the navy announced friday that 15 crew members 
of the uss vincennes the cruiser that shot down an iranian 
jetliner in the persian gulf last summer will be disciplined for 
drug abuse 
there is no connection now to the july 3 incident in the 
persian gulf to what has happened on board the vincennes said 
navy cmdr david dillon spokesman for pacific fleet surface force 
headquarters 
the vincennes meanwhile will be shifted to long beach naval 
shipyard within five weeks for modifications to correct 
deficiencies in the aegis electronic combat control system the 
san diego tribune reported friday 
aegis which would enable a ship like the vincennes to make 
computerrecommended battle decisions for entire fleets was found 
flawed in the persian gulf confrontation 
according to pentagon analysts splitsecond decisions were 
affected by the inability of radarscope interpreters to 
immediately match the planes blip with digital direction 
altitude and speed information displayed on another screen 
those problems are one reason the vincennes will undergo 
modernization an unidentified source told the tribune 
none of the sailors involved in the drug sweep were in positions 
that may have influenced the decision by capt will c rogers iii 
to fire two antiaircraft missiles at the jetliner dillon said 
all 290 aboard the plane died 
of the 15 sailors six are being processed for discharge from 
the navy while six others have been given warnings dillon said 
three are petty officers who are being investigated for 
possible courtmartial in connection with drug sales he said 
dillon noted that the 15 sailors represent 39 percent of the 
384 sailors on board that is less than the 54 percent average 
for the entire navy he said 
the announcement came as preparations were under way at the 
naval station san diego for saturdays change of command aboard the 
vincennes 
rogers will be rotated to a new assignment at the navys 
tactical training group in san diego the new vincennes commander 
is capt robert b lynch who had been stationed in washington 
dc and is assuming his fifth sea command 
rogers and his wife sharon have been under guard by the naval 
investigative service since a pipe bomb exploded under the family 
van mrs rogers was driving to her teaching job march 10 in la 
jolla she escaped injury 
the fbi is investigating the attack as possible terrorist 
retaliation for the airliners destruction

house democratic whip tony coelho plans to 
announce his resignation from congress on saturday democratic 
sources said friday throwing the partys house leadership into 
even more turmoil with the expected resignation next week of 
speaker jim wright 
wright his career in shambles as a result of ethics charges 
disappeared for a long holiday weekend after first handing out 
roses from his garden to television reporters camped outside his 
door 
hours later sources who spoke only on condition of anonymity 
said coelho the californian who was thirdranking democrat in the 
partys house leadership also plans to quit because some of his 
business dealings are under scrutiny 
popular majority leader thomas foley of washington is likely to 
be elevated to speaker without a hint of discord but coelho had 
expected to be a contender for foleys current job in what was 
expected to be a nasty battle 
but coelho told the new york times he plans to resign his 
leadership position as soon as a successor is picked and will quit 
the house on june 15 his 47th birthday 
i dont intend to put this institution through more turmoil 
and more importantly i dont intend to put my family through more 
turmoil the times quoted him as saying 
if i cant be leader and if i cant be whip its time to try 
a new and different challenge therefore june 15 which is my 47th 
birthday will be my last day in the congress coelho told the 
times 
coelhos decision will be announced saturday at the capitol 
said one source who explained he doesnt want his attention or 
abilities distracted in this fashion 
coelho has been told by his attorneys that he has no legal 
difficulties but he just thinks enough is enough the source 
said he does not want to put his party through it 
coelho was facing questions about a california bank executives 
purchase of a highyield junk bond for coelho in 1986 when coelho 
found himself unable to finance the transaction 
the bond was sold to coelho by the executive a month later at 
the initial offering price saving coelho about 4000 compared to 
the bonds market price at the time the los angeles times reported 
this week that the justice department was opening a criminal 
investigation of whether coelho received favored treatment from 
drexel burnham coelho said the story was wrong 
coelho was expected to face other contenders for the majority 
leaders spot including ed jenkins of georgia 
likely candidates for the whip position the post now held by 
coelho include democratic caucus chairman william gray of 
pennsylvania chief deputy whip david bonior of michigan and 
perhaps richard gephardt of missouri though gephardt let it be 
known he wont try for the no 2 majority leaders position against 
coelho who helped in his unsuccessful presidential campaign 
rep lee hamilton the indiana democrat who made an impression 
as chairman of the house irancontra committee might also jump 
into the majority leaders race spokeswoman sarah binder said he 
has been urged by colleagues to run but has made no decision 
coelho faced a difficult fight to move up to the no 2 spot as 
democrats were leery of perpetuating the image problems they have 
had to deal with as wright has fought ethics committee charges of 
financial impropriety 
one lawmaker a gephardt ally said there are a good many of 
us trying to persuade coelho to step aside thus freeing gephardt 
to run 
common cause the private group that joined in the complaint 
that brought the ethics commission investigation of wright said 
friday it was asking the panel to open a formal inquiry of coelho 
a source close to jenkins said the georgia democrat will be a 
candidate for the position when the speaker resigns and jenkins 
apparently will have support from the powerful chairman of the 
house ways and means committee dan rostenkowsk of illinois 
the sources aware of the sensitive nature of the situation with 
wright still in his job commented only on condition they not be 
named 
while the succession struggle swirled about him wright went on 
a weekend getaway with his wife betty to an undisclosed location 
his aides said 
wright awoke friday morning to find television crews encamped in 
his front yard he came outside cut a bouquet of roses from his 
garden and handed them to a network news producer but declined to 
answer questions 
ill have a statement to make at some time and when i do 
ill welcome you he said 
earlier this week wrights lawyers and representatives of the 
ethics panel talked over a possible arrangement under which wright 
would give up his position which makes him the nations highest 
elected democrat in exchange for the dropping of at least one of 
the major charges against him 
in particular he is said to be interested in wiping out an 
allegation that his wife betty was given a nowork job by wrights 
friend and business partner george mallick house rules prohibit 
gifts from people with a diret interest in legislation a 
description the committee says applies to mallick 
foley meanwhile told a news conference in spokane wash that 
there is no vacancy for the speakers job and i have no 
knowledge on his part of plans to resign 
foley said wright had not asked him to schedule time for wright 
to address the house to defend himself against house ethics 
committee charges he committed 69 rules violations

two sixthgraders have been charged with 
helping themselves to more than 10000 in cash during a class tour 
of a bank vault 
jay elementary school principal elton nowling said he dropped 
about 30 students off at ncnb national bank thursday morning and 
returned to pick them up about an hour later 
hours later the bank manager called to report 10100 was 
missing 
nowling said he called santa rosa county sheriffs deputy scott 
whatley a resource officer at jay high school to ask students 
about the reported theft 
whatley and another deputy questioned the students who went on 
the field trip one at a time 
nowling said the boys didnt try to hide the theft but 
apparently didnt say why they helped themselves to the cash the 
two allegedly stuffed their clothes with 100 bills 
deputies recovered all of the missing money sheriffs capt 
terry hardy said the boys were picked up by the florida department 
of health and rehabilitative services they were charged with grand 
theft and taken to the youth detention center in pensacola 
nowling said the two who had recently transferred to his 
school arent representative of its students 
our kids are good kids basically we normally dont have 
problems he said 
later nowling gathered all the sixthgraders for a lecture on 
finance 
i think the incident may have seemed kind of funny to start 
out with but when i got there it ceased being funny he said 
the principal said he had not had a chance to apologize to the 
bank manager but i dont think this will affect our ability to 
tour the bank as in years past 
nowling said the boys have been suspended from school for the 
remainder of the year bank officials refused to discuss the 
incident friday

shareholders meetings next month are the last 
big hurdle to the 18 billion merger of time inc and warner 
communications inc following action by the federal communications 
commission 
the fcc on friday granted a temporary waiver of its 
crossownership restrictions which was the final regulatory 
approval needed in the creation of the worlds largest 
entertainment and media conglomerate 
the commission had to review the transaction because a time 
subsidiary american television and communications corp 
operates cable television systems in the los angeles and austin 
texas areas which overlap with the viewership of television 
stations owned by chriscraft industries inc a company that 
controls a 155 percent block of warner stock and would hold about 
12 percent of the combined conglomerate 
the fccs waiver gave the companies 18 months to comply with 
federal crossownership rules that generally prohibit one company 
from owning multiple media outlets in one area 
there are at least four ways the companies can comply american 
television could sell the affected cable systems chriscraft could 
sell its tv subsidiary or it could reduce its stake in the 
combined timewarner to below 5 percent or timewarner could apply 
and receive a permanent waiver from the fcc 
we perceive no public interest benefit in removing cable 
service to the many communities involved in this matter until a 
buyer or buyers can be found the commission wrote in its 
opinion the alternative would be to hold up a major transaction 
of which the cable systems constitute but a very small part 
the chairmen of both companies j richard munro of time and 
steven j ross of warner said in a joint statement we are 
delighted to have successfully completed the federal review process 
necessary for our merger we are confident that the nations 
policy makers will not be disappointed in the procompetitive 
proamerican and proconsumer impact of the merger 
seven weeks ago the justice department ruled that the merger 
would not violate antitrust laws on monday the securities and 
exchange commission approved proxy materials for separate time and 
warner shareholders meetings scheduled june 23 in new york a 
majority of shareholders of record on may 1 must approve the 
merger which was announced on march 3 
the transaction also must be approved by several local cable 
franchising authorities time owns systems with about 4 million 
subscribers while warner has about 15 million cable subscribers 
the proposed conglomerate timewarner inc would surpass 
rupert murdochs australia news corp as the worlds biggest media 
and entertainment concern 
time publishes time people and sports illustrated magazines and 
owns timelife books and the bookofthemonth club warner 
operates the warner bros movie and television studios as well as 
warner recording 
american television owns cable systems or has a stake in cable 
systems serving canyon country orange san marino south pasadena 
gardena and torrance calif and austin texas a wholly owned 
chriscraft subsidiary bhc inc owns kmoltv in san antonio

frederick g fisher who as a young lawyer 
became a target of joseph r mccarthy but whose boss spirited 
defense of him helped turn the tables on the senator has died of a 
heart attack he was 68 
fisher died thursday while attending a lecture sponsored by the 
israeli bar in tel aviv he was a senior partner in the boston firm 
of hale amp dorr which he joined shortly after his graduation from 
harvard law school he recently had moved to sagamore beach mass 
from west newton mass 
fisher played an inadvertant part in the dramatic 1954

fifth amendment communists

officials military officers and prominent private citizens in the 
early 1950s of having communist affiliations

amp dorr in which fisher was then an associate 
mccarthy accused fisher of having been a member of the national 
lawyers guild long after it had been exposed as the legal arm of 
the communist party 
welch near tears responded until this moment senator i 
think i never really gauged your cruelty or your recklessness fred 
fisher is starting what looks to be a brilliant career with us i 
fear he shall always bear a scar needlessly inflicted by you 
have you no decency sir he said to mccarthy 
the exchange on national television was considered a pivotal 
point in turning public opinion against the senator who 
subsequently was censured by his colleagues 
fisher later became a partner at the firm in 1958 and organized 
its commercial law department 
he also served as president of the massachusetts bar association 
and as chairman of many committees of the american and boston bar 
associations

britain has been hit by a series of strikes in 
recent months recalling the prethatcher days of national walkouts 
that helped bring down a labor party government 
but experts say the scenario is very different from the winter 
of discontent of 197879 when public service workers paralyzed 
much of the country prime minister margaret thatchers 
conservative party ousted the socialists in may 1979 on a wave of 
antiunion sentiment 
experts predict the strikes will eventually subside after a 
current round of wage negotiations although there are concerns the 
walkouts could lead to higher wages and prices their impact will 
be limited by mrs thatchers unioncurbing laws they say 
repeated oneday walkouts by subway workers and bus drivers have 
forced millions of londoners to walk to work the british 
broadcasting corp has canceled or cut live television and radio 
programs because of brief strikes by employees for higher pay 
dockworkers are voting on whether to strike at britains 40 
ports over the governments plans to abolish a jobguarantee plan 
engineers and university and national health service workers are 
also restive 
when times were very hard in the 1980s we took a back seat 
said jim mowat an official with the transport and general workers 
union britains largest union 
we negotiated wage decreases now mrs thatcher is telling us 
that britains economy is booming so we think we should be 
partial beneficiaries of that boom 
the strikes have been spurred by high wage demands stemming from 
resurging inflation and interest rates 
changes in work practices sought by new managers to control 
costs and raise efficiency are also a factor said john kelly a 
lecturer at the london school of economics 
however gavyn davies an economist with goldman sachs 
international in london said the economic effect of the renewed 
industrial strife is much less because the economy has moved to 
be more serviceoriented more small firmoriented and more female 
labor and in each of those areas there is less incidence of union 
membership 
rod thomas an official with the employers confederation of 
british industry said our view is that it is a shortlived 
period of industrial disputes there is no widespead fear of an 
upswing in union militancy 
workers are demanding raises as high as 15 percent pointing to 
the rising inflation which largely is blamed on a creditfueled 
consumer spending boom aprils 8 percent annual inflation rate was 
more than double the 39 percent rate a year earlier 
the government has tried to curb inflation by raising interest 
rates 10 times in the past year from 75 percent to 14 percent 
but the subsequent higher mortgage rates have boosted pay requests 
employees of the soontobeprivatized electricity industry 
recently won a 92 percent pay raise higher than the inflation 
rate the settlement averted a walkout 
it has been difficult for companies to reject wage demands as 
their profits have soared they were up 12 percent in 1988 and are 
expected to be healthy this year 
in addition many employers have difficulty recruiting labor 
britains national unemployment rate has nearly halved to 65 
percent and lower birth rates of the 1970s are going to translate 
into fewer workers in the 1990s 
unions are in quite a strong bargaining position kelly said 
however mrs thatcher has curbed union power with laws banning 
sympathy strikes and mass picketing and forcing secret ballots on 
whether to strike 
union membership has declined to 88 million from a peak of 122 
million in 1979 last year 302 million work days were lost to 
strikes compared with 30 million in 1979

teachers and students returned to peaceful 
campuses friday after settlement of a nearly twoweek strike but 
the atmosphere was more social than academic some said 
people havent seen each other in two weeks and they want to 
talk to each other and welcome each other back said 10th street 
elementary school assistant principal evelyn peter 
throughout the 700squaremile district teachers at nearly 600 
schools were greeted with flowers balloons and hugs from students 
but numerous absences indicated the memorial day weekend may have 
tempted many students to stay away 
students who reported to class during the strike were subjected 
to auditorium assemblies educational films and lengthy study 
periods overseen by substitute teachers thousands of others stayed 
away from school 
i dont think we knew how much our teachers provided us with 
motivation to learn said sam perez a senior at hollywood high 
school 
everything is back to normal now said a smiling brenda 
montoya a 10th grader at belmont high school we have our 
teachers back and now we can get back to our studies 
special education teacher russell ung said the mood among the 
teachers was upbeat at belmont high it seems to be getting back 
to normal from everyone ive talked to the mood is good the 
attitude is excellent he said 
but he noticed that classes seemed thin some may be taking 
advantage of the long weekend he said 
there were 365137 students in class in the nations second 
largest school district hardly a dramatic lift from the 305650 
attending thursday the last day of the strike that began may 15 
teachers did return nearly in force with 24569 regularly 
assigned teachers out of a possible 26250 returning friday with 
1447 substitutes bringing the number to 26016 pretty close to 
full strength said school district spokeswoman eva hain 
on thursday members of united teacherslos angeles approved by 
voice vote a 600 million threeyear contract giving them a 24 
percent raise over three years and a bigger voice in the control of 
their schools 
the los angeles unified school districts sevenmember board 
approved the pact during a closed door meeting the same day with 
arguments centering on the 120 million in cuts the school board 
staff says will have to be made elsewhere to provide the teacher 
salary increases the contract 16 months in the making is 
retroactive to july 
the union represents 22000 of the districts 32000 teachers

for nearly 20 years space buffs have wondered 
who composed the words thats one small step for a man which 
neil armstrong said when he stepped on the moon 
now with the onescore anniversary coming up july 20 armstrong 
says that not only were those words his own but that he composed 
them on the spot 
armstrong commander of the apollo 11 moon mission was reunited 
with his two crew mates for a news conference friday to satisfy 
requests for interviews in connection with celebrations planned 
across the world to mark the event 
he was asked when exactly he decided on the words thats one 
small step for a man one giant leap for mankind which he said 
after climbing down the ladder on the lunar lander 
it was a statement that was natural in the sense of the 
time armstrong said i thought about it after we got there 
with that he destroyed longstanding rumors in space circles that 
some anonymous public relations genius not armstrong created 
those words for history 
armstrong along with lunar module pilot edwin buzz aldrin 
and command module pilot michael collins fielded questions from 
reporters with humor and selfdeprecation for the niche they carved 
in the annals of exploration 
here are some armstrong comments 
on the use of robots to explore space a technique favored by 
many scientists man can be amused and amazed and a robot can be 
neither 
on leaving footprints on the moon that will remain undisturbed 
for millennia i had hoped that somebody goes up there some day 
and cleans them up 
on how their lives were changed by their adventure before 
1969 press conferences were much smaller 
on whether the apollo moon program was a stunt of little value 
even if it was a bad idea im glad we did it 
all three were asked what moment of their mission they would 
choose to relive 
aldrin who just published a book on americas space program 
answered it would be the last 10 seconds before they touched down 
on the lunar surface and the first 10 seconds afterward 
armstrong said i would pick a moment when i could look out 
the window and see a full earth 
and collins said it would be the moment when he saw the lunar 
module returning from the moons surface against the background of 
the earth floating in the black of space 
in his view he said were both the earth with three billion 
people and the moon ship with only two

they cant play rock music and they 
have to use a parking lot instead of a ballfield but a 
promarijuana group has won a judges permission to hold a rally 
over the memorial day weekend 
us district judge frank freedman on friday ordered the 
massachusetts cannabis reform coalition to refrain from selling 
tshirts or playing amplified music at the rally sunday in north 
adams a small industrial city in the berkshires 
a rock concert would not be in keeping with the solemnity of 
memorial day when we acknowledge those who died representing their 
country the judge said 
he also pointed out that the constitution protects expressions 
of thought not profitmaking activities 
richard evans an attorney for the group said it was willing to 
use the parking lot rather than a ballfield as it had originally 
hoped 
its a disappointment but well have speeches acoustic music 
and distribute literature said curt mansfield one of the 
organizers after the hearing in us district court in springfield 
on wednesday the judge told both sides to find a suitable place 
for the rally mayor john barrett iii who opposes legalization 
suggested the city landfill 
this group has a right to express its feelings whether we 
agree with them or not freedman said friday noting that the 
coalitions request had been before the city recreation commission 
for four months 
mansfield said the group initially wanted to march in the citys 
memorial day parade but a vietnam veterans group opposed the idea 
they wanted no part of it he said so we came up the idea 
of having a gathering in the park 
said evans we recognize that reform of the marijuana laws is 
a very controversial subject and we were hesitant to inject it 
into the memorial day parade because of the solemnity of the 
observance

engineer edward brown was part of the team 
overseeing the startup of a massachusetts reactor that 30 years ago 
helped usher in the age of commercial nuclear power 
today he is preparing to lead the start of atomic fission at 
the seabrook nuclear power plant a symbol for the antinuclear 
movement and bellwether for utility industry officials worldwide 
who hope to promote a new safer generation of nuclear reactors 
the 6 billion seabrook reactor which was originally planned 
for commercial operation in 1979 and completed but idle for three 
years because of evacuationplanning and financial problems won a 
lowpower testing license friday 
the nuclear regulatory commission granted the license a day 
after a federal appeals court declined to delay the tests 
the testing process is expected to start this weekend leading 
to the first fission reaction in seabrooks fuel core in seven to 
10 days brown said 
brown president of new hampshire yankee which operates the 
plant recalled his days as a darkhaired young engineer 
conducting environmental monitoring at massachusetts yankee rowe 
when the reactor started its atomic tests in 1960 it was the 
nations second commercial nuclear power plant 
its a different ball game now brown said in an interview 
in his office 
in contrast to seabrooks tumultuous history the massachusetts 
plant was built in three years for 45 million it produces only 
189 megawatts of electricity 
seabrook is supposed to produce six times as much 
a lot more is at stake with this one brown said arguing 
that seabrook is vital for meeting the regions energy needs 
seabrooks opponents agree that much is at stake but for 
different reasons they say stopping the plant is crucial for the 
health and safety of tens of thousands of people who live nearby 
the lowpower license does not settle disputes over evacuation 
planning for crowded beaches and coastal communities within 10 
miles of seabrook the key issue blocking commercial operation 
seabrook officials hope to receive a commercial license in the 
fall but massachusetts gov michael dukakis and other foes have 
promised to fight it even if it means going to the us supreme 
court 
nuclear industry officials around the world also see high stakes 
involved with the seabrook plant brown said 
were aware the rest of the industry is watching us but were 
not out there fighting the industrys battles he said 
two weeks ago brown attended a conference in moscow of nuclear 
plant operators from 31 countries and he said there was 
tremendous interest in seabrooks progress 
when i came back i told the folks here that it really dawned 
on me for the first time there are people who perceive seabrook 
as the bellwether brown said but i dont my objective is to 
get it running 
when seabrooks tests start valves will be opened and water 
will be pumped through the reactor coolant system friction from 
the rapid circulation would heat the reactor from 150 degrees to 
its operating temperature of 557 degrees 
then operators would set the stage for a nuclear chain reaction 
by withdrawing neutronabsorbing control rods from the reactor fuel 
core and reducing the amount of neutronabsorbing boron in the 
coolant water eventually letting uranium atoms start the fission 
process 
brown estimated the plant would achieve initial criticality 
its first selfsustained fission reaction within seven to 10 
days

a mission from the organization of 
american states has failed to make any progress toward a solution 
of panamas political crisis an opposition leader said friday 
unfortunately there has been no progress for the good of 
panama in the talks said opposition presidential candidate 
guillermo endara after meeting with the oas delegation 
the mission made up of the foreign ministers of ecuador 
guatemala and trinidad and tobago also met friday with panamas de 
facto leader gen manuel antonio noriega 
endara and first vice presidential candidate ricardo arias 
calderon said the sticking point had been noriegas refusal to 
negotiate with the opposition 
endara said he would not take power if noriega remained as 
commander of the panamanian defense forces but noriega called 
questions about his possible retirement stupid 
earlier friday noriega told reporters that the military would 
not be drawn into negotiations and that a solution to the political 
crisis should come from talks between the opposition and 
progovernment parties 
they both claim they won noriega told reporters 
ecuadoran foreign minister diego cordovez said the oas mission 
had succeeded in giving noriega and the opposition each others 
point of view but that a solution will require an enormous 
effort from the panamanian people 
the oas delegation seeks to end the impasse created when the 
government nullified the may 7 presidential election 
the opposition led by endara won the elections over 
progovernment candidate carlos duque by a 31 margin according to 
international observers noriegas troops seized the vote tallies 
and the election was nullified three days later 
noriega said friday the key to the problem lies with the 
contending political parties the opposition has declined to talk 
to duque 
if the opposition remains intransigent the defense forces are 
not going to slip on a banana peel and be drawn into the dispute 
the two sides have to start talking 
opposition leaders say they will not negotiate with civilians 
because the defense forces which noriega commands hold the real 
power in panama 
nothing positive can come out of a negotiation between duque 
and endara because duque doesnt have a single drop of power 
endara said friday in a telephone interview with the associated 
press 
we are willing to talk to noriega about an institutional 
solution but for this it is vital that noriega retire 
when asked to say who had won noriega said thats up to the 
electoral tribunal which nullified the vote im just another 
panamanian among 2394000 
endara noted that in a resolution passed before the mission was 
sent the oas called for a transfer of power as soon as 
possible 
they didnt talk about the presidency but about power 
endara said that power that is now in military hands 
the oas mission came to noriegas offices at fort amador south 
of panama city and waited 15 minutes before the general came 
strolling down the street with a halfdozen staff officers 
munching on a mango 
panamanian mango he remarked taking a bite you should 
try it 
noriegas offices back onto a us naval station and are 
catercorner from the us southern commands logistics and 
personnel offices 
noriega who also spent 2 hours with the delegation wednesday 
said he repeated that panamas problems were caused by the 
interfering hands of the united states 
since president bush sent 1900 more troops to augment security 
at panama canal installations he said panamanian troops have 
been instructed not to get trapped into a provocation we also ask 
panamanian citizens not to do anything provocative 
noriega has been indicted on drug trafficking charges in the 
united states which he describes as part of a us plot to renege 
on treaties that cede the canal to panama at the end of 1999 
he said the oas had made some proposals but he would not reveal 
them 
there are 100000 formulas he said when asked if he would 
step down he replied dont ask stupid questions 
at wednesdays meeting the oas was told noriegas retirement 
was a matter for the defense forces to consider not the opposition 
or the oas 
on friday noriega called the international press 
disinformers and agents of imperialism 
you are the ones who have made me out to be a dictator he 
said to an unruly crowd of reporters photographers and television 
cameramen you say its a dictatorship but right here we have 
anarchy

although deng xiaoping has been chinas supreme 
ruler for more than a decade his differing approaches to economic 
and political change have not met with universal approval 
dengs marketoriented economic reforms have achieved remarkable 
results since 1978 and received a resounding vote of confidence at 
the 13th communist party congress in 1987 under his policies 
millions of chinese have seen their living standards increase 
dramatically 
zhao ziyang who was named communist party chief at the 
congress was considered dengs top protege and heir apparent 
because of his enthusiastic support for economic liberalism and 
opening up to the outside world 
but zhaos sympathy with student demands for free government and 
democratic reform apparently proved unacceptable to deng an 
84yearold revolutionary with little tolerance for dissent 
zhaos moderate attitude toward the students resulted in his 
loss of power this week to conservative premier li peng 
li an engineer trained in the soviet union opposed the rapid 
pace of economic decentralization that was the result of dengs 
policies he instead prefered the status quo 
but li apparently was acting on dengs behalf may 20 when he 
decreed martial law for beijing where students and more than 1 
million supporters have been demonstrating for political 
liberalization 
at least temporarily supporters of dengs conservative views on 
political change have won out over supporters of his farreaching 
economic reforms 
among other leaders 
president yang shangkun the former general has close ties to 
deng and has been viewed as a supporter of economic reform yang 
apparently shares dengs aversion to political pluralism however 
and announced may 19 that troops were being sent to beijing to 
restore order 
wan li the head of the national peoples congress is a firm 
supporter of the marketoriented economic reform but may not 
approve dengs crackdown during a recent trip to the united 
states he praised the students as leading a patriotic movement and 
urged a peaceful resolution to the uprising 
chen yun the chairman of the communist party central advisory 
commission long has been viewed as a staunch conservative opposed 
to dengs economic reform but he made clear in a speech friday he 
supports the hardline stance against the prodemocracy movement 
joining zhao and li on the partys policymaking politburo 
standing committee are hu qili yao yilin and qiao shi their 
support of dengs economic and political policies is difficult to 
gauge particularly because all of their meetings are in private

the passions of the 16th century burning fiercely 
in the highlands of scotland have driven the lord high chancellor 
from his church 
lord mackay of clashfern britains chief legal officer said 
friday that he would leave the free presbyterian church of scotland 
rather than promise not to attend roman catholic funeral mass as 
he had done twice in honor of fellow peers 
i have no intention of giving any such undertaking as that for 
which the synod has asked mackay said in a statement issued from 
his office in london 
like a 16th century chancellor sir thomas more mackay was 
forced to choose between private conscience and public duty in a 
land where the church as well as the state derives its authority 
from the crown 
more a catholic was beheaded in 1535 after refusing to 
recognize henry viiis supremacy over the newly formed church of 
england and the rhetoric of the reformation echoed in the church 
at inverness where the wee frees held their annual synod this 
week 
i find it very difficult to believe that the lord chancellor 
of a protestant country with a protestant queen on a protestant 
throne has any obligation by reason of state to go to a popish 
mass said the rev donald maclean clerk of the southern 
presbytery 
lord st john of fawsley a prominent roman catholic and former 
cabinet officer put the issue this way what is the lord 
chancellor of great britain who is the head of the judiciary 
doing belonging to such an intolerant organization 
the struggle for the lord chancellors soul was waged amid 
scenes of stout women weeping solemn men stomping their feet in 
protest and the churchs moderator the rev aaron ndebele of 
bulawayo zimbabwe banging his fist on the table for order 
mackay an elder of his church in edinburgh had been suspended 
last year following a complaint about his attendance at the funeral 
of lord russell of killowan at westminster cathedral in london he 
had attended another catholic funeral in 1986 
speaking to the lord chancellors opponents the rev john ross 
of tain warned the synod that it will make the name of this 
church stink in the highland scotland the united kingdom and 
wherever it is known 
may god have mercy upon us as a church said the rev robert 
sinclair of wick at 90 the oldest clergyman in the church lord 
mackay is a man whose conscience is clear before god 
the rev neil ross of laide convenor of the churchs committee 
on religion and morals noted that the synod had easily mustered a 
unanimous vote some years ago to rebuke prince charles for 
attending a mass yet when one of our own goes to mass there is a 
big hullabaloo when he is disciplined for it ross said 
the vote upholding mackays suspension by 3327 signaled a new 
schism in a 6000member denomination born in protest in 1893 
the rev calum macinnes of toronto who had once been threatened 
with discipline for refusing to wear a clerical collar filed a 
formal protest and walked out besides the mackay case macinnes 
complained of a 1987 decision to refuse membership to a man whose 
golf club was open on sundays and another last year to suspend a 
minister who had invited a catholic priest to pray at an education 
committee meeting 
appointed lord chancellor by prime minister margaret thatcher in 
1987 the 61yearold mackay presides over the house of lords the 
unelected upper house of parliament 
his tenure has been controversial because of his proposals for 
sweeping reform of the ancient privileges and powers of the english 
bar proposals which some lawyers have resented as coming from an 
outsider 
mackay with his twinkling eyes and soft smile appears an 
unlikely object of controversy 
the son of a railway porter he attended george heriots school 
for the improvement of the children of poor but deserving 
folk in edinburgh and then took a degree in mathematics and 
natural philosophy in edinburgh 
after lecturing for a time at trinity college cambridge he 
turned to law in scotland and eventually became lord advocate the 
top law officer in scotland 
in an interview with author john mortimer published in the 
daily telegraph in february mackay had defended his church from 
accusations of intolerance 
it depends what you mean by intolerance he said if you 
believe something strongly if that is your faith the testimony 
you have received you seek change in others by way of persuasion

the trial of a former cia agent in the 
irancontra arms and money affair is being delayed for two weeks 
over allegations the prosecution is using the defendants testimony 
to a congressional panel 
us district judge claude hilton on friday moved the starting 
date to july 24 after excia agent joseph fernandez said the 
prosecutions case has been tainted by his immunized congressional 
testimony 
in a related case us district judge gerhard a gesell on 
friday rejected a motion by former national security council aide 
oliver north for a posttrial hearing north convicted may 4 of 
three felonies stemming from the irancontra affair had contended 
that the evidence against him was prejudiced by his testimony 
before congress during televised hearings in 1987 
gesell said norths lawyers raised no new issues to warrant 
another hearing or dismissal of the charges the judge concluded in 
a june 16 1988 ruling that norths congressional testimony was 
not submitted to the grand jury in any form 
in the fernandez case hilton denied a motion to dismiss the 
case but the judge said he will look further into what steps the 
prosecution took to insulate itself from fernandez testimony 
fernandez the cias former station chief in costa rica is 
accused of obstructing and lying to the cia inspector generals 
office and the presidential tower commission 
he allegedly told investigators that a secret airstrip in costa 
rica built as part of norths secret resupply network for the 
nicaraguan contra rebels was an initiative of the costa rican 
government 
fernandez allegedly told the tower panel he did not know for a 
fact that north was assisting the resupply effort which was 
prohibited by congress 
under immunity from prosecution fernandez later told 
congressional investigators the airstrip was tied into the resupply 
effort and that north was part of it 
fernandez lawyer thomas wilson said two cia employees cole 
black and louis dupart were familiar with fernandez immunized 
testimony yet were questioned extensively by prosecutors 
wilson said black maintained he was unable to ferret out 
what he learned from fernandez immunized testimony and what he 
learned from nonimmunized testimony prosecutor robert longstreth 
disputed wilsons contention saying prosecutors questions to 
black were framed narrowly and that none of his answers was based 
on fernandez immunized testimony 
a supreme court ruling bars prosecutors from making any use of 
someones immunized testimony in prosecuting the person the office 
of independent counsel lawrence walsh which is prosecuting 
fernandez has gone to extreme lengths to wall itself off from such 
testimony longstreth said 
walshs office will supply the court with information on the 
steps it has taken to remain free from the taint of immunized 
testimony the judge said at the end of a hearing 
the trial is expected to last about three weeks prosecutor 
laurence shtasel said the government will call 15 to 18 witnesses 
and take five to seven days to present its case wilson said the 
defense will take a similar amount of time

house democratic whip tony coelho under 
scrutiny for his personal business dealings said he intends to 
resign from congress next month majority leader tom foley 
confirmed friday night 
coelhos decision was a stunning followup to speaker jim 
wrights reported decision to resign under an ethical cloud 
foley of washington told the associated press he had spoken to 
coelho and that hes decided to give up his whip post and go into 
the private sector which he has considered doing at some time 
before 
the new york times reported in its saturday editions that coelho 
said in an interview he would give up his leadership post as soon 
as a replacement is picked and would resign his california house 
seat on june 15 his 47th birthday 
coelho declined comment through a spokesman friday night the 
congressman did not return messages left at his home 
foley said in the current environment realistically there 
might be a long period of inquiry which he feels would be damaging 
to the party or to the house for which he has deep affection 
he just said he couldnt be an effective majority leader with 
these charges out there a top democratic leadership source told 
the associated press the source who insisted on anonymity said 
coelho felt he could not remain as an effective whip and thus saw 
no reason to remain in congress 
coelho the houses no 3 democrat told the times he was taking 
the actions to avoid a protracted investigation of his personal 
finances 
i want to give my party a chance to move on the times 
quoted him as saying 
i dont intend to put my party through more turmoil coelho 
told the times i dont intend to put this institution through 
more turmoil and more importantly i dont intend to put my family 
through more turmoil 
if i cant be leader and if i cant be whip its time to try 
a new and different challenge therefore june 15 which is my 47th 
birthday will be my last day in the congress the paper quoted 
him as saying 
earlier this month coelho acknowledged that a california 
savings and loan executive set him up in a junk bond investment 
that netted him a 6882 profit without him having to put up any of 
his own money 
however coelho had said that except for some reporting errors 
the 1986 deal was totally above board and he did nothing wrong 
a source close to coelho said friday night that he basically 
said hes devoted 25 years to public life he has worked for social 
change and he has spent too much time trying to build the party 
up he doesnt want his attention or abilities distracted in this 
fashion 
he has been told by his attorneys that he has no legal 
difficulties the source said but he just thinks enough is 
enough he does not want to put his party through it the source 
said the resignation is expected to be announced in a statement to 
be released saturday 
coelho has been a rising star in the democratic firmament in the 
house and his aides were busily spreading the word earlier in the 
day that he intended to try and move up to majority leader if 
wright resigns as expected next week and majority leader tom 
foley becomes speaker 
at the same time some democrats expressed concern privately 
over the possible political damage to the party if coelho took on a 
more prominent role at a time when his business dealings were 
coming under close scrutiny on the heels of wrights apparently 
unsuccessful campaign to fend off multiple ethics allegations 
foley said i think this is a loss for the house of 
representatives hes had a brilliant record as chairman of the 
campaign committee and as the party whip and i think hell be 
deeply missed by his colleagues and by the constituents he served 
so well 
coelhos reported decision could result in a political 
freeforall when house democrats meet to select new leaders foley 
is widely expected to be the next speaker assuming that wright 
resigns next week as expected and the jockeying already had begun 
to fill the other rungs on the leadership ladder 
coelhos reported decision would bring an end to a successful 
career in the house 
the californian was widely respected and liked by other 
democrats for his work as chairman of the partys campaign 
committee which raised funds and provided campaign services for 
the partys candidates 
a report released by coelho on may 14 showed that thomas 
spiegel chief executive officer of the columbia savings and loan 
assn of beverly hills calif purchased 100000 in bonds for 
coelho and held them until coelho could raise money to pay for them 
spiegel also provided half of the money to finance the bonds 
the bond was sold to coelho by the executive a month later at 
the initial offering price saving coelho about 4000 compared to 
the bonds market price at the time the los angeles times reported 
this week that the justice department was opening a criminal 
investigation of whether coelho received favored treatment but 
coelho said the story was wrong 
however coelho acknowledged that he regretted the deal he put 
his personal funds into a blind trust last year and he said he 
wished he had done it earlier 
according to coelhos report he first considered investing his 
1986 campaign funds in 12 percent bonds based on a suggestion by 
spiegel coelho ruled out that type of investment for his campaign 
but spiegel suggested the congressman himself could make an 
investment in the bonds 
in the report earlier this month coelhos lawyer robert f 
bauer concluded that spiegels role in the transaction could not 
be considered a gift which would violate house rules because 
coelho paid him interest

the voracious japanese appetite for sea 
urchins has created a booming market for the spiny creatures and 
university of maine researchers want to develop an even better 
version 
presently if you take 100 you might get 50 or 60 in a load 
that are grade a color said ben baxter extension marine program 
coordinator were trying to get it up to 80 or better in the 
japanese market which is very fussy if you can produce a reliable 
product that is worth more 
sea urchin gourmets consume the eggs or roe researchers hope 
they will get greater quantities of roe and give it the colors 
considered most desirable by japanese diners if they keep urchins 
in pens and feed them kelp and fish byproducts baxter said 
the new improved urchins could double or triple a sellers 
income 
a state department of marine resources official doesnt believe 
the project will make anybody rich because ranching the urchins 
will probably not be economically feasible 
thats one of their pipe dreams said phil averill director 
of the maine fisheries technology service the price isnt there 
they arent going to get any more for that urchin than the wild 
harvester is 
averill said the industry has been around for 25 or 30 years in 
maine but it really took off in the last three years because of 
the yens high value in relation to the dollar 
we are estimating that 10 million pounds were shipped last 
season he said thats up from like 6 million a year before 
that and there was like 1 million the year before that you can 
estimate 35 cents a pound on 10 million pounds thats 35 
million 
when the value of the yen drops in relation to the dollar the 
japanese are likely to start shopping elsewhere for their urchins 
averill said maines urchins are not much different from other 
urchins and people harvesting them here dont always know how to 
pick the best ones he said 
theres been a tremendous amount of urchins rejected for 
quality reasons averill said maine has a soso reputation 
baxter maintains the research could lead to superior sea urchins 
of a bright yellow color favored by many japanese 
they can range from a muddy brown to a rainslicker yellow 
with several cream colors at the other end of the spectrum 
baxter said if they have a bright yellow color it gives them a 
sweetish flavor it can almost be a honey flavor 
averill said the state and the university have developed a color 
chart that the japanese can use in ordering urchins that will be 
pleasing to the eye the roe color preferred by the diners varies 
from city to city in japan and the chart gave maine urchin sellers 
a better idea of what to send 
after youve been looking at sea urchins all day they start 
to look alike averill said 
baxter tries to discourage the notion that someone can easily 
start making money in the sea urchin business pointing out that 
someone needs the proper equipment and needs to know how to harvest 
the creatures 
neither the roe improvement nor the wild harvesting are 
goldrush industries baxter said theyre not getrichquick 
schemes its damn hard work and a very fussy market

citing concerns of residents fearful of crime 
and addicts in their neighborhoods former first lady nancy reagan 
just said no to plans for a drug rehabilitation center that would 
bear her name 
mrs reagan cited local concerns for her decision to abandon the 
10 million nancy reagan center for drug rehabilitation a 
spokesman said friday 
there is a god im on the verge of tears said lew snow 
vice president of the lake view terrace homeowners association the 
group opposing the center i think it shows you can beat city 
hall 
despite all the pressures that people with money and power can 
put on a mixed community of all races and incomes they can still 
pull together to defend themselves and win 
residents of the rustic lake view terrace neighborhood 20 miles 
northwest of downtown had objected to the drug treatment center 
claiming it could bring crime to the neighborhood and traffic jams 
when mrs reagan visited it 
phoenix house which operates 10 drug treatment centers 
nationwide said mrs reagans decision to withdraw ended its 
efforts to take over the closed lake view terrace medical center 
but indicated another san fernando valley location would be sought 
to bear mrs reagans name 
the former first lady has been deeply impressed by many 
treatment programs especially phoenix house which enjoys a 
welldeserved reputation for excellence reagan family spokesman 
mark weinberg said but mrs reagan respects the concerns of 
those in the lake view terrace neighborhood she regrets that this 
situation has upset members of the community 
mrs reagan has continued her just say no antidrug crusade 
since moving back to california earlier this year 
phoenix house understands mrs reagans desire to change the 
proposed site of the nancy reagan center said spokeswoman billie 
greer accordingly we will terminate our agreement to purchase 
the former lake view medical center in lake view terrace 
greer said the organization remained committed to meeting the 
treatment needs of young drug abusers in the san fernando valley 
another location in the area would be sought she said 
snow said he learned of mrs reagans decision to withdraw 
during a meeting with nancy reagan foundation executive director 
john gustafson reagan chief of staff fred ryan and howard 
raphael the lobbyist hired by the lake view terrace homeowners 
association 
we were dumbfounded snow said of the 500 things on my 
list of things to come up in the meeting that was not one of 
them 
on march 8 the proposed drug center had won a conditional use 
permit from the board of zoning appeals which placed strict 
security requirements on the site and a twoyear limit to the 
operating permit 
associate zoning administrator darryl fisher said then that 
phoenix house would have to erect a sevenfoot wroughtiron fence 
around the center maintain a 24hour guard at the front gate and 
place video surveillance cameras inside the center 
phoenix house was to have 210 beds a residential high school 
and treatment center for as many as 150 teenagers and 60 young 
adults 
snow said a planned june 4 demonstration in front of the 
reagans belair home had been canceled 
well probably have some kind of neighborhood rally instead 
he said

the district of columbia court of appeals is 
trying to decide whether washingtons ban on capital punishment can 
be used to block the extradition of a juvenile facing a possible 
death sentence in alabama 
gerald fisher an attorney for the 17yearold boy identified 
only by the initials om urged a threejudge panel of the court 
friday to overturn a lower court ruling that alabamas extradition 
bid must be honored 
fisher said the district governments death penalty prohibition 
must override its obligation under the interstate compact on 
juveniles the agreement which requires states to honor each 
others extradition requests for juveniles 
but edward schwab assistant corporation counsel for the 
district government said the interstate compact does not give the 
district the discretion to impose its antideath penalty policy on 
alabama or any other state 
the threejudge panel court did not indicate when it would rule 
although it agreed in march to handle the case on an expedited 
basis 
om was arrested by district police last december on juvenile 
charges of arson and murder stemming from a may 1988 firebombing in 
gadsden ala which killed 14monthold tamel jackson his uncle 
yul devoe guice 31 also has been charged with arson and murder in 
the case 
oms lawyers contend the youth who is black will not be 
treated fairly the allwhite judicial system in gadsden 
district city councilwoman wilhelmina rolark chairman of the 
councils judiciary committee has introduced emergency legislation 
to prohibit the district from extraditing any juvenile facing a 
potential death sentence unless the state involved certifies that 
it will not seek the death penalty a hearing on her bill is set 
for tuesday 
during fridays hearing james klein another attorney for om 
argued that the interstate compact is not valid in the district 
because its ratification papers never were published in city 
regulations as required by a 1984 district law 
one judge indicated that kleins argument might provide 
sufficient grounds to overturn the order that om be returned to 
alabama 
the supreme court is expected to rule in july whether imposing 
the death sentence on murderers who commit their crimes before age 
18 violates the constitutions ban on cruel and unusual 
punishment

the federal communications commission rejected 
a challenge to one of the largest nonmilitary government contracts 
awards ever made a decision that could mean up to 15 billion in 
business for atampt 
in a ruling friday the fccs common carrier bureau said martin 
marietta corp and mci communications corp failed to prove their 
claim that american telephone amp telegraph co violated regulatory 
guidelines by offering a bid below its actual costs 
we conclude that no compelling argument has been presented 
that the tariff proposal is patently unlawful so as to require 
rejection and that no question has been presented that warrants 
investigation at this time said brock the fccs top telephone 
official 
this is very good news for atampt company spokesman herb 
linnen said we have said all along that the protest was without 
merit another example of atampts longdistance competitors using 
the regulatory arena to win something they have lost in the 
competitive marketplace 
mci spokeswoman kathleen keegan said company officials were 
reviewing the order to determine their options 
were disappointed that the fcc apparently accepted atampts 
faulty legal justification regarding the establishment of 
preferential rates for the government ms keegan said 
martin marietta spokesman tom hobson said company attorneys 
would review the decision next week and decide whether to appeal to 
the full commission 
the general services administration in december awarded 60 
percent of the contract to atampt and the remaining 40 percent to us 
sprint communications co the contract is for telephone and other 
hightech communications equipment and could be worth up to 25 
billion with a 15 billion cap on the amount that could go to atampt 
martin marietta and mci challenged the gsa decision alleging in 
their petition to the fcc that atampt offered the government 
unreasonably preferential and discriminatory rates that were 
below what it would cost atampt to provide the services 
in its response atampt maintained its rates would cover costs and 
asserted that even if the commission found otherwise there was 
legal precedent for offering the government preferential rates 
the system atampt and us sprint are to provide to the government 
known as fts2000 is a customdesigned communications network 
using digital and fiber optic technology to link the federal 
governments expansive telecommunications system

the agency announced however that it would fund a detailed

willing to certify individual pilots over 60 if a way can be found 
to determine their capacities 
what is needed and what the petitioners have failed to show

supplemental housing allowance and more than 800000 people in the 
military services will see a small increase in that part of their 
paycheck 
the change in the variable housing allowance set to begin june 
1 will be the second increase this year 
the pentagon declined to estimate the average increase on a 
percentage basis saying all the geographic factors hadnt been 
computed but figures released by the defense department suggest 
the increase will exceed this years first hike of 34 percent and 
will range from an average 480 a month extra for a private to 
1301 a month extra for a colonel 
military officials boosted the allowance in january 
deliberately holding down the size of that hike to make sure the 
pentagon didnt exceed a congressional limit of 122 billion for

even after tests on air food and water 
and blood samples from the victims authorities have yet to find a 
cause for 62 office workers becoming so ill that they had to be 
treated at hospitals 
we may never find out said jack brown acting director of 
the city and county health departments environmental health 
division weve done everything possible in the analytical 
viewpoint we went from roof to basement and we didnt find 
anything 
brown and others investigating the phenomenon are considering 
such causes as lingering airborne pesticides and sick building 
syndrome at the pioneer teletechnologies office where the employees 
took sick thursday night 
sick building syndrome is an illness associated with new or 
renovated buildings that have a lot of synthetic materials and poor 
ventilation the telemarketing office was renovated six months ago 
but every test that brown and other health and emergency service 
workers performed provided no insight about the cause 
weve tested all of that with very sophisticated equipment and 
weve found nothing brown said friday 
about 730 pm a pregnant worker became ill at the 
telemarketing office in the lower level of a shopping center and a 
paramedic was called shortly after that a second pregnant woman 
became ill and another ambulance was summoned 
about 945 pm the paramedics were called a third time this 
time it was for dozens of people complaining of headaches 
dizziness and nausea 
three paramedics and a two firefighters also became ill 
by 10 pm ambulances were taking people to four hospitals and 
medical centers 
but it didnt end there workers who went home had delayed 
reactions several were picked up at their homes by paramedics and 
taken to the hospital 
business was normal at the shopping center friday but the 
telemarketing company was closed and brown said it was unknown 
when it would reopen 
hospital spokesmen who declined to give out specific information 
said that only a few people remained hospitalized for further 
observation the others were treated and released

rain has ended a threemonth 
drought but it came too late to save much of the rice that most of 
this impoverished nations 110 million people rely upon farmers 
and officials said 
last weeks rain should have come at least a month ago now 
there is water but the damage is already done said abdul jalil 
a farmer who has to feed 24 people in his family 
agriculture officials said the rain can save only 40 percent of 
the rice crop near this village about 130 miles northwest of dhaka 
in some areas the loss is estimated at 80 percent the officials 
said on condition of anonymity 
jalil planted rice on the two acres he owns and was planning to 
sell the expected harvest of 22800 pounds 
but this year i will have to buy rice from the market to feed 
my family he said sitting at the edge of his withered rice 
paddies 
jalil 40 said he was still trying to repay a bank loan taken 
to offset losses during last summers floods 
the deluge inundated fourfifths of bangladesh killing at least 
1400 people and destroying 25 million tons of rice and wheat 
bangladesh one of the poorest countries in the world with 
annual per capita income of 160 alternates between flood and 
drought these and other natural disasters such as tornadoes and 
cyclones have crippled government efforts to improve the economy 
almost 80 percent of the population depends on agriculture in 
good years the country produces about 17 million of the 185 
million tons of grain needed to feed itself the rest is imported 
economists fear this years drought will prompt a food shortage 
though the government claims it has adequate food stock we 
are apprehensive the effect of drought on the economy is going to 
be significant said khwaja shamsul huq head of he association 
of development agencies in bangladesh 
the group is a coalition of more than 100 local and foreign 
nongovernment organizations 
the government says it has a food grain reserve of 800000 tons 
and plans to import 2 million tons more 
agriculture ministry officials speaking on condition of 
anonymity said last years flood and the current drought may push 
the deficit to 3 million tons 
the officials said 80 percent of the shallow wells in the area 
had run dry deep wells reaching nearly 500 feet underground 
still functioned but these accounted for only 10 percent of the 
total wells 
sheikh surat ali another taraganj farmer said his village had 
only one pump to operate wells that irrigate more than 40 acres 
but that also did not work for most of april 
today i got water but it will be 15 days before my next 
turn ali said wiping his brow with his tattered sarong he said 
50 farmers share the pump 
officials and economists say relying on deep wells also lowers 
the water table 
a national disaster planning council has discussed building 
canals for more water it also wants to improve techniques to 
evacuate people during floods but the plan has a 7 billion price 
tag and the government is seeking foreign donations to implement it 
we are tied in a vicious circle flooding this year drought 
next year it seems we have no escape from natural disasters a

the government and opposition 
appeared no closer to resolving the presidential election crisis 
after a visit by representatives of the organization of american 
states 
the opposition said friday that gen manuel antonio noriega 
panamas de facto ruler must be a party to any negotiations 
noriega however insisted the opposition must negotiate with 
progovernment parties 
the oas mission scheduled to leave today had hoped to help 
resolve an impasse that arose when the government nullified the may 
7 presidential elections international observers said the 
opposition won by a 31 margin 
at this time what we hoped for has not been achieved an 
agreement among panamanians to resolve the crisis that bedevils 
panama opposition candidate guillermo endara said friday after 
meeting with the oas delegation 
a member of the oas delegation foreign minister diego cordovez 
of ecuador said the opposition and government understand each 
other better but it will require an enormous effort from the 
panamanian people because they have to develop the formulas to 
solve the problem 
the other members of the mission were the foreign ministers of 
guatemala and trinidad and tobago and oas secretary general joao 
baena soares of brazil the delegation must file a report the day 
before the oas foreign ministers meet on june 6 to consider the 
organizations next step 
endara said he would not accept the presidency on sept 1 even 
if noriega allowed it but remained commander of the panamanian 
defense forces 
i would just be a puppet endara said 
the opposition has said repeatedly that noriega and the defense 
forces hold real power in panama and therefore must be a part of 
any talks 
noriega at a news conference after his own meeting with the oas 
delegation said the key to the problem lies with the contending 
political parties if the opposition remains intransigent the 
defense forces are not going to slip on a banana peel and be 
drawn into the dispute 
the two sides have to start talking he said they both 
claim they won 
he said questions about the possibility of his own resignation 
were stupid 
noriega who was indicted in february 1988 on drug charges in 
the united states said he told the oas that panamas problems were 
caused by interfering hands 
he cited the drug charges which he denies and economic 
sanctions as proof that the united states was plotting to keep the 
panama canal despite treaties that call for the canal to be turned 
over at the end of 1999

katarina is a pole by birth who adopted sweden 
as her home but at an allamerican hot dog and apple pie memorial 
day event she conceded she feels most at home here where she can be 
free free free 
katarina and about 80 other foreigners were treated to a slice 
of americana on the eve of a threeday holiday weekend in which 
americans remember their war servicemen 
the friday night event was anything but somber however 
in fact it could easily have been called corny except for the 
fact that these foreigners beamed with patriotic pride as they 
belted out yankee doodle when johnny comes marching home 
and other familiar american tunes 
the memorial day festival complete with hot dogs and beans 
coleslaw real lemonade and apple pie took place in the concrete 
jungle of manhattan the group enthusiastically swayed and members 
clapped their hands as the pep boys band gave a sampling of 
bluegrass 
stockholm where katarina lived for 20 years is clean 
beautiful safe and boring she said in new york you can

coin experts say some 1989 quarters could be 
worth hundreds of dollars because the us mint unwittingly struck 
an unknown number of them with no mint mark 
readers of the numismatic news a weekly coin collectors 
publication based in iola wis sent in two 1989 quarters missing 
the mint mark the new york times reported today 
a spokesman for stacks a new york coin dealer said the 1989 
quarter could be worth 250 to 1000 based on prices of other 
coins with similar errors 
all of the 6059 million 1989 quarters already minted should 
bear a mark just to the right of the george washingtons head that 
tells where the coin was minted a p indicates the mint at 
philadelphia and a d the denver mint quarters minted in 
philadelphia before 1980 do not have a mint mark 
the first quarter sent to numismatic news also had the second 9 
in 1989 partly erased 
eugene h essner the deputy director of the us mint analyzed 
the first quarter and confirmed that it was genuine if it had been 
tampered with in an effort to remove the mark a microscopic 
inspection would show signs of metal deformation he said 
the last such error with a mint mark came on some 1982 dimes 
which are now worth about 140 each

house majority leader tom foley the 
likely successor to embattled speaker jim wrights post said the 
looming departure of the no 3 house democrat will be a loss for 
the house of representatives 
house majority whip tony coelho has had a brilliant record as 
chairman of the campaign committee and as the party whip and i 
think hell be deeply missed by his colleagues and by the 
constituents he served so well foley said of the california 
democrat 
coelho told colleagues late friday that he intends to resign 
from congress next month rather than endure a protracted ethics 
investigation coelho has come under criticism for his personal 
business dealings particularly the handling of a 100000 
investment in junk bonds 
coelhos decision added a new element of uncertainty to the 
future makeup of the house leadership wright embroiled in an 
ethics controversy of his own is widely expected to give up his 
post next week and foley is the favorite to replace him coelho 
had been expected to be a candidate to replace foley as majority 
leader 
foley a 13term congressman declined friday to answer 
questions or speculate on whether he would succeed wright should 
the texan resign the speakership 
foley said telephone calls and letters from constituents are 
overwhelmingly about other things such as health care gun 
control and issues other than the ethics controversy 
foley repeated that he knew of no plan for wright to step down 
nor any deal in the works that would allow him to do so

prime minister noboru takeshita who says he will 
resign to take responsibility for an influencepeddling scandal 
has decided to back foreign minister sousuke uno as his successor 
news reports said today 
nearly all major newspapers carried frontpage reports of 
takeshita choosing to support uno although most said the situation 
remained fluid 
unos appointment would fill a leadership vacuum that has 
plagued the governing liberal democratic party since takeshita 
announced last month that he would resign many party members 
previously mentioned as potential successors were believed tainted 
by the scandal 
takeshita was believed to have discussed the succession problem 
today with party secretary general shintaro abe at a tokyo 
hospital where abe is recovering from surgery 
takeshita told reporters a choice would not be made until late 
next week following discussions with other party elders kyodo news 
service and other news reports said 
party leaders said uno emerged as the top contender after talks 
on friday between takeshita and masayoshi ito chairman of the 
liberal democrats policymaking executive council according to 
the asahi yomiuri and mainichi newspapers 
uno 66 a 10term member of the powerful lower house of 
parliament and foreign minister since 1987 also has held the 
international trade and industry portfolio and served as party 
deputy secretary general 
we havent received any word from tokyo an official at 
unos office in moriyama in western japan said on condition of 
anonymity 
a spokesman for takeshita refused to comment 
a foreign ministry official said uno was to leave sunday for 
paris to attend a meeting of the organization for economic 
cooperation and development he is to return june 4 
party leaders reportedly favor uno because he has experience in 
foreign affairs and apparently is untainted by the recruit bribery 
scandal which already has led to more than a dozen arrests 
uno faces some opposition however because he is a leading 
member of the liberal democratic faction headed by takeshitas 
predecessor yasuhiro nakasone who testified before parliament 
this week about his links to the scandal 
the recruit co the publishing and information services 
conglomerate at the center of the scandal is accused of trying to 
influence government policy by selling underpriced unlisted shares 
in a real estate subsidiary and by doling out millions of dollars 
in political contributions 
the scandal has led to the downfall of three cabinet ministers 
and the arrest of a former chief cabinet secretary 
many governing party members have called it the worst crisis 
since the party was founded 34 years ago 
in the meeting with ito on friday takeshita agreed to stay on 
as prime minister until a successor is found although on april 25 
he vowed to leave when the years budget cleared parliament the 
budget is due to become law on sunday 
the head of the governing party routinely serves as prime 
minister because of the partys large majority in both houses of 
parliament 
itos refusal may 13 to take the top job created a leadership 
vacuum in a governing party desperately in need of a leader with a 
clean enough reputation to steer the party out of scandal

officials investigating a pipeline 
explosion that killed at least two people are focusing on dents 
that were not discovered in a check of the line made after a train 
derailment two weeks earlier 
meanwhile many residents evacuated from the neighborhood on 
thursday were expected to be allowed to return home today few 
among the estimated 96 displaced families voiced much willingness 
to do so 
they told us the gas line was no danger but you can see for 
yourself that this place looks like a bomb exploded said george 
liti 54 whose 9yearold son suffered burns in the fire none 
of us can ever forget 
the pipeline fire destroyed 10 houses across the street from the 
vacant lots left after the freight train derailed two weeks ago 
that accident killed four people and destroyed six houses 
heavy pieces of debris from the may 12 freight train wreck were 
found embedded around the 14inch diameter line the closest about 
15 inches away federal investigators announced friday 
federal investigators could not say if the metal fragments found 
near the line had caused the rupture said jim kolstad acting 
chairman of the national transportation safety board 
surface dents on the steel pipeline range up to about 30 inches 
long and 4 inches wide kolstad said the section bearing the 
30inch by 4inch rupture was being removed for laboratory tests in 
washington 
a section of the damaged line that was excavated revealed a 
blownout hole with a dent directly across the gash 
david andries operations manager of calnev pipe line co owner 
of the line said the section of pipe where the rupture occurred 
wasnt excavated in spot checks of the line for damage caused by 
the wreck 
instead holes were dug every 50 feet along the 2000foot 
stretch of track involved in the derailment to check for damage he 
said two larger areas were excavated including one spot where a 
locomotive dug into the ground 
the fire that raged all day thursday as unleaded gasoline gushed 
from the pipe was so intense that it has been difficult to 
identify or even count the dead authorities said 
the san bernardino county coroners office has identified only 
one of the victims so far darie lee brown 54

the government deployed 7000 riot 
police in central seoul today to block a protest by dissidents 
calling for the fall of president roh taewoo troopers arrested 
more than 500 people 
hundreds of troopers in green combat fatigues with shields 
blocked off the park where the rally was to be held others guarded 
main streets subway stations and government buildings to prevent 
protests 
several hundred people tried to stage protests or march downtown 
after being blocked from assembling at the rally site bands of 
radical students who tried to march in the center of the city were 
dragged away by police after they laid down in the middle of the 
road 
troopers stopped and questioned people searched bags and took 
away suspects for further questioning police officials said more 
than 500 people were arrested 
it was the second saturday in a row that the government blocked 
a protest in seoul with a massive show of police strength few 
people responded to widespread appeals by dissidents to take part 
in the protests 
dissidents and radical students have little public support 
because of their violent tactics and extremist views opposition to 
the dissidents has increased since seven riot troopers were killed 
by radical students earlier this month 
the united national democratic movement the main dissident 
alliance which called for protests in seoul and 10 other cities 
had predicted up to 100000 people would demonstrate nationwide 
the only other reported protest involved about 2000 people in the 
southern city of kwangju 
about 300 radical students continued a hunger protest for a 
second day at myongdong roman catholic cathedral in the city center 
today to demand the fall of roh and a government admission that 
police killed a radical student riot police ringed the cathedral 
but made no move to stop the protest 
some of the hunger strikers bit their fingers to draw blood 
with which they wrote antigovernment slogans 
about 500 students were blocked by riot police when they 
attempted to march out of yonsei university in western seoul 
students pushed and hit police with sticks but were not able to 
break through lines of troopers with interlocked shields 
bury roh taewoo students shouted 
dissidents are demanding an investigation into the death of lee 
cholkyu who they claim was tortured and killed by police his 
body was found in a reservoir may 10 near the southern city of 
kwangju 
the government says police chased lee after stopping him at a 
roadblock but deny any official involvement in the death the 
government says an autopsy shows lee drowned and officials 
speculate he fell into the reservoir and drowned by accident

federal officials refused to discuss a 
broadcast report that a federal grand jury is investigating 
allegations of clean water act violations in the exxon valdez oil 
spill 
obviously one method of investigating would be a grand 
jury us attorney michael spaan said friday he would not 
elaborate in response to questions about the abc news report 
tom matthews the fbis assistant special agent in charge in 
anchorage said he could neither confirm nor deny the workings of 
a grand jury 
in march fbi spokesman bill carter in washington said the 
agency was focusing on possible felony violations of the clean 
water act 
the fbi said its investigation into the march 24 spill of nearly 
11 million gallons of crude oil was continuing in cooperation with 
a number of agencies among them the coast guard the us fish amp 
wildlife service and the us environmental protection agency 
the clean water act prohibits the willful or negligent discharge 
of oil into navigable waters said carl lautenberger an 
environmental protection specialist for the epa in anchorage 
the whole jurisdiction for us to write regulations to 
assess penalities and fines is packaged in the act he said 
it gives federal agencies the jurisdiction to do what they 
do 
matthews said the fbis investigation will be lengthy he said 
he could not specify a time frame 
were just beginning really he said 
exxon has taken responsibility for the damage that occurred when 
its tanker hit a charted reef in prince william sound but has 
insisted the company was not negligent in its safety precautions

hopes are spreading on wall street that 
investors will get invited to a financial party this summer catered 
by the federal reserve 
the festivities would have a simple theme lower interest rates 
and higher stock prices courtesy of an easier credit policy from 
the fed 
talk of such a celebration has been increasing for some time 
now ever since signs began to show up that the economy was 
beginning to slow 
inflation the target of the feds long credittightening 
campaign from early 1988 through the first couple of months of this 
year hasnt been quite so cooperative 
to judge from the latest readings its still running at a 5 
percent to 6 percent annual rate that government officials and a 
good many other observers consider troublesome 
but optimists in the financial world still seem willing to bet 
that a slower pace of business will sooner or later ease upward 
pressure on the cost of living 
conjecture about a change of course at the fed has also been 
fanned lately by the sharp rise of the dollar in foreign exchange 
presumably a sustained advance in the dollar would be unwelcome 
in policymaking circles because it would threaten to reverse the 
difficult progress that has been made toward shrinking the nations 
trade deficit 
so far efforts to keep the dollar stable have consisted mainly 
of intervention by the fed and other banks in the foreign exchange 
markets 
if that proves insufficient the reasoning goes the fed might 
want to lower interest rates in this country to reduce the flow of 
international funds into dollars 
for the moment the dollars strength seems to have worked in 
the us markets favor 
whether this marks a major turn in the dollar remains to be 
seen said martin zweig in his investment advisory letter the 
zweig forecast 
however in recent days there has been a sharp pickup in 
foreign demand for us stocks as those abroad fear they may miss 
the boat on the dollar 
the 6monthold rally in stock prices leveled off in the past 
week the dow jones average of 30 industrials which had climbed 
11914 points over the two preceding weeks slipped back 733 to 
249377 
the new york stock exchange composite index edged up 39 to 
17931 the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market 
rose 316 to 44521 and the american stock exchange market value 
index was up 118 at 35501 
volume on the big board averaged 16979 million shares a day 
against 19271 million the week before 
as popular as it may have become the belief that the fed is 
succeeding in curbing inflation without tipping the economy into a 
recession is not yet universally embraced on wall street 
to an economist the main problem with the soft landing 
hypothesis is that it is hard to understand the practical mechanics 
of slowing growth enough to lower inflation without creating the 
stress of a recession first said robert brusca at nikko 
securities international 
in fact our experience with such happy events is almost 
completely lacking 
said hugh johnson at first albany corp in albany ny the 
trend in stock and bond prices is positive this is being driven by 
some measure of speculation in the dollar which has been 
transmitted to our stock and bond markets this can change 
the current forecast of a soft landing which is driving the 
dollar and the stock and bond markets may change it may change at 
a time when the stock market is perhaps overvalued and therefore 
vulnerable

here is the text of a statement issued today 
by rep tony coelho dcalif announcing his resignation as house 
majority whip and from congress 
for nearly 25 years i have devoted my life to public service 
first as a congressional staffer then as congressman campaign 
committee chair and majority whip all that time i have worked 
for social change for wider acceptance of the disabled for the 
interests of my district and to serve the democratic party 
in recent weeks my ability to complete those missions has been 
diminished by needless and baseless charges about my investments or 
private life i have simply spent too much time building the party 
and trying to help people to have my attention or abilities devoted 
to such distractions 
accordingly i will not seek the office of majority leader 
instead i will tender my resignation as majority whip and will 
also resign my seat in congress on my 47th birthday june 15th 
all week my colleagues have expressed their confidence in me 
and their support for a leaders race i would have preferred to 
land in that race with both feet and would have had the votes to 
win moreover my attorneys remain convinced that a normal business 
transaction admittedly marred by reporting errors posed no legal 
problems for me and i accept their advice 
undoubtedly some will think this decision was motivated by 
weakness in my political standing or my legal position they are 
entitled to their opinion but they are wrong 
i want to thank my family my party and colleagues my country 
and especially my constituents for all the opportunities i have 
enjoyed i particularly want to thank the community of the disabled 
for all the strength theyve given my for so many years 
while i will no longer be working in the congress phyllis my 
daughters and i look forward to conquering new horizons i always 
have and we always will

leaders of chinas student protest movement 
proposed today that thousands of demonstrators hold a final rally 
next week and then end their twoweek occupation of tiananmen 
square 
also today in the first official acknowledgement of a power 
struggle at the top chinas former president li xiannian accused 
certain people in the leadership of the communist party of 
creating confusion in china 
the statement broadcast on staterun radio and television came 
two days after communist party leader zhao ziyang was reportedly 
stripped of power and placed under house arrest for apparently 
being too sympathetic to the protesters demands for democratic 
reforms 
student leaders wang dan wuer kaixi and chai ling at a news 
conference on the square called for a citywide march and mass 
rally on tuesday after which students would leave the square 
the three the top leaders of the uprising said they wanted to 
leave the square because of sanitation and to return the square 
to the people 
they demanded an end to martial law ordered for parts of beijing 
on may 20 by premier li peng and the withdrawal of the tens of 
thousands of army troops surrounding the capital 
the student leaders said the approximately 10000 students 
remaining in the square would make the final decision on whether to 
leave they said student representatives would begin tonight 
meeting with groups of students to reach a final decision on 
whether to end the beijing protest 
they also called for april 27 to be made into a holiday for 
freedom and democracy on that date hundreds of thousands of 
students and workers took to the streets in beijing to protest a 
peoples daily editorial accusing the student movement of causing 
turmoil 
yang jianjun a junior at liaoning fuxing institute of mining 
and technology in northeastern china said the activism displayed 
in chinese cities should be brought to rural areas 
yang who was at the beijing train station to return home today 
also said the conditions are really bad at the square a lot of 
people are tired of living out there 
students began leading organized demonstrations on april 15 to 
demand talks with officials on democratic reforms and ending 
corruption and profiteering by party officials 
the rallies gradually escalated drawing many verage citizens 
and culminated with the occupation of the square by hundreds of 
thousands and a hunger strike by 3000 students in tiananmen square 
on may 13 two days before soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs 
historic visit to china 
at times a million people swarmed through the square and city 
li declared martial law on may 20 but soldiers either were 
reluctant or unable to move against the jubiliant masses 
the protests caused a power struggle between more moderate 
leaders and hardliners with li apparently emerged victorious 
the student leaders did not mention another march planned for 
sunday in beijing student activists in beijing had called for a 
worldwide march of ethnic chinese and a citywide strike in beijing 
most people do not work in china on sunday 
in a shrill speech former president li xiannian also was quoted 
as urging a crackdown on a small band of criminals who he said 
were trying to overthrow the rule of the communist party 
these people have an organization a plan and a plot he 
said if they succeed china will be thrown into a deep disaster 
in another blow to the moderate faction led by zhao wan li 
chairman of the standing committee of the national peoples 
congress threw his support to premier li and other conservatives 
who ordered martial law 
wan a moderate cut short his visit to the united states 
earlier this week and was initially reported to be placed under

israeli troops shot and killed a guerrilla 
today after he opened fire from the jordanian side of the border 
the army said two soldiers were slightly wounded it said 
jordan in an official broadcast suggested the attacker was a 
distraught jordanian soldier who had abandoned his observation post 
at the border 
the attack occurred about 630 am near the kibbutz or 
communal settlement of hamadiya the military command said 
hamadiya is 50 miles northeast of jerusalem 
the israeli army said one of its patrols near a border fence 
encountered light weapons fire from east of the fence and 
returned fire 
soldiers searched the area after the firefight and found the 
body of a guerrilla dressed in a militarytype uniform and armed 
with the usmade m16 assault rifle an army spokesman said 
the body was found on the jordanian side of the border he said 
although the army identified the attacker as a guerrilla the 
staterun jordan radio quoted an official source as suggesting the 
attacker was a jordanian army soldier 
an official source said today that at 630 am the conscript 
issa mahmoud ahmad carrying his gun abandoned his observation 
post at the border the broadcast said 
during search operations for the absent conscript the sound 
of shooting was heard in the zor abdullah area northwest of waqqas 
village it said waqqas is close to the site of the clash as 
given by the israeli army 
the jordanian official was quoted as saying ahmad suffers from 
psychological troubleand is still absent 
israel radio gave a different version of the clash saying that 
an army scout was the first to open fire when he heard a noise on 
the other side of the border it said the scout was wounded in the 
firefight 
it was the third infiltration attempt or attack from jordan 
since may 1988 
we have an impression that this is not a new step or a new 
direction maj gen amram mitzna the head of the armys central 
command told israel radio in an interview from the site of the 
clash 
we see that the jordanians are making every effort and use all 
the means to keep this border secure and closed 
in previous cases mitzna said the guerrillas succeeded in 
sneaking by the jordanian patrols this case is still unclear we 
dont know who this man is where he left from who sent him and 
how he came here 
we should remember that although jordan is really trying to 
prevent such activity there is no substitute to our own forces 
mitzna said

syrian gunners shelled the christian 
coastline north of beirut today despite an appeal by arab leaders 
for a ceasefire 
a dozen 130mm howitzer shells fired by syrian gunners from a 
battery in moslem west beirut slammed into the coast near the 
christian ports of jounieh and byblos a police spokesman said no 
casualties were reported he said 
arab leaders ended a summit in casablanca morocco on friday 
without a blueprint for solving lebanons 14year civil war or the 
recent fighting between gen michel aouns mainly christian troops 
and his syriandruse foes 
fighting broke out again march 8 when aouns troops blockaded 
illegal druserun ports and the moslem alliance responded by 
shelling the 310squaremile christian enclave several ceasefires 
declared by the arab league have failed 
the arab leaders were unable during their summit to reach an 
agreement on proposals to form an observer force for lebanon 
instead they created a committee of moroccos king hassan ii 
saudi monarch king fahd and algerian president chadli bendjedid to 
set up a workable ceasefire over the next six months 
iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz who attended the summit 
reported a gentlemans agreement had been reached calling for 
syria to withdraw its 45000 troops from leganon but there was no 
sign it would be honored 
the committee also is to hammer out a new constitution for 
lebanon 
salim hoss who heads the moslem cabinet in lebanons dual 
government was quick to support the summits resolutions 
i welcome the resolutions of the arab summit and hope they 
will be implemented as soon as possible he said in a statement 
released friday 
aoun who heads the christian cabinet has not announced his 
position but the christian militia was apparently disappointed 
because the resolutions did not call openly for the withdrawal of 
syrias troops 
aoun and other christian leaders accuse the syrians of failing 
to adhere a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the arab league by 
siding with the moslems against the christians in the civil war

two years after his flight to red 
square triggered a kremlin shakeup and drew a soviet prison 
sentence mathias rusts interests are more down to earth he rides 
a horse 
back at home in this hamburg suburb life is nearly back to 
normal for the west german youth who thought his may 28 1987 stunt 
would earn him a meeting with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
the crew cut he wore upon release from moscows lefortovo prison 
in august has grown back as has the grass around his familys 
brick apartment house after repeated trampling by journalists and 
curiosity seekers 
but rust now 21 has had to change roles from aviator to 
equestrian as local authorities refuse to reinstate his pilots 
license 
i dont like places where there are so many people on so 
little space said rust seated primly in the tiny dining alcove 
cluttered with memorabilia from his moments in the limelight 
thats why i bought my horse to get away while im not able to 
fly 
the 8yearold black mare torina is a champion jumper and was 
bought with money stern magazine paid rusts family for the rights 
to their story 
the west german press labeled rust the daredevil kremlin 
flier when at the age of 19 he flew a singleengine cessna 
through heavily guarded air space and landed in moscows red square 
the act was a prelude to the ouster of soviet defense minister 
sergei l sokolov and air defense chief alexander koldunov because 
soviet air defenses took no action to halt the flight 
but despite selfconfidence about his abilities as an aviator 
rust is no adventurer and an unlikely hero 
his political rationale for making the flight has done more to 
perplex than impress those who initially took his flight as 
reckless derringdo 
it was my direct goal to speak to gorbachev to explain that 
our people also want better relations it was impossible at that 
time in any other way so i made the flight rust said 
i do not regret the flight because in the end this incident 
helped to better relations between east and west and to clarify the 
differences and similarities between our societies the 
bespectacled youth contended 
he expresses disappointment that gorbachev never granted him 
an audience but harbors a hope of meeting him when he travels to 
the soviet union as a tourist he cannot get a visa however until 
his fouryear sentence expires in september 1991 
rust was convicted in moscow on charges of violating 
international air safety regulations illegal entry into the soviet 
union and malicious hooliganism he was released in august on what 
soviet authorities said were humanitarian grounds 
he initially faced charges in west germany but they were 
dropped late last year by the hamburg state prosecutors office 
the sole sanction still in force is the revoked pilots license 
rust expects to earn it back some day and fly for one of hamburgs 
air charter services 
in the meantime he is spending an idle summer at home with his 
parents monika and karlheinz and his 17yearold brother ingo 
this fall he will enter the civilian service the pacifist 
alternative to west germanys compulsory military term 
rust says his experience in moscow where he claims to have 
befriended guards prosecutors and kgb agents solidified his 
opposition to any use of armed force 
he will instead serve his 20month term at a local hospital and 
get the training he needs to be a health care worker should the 
much hopedfor pilots license not materialize 
the familys crowded fourroom home has been transformed into a 
shrine to rusts crime 
photographs newspaper clippings artists sketches and cartoons 
lampooning his unauthorized flight from helsinki to moscow cover 
much of the wall space in the dining and living rooms as well as 
over the bunk beds in what mrs rust still calls the childrens 
room 
a poster of gorbachev has stared across the entrance way since 
the first of the familys seven trips to moscow to visit the jailed 
flier 
between rides on torina stabled at a farm four miles away rust 
says he is at work on a book and a screenplay that would explain 
his moscow mission 
the book progressing slowly is being penned by hand because 
rust says computers and typewriters are intimidating and 
overrated 
he claims us filmmakers have offered him as much as 500000 
for the movie rights to his story but that he has turned them down 
because they would not allow him to write the script 
his mother claims part of the responsibility for her sons 
flight across heavily guarded soviet territory recalling how she 
would sometimes dream aloud of a western gesture of peace to the 
new kremlin leader 
but these were just illusions she said i had no idea he 
was planning such a thing 
russ contends the idea was his alone and that its roots will 
become clear in the book which he hopes to release some time next 
year

a bridge collapsed minutes after an engineer 
recommended closing it and the rainswollen river below swept away 
at least two vehicles flooding elsewhere in ohio left two people 
dead and hundreds out of their homes 
police could not say how many people were in the cars which 
plunged into the great miami river when a bridge near miamitown 
collapsed friday evening rescuers resumed searching for victims 
this morning but could not enter the flooding river because of its 
swift current 
the car in front of us just dropped straight down said 
sharon boebinger who was waiting to cross the bridge when it 
started collapsing i said oh my god i put it in reverse and 
backed up i didnt feel the bridge shake at all it just happened 
in an instant 
lt col ramon hoffbauer of the hamilton county sheriffs office 
was asked if anyone could have survived the plunge 
i wouldnt think so he said the current is moving pretty 
fast i cant tell you how fast but the rescue crews didnt go 
into the water at all 
the american red cross said it got more than a dozen missing 
person calls but gary miller disaster services director said 
none of the missing could be confirmed as river victims 
officials said divers likely would have to wait for the water to 
recede before going in 
the collapse of the onelane temporary bridge carrying us 52 
over the great miami river at miamitown 10 miles west of 
cincinnati occurred just 10 minutes after a hamilton county 
engineer had given an order to close the span 
widespread flooding in southwestern ohio earlier friday sent 
people scurrying to rooftops and high ground 
a couple and their 10yearold son were stranded on the roof of 
their house all day until rescuers reached them by boat the butler 
county sheriffs department said 
in camden rescuers used lifelines and boats to lead 30 
occupants of a trailer park through chesthigh water to safety a 
total of 200 people were forced from their homes in the town of 
about 1900 people southwest of dayton 
divers recovered the body of 20monthold brandon k irwin of 
springfield in donnels creek northeast of dayton the sheriffs 
department said the boy fell into the swollen creek from a 
footbridge near his grandmothers house 
in findlay in northwest ohio hancock county sheriffs deputies 
recovered the body of lisa faust 24 of fostoria from her 
overturned car in the portage river the car was swept off a county 
road by high water hit a metal bridge abutment and overturned into 
the river 
at the site of the bridge collapse witnesses gave varying 
accounts of two to four vehicles falling into the river said bruce 
smith chief of the colerain township fire department 
radio station wcky reported at least six people were missing an 
adult and four children were seen in a yellow pickup truck and at 
least one person in a car which went under the water the station 
said 
william brayshaw the countys chief deputy engineer had been 
advised by the contractor national engineering co of 
strongsville ohio that the river was washing tree trunks and 
other heavy debris downstream 
engineers said the debris posed a threat to the steel beams 
driven into bedrock under the river that supported the 300foot 
bridge 
the temporary bridge had been in use for several months while a 
new bridge was being built to replace a 94yearold span brayshaw 
said 
just as engineers were moving to barricade the bridge a 
100foot section collapsed late friday three other bridges over 
the great miami were closed

the politics of judicial selection is heating 
up in legal and legislative circles just as president bush 
prepares to begin filling 46 vacancies on the federal bench 
the 16 to 18 candidates expected to be nominated in june will 
indicate whether bush plans to extend the conservative control of 
judicial appointments that began eight years ago 
bush has a chance to consolidate the conservative trend in 
federal jurisprudence begun under president reagan who appointed 
more than half of all federal judges currently sitting during his 
eight years in office 
the expected nomination of clarence thomas a black conservative 
who is chairman of the equal employment opportunity commission 
would signal just such a trend 
thomas is expected to be nominated to fill a vacancy created on 
the us circuit court of appeals here by last years resignation 
of robert bork a martyr of the conservative movements battle for 
the federal judiciary 
conservatives are still seeing red over the senates 1987 vote 
defeating borks nomination to the supreme court 
resentment by conservatives over borks defeat wont be hard to 
detect this week at a senate judiciary committee hearing on the 
american bar associations judicial screening role 
conservatives criticized the abas judicial panel after four of 
its 15 members found bork unqualified on the ground that his 
comparatively extreme views on constitutional principles would 
affect his judicial temperament 
earlier this year bush submitted five nominations to the 
senate but the candidates were chosen from the ranks of potential 
judges left over from the reagan administration 
the final screening of the first crop of bushs own judicial 
nominees comes amid a dispute between attorney general dick 
thornburgh and the aba over the groups role in judicial screening 
and heightened concern about the issue on capitol hill 
thornburgh aba officials and representatives of other interest 
groups are scheduled to testify at fridays senate judiciary 
committee hearing 
conservatives and liberals alike have criticized the secret 
process by which the aba reviews judicial candidates and renders a 
rating of the individuals qualifications before a nominee is 
forwarded to the senate 
conservatives accuse the aba of giving low marks to candidates 
because of their political views 
liberals like sen joseph r biden jr ddel the chairman of 
the judiciary committee are concerned about the abas practice of 
not divulging the basis for holding a candidate unqualified for the 
judiciary 
thornburghs dispute with the aba was born of an apparent 
disagreement over discussions he and his aides had with bar 
officials over changes in the abas guidelines on judicial 
screening 
robert b fiske jr the attorney generals choice to be the no 
2 justice department official has become embroiled in the 
controversy 
conservative critics hold fiske who chaired the abas standing 
committee on federal judiciary from 1984 to 1987 responsible for 
what they regard as the panels ideological and political bias 
against reagan appointees to the courts 
a month after thornburgh confidently told the house judiciary 
committee that the aba had agreed not to evaluate a candidates 
political or ideological beliefs the attorney general is still 
trying to resolve the issue 
the aba said it made no such agreement denying it had ever 
considered politics or ideology in assessing a candidates 
professional qualifications 
thornburgh threatened to cut the aba out of the judicial 
screening process unless it abided by the agreement he insisted he 
had obtained 
the aba then offered to drop a sentence from its guidelines 
stating that ideological and political beliefs are not examined 
except to the extent they may bear on other qualifications notably 
judicial temperament 
thornburghs spokesman david runkel said this is an acceptable 
solution but it might not satisfy conservative critics 
i cant believe they are putting that forward as an honest 
proposal said daniel l casey head of the american conservative 
union 
deleting the sentence prohibiting consideration of political 
beliefs would give them carte blanche to do it because its not 
expressly forbidden as it was before 
the discussions between the aba and thornburgh are continuing to 
try to resolve one remaining obstacle to a joint statement 
when you get more than one lawyer trying to get words down on 
a piece of paper you find controversy over words runkel said 
what appears to be still at stake is the abas insistence that 
it will not admit to ever having improperly having delved into a 
candidates political beliefs 
at a briefing last week runkel conceded that thornburgh could 
not cite any examples of ideologically tainted aba reviews 
signalling a slight retreat in the attorney generals position 
runkel said thornburgh has problems with the changes in the 
language in aba guidelines that have led to perception problems 
with the aba on how they reviewed judicial candidates

atampt and its unions raced against the clock 
today in hopes of negotiating new contracts before existing pacts 
expire tonight but a bitter dispute over medical benefits 
threatened to block a settlement 
theres a lot to be done and a lot of hard bargaining going 
on a company official said today shortly after the negotiators 
returned to the bargaining table 
it remained unclear whether the two sides could resolve their 
differences over medical benefits described by one source as the 
major block to a settlement also up in the air was whether the 
unions would immediately call a strike in the absence of a 
settlement 
after a long and frantic day of negotiating friday both sides 
publicly continued to express hope of reaching new contracts before 
existing pacts affecting about 160000 workers expire at 1159 pm 
edt but they say such a development hinges on a major breakthrough 
on the benefits package which has dominated the talks from the 
outset 
if we can settle health care no easy task then we can 
reach agreement on wages and the other issues a union source 
said late friday this is the major block to a settlement 
sources close to the negotiations said progress has been made 
but they cautioned that negotiations are at a fragile stage and 
could turn for the worse in an arrangement likely to be repeated 
today formal negotiating committees met friday at a washington 
hotel while the two union presidents and atampts top negotiator held 
separate meetings periodically on the major issues 
it remained unclear as the deadline approached whether the 
unions would call a strike immediately if no agreement is reached 
union officials have refused to disclose their plans but have 
hinted strongly that they would not strike right away particularly 
if agreement on a contract appeared near 
instead the unions have a number of other strategies designed 
to pressure the american telephone amp telegraph co into a 
settlement primarily a nationwide labor boycott of atampt 
longdistance service that the unions contend could cut the 
companys longdistance revenues by up to 8 percent 
as two levels of negotiations continued late friday both sides 
reported progress but said bitter union opposition to atampts health 
care proposal remained a substantial barrier to a settlement 
the unions the communications workers of america and the 
international brotherhood of electrical workers vehemently oppose 
atampts demand that workers pay more up front for medical care the 
company says it needs to reduce its 1 billion annual medical bill 
but the unions have demanded expanded benefits while promising to 
devise new costcontrol measures 
hectic negotiations friday were marked by repeated exchanges of 
proposals and counter offers including a significant atampt offer to 
limit the use of temporary workers a key union jobsecurity 
demand 
the sources who spoke only on condition of anonymity said atampt 
proposed in an informal meeting among top officials from both sides 
to revise its health care package neither side would discuss 
details but a union official said it was a reconfiguration of 
the existing offer and it is unacceptable 
in addition to offering to regulate use of temporary workers 
atampt has amended and expanded its contract proposal to improve eye 
and dental care and its parental leave policy company officials 
said also it has proposed for the first time allowing leave for 
workers to care for sick relatives 
those proposals are in addition to the formal offer the company 
made monday a package which provided varying base wage increases 
and lump sum payments depending on job classification and also a 
new profitsharing plan for union workers

the united states secretly has supplied france 
with information about the design of nuclear weapons since 1972 
the pentagon acknowledged confirming a reported published saturday 
american officials previously acknowledged sharing nuclear 
weapons information only with britain and usfrench nuclear 
collaboration has been one of the most closely guarded secrets 
of both governments princeton university professor richard h 
ullman wrote in the quarterly foreign policy 
the exchange of data means that france is more closely 
integrated than previously realized into the nuclear war plans of 
the north atlantic treaty organization and the disclosure might 
complicate efforts to negotiate a deal to sharply reduce us and 
soviet strategic arsenals 
it may be that public acknowledgement of the program of aid to 
france and particularly of coordination between us and french 
nuclear forces would increase soviet pressure for the inclusion of 
french and british forces in any future strategic arms control 
regime wrote ullman 
the british nuclear arsenal now being modernized is slated to 
consist of 500 warheads by the mid1990s and the french plan to 
have about 1000 warheads by early in the next century the united 
states and soviet union each have more than 11000 strategic 
warheads and under the proposed strategic arms reduction treaty 
would cut that number to 6000 apiece 
the us policy of sharing nuclear weapons data with the french 
was initiated in 1972 by then president richard m nixon and his 
national security adviser henry kissinger as a means to draw the 
french more closely into nato wrote ullman france left natos 
integrated military structure in 1966 although it remains within 
the alliance 
ullman concluded in the course of more than 100 interviews 
over the past two years with toplevel politicians civil 
servants and others involved in the program that since 1972 us 
experts have briefed their french counterparts on aspects of 
nuclear weaponry including 
penetration of soviet defenses 
miniaturization of warhead components to allow development of 
multiple independently targeted reentry vehicles 
guidance and propulsion systems including the chemistry of 
solid fuels for rocket engines 
moreover the two sides have shared targeting information about 
the soviet union to ensure that the french and us nuclear bombs 
do not interfere with one another ullman wrote 
the assistance almost certainly has violated us law 
ullman wrote 
the pentagon acknowledged some aspects of ullmans article but 
denied that the data exchange was illegal and declined to discuss 
details 
the united states has cooperated with france in improving the 
operational effectiveness and survivability of its strategic 
missile systems including supporting command and control 
systems said a pentagon spokesman reading a statement he said 
had been cleared by the french government and the white house 
there have been several meetings involving us and french 
technicians every year since 1972 under the terms of the 1961 
agreement on nuclear cooperation said the spokesman who spoke 
on condition that he not be further identified 
that agreement was amended in 1985 to provide for the exchange 
of classified or restricted data the 1961 agreement provided 
the basis for the exchange of nuclear weapons information related 
to military operational requirements said the spokesman 
the amended agreement allows certain classified exchanges 
focused on enhancing the safety security and reliability of 
nuclear activities and installations said the pentagon statement 
the picture that emerged from ullmans article and the pentagon 
statement was of an information exchange that at first was heavily 
in favor of the french but which in recent years has become more 
balanced 
the french nuclear program has reached a technical maturity 
which approaches our own the statement said the french force 
contributes effectively to western deterrence 
exchanges were aimed at improving our mutual understanding of 
technologies related to nuclear safety the pentagon statement 
said more recently we discussed measures to deal with nuclear 
weapons accidents exchanges facilitated efforts from both sides to 
make their nuclear weapons safe 
the transfer of nuclear weapons nuclear components of 
weapons source or special nuclear material is not authorized by 
this agreement he said 
as required by law the senate and house foreign relations and 
armed services committees and senior congressional leaders were 
informed of the 1985 amendment to the 1961 agreement and the 
exchange of information was fully legal the statement said the 
amendment did not require senate ratification it said 
congress was in recess over the memorial day weekend and it was 
impossible to determine the extent of congressional knowledge of 
the nuclear data exchange senior congressional aides said they 
were unaware of details of the agreement but that it might have 
been so secret that they were not informed 
ullman wrote that the 1985 amendment seems to have gone 
unnoticed by anyone outside the nuclear weapons establishments of 
both countries

strength hundreds of police in combat fatigues with shields 
blocked off the park where the rally was to be held other officers 
blanketed the city center 
dissidents and radical students staged scattered peaceful 
protests in the downtown area after the rally was blocked bands of 
students attempted to march in some downtown areas but were 
quickly dispersed and some students were dragged away 
small peaceful protests were reported in the provincial cities 
of taegju and chonju and about 10000 people marched in the 
southern city of kwangju according to korean press reports 
about 300 radical students were in the second day of a hunger 
strike at the myongdong roman catholic cathedral in seoul they are 
demanding the fall of the roh government and a government admission 
that police killed a radical student riot police ringed the 
cathedral but did not move in 
some of the hunger strikers wrote antigovernment slogans with 
their blood drawn by biting their fingers as other protesters 
applauded down with the dictatorship the hungers strikers 
chanted

by students demanding political reforms in china

yankees 
it was the second saturday in a row that the government blocked 
a protest in seoul few people responded to the dissidents call to 
take part in the protests despite widespread appeals

because of their violent tactics and extremist views 
the united national democratic movement the main dissident 
alliance which called for protests in seoul and 10 other cities 
had predicted up to 100000 people would demonstrate nationwide 
it called the rally to denounce the government and demand a full 
investigation into the death of radical student lee cholkyu the 
alliance had said its protests would be peaceful because of public 
anger over past violent demonstrations 
dissidents claim police tortured and killed lee whose body was 
found in a reservoir may 10 near the southern city of kwangju the 
government says police chased lee after stopping him at a roadblock 
but deny any official involvement in the death

demanding the removal of the 43000 us troops based in south 
korea under a defense pact

residents of this affluent community 
shaken by the arrests of five high school students on charges of 
sexually assaulting a mentally retarded girl have raised another 
disturbing question 
why did it take weeks for authorities to bring charges in the 
case when students in the high school were buzzing about the 
incident the day after it occurred authorities say it just took 
that long to investigate while others charge it was a sign of the 
popularity and privileged status of the suspects 
everybody has known about it for a while said a student who 
would give her name only as w sanford 
police say that on march 1 13 teenagers accompanied a 
17yearold mentally retarded girl to the home of two of the teens 
where she was sexually assaulted with a broomstick and a miniature 
baseball bat no sexual intercourse took place 
the girl who was an acquaintance of the boys is not capable of 
understanding or consenting to what happened authorities said 
five teens all 17 or 18 were arrested wednesday the day after 
a new york city television station broadcast a report on the 
incident three were charged as adults with conspiracy and assault 
charges two were charged as juveniles the other eight who were 
not charged watched the incident but did not intervene 
investigators said 
patrick pignatello a lifelong resident said this doesnt 
happen in glen ridge i know those kids i know every family in 
town these kids are well educated they know right from wrong 
theyre not on drugs or alcohol 
i just cant understand how anything like this could happen 
some residents are angry that the march 1 incident is being 
compared to the case from new york city 20 miles to the east in 
which a central park jogger was raped by a gang of teenage boys 
because of the proximity and time of the new york wilding 
incidents analogies are made of rich white boys vs poor black 
youths in the city said kevin rigby an attorney for one of the 
teenagers charged youve got two very distinct incidents here 
and its not fair to make comparisons 
some students and residents say the delay in the arrests may be 
due to the popularity of the students many of whom are athletes 
they also note that among the eight who witnessed the incident but 
was not charged is a township police lieutenants son 
missy sheuermann a township resident said she suspected a 
coverup by authorities to protect a group of privileged students 
its appalling no ones ever going to hear the truth 
she said 
students said rumors began circulating the day after the 
incident and it was known throughout the 340student school by the 
time of the arrest everybody knew about it said one junior 
who said he didnt want his name used for fear of reprisals 
ray weiss spokesman for the essex county prosecutors office 
said the length of the investigation was justified by the factors 
involved the mental state of the victim and the number of boys 
involved 
it is the normal course that a complex investigation takes 
weiss said you do it as thoroughly as you can until youre 
satisfied youve gone as far as you can 
the girl first reported the incident march 4 to a teacher at 
west orange high school where she attends special education 
classes 
the delay by a victim in reporting the attack is common in 
sexual abuse cases said dr jeffrey segal coordinator of a 
morristown memorial hospital program that cares for victims of 
violent assaults 
i think victims in general children or adults fear of what 
would happen if they do reveal an attack segal said also 
there is the fear will people believe them 
police were notified about three weeks later rose mccaffrey 
glen ridge superintendent of schools said school officials wanted 
to be sure of the nature of the incident before calling in police 
glen ridge school officials heard about the incident from west 
orange officials and from a student 
there was certainly no coverup on our behalf mccaffrey 
said we cannot answer why it took them that long to investigate 
they shared no information with us

enough talk about flexible freezes sin 
taxes and revenue enhancement to cut the federal budget 
deficit says economist richard a musgrave 
the real solution to the budget problem insists musgrave an 
authority on public finance is the oldfashioned one an increase 
in the individual income tax and he wants more than higher rates 
that hit the wealthy he is calling for restricting the mortgage 
interest deduction and for repealing the writeoff for charitable 
contributions 
we cannot resolve the federal budget crisis without raising 
taxes musgrave author of the theory of public finance said 
in a report issued saturday 
there is not enough scope for responsible program cuts while 
paying for the savingsandloan bailout and beginning to address 
the growing backlog of unmet needs in education child care the 
environment and public infrastructure he wrote 
increased revenue is needed and should be drawn from the 
personal income tax musgrave said in a report released by the 
economic policy institute a research group financed by labor 
business and foundations musgrave is a professor at the university 
of california at santa cruz and harvard professoremeritus 
congress and president bush agree there will be no general tax 
increase to reduce the deficit during the budget year that begins 
oct 1 the president prefers a flexible freeze on spending 
congress would not go along and such revenue enhancements as 
extending the expiring tax on telephone service and blocking a 
scheduled decline in taxes on air tickets and shipments 
it remains to be seen whether bush a year from now will abandon 
his campaign promise against any tax increase while there is a 
widespread feeling in congress that higher taxes will have to be 
enacted by oct 1 1990 few lawmakers are calling for major 
changes in the massive 1986 tax overhaul 
musgrave is 
the proposition that the income tax must not be touched 
because it has been the subject of recent reform has political 
appeal but little substance musgrave wrote on the contrary 
the need to provide for additional revenue and to do so promptly 
should make use of the improved tax rather than worsen the tax 
system by resorting to inferior revenue sources or the addition of 
a new and complex tax 
raising excise taxes the sin taxes that congress talks 
about would be unfair to lowerincome americans and provide 
insufficient revenue for deficit reductions musgrave says 
imposing a national sales tax known as a valueadded tax would 
discriminate against larger families require a new bureaucracy to 
administer and preempt a traditional state revenue source he adds 
the individual income tax which already provides 40 percent of 
federal revenues remains superior to other proven taxes and 
preferable to most alternatives which have been proposed 
musgrave says 
the income tax is highly visible a steady reminder of the 
quality of public service that should be provided in return the 
report argues it permits tax liabilities to be adjusted to the 
taxpayers ability to pay and to family size and since the 1986 
overhaul the income tax has people with similar incomes paying 
similar taxes 
but the new law can be improved making it fairer and providing 
sizable revenue to reduce the deficit musgrave contends his 
proposals which could wipe out the deficit in one year 
raise the 33percent top individual tax bracket which affects 
upperincome taxpayers to 40 percent and impose a new set of 
graduated rates that would hit some middleincome families 
limit the amount of home mortgage interest that can be deducted 
repeal the deduction for charitable contributions 
tax interest on state and local bonds 
tax a portion of the money contributed to pensions health 
insurance and other employerfinanced benefits 
impose capitalgains taxes at death on the increase in value of 
property during the owners lifetime

as so often in its recent history china is in a 
convulsion seemingly unable to escape the pattern of using force 
or the threat of it to settle political differences and achieve 
change 
once again as in the violent 196676 cultural revolution the 
leaders and masses caught up in the struggle seem oblivious to the 
possible damage to chinas careful advances in economic reform 
this time however the issues are clearer than in the 
farleftist cultural revolution when a power struggle was cloaked 
in ideology 
at stake now is whether the communist party will continue to 
determine chinas future or whether it will allow students or any 
other group a small voice 
although other demands were raised during six weeks of student 
protests that climaxed in a toplevel power struggle the students 
key demand is for a meeting on equal terms at which specific 
reforms such as a free press can be discussed 
reformist party chief zhao ziyang endorsed a dialogue and for a 
brief time student leaders believed he was winning a power struggle 
with hardliners some hoped that under him china might take its 
first major step away from a 2000yearold tradition of autocracy 
but by last weeks end it was clear that hardliners under 
senior leader deng xiaoping and premier li peng were in charge 
fears of violent conflict between protesters and soldiers and 
among military units on opposing sides of the power struggle 
subsided as soldiers ordered by li to enforce martial law moved to 
the outskirts of beijing 
li seemed willing to wait before trying to enforce the martial 
law that so far has existed in name only 
street marches waned and barely 10000 students continued a 
sitin at tiananmen square that began may 13 and peaked with 
200000 participants however students and workers said they would 
hold new mass marches this week 
but even if the movement dies it will only be a matter of time 
before deng is challenged again by the same clamor for democracy 
from students intellectuals workers and others whose nonmaterial 
aspirations the party has ignored for 40 years 
their voice has gained strength with each round of protests in 
1978 hundreds of students and workers put posters on a wall in 
beijing calling for reform in 1986 students marched several 
hundred thousand strong this month more than 1 million students 
workers teachers doctors police government workers party 
members and soldiers joined the chorus 
little popular respect remains for leaders who have been seen as 
ready to go to any extreme to protect their power even children 
joined the mocking chant xiaoping your mind is not sharp 
beijing residents will not forget soon the heady sense of power 
it gave them 
during the height of the protests many careened down streets in 
flatbed trucks whooping and waving flags they hung li in effigy 
and satirized deng 
it was a mass catharsis for citizens of one of the worlds most 
tightly controlled societies even the army lost prestige 
something has snapped in the entire political system said a 
western diplomat its impossible to put it back together again 
the way it was 
some players may be off the stage for good zhao was reported 
under house arrest several other top officials were reported in 
serious trouble and a purge of liberals in the party academia and 
the media was predicted 
li said most of the student protesters will be regarded as 
patriots but that a tiny minority of student leaders conspired 
to overthrow the party and will be punished 
they can expect to go the way of wei jingsheng the last 
impetuous youth who dared take dengs name in vain in public wei 
a 29yearold electrician helped lead the 1978 democracy wall 
movement and is serving a 15year prison term 
semiretired conservative chen yun 84 in a televised speech 
blamed the student protests on a relaxation in marxist 
ideological education indicating the nation may face a strident 
antiwestern antiliberal political campaign like the one that 
followed the 198687 student protests 
for a time at least writers and artists who had been enjoying 
a gradual relaxation of censorship will have to feel their way 
carefully 
pressures for economic conservativism also will increase deng 
sponsored a 10yearold reform program that stimulated the economy 
by reducing central planning and introducing elements of the free 
market 
but the reforms have been stalled since september while the 
government tries to end supply bottlenecks corruption and more 
than 30percent inflation liberal economists prescribed faster 
dismantling of the old system 
in order to defeat zhao however deng was forced to seek 
support from aging revolutionaries such as chen who may insist on 
moving slowly and even reasserting some controls 
the government also may have scared off some foreign investment 
by its harsh response to the protests which negated the image it 
had carefully cultived of a united rational leadership 
ripples will be felt in the british colony of hong kong from 
which thousands of professionals already have fled in anticipation 
of the return to chinese rule in 1997 the crackdown will only 
encourage further exodus 
in the end the huge masses of protesters in beijing and other 
cities seemed irrelevant to the power struggle itself the outcome 
of which was determined by the allegiances of military commanders 
and votes in the party politburo 
without mass support however dengs rule will be shaky 
furthermore he and the party elders who rallied to him cannot live 
forever deng is known to suffer from minor illnesses and his 
public statements have become rambling 
he or a successor will be forced eventually to respond to the 
masses to students galvanized by the writings of thomas jefferson 
henry david thoreau and other western individualists to workers 
who see inflation erode their buying power while corrupt officials 
get fat and to peasants who are angry at being forced to grow 
grain and accept ious from the government 
all have a common yearning to share in chinas prosperity 
beyond that most want democracy in the simple terms of being able 
to choose their leaders perceiving the current lot as confused and 
ineffectual they want newspapers that are believable free of 
political controls 
very few have said they want to replace the communist party but 
a growing number of students and others wonder if their goals can 
be achieved under a oneparty system 
they may face arrest but most of the student activists are 
determined to continue agitating for reform as long as they can 
despite the fall or rise of top leaders 
democracy and freedom and science cant be accomplished in one 
or two years said chen zhangbao of beijing normal university 
we want to go forward step by step and hope that future 
students will join in

rep tony coelho no 3 in the house 
democratic leadership said today he will quit congress rather than 
endure a protracted ethics investigation similar to the one that 
has driven speaker jim wright to the brink of resignation 
coelho the majority whip in the house has come under fire in 
recent weeks for a 100000 junk bond investment in which he earned 
more than 6000 without investing any money and for other 
financial dealings 
in a statement coelho said his ability to work in congress and 
serve the democratic party has been diminished by needless and 
baseless charges about my investments or private life i have 
simply spent too much time building the party and trying to help 
people to have my attention or abilities devoted to such 
distractions 
accordingly i will not seek the office of majority leader 
instead i will tender my resignation as majority whip and will 
also resign my seat in congress on my 47th birthday june 
15th he said 
the california congressman said that all week my colleagues 
have expressed their confidence in me and their support for a 
leaders race i would have preferred to land in that race with 
both feet and would have had the votes to win 
moreover my attorneys remain convinced that a normal business 
transaction admittedly marred by reporting errors posed no legal 
problems for me and i accept their advice coelho said 
he added undoubtedly some will think this decision was 
motivated by weakness in my political standing or my legal 
position they are entitled to their opinions but they are wrong 
house majority leader thomas foley dwash termed coelhos 
departure as a loss adding in the current environment 
realistically there might be a long period of inquiry which he 
feels would be damaging to the party or to the house for which he 
has deep affection 
with coelho out of the leadership scramble rep richard 
gephardt dmo has decided to run for majority leader no matter 
what a congressional source close to gephardt said today on 
condition of anonymity 
he has been persuaded to run the democratic source said 
today 
gephardt learned of coelhos planned resignation through news 
accounts friday night and was in his congressional office today 
calling colleagues to seek their support for his leadership bid 
according to the gephardt source the missouri congressman has 
decided to unequivocally abandon any presidential plans for 
1992 if he wins the majority leader position gephardt 
unsuccessfully sought the democratic presidential nomination in 
1988 
gephard said in a statement he was stunned and saddened by 
tonys decision 
he has been an extraordinarily able and effective leader in 
the house he has also been my good friend and he will continue to 
be gephardt said 
a top democratic leadership source who spoke only on condition 
he not be named said coelho just said he couldnt be an 
effective majority leader with these charges out there 
coelhos decision first disclosed in an interview published in 
todays editions of the new york times further complicates 
democratic efforts to regroup in the wake of the furor over 
wrights ethical problems 
foley is expected to become speaker if wright resigns as 
expected next week 
earlier friday coelho had been passing word that he would 
attempt to move up to majority leader but his decision to depart 
leaves open the posts of majority leader whip and possibly several 
other leadership posts 
coelho told the times he was taking the actions to avoid a 
protracted investigation of his personal finances 
i want to give my party a chance to move on the times 
quoted him as saying i dont intend to put my party through more 
turmoil i dont intend to put this institution through more 
turmoil and more importantly i dont intend to put my family 
through more turmoil 
if i cant be leader and if i cant be whip its time to try 
a new and different challenge he said 
earlier this month coelho acknowledged that a california 
savings and loan executive set him up in a junk bond investment 
that netted him a 6882 profit without him having to put up any of 
his own money 
however coelho had said that except for some reporting errors 
the 1986 deal was totally above board and he did nothing wrong 
coelho has been a rising star in the house the californian was 
widely respected and liked by other democrats for his work as 
chairman of the partys campaign committee which raised funds and 
provided campaign services for the partys candidates 
but some democrats expressed concern privately over the possible 
political damage to the party if coelho took on a more prominent 
role at a time when his business dealings were coming under close 
scrutiny on the heels of wrights apparently unsuccessful campaign 
to fend off multiple ethics allegations 
a report released by coelho on may 14 showed that thomas 
spiegel chief executive officer of the columbia savings and loan 
assn of beverly hills calif purchased 100000 in bonds for 
coelho and held them until coelho could raise money to pay for them 
spiegel also provided half of the money to finance the bonds 
the bond was sold to coelho by the executive a month later at 
the initial offering price saving coelho about 4000 compared to 
the bonds market price at the time the los angeles times reported 
this week that the justice department was opening a criminal 
investigation of whether coelho received favored treatment but 
coelho said the story was wrong 
however coelho acknowledged that he regretted the deal he put 
his personal funds into a blind trust last year and he said he 
wished he had done it earlier 
according to coelhos report he first considered investing his 
1986 campaign funds in 12 percent bonds based on a suggestion by 
spiegel coelho ruled out that type of investment for his campaign 
but spiegel suggested the congressman himself could make an 
investment in the bonds 
in the report earlier this month coelhos lawyer robert f 
bauer concluded that spiegels role in the transaction could not 
be considered a gift which would violate house rules because 
coelho paid him interest

troops on saturday shot and killed a guerrilla 
who opened fire from across the jordanisrael border and wounded 
two soldiers the army command said 
the attack occurred in a bushy area near the communal settlement 
of hamadiya 50 miles northeast of jerusalem the military command 
said 
an army patrol encountered light weapons fire from east of 
the fence between israel and jordan and returned fire the 
command said 
soldiers searched the area on the jordanian side of the border 
and found the body of a guerrilla dressed in a militarytype 
uniform and armed with a usmade m16 assault rifle an army 
spokesman said 
but in an official broadcast jordan said the man may have been 
a jordanian army soldier issa mahmoud ahmad who earlier 
disappeared from a border observation post 
it was the third infiltration or attack from jordan since may 
1988 
we have the impression that this is not a new step or a new 
direction maj gen amram mitzna the head of the israeli armys 
central command told israel radio we see that the jordanians 
are making every effort and use all means to keep this border 
secure and closed 
in previous cases mitzna said guerrillas sneaked by jordanian 
patrols this case is still unclear we dont know who this man 
is where he left from who sent him and how he came here 
the last raid across the jordanian border was on march 17 when 
two guerrillas ambushed an israeli frontier patrol killing one 
soldier and wounding another before escaping back to jordan 
the fatahuprising group a syrianbacked faction of the 
palestine liberation organization led by col said mousa claimed 
responsibility for the attack 
three arab guerrillas infiltrated israel from jordan on may 17 
1988 and one was killed in a firefight with israeli troops the 
others escaped

voodoo murder is usually the stuff of 
paperback novels and bgrade movies but its shaping up as the 
fare of a reallife court battle for two men accused of trying to 
use a hex to kill a judge 
they are ridiculous charges insists john henry adams 
charged along with his halfbrother leroy ivy with conspiracy to 
commit murder 
prosecutors arrested ivy on oct 14 1988 minutes after he paid 
100 for a faded photograph of circuit judge thomas gardner iii 
gardner had sentenced adams 25 to 40 years in the mississippi 
state penitentiary on an armed robbery charge a sentence that 
adams was serving at the time of the alleged plot 
authorities claim the brothers intended to send the picture and 
what was supposed to be a lock of gardners hair both purchased 
from undercover agents to a jamaican voodoo priest who would cast 
a death curse on the judge 
the brothers who have the same mother but different fathers 
have been jailed in tupelo awaiting trial on the charges unable to 
post 50000 bonds if convicted they could face sentences of up 
to 20 years in prison and fines of up to 500000 each 
their trial originally scheduled to begin friday has been 
delayed because it was assigned to gardner a new judge is to be 
appointed in the meantime adams and ivy who spoke during 
separate prison interviews said they are growing weary of the wait 
and sick of the attention their case has drawn 
im tired of this i want to know whats going on said the 
33yearold ivy theyve already ruined my life with all these 
allegations 
what makes this so interesting asked adams his lanky body 
thrown into a molded plastic chair in a jail corridor 
prosecutors will say little about the case 
i cant comment on the evidence or our trial plans said 
assistant district attorney rowland geddie jr prosecutors are 
expected however to argue that it makes no difference if the 
intended murder weapon was supernatural so long as the brothers 
intended to kill gardner 
the defense is expected to argue that the judges life was never 
in danger 
at the center of the case is the brothers alleged belief in 
voodoo which ivy flatly denies and adams will not directly discuss 
voodoo is a religion and i shouldnt comment on other peoples 
beliefs adams said a lot of people have made a joke out of 
this you shouldnt make a joke out of something you dont know 
anything about 
the brothers say they havent seen each other while theyve been 
in the lee county jail 
i aint seen my brother in eight months hes right down 
there ivy said gesturing toward one of two wings i sure would 
like to go down there and holler at him but i know that would be 
wrong and im not fixing to do nothing wrong 
he did not he insists do anything wrong when he purchased the 
picture of gardner from one of the judges employees adams takes 
the same position 
nobody can say that i told anybody that i was going to murder 
anybody adams said nobody can say that i told anybody that i 
was going to practice voodoo where did that idea come from 
what then did adams intend to do with the photo 
if i told you who would believe me he replied 
pressed on the subject he finally said he planned to put the 
picture on a punching bag he used for boxing at the prison that 
was all i could do with it he said 
ivy said he and his brother are being railroaded because they 
are black 
i live in the south and these white folks dont allow no black 
man to do nothing he said the justice system is not set up 
for a black man if a black man goes to court nine times out of 10 
hes going to be found guilty adams said he is eager to go to 
trial 
im glad this case is going to trial he said maybe the 
public will get a chance to see how the justice system is really 
run in lee county

bestselling author jeffrey archer said saturday 
the soviet union had offered real money for a western book for 
the first time paying him 10000 for his 1982 saga kane and 
abel 
archer said a similar soviet deal had been arranged for john le 
carres spy novel the russia house 
up to now the russians either stole your books or offered 
you rubles which you had to go to russia to be able to spend 
archer said 
but now in this latest example of glasnost soviet leader 
mikhail gorbachev has said that russian publishers have to pay 
proper prices if they want to be competitive he said 
archer claime both books were antirussian in the sense that 
le carres is about a spy in russia and mine is about a man who 
escapes from russia and makes good in the united states 
so they have had the courage not simply to pick books which 
automatically say what a wonderful country the soviet union is 
he said

their new shop is a boat 
the 32foot pizza tug o is due to make its maiden voyage 
tuesday it will ply the waters of southeastern alaska where 
almost every town is on its own island and pizza delivery was out 
of the question until helen and fred tallmadge decided that where 
theres a wave theres a way

years ago and never went back opened the first dominos pizza

later

approved it 
dominos claims to be the worlds largest pizza delivery company

floating one said spokeswoman moira mcdermott

most sixthgraders work on science 
projects but few receive the results 11 years later from 250 miles 
away 
barb spence formerly of battle creek was 12 years old in march 
1978 when she put a note into a baby food jar sealed it with black 
tape and threw the jar into the elkhorn river 
the note included instructions to contact her if the jar was 
found as part of her sixthgrade science project 
over the years miss spence grew up married and moved to 
tallahassee fla but the jar apparently continued its slow journey 
down the elkhorn into the platte river and finally the missouri 
river 
last month bill jeffrin of orrick mo found the jar almost 
hidden on a sandy shore of the missouri river southwest of kansas 
city the note inside was still legible so jeffrin contacted miss 
spences parents lyle and rosie spence of battle creek 
we couldnt imagine that the note had survived i thought it 
was a joke at first mrs spence said but mr jeffrin seemed 
so excited and sincere that we gave him barbs phone number 
at first mrs spence said her daughter thought jeffrin was 
pulling her leg but then the memory of the project came back 
she thought it was incredible to get the results of that 
project so many years later she was thrilled mrs spence said 
the find also surprised loren kment of norfolk the teacher who 
assigned the science project 11 years ago 
kment who is now an insurance salesman said the project was 
intended to combine a science lesson on river currents and an 
english lesson on communication 
its wonderful to realize that my lessons are still having an 
impact on the students even 11 years later he said

president bush and the heads of the 15 
other nato nations meet this week to mark the alliances 40th 
anniversary and set a course for future dealings with moscows 
unpredictable and popular leader mikhail gorbachev 
the east is turning toward the west and is opening up said 
manfred woerner secretary general of the north atlantic treaty 
organization we will not miss the opportunity 
a dispute over natos shortrange nuclear missiles threatened to 
undermine the show of unity but woerner said let me make it 
very clear that this summit is not a missile summit 
jaap de hoop scheffer the netherlands ambassador to nato said 
the allies need to agree on an overall strategy they cannot pursue 
completely independent eastern policies they have to do that in 
close contact and coordination he said 
but the strategy will likely contain few initiatives that will 
grab public attention in western europe as have gorbachevs 
peacemaking promises of major cuts in arms troops and defense 
spending 
bush in keeping with his cautious approach toward the soviets 
is weighing more moderate moves including a smaller us troop 
reduction in europe and a possible end to us economic sanctions 
against the soviets while less sweeping than gorbachevs 
proposals such moves would be likely to gain support in a europe 
hopeful for less combative eastwest relations 
i would not exclude the possibility that there will be some 
new ideas said woerner 
but alton keel the american ambassador to nato acknowledged 
its hard to match gorbachev in the public imagination 
especially in europe where his proposals have won him wide 
popularity 
the first of the nato leaders began arriving in brussels on 
saturday with bush to follow late sunday after his visit to italy 
prime ministers brian mulroney of canada and andreas papandreou of 
greece the latter accompanied by his muchphotographed mistress 
dimitra liana were among those arriving early for the twoday 
summit 
preparations leading up to the summit were dominated by the 
dispute between the united states and west germany over the future 
role of shortrange nuclear weapons in europe 
bonn would like to enter into early negotiations with the warsaw 
pact over reducing those weapons most of which are in west germany 
the united states and britain argue the alliance should focus 
its attention on cutting the easts superiority in conventional or 
nonnuclear weapons nato contends it needs a nuclear arsenal as a 
deterrent to balance the easts enormous stockpile of conventional 
arms 
the united states agreed last week to accept the principle of 
eventual talks on tactical nuclear arms but only with strict 
conditions 
american and british officials worry that entering into the 
negotiations would inevitably lead to a third zero the 
removal of all those forces from europe 
british prime minister margaret thatcher declared in a radio 
interview on the eve of the summit that if you reduce those 
missiles youre going for the jugular of nato 
a west german official meanwhile offered an assurance of 
cooperation we must not give the impression that the germans 
alone know the recipe for the future of western policies defense 
minister gerhard stoltenberg told the bild newspaper 
but west german chancellor helmut kohl on saturday ruled out 
postponing superpower talks on shortrange nuclear weapons into 
the distant future as a possible compromise in the dispute 
woerner said that despite the missile dispute the overall shape 
of nato policy is likely to remain the same the summit will 
culminate tuesday with the release of a document expected to 
reaffirm longstanding nato positions 
the main section of the document is tentatively called 
overcoming the division of europe said a senior nato official 
who spoke only on condition of anonymity 
a key point he said will be 
the alliance reaffirms that it will and must reintensify its 
own efforts to overcome the division of europe and to explore all 
available avenues of cooperation and dialogue with the east 
the document will refer to the efforts by 35 nations to improve 
personal freedoms and human rights and open up military matters in 
an effort to reduce tensions among the east and the west it will 
challenge the east to make further progress 
bush also was expected to discuss his recent open skies 
proposal the plan expanding on an initiative by president dwight 
d eisenhower calls for nato and the sovietled warsaw pact to 
permit unarmed aerial surveillance flights over their territory 
the nato official said the political document will spell out an 
action agenda of eight to 10 points for expanding eastwest 
contacts and cooperation 
the aim he said is to support and encourage those reforms 
which go our way which enhance pluralism and allow democratic 
structures to unfold better 
the document will also discuss relations among the western 
nations including burdensharing a shorthand term for the 
sticky question of whether the europeans are paying enough for 
their own defense and the united states too much 
a resolution of the dispute would show up in the comprehensive 
concept a blueprint for nato planning on arms control and force 
structures the document is nearly complete except for wording on 
the divisive issue 
nato members are canada the united states belgium britain 
denmark germany greece france iceland italy luxembourg the 
netherlands norway portugal spain and turkey

dudley brewster and his family are 
refugees from a disaster they were told would never happen 
they had been assured by officials that a devastating train 
wreck in their modest suburban neighborhood on may 12 posed no risk 
to a 14inch gasoline pipeline buried near the tracks 
the pipe had been inspected the trains would roll again 
everything was safe 
then thursday morning as brewster took a morning walk the 
familiar rumble of a freight train was followed by an unusual 
sight a geyser of gasoline spraying dozens of feet into the air 
suddenly a thunderous explosion rocked the neighborhood and 
flames engulfed everything brewster woke his wife and two sons 
ages 6 and 12 and tried to get to his truck in the garage but the 
flames beat them back they blindly ran into the street and 
sprinted to safety several blocks away 
the blast killed two people injured 31 and destroyed 10 homes 
it was less than two weeks after a runaway train plowed through 
homes across the street killing four people 
among the burned homes was the one rented by the brewsters 
all ive got left is a set of keys that dont go to 
anything brewster said 
he is not alone in his loss nor in his bitterness and fear the 
disasters have sent waves of anger apprehension and uncertainty 
through this bluecollar neighborhood of modern ranchstyle homes 
many of them only a few feet away from the train tracks 
counselors who were summoned to the neighborhood found adults 
and children alike who spoke as if they had just left a combat 
zone mental health workers said they expect many people to suffer 
the same longterm problems that afflict war veterans 
and everywhere in hospitals rescue shelters and hotel rooms 
people expressed a strong fear of returning to the old 
neighborhood certain that any assurances that the area is safe are 
nothing but lies 
they dont want to come back nobody wants to come back 
said san bernardino city councilwoman valerie popeludlam 
cita wilson 18 was sleeping thursday morning when she felt the 
rumble of what she assumed was a passing train a sensation that 
still jangled nerves among those who lived by the tracks 
this time she rolled over to go back to sleep but was pulled 
out of her slumber again by the shouts of her neighbor 
it felt like an earthquake said ms wilson who leaped for 
the door the whole neighborhood was orange and red thats all i 
saw i just went outside and ran i ran north i just kept 
running 
ms wilson was unharmed and her home escaped damage but like 
many people she doesnt want to go back to a neighborhood she 
hardly recognizes anymore 
duffy street in the heart of the damaged area resembles an 
eerie black moonscape covered with gutted cars charred trees 
blackened telephone poles and the skeletons of homes at one house 
all that remains of a garage is a small piece of wood holding a 
padlock at another home what once was a swimming pool is now a 
black pit 
when the train fell off the track i was there by myself 
ms wilson said when the explosion happened i was there by 
myself and now im afraid to be by myself 
counselors who have spoken to dozens of residents said ms 
wilsons feelings are common 
the train derailment alone had frightened many people out of 
returning to the neighborhood and many were skeptical of official 
assurances that the pipeline near the tracks would not be 
threatened by the resumption of rail traffic about 100 residents 
even hired an attorney who says he found evidence that the area was 
unsafe 
with the second disaster the fear of going home is overwhelming 
for many people said clinical psychologist patricia haire a roman 
catholic nun who met many residents at an evacuation center 
mental health workers are paying special attention to children 
at muscoy elementary school a memorial service for two students 
killed in the train derailment was postponed friday counselors 
came to classrooms asking students to write down their feelings 
and share their thoughts with friends and family 
the trauma will stay with people for some time said red 
cross psychologist sandra smith especially with the children it 
may pop up later down the line they could be skittish about an 
earthquake or any other thing like that it could even pop up in 
some nervousness in relationships 
it really is post traumatic stress syndrome the same thing 
you hear about all the time with vietnam veterans 
for some the anger and bitterness have overwhelmed any ties 
they may feel to the neighborhood 
all these people were saying it was safe to go back after the 
train accident brewster said now the red cross says its got 
another place for me a few blocks away i said uhuh no way 
were never going back

archaeologists have unearthed the 
goldstuffed tomb of two women in what appears to be the richest 
discovery ever made at ancient nimrud in northern iraq 
the 2700yearold tomb in the palace of king ashurnasirpal ii 
contained more than 55 pounds of gold jewelery including diadems 
necklaces earrings belts and anklets the englishlanguage 
baghdad observer reported friday 
the official iraqi news agency monitored in cyprus carried 
details of the newspaper report 
nimrud a sprawling site 250 miles north of baghdad was a major 
city of the assyrian empire that extended from the persian gulf to 
the mediterranean in the first millennium bc 
ashurnasirpal ii was a ruthless but brilliant military leader 
who built the vast palace at nimrud in the 9th century bc 
scores of iraqi and foreign archaeological teams have dug at 
nimrud in a centuryandahalf of excavations since british 
explorer henry layard uncovered huge stone sculptures and 
inscriptions there in the 1840s 
the explorers included british archaeologist max mallowan the 
husband of author agatha christie who excavated close to the newly 
found tomb between 1949 and 1958 
some of layards and mallowans finds are displayed in the 
british museum in london as well as in iraqs national museum in 
baghdad 
muzahem mahmoud the iraqi archaeologist who made the new 
discovery said an inscribed stone tablet found in the 
32by14foot burial chamber identified one of the women as yabaya 
of the assyrian royal court the newspaper reported 
the inscription in wedgeshaped cuneiform script also placed a 
curse on anyone who opened the tomb 
if anyone lays his hands on my tomb or opens my grave or 
steals my jewelery i pray to the gods of the nether world that his 
soul shall roam in the scorching sun after deathlet the ghost of 
insomnia take hold of him for ever and ever it said 
the other woman was identified only as a much younger person 
named taliya the newspaper said 
yabayas possessions included gold needles a bronze mirror with 
its enamel handle encrusted with precious stones and tiny tongs 
for applying kohl a dark eye makeup the paper said 
we found more than 100 earrings beside her skull some small 
some large she had all her personal belongings buried with her in 
the grave mahmoud said 
the report said that rich royal tombs had been unearthed at 
ashur another assyrian city but none contained as many precious 
objects as the nimrud grave 
it said that although the assyrian empire is welldocumented 
there are few references to the role of women at the royal court 
however queen semiramis is known to have ruled assyria for five 
years at the end of the 9th century bc

as president bush held presummit talks with italian 
leaders the white house said today the united states will not 
withdraw troops from europe without consulting its western allies 
there also were hints the united states might ease economic 
sanctions against the soviet union 
leaving the door open for troop reductions white house press 
secretary marlin fitzwater said the latest soviet proposal for 
reducing tanks and other conventional forces in europe presents 
some opportunities for the west 
fitzwater said bush will discuss conventional force levels with 
15 other allied leaders when a nato summit meeting begins in 
brussels on monday 
on three separate occasions today bush brushed aside reporters 
questions about whether he was planning to announce withdrawal of 
as many as 30000 troops from europe nearly 10 percent of the 
total stationed there 
bush held private talks with pope john paul ii at the vatican 
saturday evening afterwards the pontiff praised bush for 
combatting the moral crisis of drugs 
bush in turn spoke warmly of the popes efforts for world peace 
and said weve made progress in reducing armaments 
before the audience with the pope bush held talks at a 16th 
century hillside villa with italian premier ciriaco de mita and 
later conferred over lunch at the quirinale palace with president 
francesco cossiga 
fitzwater refused to discuss possible troop cutbacks but said 
the united states will not unilaterally withdraw troops from 
europe meaning that bush would consult first with its allies 
in brussels said fitzwater the president clearly will be 
discussing a number of ideas many of them have not been presented 
before he said he could not discuss details 
asked whether bush might be willing to ease economic sanctions 
that were imposed against the soviets in 1980 fitzwater pointedly 
noted that the soviet union has withdrawn its troops from 
afghanistan 
it was the soviet invasion of afghanistan in december 1979 that 
prompted the united states to impose a ban on technology transfers 
to moscow 
fitzwater said any action on lifting sanctions would depend on 
talks with us allies this is a matter we would have to 
discuss he said 
fitzwater left the door open for possible ussoviet talks on 
reducing american troop levels in europe until now the united 
states has been willing to talk only about nato and warsaw pact 
tanks artillery and other equipment but has ruled out direct 
negotiations over troop levels 
fitzwater said the soviets were coming around to nato 
thinking and that there was a different climate we find 
promising 
the washington times reported that bush planned to propose a 10 
percent cutback in american troop strength in europe which totals 
between 305000 and 325000 personnel 
the washington post quoted sources in todays editions as saying 
the administration is considering an offer to negotiate cuts in 
troop strength aircraft and helicopters in europe if the soviet 
union agrees to cuts in tanks armored personnel carriers and 
artillery pieces 
bush has been under intense pressure at home and abroad to reply 
to a series of disarmament proposals from moscow with some ideas of 
his own white house officials readily acknowledge that bush has 
seemed too negative while soviet president mikhail s gorbachev has 
been portrayed as a peacemaker 
there is pressure in congress for withdrawal of at least 8000 
troops to pull back americans whose jobs are eliminated by the 
1987 ussoviet treaty to destroy mediumrange nuclear missiles 
fitzwater said discussions about conventional arms troops 
tanks and nonnuclear artillery would be a major thrust of the 
discussions when bush attends a nato summit monday and tuesday 
with leaders of 15 other western nations 
any ideas in this area would be ones the president would want 
to discuss with the allies fitzwater said he would raise 
them with his partners at this session before he discusses 
anything publicly 
the nato meeting has been clouded by west german demands for 
washington and moscow to begin negotiations soon to reduce 
possibly eliminate shortrange nuclear missiles in central europe 
the united states and britain oppose such talks now because of 
the sovietled warsaw pacts superiority in tanks troops and other 
conventional weapons washington and london also fear the 
negotiations would ignite public pressure to eliminate the missiles 
entirely

cosmos 2021 became object no 
20000 in the us space commands space catalog this week 
the soviet satellite was logged into the catalog at 530 am 
wednesday the time of its launch 
the space commands surveillance center is tracking about 7000 
manufactured space objects but has cataloged every satellite or 
piece of junk larger than a softball in earth orbit since sputnik 
was launched on oct 4 1957 
the center has tracked a wrench and camera dropped by 
astronauts bits and pieces of exploded rocket bodies satellites 
and shuttles 
most of the 13000 objects that have fallen back toward earth 
burned up in the atmosphere 
but a few more notable objects such as the usbuilt skylab 
and the sovietbuilt cosmos 954 were too large to burn up and came 
crashing back to earth cosmos 954 and its nuclear reactor fell in 
northern canada in january 1978 skylab fell in australia and the 
indian ocean in july 1979 
the space surveillance center uses radar and optical tracking 
devices to keep track of the objects 
the information is used to ensure that the shuttle or other 
rockets depositing payloads in space dont run into objects in 
orbit or that a falling satellite isnt mistaken for a missile 
attack

communist maverick boris n yeltsin and other 
outspoken moscow reformers lost their bids today for seats on a new 
standing legislature and one suggested they join forces to fight 
the communist party 
yeltsin and other reformers were elected in march to the 
2250member congress of peoples deputies which in turn today 
chose the smaller fulltime supreme soviet and in doing so shut 
out many progressive candidates 
many party chiefs and top bureaucrats also faced stiff 
opposition from fellow congressmen but were elected to the supreme 
soviet the revamped lawmaking body that replaces the rubberstamp 
predecessor of the same name 
the deputies voted friday night from a ballot of 600 candidates 
all members of the congress to fill the 542member supreme 
soviet 
in the baltic delegations another hotbed of reform deputies 
nominated only as many candidates as they had seats and succeeded 
in electing a number of radical leaders to the supreme soviet 
yeltsin won a majority of the votes of his fellow deputies but 
ran last out of 12 candidates vying for 11 supreme soviet seats 
designated for the russian federation deputy yuri a osipyan 
chairman of the commission that counted the ballots overnight said 
yeltsin got 1185 votes in the congress of peoples deputies with 
964 members of the national congress voting against him 
yeltsin said he was saddened and upset by the results but 
pledged to continue his crusade indicating he might seek the vice 
presidency which also will be voted on by the congress 
i must fight to the end he told reporters he added that 
was his responsibility to the millions of muscovites who sent him 
to the congress i must fulfill their will and their orders i 
wouldnt throw away any job 
the antiestablishment yeltsin headed a list of vanquished 
moscowbased reformers and radicals including sociologist tatyana 
zaslavskaya economist gavril popov ilya zaslavsky an advocate 
for the handicapped historian sergei stankevich and biologist 
alexei yablokov 
in a nationally televised session held in the kremlim palace of 
congresses many deputies applauded in delight as osipyan announced 
the radicals defeat 
before the balloting some deputies complained the nominating 
procedure had been rigged to keep party and government officials in 
power 
we have formed a brezhnevstalin supreme soviet said 
progressive historian yuri afanasyev in dismay as election results 
were announced for the new 542seat legislature he called the 
results depressing 
popov declared the apparatus has undoubtedly won and called 
on progressive deputies from throughout the country to form an 
independent deputies group to fight communist party and state 
bureaucrats 
the apparatus clearly wants to get retaliation clearly wants 
to impose its own way at the congress popov charged he said 
deputies of a democratic orientation sought at first to work 
with fellow parliamentarians but that from the beginning our 
work has met with disbelief and prejudice 
in consequence a group of deputies considers it necessary to 
withdraw from the moscow delegation the economist announced 
we are going to form an independent deputies group and 
invite all deputies to join us 
if reformers unite it would be the first opposition faction in 
the congress where for decades the kremlin leadership has imposed 
its will unimpeded by opposition 
the deputies elected some more mainstream figures who proclaim 
support for gorbachevs program of perestroika or 
restructuring but who refrained at the congress from fiery 
rhetoric they included agriculture reform advocate alexei 
emelyanov izvestia editor ivan laptev soviet academy of sciences 
vice president yevgeny velikhov and independent historian roy 
medvedev 
the muscovites put up 55 candidates for the 29 seats allotted 
them defending the principle of multicandidate elections but 
ensuring some of their number would be defeated many oldstyle 
candidates including former cosmonaut svetlana savitskaya beat 
out the reformers 
yeltsin lost his job as moscow party boss in november 1987 after 
he criticized the slow pace of president mikhail s gorbachevs 
reforms and suggested it was time for a multiparty system to end 
the communists legal monopoly on power 
in his congressional campaign he attacked official privilege and 
called for a better life for average soviets and won nearly 90 
percent of the vote 
yeltsin and the other deputies from moscow drafted their own 
congressional agenda including radical measures to revive the 
shortageridden soviet economy but the congress rejected any move 
to alter the agenda 
in the supreme soviet vote vitaly i vorotnikov the only 
member of the ruling communist party politburo to stand as a 
candidate met with stiff opposition with 761 deputies voting 
against him his 1388 votes however were enough for him to 
outpoll yeltsin and be elected 
valentin falin head of the partys policymaking central 
committees international department was opposed by 373 deputies 
and alexander kapto chief of the partys ideological department 
got 282 no votes

a delegation from the organization of 
american states left panama on saturday after four days of futile 
talks aimed at finding a solution to panamas political crisis 
the delegates indicated they would ask that another oas mission 
travel to panama soon for additional talks with gen manuel antonio 
noriega and the political forces trying to oust him 
noriega who blames the united states for panamas troubles 
told the mission it was up to the political parties to sit down and 
negotiate opposition leaders insisted noriega must negotiate 
because he is the real power in panama 
there are complex problems and deep emotions involved in the 
panamanian situation said diego cordovez ecuadoran foreign 
minister and member of the fourman delegation 
we have promoted communication between the different political 
sectors cordovez said we have fullfilled our mandate 
he said the mission met with government and opposition leaders 
as well as roman catholic church officials and other groups and 
made them all aware of the different points of view 
unfortunately there has been no progress for the good of 
panama said guillermo endara the oppositions presidential 
candidate in may 7 elections 
the two sides have to start talking noriega said they 
both claim they won 
the oas sent the mission headed by secretarygeneral joao baena 
soares to seek a solution to the impasse created by the annullment 
of the elections international observers say noriegas handpicked 
candidate carlos duque lost to endara 
the panamanian government claimed the united states interfered 
openly in favor of the opposition by providing financial assistance 
and by repeatedly calling for the ouster of noriega the defense 
forces chief and the power behind the government 
washington obtained a public condemnation of noriega from the 
oas which also blamed noriega for postelection violence 
including attacks on the opposition candidates 
the oas delegates will submit a full report on their mission to 
the oas which must decide what to do next 
noriega has been indicted in the united states on drug 
trafficking charges but he denies the allegations and says 
washington wants him out of power so it can renege on the panama 
canal treaties 
under those treaties the united states must hand over control 
of the panama canal by the year 2000

a group of nostalgic illinoisans with 
fond memories of twolane blacktops and cruising on country roads 
are trying to rally support for the historical preservation of a 
highway 
but theyre not trying to save just any piece of asphalt with 
white lines and gravel shoulders 
this group wants to preserve and commemorate the legendary us 
route 66 which was wiped off illinois maps in 1976 upon completion 
of interstate 55 and erased nationwide in 1985 more than half of 
the old roadway is gone while other pieces exist as local 
stretches of road 
youd be surprised how many people have a love affair with 
that old road said mike yates one of the groups leaders but 
theres a lot of people out there who have strong feelings about 
route 66 and what it represents 
to yates and about 35 other people scattered around the state 
route 66 represents a bygone era of small towns bustling with 
business created by travelers funneled down main street by the 
nations highways 
many people associated route 66 with freedom opportunity 
adventure and romance said another organizer tom teague of 
springfield it was the epitome of the open road 
yates fondly remembers small motels roadside hamburger joints 
shadetree mechanics and others who made a living in rural america 
thanks to highway traffic 
route 66 really was main street usa yates said it 
was the mother road as steinbeck called it that carried people 
west from chicago to all the way to the shores of the pacific ocean 
at santa monica calif it was an important road for americans 
traveling by car 
according to the book route 66 a photographic essay route 
66 was formed in 1926 when 2448 miles of existing and new roads 
were connected to establish a link between chicago and the west 
coast 
it was dubbed the gateway to the west and linked eight 
states and such cities as st louis tulsa okla and oklahoma 
city amarillo texas albuquerque nm and flagstaff ariz on 
its way to the los angeles basin 
i remember driving on route 66 near springfield a few years 
ago teague said the road was dipping and curving in 
topographical rhythm it caressed the geography instead of bulling 
it over like the interstates do route 66 had character 
the popular song about route 66 oklahoma city looks oh so 
pretty get your kicks on route 66 added to its appeal as 
did the 1960s television show featuring two men in a sports car who 
experience carefree adventures on route 66 
thats always been in the back of my mind just taking off 
down the highway yates said thats part of the attraction 
yates and teague are trying to form a route 66 association of 
illinois two preliminary meetings have attracted three dozen 
people interested in preserving and enjoying the estimated 1000 
miles of remaining highway 
they are supporting a resolution before congress to authorize a 
study of the feasibility of preserving whats left of the road and 
naming it a national scenic highway and teague wants illinois 
lawmakers to follow the example of their arizona counterparts who 
rededicated a 158mile stretch of the old route 66 in 1988 
they wrote a song about this road and sang you can get your 
kicks on route 66 i cant imagine anyone singing you can shuck 
and jive on i55 it just doesnt have the same appeal teague 
said

military spending in western countries grew 
faster than their economies as a whole in the first half of the 
1980s according to a study based on us statistics 
it was done by michael renner of west germany for worldwatch 
institute a washington body financed by private foundations and 
united nations 
the study says the information is based on a handbook of 
statistics issued by the cia and a booklet of the us arms control 
and disarmament agency called world military expenditures and 
arms transfers 
a table shows that after a drop in the 1970s military spending 
between 1980 and 1985 grew by an average of 57 percent a year in 
the western industrial countries their gross national products 
meanwhile grew by an average 22 percent annually 
in the centrally planned economies that is countries 
under communist rule the total growth was an average 17 percent 
and military spending grew even more slowly 13 percent on 
average 
the same pattern is reported for third world countries in which 
china is included total average growth of 31 percent and average 
growth of military spending 21 percent 
however the study cautions that estimates for centrally 
planned economies are likely to have a wide margin of error 
for the third world it quotes figures from the world bank to 
show that 20 out of 36 countries increased the amount of production 
they devoted to military production between 1972 and 1986 all but 
three the philippines singapore and south korea reduced the 
proportion of their spending that went for health or education or 
both 
renner cites another private study as saying that if the third 
world countries oilproducers excepted had bought no arms 
between 1972 and 1982 they would have had debts that were 20 
percent to 25 percent smaller 
he said in an interview that he believes the same trend has 
continued in more recent years the united states and other 
creditor countries are working now to reduce third world debt 
estimated at 12 trillion under a plan proposed by treasury 
secretary nicholas f brady 
titled national security the economic and environmental 
dimensions the study argues that the true threat to security 
comes from damage to the environment rather than from possible 
military attack 
future generations may regard our recent obsession with 
national security maintained by force of arms as a curious 
historical diversion that distracted our energies from the most 
basic threats to human society it concludes

an armenian activist who was jailed late last year 
after widespread unrest in the southern caucasus region has been 
released at the urging of a communist party leader journalists and 
activists said saturday 
the release of khachik stamboltsian head of an armenian charity 
group fueled speculation that moscow may soon free 13 other 
leaders of the armenian protest movement that has been at the 
center of the unrest 
a journalist at armenpress the local news agency said 
stamboltsians return to yerevan the armenian capital led to the 
cancellation of scattered strikes called to protest the detention 
of the activists 
the journalist who requested anonymity said in a telephone 
inteview that stamboltsian was freed after armenian party chief 
suren arutyunyan asked the national prosecutor to show humanity 
toward the detained activist 
the first response was khachiks release said yerevan 
activist hovik vassilian and now there are rumors that either 
all the rest are out or they soon will be he said in a 
telephone interview 
authorities had been holding at least 14 people 11 of them 
members of the karabakh committee that spearheaded demonstrations 
and strikes in a jurisdictional dispute touched off by ethnic 
friction 
the karabakh committee last year launched a campaign for armenia 
to annex the nagornokarabakh region where threequarters of the 
162000 inhabitants are ethnic armenians nagornokarabakh is part 
of the republic of azerbaijan 
the kremlin rejected the unification demand putting 
nagornokarabakh under moscows direct control instead and jailing 
the committee members 
the armenian drive to annex nagornokarabakh launched in 
february 1988 led to ethnic strife between predominantly christian 
armenians and mostly moslem azerbaijanis in which more than 90 
people were killed last year

missouris richard gephardt began campaigning 
for house majority leader saturday one day after democratic whip 
tony coelho of california dropped plans to run and said he would 
resign his seat in congress congressional sources said 
gephardts bid for the no2 spot in the leadership marked the 
latest development in an increasingly complex scramble among 
democrats set off by the expected resignation of house speaker jim 
wright dtexas 
gephardt was an unsuccessful candidate for the democratic 
presidential nomination a year ago his race for majority leader 
means he will unequivocally abandon any plans for a white house 
bid in 1992 said a source close to the missouri lawmaker 
the missourian has an unblemished record on ethical matters a 
major plus in the wake of financial controversies that have caused 
coelho to resign and brought wright to the brink of leaving the 
speakers chair 
the seventerm st louis lawmaker had been lobbied hard last 
week by some democrats to run for majority leader but he chose not 
to challenge coelho a friend and political ally 
with tony getting out and people persuading him to run for it 
he made the decision that he would run for majority leader a 
democratic congressional source said 
majority leader tom foley dwash is expected to become 
speaker if wright resigns next week with coelho out of the line of 
succession the field is open for the no 2 and no 3 leadership 
posts 
on saturday gephardt was in his capitol hill office calling 
colleagues to seek their support for his leadership bid his 
supporters said he would be the frontrunner even if challenged by 
others 
if gephardt gets into it my feeling is he is the next 
majority leader said rep dan glickman dkan who had not 
talked with gephardt about the race 
gephardts decision did not daunt at least one other lawmaker 
who already is running for majority leader rep ed jenkins dga 
who began campaigning last week said saturday he remains in the 
race 
it ws unclear whether gephardts candidacy would dissuade others 
from entering the race for majority leader 
jenkins and gephardt serve on the taxwriting house ways and 
means committee 
gephardts partisans say he would provide democrats with a 
youthful highprofile leader who could burnish the party image in 
the wake of wrights ethical problems the 48yearold congressman 
is viewed by supporters as squeaky clean having survived media 
scrutiny in 1988 
he also has earned a reputation as an effective televisionage 
advocate of tax overhaul and a gettough trade policy which was 
the centerpiece of his presidential campaign 
until the disclosure that coelho was stepping down from the 
house gephardt was considering a run for the no3 post of whip 
coelho was a key early supporter of gephardts unsuccessful 1988 
bid for the democratic presidential nomination and the missouri 
lawmaker reportedly did not want to damage his friendship with 
coelho 
but that changed friday night when gephardt learned of coelhos 
resignation from news accounts gephardt had met earlier friday 
with coelho and was stunned when he found out later that his friend 
was leaving congress according to a congressional source with 
close ties to gephardt

palestinians who lost 
relatives in the antiisraeli uprising met saturday with israeli 
peace activists and some warned that arabs might take up arms 
unless israel agrees to talk peace with the plo 
in the occupied territories troops wounded seven palestinians 
in scattered stonethrowing clashes arab hospital officials 
reported 
in three villages and a refugee camp in the west bank about 
3000 israeli activists from the peace now movement met with arabs 
who have lost family members in the 17monthold uprising soldiers 
watched the gatherings from afar without intervening 
leaders of the 70000 jewish settlers living in the occupied 
west bank and gaza strip condemned the meetings 
in the west bank village of nahalin 200 palestinian men women 
and children greeted the israelis 
i stand here and greet you because we need peace said 
mohammed attiyah whose 22yearold son subhi was shot and killed 
in a raid last month that left five palestinians dead and 18 
injured 
palestinians warned that uprising activists were inclined to use 
weapons against the army if israel persisted in its refusal to talk 
peace with the palestine liberation organization which the 
government considers a terrorist organization 
the people with weapons are beginning to wake up said 
village leader abu khalid we must warn that a true revolution is 
possible if we do not achieve our rights 
we must remind the israeli government that the palestinian 
nation has its roots here and there must be peace with our sole 
legitimate representative the plo khalid said 
last week a soldier was killed and three palestinians wounded 
in the first gun battle between israeli troops and arab activists

powerful currents that collapsed and swallowed 
a temporary onelane bridge over the great miami river prevented 
authorities from finding any victims or their vehicles on saturday 
the american red cross said seven people remained unaccounted 
for but there was no way to know how many of them might have been 
on the bridge when it fell into the river friday evening 
authorities said efforts to find them could be thwarted for at 
least several days by the rushing muddy water 
officials are uncertain how many vehicles plunged into the river 
when a 100foot section of the bridge collapsed eyewitness 
accounts differed but authorities believed at least two vehicles 
were on the bridge section when it gave out the number of 
passengers aboard was unclear 
we still have no idea said capt arthur reid of the 
hamilton county sheriffs department 
the river a tributary of the ohio river jumped its banks 
friday following heavy overnight rains that took two lives 
elsewhere in ohio and caused hundreds of thousands of dollars of 
damage in illinois 
county engineers said the bridge was ordered closed a few 
minutes before the collapse because of the danger from debris 
pinned against it but the order had not been carried out when the 
bridge collapsed 
the river was searched saturday by helicopter but no trace of 
vehicles or victims was found authorities tried to use an 
airsupported boat but without success 
the river crested early saturday at about 24 feet eight feet 
over flood stage 
now its just a matter of time before it starts receding 
reid said 
the fastflowing river littered with trees tires and other 
debris left searchers virtually helpless reid said recovery 
efforts will be stalled until the waters subside 
you cant even put divers out its too dangerous reid 
said our boats cant handle the swift currents 
the bridge collapsed at miamitown a town of 700 people about 
seven miles from cincinnati on the western side of hamilton county 
dozens of people gathered at the ends of the bridge saturday 
craning their necks to see the missing section 
chaplains from the sheriffs department were at the scene in 
case counseling was needed but the rev bruno kremp said there 
wasnt much for them to do because of the lingering uncertainty 
over the victims identities 
the onelane temporary bridge has been in use for only a few 
months it was erected last year to keep traffic flowing while a 
94yearold bridge is torn down and rebuilt a few feet to the 
south traffic lights at either end of the 300foot temporary 
bridge regulated traffic over the narrow span 
the countys chief engineer william brayshaw said he ordered 
the bridge closed friday immediately after the bridge contractor 
national engineering co of strongsville ohio told him that the 
debrischoked river posed a danger to the span the collapse 
occurred before workers could reach it and set up barricades 
the car in front of us just dropped straight down said 
sharon boebinger who was waiting to cross the bridge when it 
collapsed i said oh my god i put it in reverse and backed 
up i didnt feel the bridge shake at all it just happened in an 
instant 
floods caused by heavy thunderstorms elsewhere in ohio were 
blamed for the deaths of a 20monthold boy who drowned after 
falling into a swollen creek near his grandmothers home and a 
24yearold fostoria woman whose car was washed into a river

rep tony coelho the no 3 democrat in the 
house said saturday he will resign from congress to spare himself 
and his party the ordeal of a protracted ethics investigation like 
the one that torched the career of speaker jim wright 
the surprise announcement means house democrats could be 
installing a totally revamped leadership team by the end of next 
week with thomas s foley of washington the likely new speaker and 
several candidates vying for the next two posts of majority leader 
and majority whip 
the end appeared near to wrights 2year reign as speaker and 
perhaps his 34year career in the house because of charges 
brought by the house ethics committee 
the texas democrat stands accused of arranging bulk sales of his 
book as a way to evade house limits on outside income and of taking 
gifts from a developer friend with an interest in legislation 
wrights lawyers failed last week in an attempt to convince the 
house ethics committee to drop at least some of the charges in 
exchange for the speakers resignation he was in seclusion this 
weekend and the house leadership was preparing for him to deliver 
a resignation speech wednesday 
coelho the current whip began running for the post of majority 
leader last week when it became known that wright was thinking 
about quitting 
however coelho was coming under increasing scrutiny because of 
his business dealings including a deal where a california 
savingsandloan official arranged and helped finance a junk bond 
investment 
a newspaper reported that a federal investigation had begun and 
on friday common cause the group that lobbies for stricter 
government ethics called on the house ethics committee to 
investigate coelhos finances 
i have simply spent too much time building the party and 
trying to help people to have my attention or abilities devoted to 
such distractions coelho said in a resignation statement that 
called the charges needless and baseless 
coelho said his colleagues had expressed confidence in him and 
he would have won the majority leaders race 
undoubtedly some will think this decision was motivated by 
weakness in my political standing or my legal position they are 
entitled to their opinion but they are wrong he said 
coelhos statement made available to news organizations made 
no mention of it but several legislators said privately that he 
had been admonished by others not to run for higher leadership he 
would become more of a target and further injure the party 
structure already reeling because of wrights travails they said 
coelho himself remained out of public view on saturday his 
statement said the resignation is effective june 15 his 47th 
birthday 
even before coelho dropped out rep richard gephardt of 
missouri was being urged to challenge for the majority leaders 
post with his friend coelho out of the race gephardt began his 
campaign in earnest on saturday 
gephardt said he was stunned by coelhos decision and 
praised the california congressman as an extraordinarily able and 
effective leader 
gephardt gave up a job in the democratic leadership to run for 
president in 1988 he is now promising colleagues he will not run 
for president in 1992 if he wins the majority leaders job 
rep ed jenkins dga began campaigning for leader last week 
as an alternative to coelho and said saturday he was still in the 
running 
jenkins declined to handicap his race against gephardt but said 
many members saw a need to bring some new blood maybe outside 
the established leadership group into the game for the good of 
the party and of the institution 
jenkins has support from rep dan rostenkowski dill the 
powerful chairman of the house ways and means committee 
at least a threeway race was under way for the whips post 
between beryl anthony dark who holds coelhos former post as 
chairman of the democratic congressional campaign committee rep 
david bonior dmich the chief deputy whip and william h gray 
iii dpa chairman of the house democratic caucus 
the election for speaker would be held immediately if wright 
were to leave because the house cannot function with that 
constitutionallymandated job vacant the other party positions 
could be elected at the same time or at a later date but the 
democrats were expected to get it all taken care of in no more than 
a week or two 
anthony said the resignations and the ensuing shakeup will make 
the party look bad in the near term weve got a problem of 
public perception he said 
but he said the spotlight shifts to the republicans soon 
because one of their leaders rep newt gingrich rga is the 
subject of a complaint before the ethics committee 
on the other hand the house gop which has largely sat on the 
sidelines during wrights travails lest the ethics probe be seen as 
a partisan vendetta may become more aggressive 
republicans are likely to redouble their emphasis on 
institutional changes including pressing for campaign reform and 
tougher ethics standards that would enable them to keep political 
pressure on the democrats by keeping the ethics issue alive without 
appearing to be attacking individual personalities

secretary of state james a baker iii on saturday and pledged anew 
to end white domination of blacks in his country 
baker and botha also discussed a planned visit to washington by 
fw deklerk the leader of south africas governing national party 
and the man expected to become the countrys president later this 
year 
baker in a brief exchange with reporters after the meeting 
ssid botha had indicated to us it is the intention of the south 
african government to abolish the system of apartheid and we were 
pleased to hear that 
botha concurred we are in the process of reform and we are 
dismantling apartheid and we accept that white domination must 
end both said 
he said the decision was taken by the south african government 
for its own policy reasons and not in response to outside pressures 
its going to be done in consultation with black leaders 
botha said 
later the white house issued a statement saying botha had told 
baker his party would campaign for the south african presidency 
with the view that the days of white domination are over 
the statement said baker raised questions about denial of human 
and civil rights of black south africans individual cases of 
detention and restrictions on freedom of travel 
the secretary said that the us government intended to engage 
with a full range of black and white south africans in an effort to 
work towards the goal of producing peaceful abolition of 
apartheid the statement added 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said that in view of the 
government changes coming up in south africa baker had taken 
this opportunity to explore any possible changes that might be 
taking place in the policies of that government at this time 
the invitation to de klerk who would be the first top south 
african leader to visit washington in 30 years and a meeting bush 
had earlier this month with antiapartheid leaders are part of a 
us initiative to increase contacts with south africa 
the united states also appears to be seeking to keep up with the 
soviet union which has been meeting with south african activists 
across the political spectrum 
assistant secretary of state herman cohen was scheduled to meet 
in rome with his soviet counterpart this weekend to discuss the 
south african changes and other developments

shame on you strikers yell at patrons 
entering and leaving tavern on the green one of americas 
bestknown restaurants 
please help us or we will die the restaurant management 
pleads in a newspaper advertisement aimed at potential patrons of 
central parks toniest dining spot 
the monthlong strike at tavern on the green may not rival the 
eastern airlines strike in size or impact on the public but the 
two sides in the restaurant battle yield to no one in rhetoric or 
passion 
each side accuses the other of lying in the advertisement 
manager warner leroy calls the restaurants workers among the 
highest paid in the restaurant world 
they are not even the highestpaid in a square mile of his 
restaurant snaps back john turchiano a spokesman for local 6 of 
the hotelmotel trades council 
but while business is down and leroy admits losing millions of 
dollars business lunchers and outoftowners continue to come for 
the clubby atmosphere creme brulee red snapper and sunday brunch 
best reception i ever got joked one businesssuited man 
friday after passing through the shame on you chants 
its very annoying them yelling at you said mary wieland 
of lancaster pa who was lunching with friends but she added 
i wanted to eat at tavern on the green 
management claims tavern on the greens workers are among the 
bestpaid in the business with a base pay of 18830 for 
dishwashers the lowestpaid workers at the restaurant waiters 
make 260 an hour plus tips bringing their total wages to 39000 
to 45000 a year management says 
turchiano disputes those figures saying dishwashers who work 
fiveday 40hour weeks make 8320 a year and that while some 
waiters make 40000 annually most earn between 17000 and 
19000 a year 
the union has rejected a 214 percent increase saying workers 
need 40 percent more for dishwashers to rise to the level of 
workers at comparable restaurants 
the two sides also disagree about heath care benefits and work 
conditions 
the union has been trying to negotiate a contract with leroy 
since january and mounted an informational picket line on april 23 
the strike began april 30 when leroy fired workers en masse for 
holding a meeting on restaurant premises 
details of the incident are murky management says there was a 
partial walkout by 11 employees the union says 200 workers called 
an impromptu meeting 
in any event some workers walked out and were barred from 
returning most of the rest refused to work and were fired 
the restaurant management has since hired replacement workers 
and claims to have a full complement of 430 workers the union says 
275 of its members are on strike and 10 have remained on the job 
turchiano accused leroy of spending a fortune to keep the 
workers from getting a decent contract 
leroy said he plans to fight even more fiercely he said he will 
file a lawsuit wednesday alleging libel slander and interference 
with business 
this is a very rough union playing dirty and telling lies 
leroy said im a good employer and i have good employees this 
is a crazy situation 
he knows how to entertain shot back steve palozzi a 
striking waiter but he doesnt know how to take care of his 
workers

president bush announced saturday night that 
italians soon will be able to visit the united states without 
obtaining visas 
bush announced this step at a blacktie dinner with italian 
prime minister ciriaco de mita and won immediate applause from the 
audience 
in the future italians who wish to visit our country whether 
as tourists or on business will no longer need to apply for visas 
and we look forward to that day bush said 
the italians will join british and japanese citizens under a 
special program giving them the privilege of entering the united 
states without the usual document required in addition to a 
passport 
a white house fact sheet said the step was taken as part of a 
threeyear test program mandated by an immigration law to waive 
temporary visitor visas under certain conditions 
the countries are selected by the secretary of state and the 
attorney general on the basis of which countries have the highest 
volume of nonimmigrant visa issuance and which offer reciprocal 
treatment of american travelers 
the program intended to promote tourism and reduce visa 
processing costs was instituted in britain and japan in 1988 
it allows visitors from these countries to enter the united 
states without a visa for up to 90 days for tourism or business

prime minister noboru takeshita has chosen foreign 
minister sousuke uno to succeed him and the change of power may 
come next week news reports said sunday 
nearly all major japanese media carried reports that uno is 
likely to become japans next prime minister when takeshita resigns 
after 18 months in office because of a huge bribery scandal 
in a meeting saturday with shintaro abe the no 2 man in the 
governing party takeshita indicated that uno was his choice as 
successor the japan broadcasting corp and kyodo news service 
reported 
the prime minister said he would seek a consensus on unos 
selection as party head from other party leaders next week the 
reports said 
the head of the governing party routinely becomes prime minister 
because of the liberal democrats large majority in parliament 
uno 66 told reporters that he had not yet been asked 
officially to take the post and said it was too early to 
comment on whether he would accept 
kyodo news service quoted takeshita as saying you should keep 
around june 2 in mind for the change in administrations 
party leaders said uno emerged as the top contender after talks 
friday between takeshita and masayoshi ito chairman of the partys 
policymaking executive council according to reports in the 
nationally circulated asahi yomiuri and mainichi newspapers 
ito 76 refused may 13 to take the top job citing his age and 
poor health his refusal eliminated the only strong candidate in a 
governing party desperate for a leader with a reputation clean 
enough to steer it out of the scandal before elections for half the 
seats in the upper house in july 
uno said he would leave as scheduled sunday for paris where he 
is to attend a meeting of the organization for economic cooperation 
and development he is due to return june 4 but officials said he 
would return immediately if the cabinet is dissolved before then 
party leaders reportedly favor uno because he is untainted by 
the recruit bribery scandal that has led to more than a dozen 
arrests and because he is experienced in foreign affairs and 
therefore capable of leading the japanese delegation at the july 
summit of industrialized nations 
uno told reporters saturday that he believed that extensive 
political reforms were needed to deal with the recruit scandal 
the recruit co the publishing and information services 
conglomerate at the center of the scandal is accused of trying to 
influence government policy by selling underpriced unlisted shares 
in a real estate subsidiary and by doling out millions of dollars 
in political donations 
in addition to forcing takeshitas resignation the scandal has 
led to the downfall of three cabinet ministers and the arrest of a 
former chief cabinet secretary 
in the meeting with ito on friday takeshita agreed to stay on 
as prime minister until a successor was found although on april 25 
he vowed to leave office when the years budget cleared parliament 
the 431 billion budget officially took effect sunday despite an 
opposition boycott that blocked debate on the spending bill in the 
upper house under japanese law the budget automatically becomes 
law 30 days after being passed by the lower house even if the upper 
chamber fails to act on it

jim wright chuckled when it was first 
suggested that the house of representatives which had elected him 
speaker just a year earlier investigate his ethics 
i dont think it really warrants too much of an answer 
wright told reporters on dec 15 1987 the day rep newt gingrich 
called for a formal inquiry into what he called the corrupt and 
blatantly unethical behavior of the veteran texas democrat 
the chuckles have turned to anguish 
the house took the proposal more seriously than wright did it 
has driven the 48th speaker to the brink of resignation which 
leadership sources say could come as early as wednesday 
as for gingrich the georgia republican is now his partys house 
whip the secondranking officer in the gop leadership 
stories about wrights financial connections in texas began to 
appear within six months after his election in december 1986 to 
succeed thomas p tip oneill jr as speaker 
the new york times and newsweek magazine reported in june 1987 
that wright had intervened with edwin j gray chairman of the 
federal home loan bank board on behalf of a savings and loan 
executive who had been a longtime political supporter and whose sampl 
activities were under board scrutiny at the time 
the board confirmed that gray had held a lengthy meeting with 
the executive at wrights urging wrights office said wright 
merely encouraged him to make sure his agency was being fair 
then in september the washington post reported that wright was 
receiving book royalties of 55 percent five times higher than 
those normally given to authors from a friends company that 
received 265000 from his 1986 campaign wright defended the deal 
saying it had been profitable both to him and to his publisher 
other news reports raised questions about wrights efforts to 
secure federal grants for a multimilliondollar historical 
renovation of the fort worth stockyards in which his business 
partner george mallick was involved 
tired of answering questions wright announced on oct 16 that 
he was putting his assets in a blind trust 
meanwhile the new speaker was raising hackles on the republican 
side of the house 
during a close vote on a democratic deficitcutting bill wright 
stopped the clock for nearly 10 minutes while finding a member 
to switch votes so the democratic leadership could avoid defeat he 
joked about it as his hidden ball play but angry house 
republicans created a 14member panel to seek ways to deal with the 
crafty texan 
with tip there was warmth and affection said thenrep 
richard cheney rwyo now secretary of defense there are no 
such feelings for jim wright 
rep trent lott of mississippi then the gop whip and now a 
senator said the house was being run by jim wright and his 
goons 
on may 18 1988 just over a year ago president fred 
wertheimer of common cause a liberalleaning public interest 
lobby announced that his group would ask the house ethics 
committee to investigate whether wright had violated 
conflictofinterest rules 
republicans said the announcement took much of the steam out of 
charges that the demands for an investigation were just a political 
vendetta 
having common cause come out changed the whole dynamics and 
legitimized the issue said gingrich 
on may 26 gingrich and 71 house republicans formally asked for 
an ethics committee investigation wright promised cooperation and 
said he was sure he had violated no rules 
on june 10 the six democrats and six republicans on the 
committee voted unanimously to conduct a preliminary inquiry of the 
royalty arrangement for the book wrights use of public funds to 
compensate an aide who worked on the book his dealings with the 
federal home loan bank board in the savings and loan case his 
lobbying efforts for a constituent with whom he had an interest in 
a gas well his intervention on behalf of texas oil amp gas co with 
the interior department and his use of a condominium in fort worth 
provided by mallick 
more allegations came along a longtime friend said he paid 
wright 5000 for copies of his book as a legal way to get around 
federal limits on campaign contributions wright listed more people 
who bought bulk copies including a washington lobbyist a boston 
insurance company and a fellow congressman records showed that 
wright had funneled more than 50000 in business from his 
congressional office to the printer who paid him his royalties 
wright acknowledged selling 504 copies of the book to a texas 
university instead of accepting a 3000 speaking fee that would 
have violated house rules 
on july 26 the committee named chicago attorney richard j 
phelan to investigate saying an outside counsel was needed to 
assure a fair and objective probe 
on sept 14 wright testified for 5 hours in closed session and 
told reporters he believed he would be exonerated 
in november phelan subpoenaed records on work that wrights 
wife betty did for mallightco the partnership formed by wright 
and mallick and their wives until 1984 she had been paid 18000 
a year as an advisor to the investment venture 
when congress reconvened jan 3 wright was reelected speaker 
and pledged a spirit of bipartisanship 
a month later he was in new political hot water over what 
critics called his awkward handling of a proposed congressional pay 
raise which failed after wright sought to have it approved without 
a house vote 
on feb 21 phelan submitted his final report to the house 
committee 
on april 13 amid reports that the panel was about to conclude 
it had found reason to believe that he violated house rules wright 
made an emotional defense of his conduct and his wifes in a 
30minute appearance before television cameras he declined to 
answer questions 
four days later the committee formally charged the speaker with 
69 violations of the chambers rules including what rep julian 
dixon dcalif the committee chairman called a scheme to 
evade limits on outside income through sales of the book the 
most serious allegation stemmed from the committees conclusion 
that mallick from whom wright had accepted 145000 in what the 
committee viewed as gifts over a 10year period had a direct 
interest in legislation 
in a halfhour speech to a closed democratic caucus on april 18 
wright acknowledged that he may have made some mistakes in my 
life but vowed to fight the charges and win 
and in a speech in fort worth on may 5 he said that the most 
unethical behavior i have witnessed is that of those who for their 
own ravening ambitions attempt to destroy the personal reputations 
of political opponents 
on may 9 he lashed out at phelan accusing the outside counsel 
of lack of professionalism and prevalence of distortion and 
inaccuracy in his report the next day the justice department 
announced it would review wrights conduct after the house 
investigation was completed 
house republican leader bob michel said wrights problems had 
contributed to a state of suspended animation in congress but 
the democratic leader rep thomas foley of washington said the 
speaker was still fully involved 
by may 18 wrights support in the house was eroding as even his 
supporters talked of easing him from his post its time for a 
leadership change said indiana democrat phil sharp 
the committee opened public hearings on may 23 with wrights 
lawyer stephen susman urging the panel to stand in the way of a 
lynch mob and dismiss the most serious charges against the 
speaker 
susmans arguments failed to move the committee after a day of 
fruitless negotiations friends of wright said thursday the speaker 
had decided to resign from congress 
i earnestly believe that i have committed no serious wrong

soviet spy ships are eavesdropping off the 
west coast about two out of every three days a sharp increase over 
the past two years a newspaper reported saturday 
in the early and mid1980s such soviet monitoring occurred on 
fewer than one out of 10 days said adm david e jeremiah 
commander of the us pacific fleet 
since 1987 specially designed soviet vessels called auxiliary 
general intelligence ships have been found two out of every three 
days just beyond the 12mile territorial limit that marks the 
united states offshore boundary the los angeles times reported in 
saturdays editions 
there has been a significant increase in soviet agi activity 
in the pacific area since 1986 said lt cmdr robert anderson a 
spokesman for the pacific fleet in pearl harbor hawaii 
this intelligence collection activity has included an 
increased presence off the us west coast especially off of 
southern california and the hawaiian islands anderson said 
the increased activity has left some navy analysts concerned 
about the sincerity of soviet leader mikhail gorbachevs commitment 
to relaxing military tensions with the united states 
jeremiah and other ranking navy officials have urged the united 
states to maintain a close watch over the actions of soviet naval 
forces in the pacific 
some analysts say the steppedup spying may not be military in 
nature the soviets may be more interested in monitoring us 
reaction to gorbachevs policies or they may be seeking industrial 
information gorbachev could use in trying to bolster his countrys 
economy according to the analysts 
in this case the soviets appear to be gathering a lot of 
technical and industrial intelligence that comes from satellite 
downlinks said desmond j ball a specialist in soviet 
intelligence collection at the australian national university

here are excerpts from speeches by members of the 
congress of peoples deputies after the defeat saturday of the 
moscow reformists 
yuri afanasyev historian and leading figure in memorial a 
society investigating the nations stalinist past 
i had a depressing view of yesterdays work of our congress 
i thoroughly studied the list of candidates to the supreme 
soviet the fulltime legislature elected by the congress i must 
say and i am convinced of this that if we take into account the 
level of qualification compared to the tasks the supreme soviet 
must decide we have formed a brezhnevstalin supreme soviet 
now about the majority that has formed at the congress this 
also depresses me i am addressing you all the 
aggressiveobedient majority and you mikhail sergeyevich 
gorbachev who is either attentively listening to the majority or 
skillfully manipulating it we can continue the work the same way 
we may be obedient but let us not forget those who sent us here 
to the congress and they sent us here not for that but to 
drastically change the situation in the country

gavril popov liberal economist who was among those defeated 
deputies with a democratic orientation inevitably formed a 
minority at the congress we knew this we had two choices as to 
how to act first to try to play the role of opposition and 
second to become involved in the constructive work of the 
congress we chose the second 
but from the very beginning our work has met with some 
disbelief and prejudice the documents we prepared have not been 
copied so far and distributed among the deputies 
it is becoming more and more evident that the apparatus 
clearly wants to retaliate clear that it wants to impose its own 
way of work at the congress in these conditions it is impossible 
to support the variant we first chose it would not be understood 
either by our country or by those who elected us 
that is why we have to think about changing our positions a 
group of deputies considers it necessary to withdraw from the 
moscow delegation we are going to form an independent deputies 
group and invite all deputies to join us

ales adamovich a reformer famous for his novels about the 
horrors of world war ii in byleorussia 
i heard once the people stopped drinking sobered up a 
little looked around and asked where is the czar what does it 
mean woke up i witnessed myself during the war that people very 
often out of fear went into a deep sleep it was a kind of 
protective reaction of the body that was how people were killed in 
the 1920s 1930s 1940s while the rest hibernated 
and what did we find when we finally woke up we realize 
that after this long sleep we are not a modern state that sets an 
example for others but an underdeveloped superstate which is losing 
its ability to develop to transform the mentally crippled 
administrative child into a normal social organism to create a 
working economy 
people have great hopes for this congress does our work 
justify their hopes wont we be forced to buy dark glasses so 
that at the end of the congress we can slip like shadows through 
the crowds which stand each day outside the kremlin 
the supreme power in the country should belong to the people 
but in reality it belongs to the party without the power to 
exercise control over the budget and the party apparatus the 
congress wont be able to do much 
and it goes without saying that the congress of deputies can 
vote noconfidence in the government if it is obviously unable 
to fulfill its duties 
the windows of western shops are full of goods in our shop 
windows it would not be a bad idea to hang the portraits of 
ministers the agriculture minister in the butchers shop and so 
on

at tass we read attentively what the foreign press think about 
the congress already during the first day the western agencies 
said radicals attempted to impose their point of view during the 
discussion of procedural questions frankly i did not believe 
in all this but here is what we have now the speeches of 
afanasyev and popov 
i was amazed to hear such phrases as the brezhnevstalin wing 
i know these comrades as persistent supporters of democracy 
and democracy implies patience for dissent when such impatience is 
shown toward an alternatively thinking majority i start to 
doubt whether they persistently defend democracy 
we have already answered the question who is guilty 
completely enough it is high time to answer the questions what to 
do and how to do it

moscow aviation research institute one of defeated reformers 
comrades we should realize that boris yeltsin is the first 
candidate of the russian federation not only was he elected by 
five million muscovites but at almost 2000 enterprises he was the 
nominated candidate in this case it means that the congress 
neglects the opinion of the people this is a discreditation of the 
congress in order not to have confrontation between us here and 
between us and our people the presidium and our leadership have to 
make necessary efforts to ensure that people like boris yeltsin 
will take an active part in political life not only at meetings 
but also here i call on mikhail sergeyevich to do this

the new soviet congress dealt reformists a major 
setback saturday by rejecting maverick boris yeltsin and several 
other prominent reformers who were seeking seats on the powerful 
supreme soviet legislature 
thousands of muscovites disappointed with the results gathered 
for a rally that lasted through the night and reformers in 
congress vowed to form an opposition bloc to challenge the ruling 
communist party 
down with the bloodsuckers who prey on the people roared 
one speaker at the rally 
the furor was set off when the 2250seat congress of peoples 
deputies chose which of its members would serve on the new supreme 
soviet a fulltime 542seat legislature 
the election results and blunt debate that followed were 
televised live 
the supreme power in the country should belong to the people 
but in reality it belongs to the party said ales adamovich a 
writer from byelorussia and member of the congress 
during a recess president mikhail s gorbachev sought to 
reassure soviets accustomed to decades of empty institutional 
ritual that such clashes of opinion are to be expected 
one need not panic he said in remarks broadcast later on 
national television we cannot sit ceremoniously at the meetings 
knowing that outside the hall there is a stormy life with a lot of 
problems 
congressional deputies voted friday to fill the supreme soviet 
seats from among 573 candidates chosen by congress deputies from 
their home regions the results were announced saturday 
the congress rejected an 11thhour attempt by gorbachev to have 
his protege anatoly i lukyanov installed as vice president 
weary deputies loudly complained the presidents choice was being 
forced through and gorbachev agreed to put the matter off until 
monday 
in secret balloting for the supreme soviet congressional 
deputies elected a number of reform advocates from the tiny baltic 
republics whose representatives nominated only as many candidates 
as they had seats 
moscow deputies however nominated 55 candidates for their 29 
seats and yeltsin and other prominent moscowbased reformers were 
among the losers also defeated were sociologist tatyana 
zaslavskaya economist gavril popov advocate for the handicapped 
ilya zaslavsky historian sergei stankevich and biologist alexei 
yablokov 
many oldstyle candidates among them former cosmonaut svetlana 
savitskaya defeated the reformers 
yeltsin scored a landslide victory in moscow in spring elections 
for the congress of peoples deputies and is among the countrys 
most popular political figures he said he was saddened by the 
results but indicated he may challenge lukyanov for the vice 
presidency 
i must fight to the end yeltsin told reporters i 
wouldnt throw away any job 
several thousand muscovites gathered in a stadium parking lot to 
protest yeltsins defeat one speaker teacher vladimir kuznetsov 
said he sent a telegram to gorbachev telling him i have less and 
less respect for you and more and more for progressive moscow 
deputies 
but is it really life if its in chains but is it really an 
election if its in fetters read one placard 
but in the palace of congresses many deputies applauded as yuri 
a osipyan chairman of the votecounting commission announced in 
a droning voice the moscow reformers defeat 
leonid kravchenko directorgeneral of the official news agency 
tass defended the electionfor gods sake lets not have chaos 
everywhere and in everything there should be order 
yevgeny meshalkin a siberian health official accused the 
reformers of sour grapes 
they find themselves in the minority and the result cannot 
satisfy them he said they instigate work aimed at breaking 
the congress into factions 
before the balloting in the first competitively elected 
parliament in 70 years some deputies complained the nominating 
procedure had been rigged to keep party and government officials in 
power 
the apparatus has undoubtedly won popov declared to his 
fellow deputies 
he called on progressives nationwide to form an independent 
deputies group to fight communist party and state bureaucrats 
popovs declaration could lead to the first opposition faction 
in a soviet legislature where for decades the kremlin leadership 
has imposed its will unimpeded by opposition 
yeltsin garnered a narrow majority with 1185 deputies 
supporting him and 964 against but he ran last among 12 candidates 
for the 11 seats reserved for the russian federation in one of the 
supreme soviets two chambers the 271seat soviet of nationalities 
yeltsins defeat was a severe setback his attacks on official 
privilege calls for a better life for average soviets and his 
suggestion that the party should discuss permitting a multiparty 
democracy have made him a special target of the partys old guard 
vitaly i vorotnikov the only member of the ruling party 
politburo to stand as a candidate and the president of the russian 
federation outpolled yeltsin with 1388 votes

chancellor helmut kohl said saturday 
he opposed postponing proposed ussoviet talks on shortrange 
nuclear weapons as a possible compromise in the dispute within nato 
over the issue 
in a surprise move kohl flew later to the netherlands for talks 
with prime minister ruud lubbers over the division in the north 
atlantic treaty organization 
lubbers has offered to mediate the dispute in which west 
germany is trying to persuade the united states to agree to early 
talks with the soviets on shortrange atomic arsenals 
a government spokesman told the associated press kohls talks 
with lubbers were part of an earlier planned meeting with hollands 
governing christian democrats to discuss a number of topics but 
there had been no announcement of kohls plans to confer with 
lubbers 
speaking to reporters in the southern city of nuremberg before 
leaving for the netherlands kohl said superpower negotiations on 
the shortrange atomic arsenals cannot be postponed into the 
distant future 
we are the frontline country in nato it is clear that we 
should be speaking up for our interests kohl said 
the united states seeking to avert a nato split has reversed a 
firm stand against such negotiations and agreed to talks with the 
soviets at an unspecified time on reducing the number of 
shortrange nuclear weapons 
also saturday kohls junior coalition partners made a veiled 
threat to pull out of the government if the chancellor agreed to 
unacceptable compromises on the issue during nato summit that opens 
monday 
kohl is caught between liberal elements within his coalition and 
conservatives who fear the internal feud endangers the western 
alliance 
public opinion polls show most germans want the lance atomic 
rockets removed from german soil rather than modernized as nato 
advocates 
defense minister gerhard stoltenberg reiterated west germanys 
call for us talks with the soviets on the issue the bild 
newspaper reported but it said stoltenberg also noted west germany 
cant formulate european defense policy alone 
we must connect our interests to the clear goal of coming to a 
common position within nato through give and take soltenberg 
said in the interview to be published sunday 
bonn and washington have tried to heal their rift over kohls 
call for early talks on the shortrange missiles the united states 
and britain say the talks should not occur while the warsaw pact 
has superiority in conventional forces 
west german newspapers said foreign minister hansdietrich 
genscher on tuesday threatened to pull his minority free democratic 
party out of the governming coalition if kohl softens his stand 
members of the coalition are kohls christian democratic union 
its conservative bavarian sister party the christian social union 
and the businessoriented free democrats 
some members of kohls government including stoltenberg 
reportedly have been angered by genschers aggressiveness in the 
nato dispute newspaper reports said stoltenberg noted washington 
has agreed in principle to start up negotiations on shortrange 
nuclear weapons and the question now is when those talks should 
begin

politics wasnt the first career choice of 
tony coelho 
the california democrat whose savvy and partisan skills helped 
him climb to the highest ranks of congress originally wanted to be 
a catholic priest 
but while coelho the son of a san joaquin valley dairy farmer 
was attending college at loyola university in los angeles he was 
rejected for the priesthood after he discovered he had epilepsy 
at that point coelho got a lucky break dolores hope wife of 
the famed comedian bob hope heard about his problems and persuaded 
her husband to offer help 
hope suggested that coelho could serve the public in another way 
politics 
the young college graduate came to washington went into the 
office of his congressman rep bf sisk and got hired 
within five years coelho became sisks administrative 
assistant his top aide and when sisk retired in 1978 coelho was 
ready at the age of 36 he ran for sisks seat and won easily 
polling 60 percent a margin that rose with succeeding elections 
he announced saturday that he will resign june 15 his 47th 
birthday he said he decided to resign to spare himself and his 
party the ordeal of a protracted ethics investigation into a 
100000 junk bond deal in 1986 
in the house coelho showed himself to be an adept politician 
and quickly won a reputation for fierce partisanship in his first 
term he was picked for the agriculture committee a choice seat 
for a freshman congressman and a key post for a man from his 
district 
while taking care of his district coelho also kept an eye on 
the internal politics of the house and when the chairmanship of the 
house democratic campaign committee opened up in 1981 he jumped in 
quickly and won the job 
coelho had few contenders for the position the panel had been 
outspent by a large margin by its house republican counterpart 
ronald reagan had just been elected president and swept a 
republicancontrolled senate into power along with him and house 
democrats were reeling 
but coelho working long hours fought back 
he worked on building a large direct mail fundraising list and 
also traveled widely across the country beating the bushes and 
trying to convince businessmen and others with money that the 
democrats not the republicans were the party of the future 
coelho also courted the political action committees the pacs 
which control millions of dollars he reminded them which party 
his controlled the house 
coelhos efforts paid off the committee began raising more 
money and its candidates did well in 1982 when the gop had been 
expected to make inroads into the house democratic margin the 
democrats picked up 26 seats two years later when a popular 
reagan was winning a second term with 59 percent of the vote 
coelhos money helped hold democratic losses to only 15 seats 
in 1986 the democrats picked up a net of five seats and coelho 
was looking to move higher in the house leadership after the 
retirement of popular speaker thomas p oneill jr 
when jim wright of texas then majority leader succeeded 
oneill as speaker coelho moved up to the whips job the 
thirdranking position it put him firmly on the path to greater 
power 
but he was brought down by ethics problems that began shortly 
after it was reported that he had not listed on his 1986 disclosure 
forms a loan he obtained to buy 100000 in highyield junk bonds 
more questions were raised about that loan even as coelho was 
spreading the word that he wanted to replace tom foley as majority 
leader the partys secondranking leadership position when 
foley as expected moved up to the speakership 
sisk his mentor said saturday he was saddened by the situation 
basically he and i were very close i guess like a son 
because i never had a son sisk said i feel badly because i 
think he still had great possibilities from the standpoint of 
things that could develop but it didnt work out this way 
in the final analysis i feel very strongly that he will prove 
out to be honest and dedicated i think the time will come when he 
will have additional opportunities sisk said

president mikhail s gorbachev took a break from 
fierce parliamentary debate saturday to reassure soviets used to 
empty institutional ritual that the open clash of opinions was 
perfectly normal 
one need not panic he told a knot of fellow 
parliamentarians during a recess at the congress of peoples 
deputies at the kremlins palace of congresses 
we cannot sit ceremoniously at the meetings knowing that 
outside the hall there is a stormy life with a lot of problems 
gorbachev said 
his comments were carried on national television soviet 
citizens have been keenly following the fiery proceedings in the 
congress a sharp contrast to the traditional rubberstamp 
practices 
lawmakers used to meet in moscow for only three or four days a 
year unanimously pass legislation put before them by the communist 
party leadership and deliver ovations to top officials 
on saturday legislators made statements that would have been 
inconceivable at an official forum even a year ago the statements 
included byelorussian writer ales adamovichs claim that power in 
the soviet union is held not by the people but by the communist 
party 
even gorbachev fell victim to the new combativeness of soviet 
parliamentarians when in an 11thhour move he tried to get the 
congress to reelect his protege anatoly i lukyanov to the vice 
presidency 
deputies objected that they were tired after three days of 
debate and wanted more than one candidate to pick from gorbachev 
backed down and the congress adjourned until monday 
in informal talks with other deputies gorbachev said a clash of 
views was normal but legislators should respect those they disagree 
with 
it is all right that passions are stirring he said when 
people talk about the country the people their fate business 
what to do to improve the situation we have to show respect 
gorbachev said soviets have been sending letters and telegrams 
asking what is the congress doing 
at first glance the work of the congress might look 
disorganized deputies lacking political culture even starting to 
place others in various categories he said but the newly 
created parliament is only beginning 
the most important thing is to move things he said

president bush met saturday with pope john paul ii 
and leaders of italys caretaker government while his spokesman 
said flatly that the united states will not reduce its european 
troop levels without consulting its nato allies 
in the final analysis this is something that the president 
will want to discuss directly with his partners marlin 
fitzwater the spokesman said 
he suggested a cutback was probable saying he did not want to 
signal anything in advance but made it clear that no us troops 
will be withdrawn without the endorsement of nato leaders at the 
summit that begins monday in brussels 
bush told prime minister ciriaco de mita that in concert with 
the nato allies he intends to seize on the openings offered by 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev for arms reductions 
fitzwater said 
the pope meanwhile praised bush for his stand against 
narcotics calling drug use a moral crisis bush said he 
benefited from john paul iis wise counsel 
the president also said he shares the vaticans concern for 
world peace weve made progress in reducing armaments bush 
said 
later at a state dinner with de mita bush announced that 
italians soon will be able to visit the united states without 
obtaining visas joining britain and japan in a us program giving 
easier entry privileges to residents of selected countries 
among the guests who shook hands with bush at the glittering 
dinner was italian communist party head achille occhetto but 
elsewhere leftist demonstrators clashed with riot police in 
protest of the bush visit three police and a woman bystander were 
injured and 18 demonstrators were detained for questioning 
on monday in brussels the president will meet with the leaders 
of the 15 us allies in nato 
many of them are eager to have the united states match a series 
of weapons reductions pledged by gorbachev fitzwater said the 
latest soviet moves which include a willingness to impose limits 
on soviet troops in eastern europe presented some opportunities 
and those are openings that need to be discussed with the allies 
and will be 
the white house spokesman in a subtle policy shift said the 
united states was now willing to negotiate over troop levels in the 
eastwest talks being held in vienna 
until now the nato allies have tried to concentrate the talks 
on tanks artillery and armored personnel carriers the soviets on 
the other hand have insisted on dealing directly with the levels 
of nato and warsaw pact forces 
fitzwater responding to gorbachevs acceptance of equal 
ceilings in the two alliances said its a matter for 
discussion 
his comments saturday came after reports that the united states 
was considering a reduction in the 305000 to 325000 us troops 
in europe 
fitzwater took a similar tack in responding to questions about 
whether the united states is preparing to lift economic sanctions 
imposed on the soviet union in 1980 after the invasion of 
afghanistan 
the president will be discussing a variety of ideas many of 
them never presented before fitzwater said 
discussing us forces fitzwater said flatly that the united 
states will not unilaterally withdraw troops from europe 
john sununu the white house chief of staff said in an 
interview to be telecast sunday by cable news network that youre 
not going to see unilateral action taken by one country or another 
it will be an alliance action 
a senior us official said meanwhile that any action would be 
taken as part of the conventional forces in europe or cfe talks 
in vienna 
any suggestion of a us troop withdrawal is bound to have an 
impact on the allies as they consider a west german drive opposed 
by bush for negotiations to reduce groundbased nuclear missiles 
in europe 
on saturday west german chancellor helmut kohl warned against 
delays in negotiating missile reductions but british prime 
minister margaret thatcher a strong supporter of the us 
position argued that such cuts would be aimed at the jugular of 
nato 
italy is a strong supporter of the united states inside the 
western alliance on most defense issues while bush cannot count on 
the italians to side with him in opposing nuclear missile 
negotiations with moscow his twoday stop reflects strong ties 
with rome 
accompanied by secretary of state james a baker iii and brent 
scowcroft the national security adviser bush met with prime 
minister de mita at a 16th century hillside villa and then had 
lunch with president francesco cossiga in a wuirinale palace hall 
he announced the liberalized us entry rules for italians at a 
state dinner with the prime minister saying in the future 
italians who wish to visit our country whether as tourists or on 
business will no longer need to apply for visas and we look 
forward to that day his announcement prompted warm applause at 
the blacktie event 
he also held an unscheduled meeting with bettino craxi the 
socialist party leader and prime minister from 1983 to 1987 bushs 
audience with the pope later at the vatican gave a colorful and 
photogenic twist to his first day in europe as president 
bush met first with the pope in his library the presidents 
wife barbara dressed in a black suit and more than 30 
presidential aides joined them toward the end 
the pope praised bush for his deep commitment to liberate the 
youth of america from the destructive forces of drug abuse and to 
alleviate poverty at home and abroad he said these problems were 
only symptoms of a deeper moral crisis eating away at the very 
texture of society in almost every part of the world 
bush discussing efforts for world peace assured the pontiff 
while were still far from realizing the biblical injunction to 
turn our swords into plowshares weve made progress in reducing 
armaments and in decreasing the threat of war 
later bush told about 200 american seminarians studying here 
you remember the old american expression often said of a guru or 
individual he hasnt got a prayer well i am delighted to meet 
an audience about whom that will never be said

cardinal john oconnor of new york 
arrived saturday on a visit aimed at focusing the worlds attention 
on foreign hostages held in lebanon and on the bitter fighting 
between christian and moslem forces 
oconnor said he did not come to lebanon to negotiate on behalf 
of the united states but he would gladly meet with the hostages 
even if that meant entering the moslem sector of beirut 
i hope that they can hear my voice or can see me or can read 
that the people of our country have not forgotten them theyre in 
our prayers he said 
among the missing foreigners is anglican church envoy terry 
waite who came on a mission to try to gain the release of 
hostages he disappeared in beirut on jan 20 1988 after leaving 
his hotel for a meeting with captors of some of the victims 
before oconnor arrived syrian gunners shelled the christian 
coastline north of beirut despite an appeal by arab leaders to 
observe a ceasefire 
more than 350 people have been killed and nearly 1400 wounded 
since march 8 when the latest round of fighting broke in lebanons 
14yearold civil war 
oconnor said the fighting in lebanon in which the christian 
forces are heavily outnumbered and outgunned by the syrians and 
their allies has been largely ignored by the us and world media 
this is extraordinary that a nation is being destroyed a 
religious body is being almost obliterated and an organism where so 
many religions lived harmoniously is being torn apart and we really 
havent responded he said 
oconnor who came in his role as president of the roman 
catholic near west welfare association flew in from larnaca 
cyprus aboard a military helicopter provided by christian leader 
gen michel aoun 
the helicopter landed after sunset at the hilltop monastery of 
bkirki seat of maronite catholic patriarch nasrallah sfeir nine 
miles north of beirut 
sfeir spiritual head of the maronite sect that has dominated 
the government since lebanon gained independence from france in 
1943 will be oconnors host during his threeday visit 
oconnor who ignored state department objections to the trip 
stopped in rome on friday for talks with pope john paul ii he came 
to bkirki with a vatican passport and visa to sidestep a us ban 
on travel to lebanon 
he told reporters in larnaca the pope is distressed about the 
lebanese crisis i havent seen him nearly so anguished about 
anything else as he is about lebanon oconnor said its just 
eating away at him 
asked whether he was afraid to be in lebanon oconnor smiled 
and said no im not why should i be 
there are 15 foreigners including nine americans held hostage 
in lebanon the longest held is terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press he was kidnapped march 16 
1985 
asked if he would seek to free the hostages oconnor who 
visited lebanon in june 1986 said ill certainly say what i 
said last time i was here about the american hostages and all 
hostages im not an ambassador from the united states im simply 
a priest a churchman 
he said im not here as a negotiator if their captors 
would permit me to see them then id be very happy to see them and 
do anything i could to help them asked whether he would cross 
beiruts dividing green line to the moslem sector where most of 
the hostages are believed held the cardinal said ill be going 
to wherever patriarch sfeir thinks i should go 
officials said oconnor was scheduled to drive to west beirut to 
meet with acting prime minister salim hoss who heads a moslem 
cabinet vying for legitimacy with a christian government headed by 
aoun 
the cardinal was scheduled to meet sunday with aoun at the 
shellbattered presidential palace in baabda five miles east of

capt will c rogers iii ended his twoyear 
command of the uss vincennes on saturday without apology for the 
cruisers mistaken destruction of an iranian airliner and with a 
call to combat terrorism 
navy capt robert b lynch took over as the new commander of the 
aegis cruiser that rogers defended as a masterpiece of american 
technology and ingenuity despite past criticisms 
rogers made no mention of the airliners destruction july 3 
1988 instead focusing on a pipe bomb attack last march that 
destroyed a van driven by his wife sharon as she drove to work 
mrs rogers escaped injury 
the van bombing remains under investigation by the fbi as a 
possible act of terrorism 
rogers speaking to a crowd of about 200 aboard the heavily 
guarded ship denounced terrorism saying it is a subterranean 
and shadowy war that preys on a lack of courage and enlists 
those without moral conviction 
the vincennes was engaged in combat with seven iranian patrol 
craft when it misidentified the iranian jetliner as an attacking 
military aircraft and fired at it all 290 aboard the jet died 
rogers who took command of the vincennes in april 1987 
defended the aegis electronic combat control system which enables 
a ship like the vincennes to make computerrecommended battle 
decisions for entire fleets 
but the system was found flawed in the persian gulf 
confrontation according to pentagon analysts splitsecond 
decisions were affected by the inability of radarscope 
interpreters to immediately match the planes blip with digital 
direction altitude and speed information displayed on another 
screen 
the vincennes will be moved to long beach naval shipyard within 
five weeks for modifications of its electronic combat control 
system the san diego tribune reported 
during the ceremony rogers was commended by vice adm robert 
ku kihune who presented him with the legion of merit 
there are very few officers in our ranks who have been faced 
with the challenges of command that capt will rogers has had to 
face kihune said 
i can state today without any exaggeration that capt rogers 
has met every test and has moved on to instill pride in his men and 
to command his warship with true professionalism kihune said 
rogers new assignment is at the navys tactical training group 
on point loma which trains senior naval officers in handling 
closecombat situations he and his wife are under a naval 
investigative service guard that has been in place since the van 
bombing 
the vincennes which was commissioned in 1984 is expected to 
leave san diego for a routine sixmonth deployment to the far east 
and indian ocean in early december

thousands of moslems on saturday fought among 
themselves and clashed with police during a march to demand britain 
change its blasphemy laws and allow them to challenge the satanic 
verses in court 
police said 84 people were arrested and six policemen were 
injured during the march most in street battles in front of the 
houses of parliament 
an estimated 20000 demonstrators waved banners denouncing 
author salman rushdie and shouted slogans such as rushdie must 
die as they began their march in hyde park 
an effigy of rushdie hanging from gallows was thrust high into 
the air rushdie a british author wrote the satanic verses a 
novel that some say is insulting to islam 
lawmaker keith vaz of the opposition labor party called on 
rushdie and his publisher penguin to withdraw the novel from 
circulation in britain home to an estimated 850000 moslems 
protesters then marched to prime minister margaret thatchers 
office at 10 downing st where representatives handed in a 
petition demanding a change in britains ancient blasphemy laws 
britains rarely used blasphemy law makes it illegal only to 
insult the christian state church of england moslems want it 
extended to reflect britains multiethnic society saying this 
would give them legal grounds for opposing the satanic verses 
at their next stop in parliament square thousands of protesters 
stood under big ben and blocked traffic as fighting broke out among 
crowd members riot police poured into the area to break up the 
clashes and force protesters onto westminster bridge out of the 
square 
a scotland yard spokesman said fighting broke out among younger 
members of the demonstration for reasons best known to 
themselves 
he said the demonstrators refused to move but then resumed the 
march after protest organizers announced over a loudspeaker that 
police had assured them the arrested people would be released 
after the skirmishes the protesters continued their march to 
their final destination in south londons kennington where they 
dispersed 
rushdie born to a moslem family in india is a british citizen 
and has been in hiding in england since feb 14 when iranian 
leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini ordered moslems to kill him 
moslems say the satanic verses blasphemes islam by 
associating the prophet mohammed with prostitutes and suggesting 
that the koran islams holy book was mohammeds invention not 
the work of god 
at the start of saturdays protest moslem men sat in circles on 
the grass in hyde park and punched the air with their fists as they 
called for the british government to change the blasphemy law 
the international committee for the defense of salman rushdie 
and his publishers issued a statement calling on demonstration 
leaders to repudiate khomeinis death threat the statement said 
the death threat violated international law and contradicted the 
principle of reverence for life which underlies all religions 
the committee agreed with the demonstrators that the blasphemy 
law discriminated against moslems and other nonchristians but said 
it should be repealed rather than extended 
the protest was organized by the british muslim action front and 
moslem leader abdal hussain choudhury

was swarming with passengers but there was no mistaking the man of 
the hour eli infante who served as interpreter saturday when

surrounded by reporters the miami man smiled modestly and 
remained unruffled as he did throughout the hijacking

a cuban immigrant who escaped from a mental 
hospital tried to hijack an american airlines jetliner to cuba on 
saturday but he surrendered after the plane landed at miami 
authorities said 
the boeing 727 carrying 157 passengers and crew en route from 
dallas to miami was diverted toward cuba temporarily before heading 
back to its original destination the hijacker was armed with a 
starters pistol and two knives but no one was injured 
he was identified as pedro rene comasbanos 37 who came to the 
united states exactly nine years ago saturday as part of the mariel 
boatlift said fbi agent william gavin 
the suspect has a history of mental problems most recently 
escaping from an institution in the los angeles area gavin said 
adding that the date of that escape is not yet known 
he has been living since that time in the los angeles area and 
reportedly has a son in cuba and has expressed interest in 
returning to cuba gavin said 
before going to los angeles gavin said comasbanos escaped 
from st elizabeths hospital in washington dc where john 
hinckley who attempted to assassinate president reagan in 1981 is 
held comasbanos was there from 1980 to 1982 
hes a very confused individual not at all crystal clear and 
cogent gavin said his mind keeps changing 
dressed in olivedrab fatigues and a bombertype jacket the 
sandyhaired comasbanos boarded an american airlines flight in los 
angeles on saturday morning and then transferred to the miamibound 
flight in dallas gavin said 
after the flight left the ground on its way to miami he 
produced a demand note and said he wanted to be taken to havana 
gavin said speaking only spanish the hijacker told the flight 
crew he was carrying a bomb in his briefcase which actually 
contained a starters pistol used in track races two pocket knives 
and a pair of scissors 
the pilot turned back toward miami after reporting he didnt 
have enough fuel to get to havana which gavin said was true 
there was no bluff here this morning gavin said the plane 
never entered cuban airspace 
ninety minutes after flight 1098 parked in a remote corner of 
miami international airport comasbanos allowed children to leave 
the jet and then gave himself up gavin said 
all the passengers are off and safe said federal aviation 
administration spokesman jack barker 
comasbanos was charged with air piracy and taken to the 
metropolitan correctional center in dade county pending a hearing 
tuesday before a federal magistrate gavin said if convicted 
comasbanos faces a maximum penalty of life in prison 
one passenger eli infante 33 of miami said he served as 
interpreter between the hijacker and crew 
i thought i was going to get shot infante said 
asked why comasbanos gave up infante said i guess he got 
tired we kept telling him we would not take off with passengers 
aboard 
infantes wife silvia 28 described comasbanos as very 
tense he was sweating a lot and walking back and forth saying he 
had accomplices but we never saw anybody but him 
describing comasbanos surrender mrs infante said he 
collapsed and everybody jumped on him as he left the back of the 
jet 
at one point the faa and the airline had said there might be 
more than one hijacker but they said later that that was never 
confirmed 
robert baker senior vice president of operations at american 
airlines said the hijacker claimed to have confederates aboard the 
plane and the other passengers were being interviewed and the 
plane checked for weapons 
faa officials said passengers left the aircraft by rear stairs 
and their carryon luggage was checked by officers with police dogs 
flight 1098 carrying 150 passengers and a crew of seven left 
dallasfort worth international airport about 8 am edt and was 
scheduled to land at miami at about 1030 am 
approximately 15 miles north of miami the pilot reported 
he had a passenger who wanted to go to havana said faa spokesman 
bob buckhorn in washington 
the aircraft circled miami for approximately 20 minutes and 
then turned south approximately 60 miles south of miami the 
aircraft turned north again buckhorn said 
the coast guard was notified of an air emergency shortly before 
11 am as the jet flew over the atlantic ocean ditching was a 
concern at one point in time said law enforcement duty officer 
david newton 
in miami metrodade police sent a specialweapons and tactics 
team to the airport and the fbi was on the scene 
during the 1960s and 1970s there were a rash of hijackings or 
attempted hijackings to cuba before the institution of security 
measures at airports and the cooperation of cuban authorities 
stemmed the tide 
last december a cuban exile tried to hijack a twa airliner to 
cuba on a flight from san juan puerto rico to miami but the 
aircraft landed on grand turk island instead with the hijacker 
thinking he was on the ground in havana

really life if its in chains but is it really an election if 
its in fetters

house majority leader tom foley said 
saturday the democratic party and congress were not in a crisis 
despite the ethics controversies that have ensnared speaker jim 
wright and rep tony coelho 
the washington congressman said he tried to persuade coelho who 
as majority whip is the no 3 house democrat not to resign from 
congress because of a pending ethics investigation into personal 
finances 
but he said his california colleague told him his decision to 
quit was irreversible 
there is an environment of very intense scrutiny and focus on 
us foley told reporters as he shook hands during the annual old 
mill days parade in oakesdale about 45 miles south of spokane 
in recent weeks and months the focus has been so intense it 
has created a mood that i hope will soon change to focus on the 
legislative issues said foley who is favored to succeed wright 
should the speaker resign as expected next week 
i hope the focus of the media will come back to those issues 
for which we were elected to undertake 
the 13term congressman who later was keynote speaker at a 
democratic party fundraiser in spokane said the ethics issues 
have not hurt the democrats or congress 
we are not in a crisis the democratic party or the congress 
are not in a crisis he told reporters were going to address 
ourselves to the legislative issues that face the country 
well resolve the leadership issues very soon and well go on 
and have a very important and meaningful congress he said 
he noted coelho who had been expected to be a candidate to 
replace foley as majority leader continued to deny he had violated 
any house ethics standards 
coelho has had a brilliant record as chairman of the campaign 
committee and as the party whip and i think hell be deeply missed 
by his colleagues and by the constituents he served so well 
foley said 
coelho told colleagues late friday that he intends to resign 
from congress next month rather than endure a protracted ethics 
investigation coelho has come under criticism for his personal 
business dealings particularly the handling of a 100000 
investment in junk bonds

yang jianjun one of thousands of students 
waiting saturday at beijings railroad station to go home said it 
was time to bring the spirit of the demonstrations that have 
convulsed the capital out to the countryside 
participation of the people will help bring about a new 
government yang said after spending four days marching and 
chanting antigovernment slogans at beijings central tiananmen 
square 
but he conceded the conditions are really bad at the square 
a lot of people are tired of living out there 
as he and others prepared to leave hundreds of students were 
arriving at the station soldiers blocked many from leaving the 
station to go to tiananmen 
yang a junior at the liaoning fuxing institute of mining and 
technology in northeastern china said he was not discouraged that 
the beijing demonstrations appeared to be coming to an end with 
only about 10000 protesters remaining in tiananmen saturday 
compared to hundreds of thousands a week ago 
people from my school are still at tiananmen and many of us 
return to beijing after going home to continue our movement yang 
said but he added that the journey back and forth is getting 
hard now with all the soldiers at this station 
demonstrations have been reported in many cities apparently led 
by students who returned home after participating in the beijing 
protests 
we have to tell the people to arise including peasants 
workers intellectuals and others from every walk of life said a 
24yearold student from wuhan who asked not to be identified 
on saturday several dozen soldiers kept crowds of students in a 
waiting area outside the station for a long trip back by special 
train to wuhan in central china several dozen more plainclothes 
soldiers wearing red armbands made a ring around the departing 
students making sure they did not stray back into the city 
soldiers have blocked the exits to keep students from getting 
out of the station said li xiongdong a junior at beijings 
university of science and technology who was seeing friends off 
li said guards scuffled with five students from suzhou 
university earlier saturday tearing their shirts while hauling 
them away to be sent back to eastern jiangsu province 
if a big group arrives from the countryside the soldiers 
wont try to stop them but if its just a handful they wont get 
through he said 
the government has issued orders to provincial officials to stop 
students from coming to beijing 
during the peak of the demonstrations some 50000 students 
arrived by train daily according to newspapers staterun radio 
reported 26000 students left beijing friday 
railroad officials declined to answer questions about the 
situation saturday 
railroad workers have allowed many students to ride the trains 
free to join the demonstrators at tiananmen but that too is to 
end loudspeakers at the beijing station said that starting sunday 
all students would have to pay for their trips

the service employees international union 
picked up about 50000 new members saturday and its chief rival in 
the health care field an estimated 27000 as a smaller but 
aggressive union dissolved to join the ranks of labors giants 
seiu immediately claimed preeminence in the burgeoning health 
care industry but its rival the american federation of state 
county and municipal employees vowed to continue its organizing 
forays in one of the fastestgrowing sectors of the economy 
both had campaigned hard for the affiliation of locals now tied 
to the national union of health care and hospital employees also 
known as district 1199 a 30yearold pioneer in health care 
organizing that decided to join a larger union to expand its 
financial and political clout 
results of an election supervised by the american arbitration 
association and released saturday showed 13 of the district 1199s 
18 locals chose to join seiu that would swell the unions 
membership from 850000 to about 900000 
five of the locals with a total of about 27300 members voted 
to join afscme which entered the election 12 million members 
strong 
the results left seiu representing about 375000 healthcare 
workers to about 330000 for afscme 
district 1199 secretary treasurer jerome brown who sided with 
seiu in the affiliation fight said the election was but the 
opening salvo in a battle to organize all health care workers into 
one great union 
added seiu spokesman gerry shea we come out of this with a 
lot of energy to turn to the question of unorganized workers 
but an afscme spokesman said seiu would face continued 
competition in organizing the estimated 6 million health care 
workers not currently represented by unions 
were very pleased to have gotten those votes to have gained 
those members that we have said afscmes robert harman that 
means were a very potent health care union too and we intend to 
remain so 
the election took on added significance because of a recent 
national labor relations board decision unions believe will make it 
easier to organize health care workers 
the two larger unions were unable to resolve differences over 
how an affiliation vote would be conducted so the aflcio brokered 
a compromise under which each local of the health care union 
decided which of the bigger unions to join that decision 
essentially guaranteed district 1199 would be split up because 
afscme and seiu had concentrated their lobbying efforts in 
different regions and were competing headtohead in only a few 
seiu emerged victorious in two of the hardest fought battles 
gaining 5000 members in the baltimore area and another 2500 in 
michigan it also won the affiliation of district 1199 members in 
new england except for one connecticut local rome and 
rochester ny washington state ohio west virginia kentucky 
indiana iowa wisconsin and pennsylvania except philadelphia 
afscmes wins included the two largest district 1199 locals a 
10500member unit in philadelphia and one representing 10000 
workers in new jersey about 5200 california nurses picked afscme 
over seiu as did one district 1199 local in connecticut and another 
representing workers in several southern states

congress owes the public an up or down 
vote on alleged ethics violations by two democratic leaders even 
if they step down republican national committee chairman lee 
atwater said saturday 
atwater said the resignation of house majority whip tony coelho 
and the anticipated resignation of speaker jim wright does not mean 
the ethics investigations should be halted and the allegations 
dropped 
if i were a member of congress i would want an opportunity to 
vote on these wright and coelho matters he said what would 
disappoint me would be if these things are just kind of brushed 
aside 
atwater who said he was taken by surprise by coelhos decision 
to step down urged congress to improve its tarnished image its 
very dangerous and very unhealthy for the american people to have 
such a bad attitude about one of our institutions he said 
the gop chairman said hes been avoiding attempts to make 
political hay out of the wright and coelho problems he would not 
say whether he expects congressional ethics to be a dominant issue 
in the 1990 elections 
ive been following the napoleonic maxim which is never 
interfere with the enemy when hes in the process of destroying 
himself atwater said 
atwater who managed george bushs presidential campaign last 
year was in maine for an afternoon fundraising reception at the 
cape elizabeth home of house minority leader mary clark webster

italys president on friday asked former premier 
giovanni spadolini to try to mediate an end to a weekold political 
crisis that seemed likely to continue beyond president bushs 
threeday visit 
premier ciriaco de mita a christian democrat resigned as the 
head of a 13month government last friday after repeated attacks by 
the socialists one of his allies in the fiveparty coalition 
a few hours before bushs arrival friday president francesco 
cossiga asked spadolini to talk with party leaders and find a way 
to solve the crisis brought on de mitas resignation cossiga as 
head of state is charged with picking someone to try to form 
italys 49th postwar government 
the christian democrats had sought to have de mita succeed 
himself as premier that would have enhanced de mitas position in 
talks with bush and at the nato summit next week in brussels 
but there have been indications socialist leader bettino craxi 
was opposed to another de mitaled government 
craxi has accused de mita of failing to demonstrate leadership 
spadolini said after his meeting with cossiga that he would 
begin his consultations on wednesday after de mita returns from 
brussels 
his appointment as mediator marked the ninth time that an 
italian president has given a prominent politician the socalled 
exploratory mandate for resolving a government crisis

1982 and from aug 23 1982 until nov 11 1982 he was the first

a graduate student has sued the university of 
michigan claiming that its new antidiscrimination policy violates 
his first amendment right to free speech 
the american civil liberties union of michigan filed the 
complaint thursday in us district court in detroit on behalf of a 
graduate student in psychology who wished to remain anonymous 
the university introduced the policy in 1988 in response to a 
series of racial incidents that included the broadcast of racially 
offensive jokes on a campus radio station in 1987 and distribution 
of antiblack leaflets 
the plaintiff is a specialist in behavioral psychology and fears 
punishment if he discusses some of his theories in class said aclu 
attorney robert sedler said 
under the universitys policy the expression of ideas 
concerning the superiority or inferiority of members of one sex 
over the other or of members of one race over another as a result 
of biopsychological differences would be considered to be 
discriminatory harassment the complaint said 
the policy on discrimination and discriminatory harassment by 
students in the university environment prohibits any behavior 
verbal or physical that stigmatizes or victimizes an individual on 
the basis of race ethnicity religion sex sexual orientation 
creed national origin ancestry age marital status handicap or 
vietnamera veteran status 
the case would have important implications for other schools 
that have antidiscrimination policies said howard simon 
executive director of the aclu of michigan 
the university of wisconsin at madison and the university of 
massachusetts at amherst are considering introducing 
antidiscrimination plans 
our suit may serve as an important precedent simon said 
if we can prevail and redirect the university of michigans 
efforts to deal with racism and sexism it will have an influential 
effect on other universities 
walter harrison executive director of university relations 
said michigan has always sought to preserve first amendment rights 
when we crafted the antidiscrimination policy we gave 
careful consideration to the first amendment which we consider to 
be essential to the successful operation of the university 
harrison said 
aclu officials called the policy excessively broad making any 
offensive speech the target of disciplinary action 
you do not address the problem of racism by attacking the 
constitution and the first amendment simon said if there is 
any institution in the country where controversial in fact 
outrageous and even offensive ideas ought to be aired analyzed 
evaluated and debated it ought to be a university 
the policy addresses only the symptoms and not the disease of 
racism simon said 
if all the racist fliers and jokes and sexually offensive 
fliers or jokes are eliminated from the campus of the university of 
michigan that does not mean racism and sexism will be 
eliminated he said 
the university has 30 days to respond to the lawsuit sedler 
said

britain has been hit by a series of strikes in 
recent months recalling the prethatcher days of national walkouts 
that helped bring down a labor party government 
but experts say the scenario is very different from the winter 
of discontent of 197879 when public service workers paralyzed 
much of the country prime minister margaret thatchers 
conservative party ousted the socialists in may 1979 on a wave of 
antiunion sentiment 
experts predict the strikes will eventually subside after a 
current round of wage negotiations although there are concerns the 
walkouts could lead to higher wages and prices their impact will 
be limited by mrs thatchers unioncurbing laws they say 
repeated oneday walkouts by subway workers and bus drivers have 
forced millions of londoners to walk to work the british 
broadcasting corp has canceled or cut live television and radio
