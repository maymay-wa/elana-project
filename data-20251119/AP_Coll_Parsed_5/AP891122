el morro castle the fortress 
spaniards built 400 years ago to keep out pirates and now a major 
tourist attraction has become a battleground for tree lovers and 
those who demand historical authenticity 
in the treelovers camp are conservationists and a group of art 
students protesting what they call the chainsaw massacre of el 
morros trees by the national guard after hurricane hugo struck on 
sept 18 all 200 trees on the 21acre site not just those damaged 
by the storm were chopped up and hauled away leaving a litter of 
stumps 
in the opposing camp are the national park service and puerto 
ricos commonwealth historic preservation office they control 
separate areas of el morro and authorized the clearance as part of 
their plan to restore the site to its original state a treeless 
garrison 
about 100 students at the school of plastic arts which is on el 
morro grounds planted saplings and protest placards outside the 
school and have been maintaining an aroundtheclock vigil there 
since early october 
the students who once did their artwork in the shade of the 
trees have organized protest marches to the governors mansion la 
fortaleza demanding reforestation of el morro 
conservation groups have taken up the cause which has provoked 
a stream of letters in the san juan star including one containing 
joyce kilmers most famous poem trees 
wp crawford the national park service superintendent in 
puerto rico said hugos 140mph winds left only few trees standing 
at el morro and most of the rest were too badly mangled to be saved 
taking them out was only thing to do he maintained 
besides crawford said a 1983 general management plan approved 
two years later by the us and commonwealth governments said the 
broad grassy slope leading to the fort should be treeless the way 
it was originally 
maybe with a superhuman effort some of the trees could have 
been saved he said but because the general management plan 
calls for removing all the trees i didnt think it was worth the 
time and effort of nursing a dozen or so along 
what we are trying to do is protect the historic scene as 
mandated by congress for all us historic sites crawford said 
the historical context has got to be no 1 by law 
archaeologist guy pantell who has asked the presidential 
advisory council on historic preservation in washington for an 
investigation said the historical argument did not justify the 
destruction of trees not damaged by the storm 
if this was so parts of el morro would have to be eliminated 
its construction occurred during several centuries pantell said 
in an interview with the star 
the walled fort which overlooks san juan harbor was built 
mostly between 1589 and the 1650s to guard the city against 
seaborne attack today it is by far puerto ricos most popular 
tourist attraction with 25 million visitors a year 
tourists approach el morros tiered batteries across a 200yard 
esplanade which is a popular place for picnics and flying kites 
historians say the esplanade was purposely kept clear of vegetation 
to give el morros defenders a clear line of fire 
but during the 1940s soldiers planted about 50 sea pines and 
coconut palms along the road in front of el morro which at that 
time had a us army officers club other trees were planted 
nearby on land controlled by the commonwealth government 
gov rafael hernandez colon who had endorsed the tree removal 
has reversed his position and appointed a committee to work out a 
compromise 
committee member enrique marti founder of the conservation 
group pro bosques urbanos or pro urban forests said the panel had 
agreed to selectively plant trees at el morro to keep the main 
esplanade clear he said the landscape would look better than it 
did before the hurricane 
but not everybody is satisfied 
our children will see the trees but we wont said lourdes 
quintero 24 one of the protesting art students

sculptor isabel mcilvain is closing in on the 
moment of truth for her 8foottall portrayal of john f kennedy 
her clay statue is about to be cast in bronze the final step 
before its unveiling outside the massachusetts capitol as the 
formal memorial to a beloved native son 
for older generations the heroic image will recall the optimism 
and vigor embodied by kennedy for generations born since the young 
president was slain on nov 22 1963 the statue offers a glimpse 
of the era known as camelot 
my wish is to portray somebody who was a magnetic leader and 
who had a lot of youth a lot of hope about his role and the 
possiblities for america said mcilvain a professor of sculpture 
at boston university 
mcilvains work which will take about six months to cast 
depicts kennedy in a classic pose striding into a breeze eyes 
forward elbows bent with his left hand tucked into his suit pocket 
there are some people who have the carriage but they are stiff 
and pompous where theres nothing stiff about kennedy said the 
artist who has spent thousands of hours studying her subject i 
think you can see the mans wit the glint of humor in his eye 
the finished 175000 sculpture which has been paid for through 
donations from citizens groups and schoolchildren is scheduled 
for unveiling may 29 which would have been kennedys 72nd birthday 
it will be displayed outside the statehouse near a statue of 
henry cabot lodge the republican whose son kennedy defeated in 
1952 in the us senate campaign that launched his national career 
the john f kennedy memorial commission was established by the 
state legislature in 1983 to create a suitable tribute the 
commission sponsored a yearlong competition for memorial designs 
which drew 300 entries from around the country 
judges debated the former presidents stance demeanor and 
whether both coat buttons should be buttoned the way kennedy 
preferred despite the dicates of style 
history and mcilvain won after it was established kennedy 
had indeed appeared in more than 200 photographs with his 
twobutton coat buttoned contrary to sartorial custom 
i tried to catch his spirit so its not my thinking imposed 
on him as much as its a reflection of him said mcilvain who 
won the commissions approval in april 1988 
he was an extremely charming man but i didnt want the 
superpolished stereotypical person she added citing again the 
hand in the pocket im sure his mother told him endlessly not to 
do it because it sags the pocket out but thats the real john 
kennedy

a polish housewife huddles behind a motley 
collection of childrens clothes and three light bulbs laid out for 
sale on an icy patch of ground 
a west german psychologist says he specializes in the big stuff 
smuggling musical instruments or porcelain from east berlin to the 
western sector and sending back color tvs automobiles with false 
papers and computers 
in east berlin a physical education teacher plies a furtive 
trade as an illegal taxi driver outside the newly opened 
friedrichstrasse subway station near the berlin wall on a good day 
he makes the equivalent of two weeks pay by charging west german 
marks 
all three are part of a black market burgeoning with the 
crumbling of the berlin wall 
it threatens the already frail east germany currency and also 
raises the prospect of a huge underground barter of statesubsided 
east german goods for western luxuries 
east germanys problem of controlling people has been replaced 
by a problem of controlling things said manfred milzer an 
analyst at the statefunded west german institute for economic 
research 
east germanys beleaguered government says it plans to impose 
harsh measures to curb the black market while prodemocracy 
opposition groups have joined state appeals to east germans not to 
use their new freedom to travel for smuggling 
there are no firm estimates of the size of the black market 
east german officials estimate that noneast germans alone will 
have smuggled out 25 billion east german marks worth of subsidized 
goods this year according to the east german daily newspaper 
berliner zeitung at east germanys official rate that equals 
135 billion 
an indicator of a new surge in black market activity is the 
plunge in the value of the east german mark since the communist 
governments abrupt decision nov 9 to let its citizens travel 
freely 
before nov 9 it was officially on a par with west german mark 
and actually exchanged in west germany at 101 since then it has 
fallen as low as 301 
there are reports of east germans many of whom have accumulated 
marks for lack of anything much to buy smuggling out huge 
quantities of money since the border was opened 
the black market had already expanded rapidly this year 
following polands easing of travel restrictions last jan 1 
an openair polish market with more than 1000 smalltime 
traders standing around before their wares operates daily alongside 
a rail line in west berlins kreutzberg district 
the poles there are among up to 10000 a day who pour through 
east germany and cross into west berlin a threehour train ride 
from the polish city of szczecin on the east german border 
some of the traveling poles have developed a regular pattern 
said a customs department spokesman in east berlin they sell in 
west berlin and buy up statesubsized goods in east germany 
these people make up to a 1000 percent profit said the 
official speaking on condition of anonymity in an interview at the 
departments headquarters 
the east german government said milzer spends 50 billion east 
german marks on subsidies about 27 billion onefifth of its 
annual budget 
in black market terms that means a purchaser with west german 
marks can buy a consignment of childrens dresses for the 
equivalent of a few cents apiece 
the first 10 days after the opening of the wall when more than 
6 millon people crossed was a black marketeers dream according 
to a 27yearold psychologist at a drug rehabilitation center in 
west berlin hes been in the black market business for three years 
that first week i got 10 color television sets into east 
berlin just piled into cars he said in an interview speaking 
about his trade on condition of anonymity 
with the gradual easing before nov 9 on crossings by west 
berliners he made three or four a month usually taking west 
german mark profits back to east berlin 
he said he also makes highrisk nighttime exchanges of smuggled 
goods on the transit autobahn that runs through east germany to 
west berlin 
he began he said by helping a few friends in east germany he 
now has a network of 20 east german contacts bolstered in the past 
year by the addition of two polish middlemen they deal mainly 
facetoface and have a code for telephone messages 
he has regular buyers in west berlin but sells pieces of east 
germanys famed meissen porcelain in other west german cities 
because the upsurge in smuggling by poles has depressed prices in 
west berlin 
his major deals he recalled were three cars east germans can 
wait up to 15 years to buy a trabi the natonal make only cars 
less than 4 years old way beyond the means of most east germans 
can be imported 
he buys older cars then buys illegally acquired documents of a 
newer model wrecked in a crash resprays the old vehicle and 
changes the engine and license plates 
for east germans this is the only way to get things or real 
money he said i just cover my expenses but there is big 
money to be made perhaps more now

two of the rarest items ever seen in the west 
letters by soviet dictator joseph stalin were sold at auction in 
london and fetched a total of 30000 
sothebys auction house would not say how it obtained the brief 
scrawled notes pencilled about 1930 on leaves apparently torn from 
notebooks 
both were written to klimenti voroshilov a henchman of stalin 
and onetime commissar of defense 
one note commuted a death sentence on andrei snesaryev a 
bolshevik general to 10 years imprisonment it sold for 22300 
the other telling voroshilov to meet with stalin at a theater 
went for 7700 
sothebys would not say how it obtained the notes which were 
bought by british dealders but they may have come from the 
snesaryev family as eight of the family photographs were included 
with the note about the meeting 
autograph letters or notes by stalin are of the greatest 
rarity as few ever reached the west and i know of nothing in the 
past 10 years said professor chimen abramsky an expert on 
soviet history 
these notes to voroshilov illustrate stalins manner of 
working without the aid of a secretary or a typewriter he said 
abramsky related that snesaryev who spoke 14 languages 
fluently tangled with stalin during the civil war that followed 
the 1917 revolution the dispute was over the conduct of military 
operations near tsaritsyn which made stalins military reputation 
the city was later renamed stalingrad 
snesaryev was condemned to death as a traitor but reprieved he 
was chief of the red army general staff from 1919 to 1921 when he 
published a book on afghanistan warning the soviet union never to 
embark on a war with that country 
abramsky said snesaryev was arrested and condemned again in 1930 
in the notorious stalin purges but reprieved when his wife appealed 
to voroshilov to intervene he died in 1937 
stalin died in 1953 voroshilov in 1969

promoter ted shupe was hoping to ham it up 
again with another porcine grappling extravaganza but there just 
wasnt enough interest in his proposed utah state pig wrestling 
championship 
so rather than root around for contestants he has called the 
thing off 
his advertising for the event carried a nov 20 deadline for 
registration and after checking his mail and returning about half 
a dozen phone calls he announced tuesday that no porkpinning 
event would be held 
shupe said he only had 10 teams signed up with entry fees paid 
eight to 10 others showed interest during the last few days but he 
said he needed 40 
the contest originally scheduled to start today at the weber 
county fairgrounds would have pitted squads of five humans racing

the breaching of the berlin wall cheered 
by many as another step in the democraticization of eastern europe 
gets a wary response from the ultraconservative john birch society 
nothings really changed said executive director g allen 
bubolz the message is still the same 
that message was contained in a fullpage advertisement saturday 
in the chicago suntimes 
the society established in the late 1950s to fight communism 
and expansion of government placed the ad in conjunction with 
polish solidarity leader lech walesas visit to chicago 
its headline was aid to poland hold on a minute and it 
criticized walesas request for more us aid and investment in 
poland 
the us government should hardly be giving away money the 
ad said and financing communiststyle socialism is doubly 
horrendous all programs involving foreign aid should be 
terminated especially those delivering american taxpayers money 
to communists cryptocommunists and collaborators with 
communists 
the birch society was founded in 1958 by 11 men alarmed at the 
growth of communism in the world and what they felt was 
thenpresident eisenhowers failure to fight it 
it was named after john m birch a baptist missionary and us 
army captain killed by chinese communists a few days after world 
war ii it took the motto less government more responsibility 
and with gods help a better world 
bubolz a former insurance executive in appleton said the group 
now claims tens of thousands members who meet in local chapters 
around the nation the society declines to provide exact numbers 
this year the society moved its longtime headquarters from 
belmont mass and san marino calif to appleton a city of 
65000 on the banks of the fox river in northeastern wisconsin it 
operates in a 10000squarefoot office complex 
although communist regimes in poland hungary and other eastern 
european countries appear to be weakening the society remains 
alarmed at the prospect that a new more dominant socialism will 
emerge financed by misguided us aid bubolz said 
the group contends that while travel restrictions have been 
lifted in east germany and free elections have been allowed in 
poland most of the recent changes in eastern europe are cosmetic 
the changes have left observers in the west euphoric but 
bubolz believes true democracies are unlikely in those countries 
john mcmanus an aide to bubolz said the society hopes to 
educate americans about the danger of financing the socalled 
reforms in eastern europe 
the society dismisses the changes initiated by soviet leader 
mikhail gorbachev throughout the communist bloc as ploys intended 
to disarm the united states and gain economic aid he said 
if the united states does not resist the temptation of providing 
economic aid to eastern bloc nations you and i are going to keep 
sovietstyle socialism going mcmanus said 
the communist world is in the greatest economic peril it has 
ever faced so some desperate and dramatic things are going to 
happen to get the financing to keep their things running he said 
bubolz said the societys founders anticipated liberalization of 
the communist bloc communism is only a tool of a larger 
conspiracy to spread a more dominant socialism worldwide he said 
the end result is one world government and what one world 
government means should it be successful is the loss of our 
national sovereignty bubolz said 
mcmanus said his group will continue to spread its message 
through pamphlets lectures videotapes and other media 
what we are is an alternate medium of information he said

guerrillas raided a luxury 
hotel before dawn tuesday trapping eight us green berets who 
barricaded themselves on one floor and remained as night fell and 
other foreigners were evacuated 
red cross spokeswoman marie aude lude said 17 foreigners were 
safely evacuated in the evening following negotiations involving 
the red cross the roman catholic church and the rebels 
she said no us military personnel were among those freed 
all the people are over 30 and none of them looks like an 
american soldier she said it was not known how many other 
foreigners were still in the el salvador sheraton hotel in the 
western part of the capital 
knowledgeable diplomatic sources who insisted on anonymity for 
security reasons said the americans barricaded on the fourth floor 
of an annex to the sheratons main building and would spend the 
night there the eight were described as heavily armed green berets 
from fort bragg nc 
a rebel spokesman in washington listed 15 people he said had 
been evacuated from the fivestory annex three us military 
advisers five israeli military advisers one german citizen five 
salvadoran hotel workers and one guatemalan military adviser 
the rebel spokesman salvador sanabria also said on abcs 
nightline that rebel forces were fired upon by us military 
advisers that could not be confirmed 
col carlos aviles spokesman for el salvadors military told 
the news program from san salvador that a catholic clergyman acting 
as an intermediary had arranged for some foreigners to be evacuated 
aviles said the military would seek to free those holed up in 
the hotel on wednesday 
the americans were barricaded in one or two rooms and controlled 
the fourth floor hallway while the guerrillas were on the third 
and fifth floors 
the army moved tanks and hundreds of soldiers into the western 
neighborhood of escalon to fight the attackers whose assault 
renewed an urban offensive that had appeared to be waning about 
1000 people have been killed since the offensive the largest of 
the decadeold civil war began the night of nov 11 
the bush administration said the united states was making 
plans as necessary to protect the lives of americans white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said no options including military 
ones were ruled out 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said the 
salvadoran armed forces rescued 20 hotel guests including several 
americans from a part of the hotel not penetrated by guerrillas 
no details were given 
the attack comes one day after president bush reaffirmed strong 
us support for president alfredo cristianis rightist government 
the united states has provided about 35 billion to oppose the 
insurgency in which about 71000 people mostly civilians have 
died fiftyfive us military advisers are assigned to el salvador 
soldiers from an armored personnel carrier earlier rescued the 
secretarygeneral of the organization of american states who had 
been in a different part of the sheraton when the guerrillas 
mounted the attack 
joao baena soares the oas chief was evacuated from the hotel a 
few hours later without incident 
a government statement said the armed forces had foiled a 
guerrilla attempt to kidnap baena soares he made no comment but a 
guard answering the phone at the oas headquarters in washington 
said late tuesday that baena soares was ok and hes coming back 
to washington tomorrow 
meanwhile in an apparently unrelated incident a us embassy 
officer was slightly wounded tuesday morning when he was struck by 
what was described as a stray bullet at his home in the escalon 
neighborhood 
embassy spokesman jeff brown said it was completely 
incidental he was not on the scene at the time he was not 
involved he is the only american that was injured in any way today 
that we are aware of 
brown said the victim worked for the agency for international 
development but there was no immediate identification available 
one of the six barricaded americans seen by the ap told 
reporters he had been talking with the rebels at one point and that 
no shots had been fired nor would they shoot unless fired upon 
were here because we dont feel we can leave safely said 
the soldier who declined to provide his name 
col carlos aviles of the salvadoran army said it was unclear 
how many rebels remained on hotel grounds overnight 
one source said there were fears the rebels left behind mines or 
boobytraps after slipping away 
the hotel manager told the ap by telephone there was still 
sporadic firing around the building 
journalists had to leave the area shortly before the overnight 
curfew went into effect at 6 pm 
state department sources said tuesday night that many of the 
guests trapped in the sheraton including several americans had 
been allowed to leave the building in the custody of the red cross 
at 530 pm 630 pm est a halfhour before the curfew 
monsignor gregorio rosa chavez the roman catholic auxiliary bishop 
of san salvador arrived at the hotel for negotiations with the 
guerrillas 
he was accompanied by francois musy head of the international 
red cross office in el salvador and monsignor emil stehe the 
archbishop of ecuador who arrived in salvador last week 
rosa chavez asked the army officer in charge of the troops 
around the hotel to withdraw the soldiers from the hotel grounds 
and he complied the troops pulled back a halfblock 
rose chavez was asked who would be evacuated and he said 
everybody comes out 
a us source said the military men trapped in the raid on one 
wing of the sheraton which is no longer part of the usbased 
hotel chain were on a twoweek training mission and had been 
scheduled to leave tuesday 
the six men seen by the ap were in civilian dress and did not 
identify themselves as us officers but carried m16 rifles and 
spoke of having been in vietnam and of the rules of engagement for 
us advisers 
citing the rules for us military advisers one described what 
he and his companions did when the building came under attack 
we did not fire he said those are the rules of 
engagement unless were fired upon we dont fire 
hotel manager robert nieuwveld who took refuge in an 
administrative office with three employees two guests and an ap 
reporter said about 12 us citizens had been among about 20 
guests trapped in the rear when the guerrillas took it over 
the guerrillas issued a statement saying no one was being held 
hostage 
the objective is to take escalon said a guerrilla in charge 
of an insurgent position about 80 yards from the hotel were 
taking escalon because here the armed forces are not going to 
bombard peoples homes this is where the oligarchy lives

its a safe bet that when the thanksgiving 
feast is over andy ross will boast the cleanest wishbone in town 
after the holiday ross is planning to give his familys turkey 
carcass to some of his hungry employees at the smithsonian 
institutions national museum of natural history so they can enjoy 
the leftovers 
ross is chief of the museums osteological preparation 
laboratory and his employees are hundreds of thousands of tiny 
beetles all voracious flesh eaters that are used to clean the 
delicate bones of birds and mammals for the museums study 
collections 
the teacher of my two preschoolers asked her class to save the 
turkey bones from thanksgiving dinner and bring them to school for 
study ross said i made the mistake of telling her i could do 
it better 
he says his beetles will finish the job in just 24 hours 
these are no ordinary bugs but beetles of the species dermestes 
maculatas which are among natures primary scavengers of carrion 
not to fear they turn up their noses at living creatures 
ross lab contains hundreds of thousands of the beetles in a 
couple of insulated steel bug rooms in a museum courtyard they 
spend their brief lives swarming hungrily over the remains of 
everything from whale skulls to hummingbird wings in 90degree heat 
and constant darkness 
when the beetles have picked everything clean they are given an 
unceremonious heaveho into bug heaven by freezing or fumigation 
after a final gasoline and ammonia bath the bones are ready for 
scholars 
so far this year his beetles have helped the museum clean the 
bones of 5500 birds and mammals keeping up with current 
acquisitions and nibbling away at a backlog of skeletons that dates 
back 70 years 
theyre friendly little things ross says they can give 
you nice clean skeletons with minimal effort 
although theyre always eating on the job and constantly engaged 
in office romances the beetles are model employees in many ways 
they never complain about long hours or lousy working 
conditions they never demand a raise too busy for idle gossip 
they work themselves to death within about three months but they 
are quickly replaced by a younger generation of workaholic 
apprentices 
a few dozen beetles were whetting their thanksgiving appetites 
monday by chowing down on the bones of a wild turkey in a plastic 
box in ross office that started the 37yearold vertebrate 
zoologist to musing about the scientific value of clean bones 
it was wild turkey ross recalled that the pilgrims supposedly 
shared with their indian guests at the first thanksgiving feast in 
massachusetts in 1621 
if some lucky archaeologists could find a buried garbage heap 
from that meal and compare its bones with those of the wild turkey 
in his office ross said we could tell whether the pilgrims 
really ate turkey or just a big chicken

james brady felled by a shot from the same 
gun that wounded president reagan eight years ago says lawmakers 
who dont want handgun controls should try being in my wheels for 
just one day 
in a wheelchair the former white house press secretary appeared 
before a senate panel tuesday to push for a bill that would require 
a sevenday waiting period before buying a handgun 
i had no choice but to be here today because too many members 
of congress have been gutless on this issue brady said they 
have closed their eyes to tragedies like mine they ignore the 
statistics 
it was the first time since brady was shot in the brain during 
the attack on reagan on march 30 1981 that the former 
presidential spokesman had personally lobbied congress on gun 
control 
his wife sarah who appeared at his side has become a leading 
national speaker on the issue as head of the group handgun control 
inc the bill carries their name as the brady bill 
with a strong voice brady said the bill would reduce handgun 
violence he described the impairment he has endured and how it 
destroyed his realized dream of serving as reagans press secretary 
i experience pain pain sometimes so intense i cry he 
said but even that he said is less difficult to endure than his 
loss of independence 
those members of congress who oppose a simple sevenday 
waiting period should try being in my wheels for just one day 
brady said 
you should know what i go through every day i need help 
getting out of bed help taking a shower and help getting dressed 
and damn it i even need help to go to the bathroom 
in addition to providing a coolingoff period for buyers of 
handguns the bill would require that gun dealers obtain 
identifying information and send it to police who would check to 
see if the purchaser was a convicted felon barred by law from 
purchasing a weapon 
the bill is opposed by the national rifle association and by the 
bush administration 
i understand brady said that many of you are intimidated 
by the gun lobby but youve got to look squarely at the facts 
there are too many cowardly lions walking the halls of 
congress he said 
the bush administration says it favors a more limited method for 
checking criminal records 
but mrs brady said the waiting period has proven effective in

alligator steaks in britain california wines 
in france and texasstyle barbecues in west germany are part of 
what some agriculture department observers say is a move by 
european yuppies to go upscale american 
the marketing niche of young urban professionals or yuppies 
that originated in the united states has spread to europe as 
well says the departments foreign agricultural service 
but while sellers in europe are targeting young and affluent 
consumers for their upscale consumption and bulging wallets the 
agency said it may be a bit early to predict whether us exporters 
can benefit significantly 
whatever the european country yuppie food tastes have common 
preferences for high quality convenience and innovation said 
mark condon a trade show manager for the usda agency 
these qualities are part of the market of the future he 
said in our upcoming food exhibits in europe we have a lot of 
the kinds of products that would appeal to yuppies 
those include lowcalorie and lowfat health foods 
nonalcoholic beers hickory chips for barbecue fires ethnic 
foods pictureperfect produce california wines and foods with no 
preservatives or additives 
europeans are marketsavvy people condon said items must 
be of top quality they cant be cheap or discounted 
the rise of yuppie food interests in europe is described in the 
forthcoming december issue of agexporter magazine published by the 
agency 
as in the united states the european yuppie market is 
small the report said but yuppies are trend setters and 
innovators often the first to try a new food or fashion later 
their tastes and preference trickle down to other segments of the 
population gradually being adopted by a broader audience 
so it is important to know what european yuppies are currently 
consuming the report added their tastes however unusual some may 
be today could be the general rule tomorrow 
dale good us agricultural trade officer in hamburg said the 
appeal of american foods to european yuppies varies from country to 
country for example in west germany the products have to be 
compatible with german food traditions 
the concept of eating cuisines from other countries is just 
emerging good said 
but in italy the opposite seems to be the case says us 
agricultural counselor for rome frank piason the current rage is 
for ethnic food especially texmex in the land of pasta 
for the italian yuppie the focus is on lighter eating and 
less fatty food piason said the italian yuppie is likely to 
consume pasta salad or rice salad rather than pasta during 
lunch 
also us wines are popular with the young italians the report 
said thats also the case in france 
while trying to sell us wines in france might seem like 
bringing coal to newcastle the french are actually fascinated with 
us wines said holly higgins who recently completed a twoyear 
assignment as us agricultural attache in paris 
so the plugged in group in france goes for american wines 
and texmex specialities such as chili and enchiladas she said 
microwave ovens also are gaining in france the land of the 
longsimmering sauce higgins said changes in lifestyles more 
working women and less time for cooking are changing eating habits 
david mergen us agricultural attache in madrid says yes 
spain does have yuppies and they can be found in the middle of 
the day at expensive restaurants close to where they work 
spanish yuppies prefer to eat dishes that are low in 
cholesterol and they also tend to drink lighter alcoholic drinks 
mergen said yuppies drink mineral water and fruit juices they 
drink wine with meals however and gin and tonics in the evening 
one of mergens colleagues isabel pastor said the opening of 
several madrid restaurants that serve american food has helped 
promote awareness of us foods at least two of the restaurants 
have names such as hollywood and boston she said 
in britain the preferences of yuppies are also highly varied 
and subject to changing moods of style and trend said marketing 
specialist christine chapman of the us agricultural trade office 
in london but a few of the in foods are alligator steaks and 
spicy creole cooking 
chapman said organic foods are part of the yuppie menu along 
with foreign items such as surimi a processed fish product from 
japan texmex from the united states and kedgeree a dish 
originally from india of rice and chopped fish bound together with 
egg 
champagne is high on the list particularly if it is laced 
with black currant juice or wine she said new world wines from 
the united states and chile are growing in popularity 
even conservative switzerland has a yuppie market according to 
agricultural specialist hansruedi bachmann of the us embassy in 
bern more than the average consumer the swiss yuppie is attracted 
by us foods especially california wines 
swiss yuppies however do not eat fast food bachmann said 
instead they frequent luxury type restaurants with an upscale 
highquality image

when he chats with kids president bush 
sometimes says the darndest things 
in what other forum for instance would he have revealed that 
he showered with pet millie after the spaniel rolled in something 
bad 
where else would he give this advice on youthful presidential 
aspirations its fun to dream about stuff 
sometimes his playful banter with groups of children for whom 
bush seems to have a special affinity may even shed light on the 
current state of the presidential mind 
for example in giving equal billing to his meeting with denver 
broncos quarterback john elway and his upcoming summit with soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev bush seemed to be voicing his 
administrations basic ambivalence about the summit whether to 
talk it up or talk it down 
granted the audience was made up of fifth graders so the 
president tended to oversimplify during a visit this week to 
chicagos pickard elementary school 
the purpose of the visit was to talk about the war against 
drugs but soon the conversation turned to how he liked his job 
sometimes it feels good and sometimes it feels less good but 
most of the time its wonderful because i like my job and i like a 
lot of parts of it he said 
you know what i got to do i got to meet the quarterback for 
the denver broncos football team and i know chicago bears coach 
mike ditka and i know some of the others so i get some fun stuff 
to do in sports 
in the next breath he told the kids were going off to meet 
mr gorbachev and in a week or so youre going to be reading all 
about that because it will be in every paper 
and why are we doing it well were trying to make the world 
a little more peaceful we want it to be a place where you grow up 
that you dont have to worry about having to go off to war 
later speaking to grownups at a republican fundraiser in rhode 
island on monday bush first declared this is going to be a 
historic meeting 
but then he softened that considerably i dont want to see 
overpromise coming from it 
the next day presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater was 
asked whether the summit which fitzwater wont even acknowledge 
is a summit unless he slips was to be historic or not 
this is a historic meeting that we dont want to 
overpromise fitzwater said on his first try 
on his second pass at the question he said i think everybody 
realizes that it is historic if only because its happening in 
historic times 
bush who has five adult children and 11 grandchildren has no 
difficulty getting kids to talk with him 
at the chicago session he was asked how did you get to be 
president 
well i was in politics a long time and i was in business and 
i worked hard bush said he recounted his first defeat in 
seeking a senate seat his unsuccessful 1980 presidential bid and 
his eight years as ronald reagans vice president 
and youve got to learn that if somebody says something ugly 
about you dont worry about it i used to be very worried when i 
was much younger 15 20 years ago somebody said something that 
was critical i would worry about that i dont worry about that 
any more 
bush a millionaire was asked are all presidents rich 
in our history some didnt have much money at all and that 
certainly should never be a requirement he said 
and oh yes how was his dog millie doing 
oh shes wonderful i dont want to say this in front of 
anybody but i had to take her in the shower yesterday and give her 
a bath because she rolled in something bad i mean really bad 
and so barbara my wife said would you mind giving millie a 
bath so even when youre president youve got to do some stuff 
that isnt too good or fun but when she slept up on our bed last 
night she was very clean and she smelled real clean

untrained and unrecognized artistic talent goes on display today 
at the smithsonian institutions national museum of american art 
the 182 objects in the exhibit includes portraits landscapes 
trade and shop signs weathervanes whirligigs toys pottery 
furniture quilts and carved figures most of them produced in the 
18th and 19th centuries 
they are some of the finest works from the collection of more 
than 2600 objects at the abby aldrich rockefeller folk art center 
which opened in 1957 at colonial williamsburg in virginia many 
objects in the touring exhibition have not been seen outside 
williamsburg for decades 
the nucleus of that museum which claims the finest public 
collection of american folk art in the world were the 420 works 
bequeathed by the wife of john d rockefeller jr a founder of the 
museum of modern art in new york who began buying the works of 
early untrained american artists in the 1920s 
many of the works were created by craftsmen or selftaught 
artists like wilhelm schimmel a vagrant from pennsylvanias 
cumberland valley who carved small animals and birds in exchange 
for food and drink and john brewster jr a deafmute who earned a 
living painting portraits such as boy with a finch which has 
become an icon of american folk art 
among the most popular paintings in the show is baby in red 
chair the familiar image of a smiling sleeping baby in a high 
chair produced by an unknown early 19th century artist probably 
from pennsylvania 
other pictures are by such widely known early american artists 
as edward hicks erastus salisbury field and ammi phillips four 
20th century objects in the exhibit signify the rockefeller

the nations drug problem is so threatening 
that the press must abandon its customary role as a mere observer 
and become part of the solution says katharine graham chairman of 
the washington post co 
some of our reporting can help show ways out of the abyss and 
show some possible solutions to these great problems mrs graham 
told a press audience 
delivering the frank e gannett lecture an annual affair to 
which many leaders of washingtons journalism community are 
invited mrs graham said tuesday night that to prepare the speech 
and get a better grasp of the drug scene she recently went into 
the city to see some parts of washington where the crisis is most 
severe 
i can tell you that we have yet to fully appreciate the 
farreaching consequences of drug abuse she said its not 
only a question of violence in the drugriddled area of the cities 
indeed police sweeps have driven much of the overt drug activity 
here inside much worse is the time bomb ticking away 
mrs graham recalled that after the watergate scandal a friend 
told her it was the posts responsibility to help rebuild faith in 
government but she disagreed our responsibility is to tell 
people what is going on she replied 
i still believe that is true but today the answer is more 
complex she said certainly it is not the role of the press to 
fix the problems of society and yet we occupy a unique position 
that enables us to be part of the solution 
she cited the thousands of babies who are born addicted 
diseased or disabled and asked what will happen when they hit the 
school system she noted the thousands of youths whose role models 
are drug addicts and who are primed for failure 
and she said attention must be paid to the ethics of 
middleclass whites who participate in the drug culture such as 
city merchants selling 250 sneakers 
she quoted one of the posts reporters were still just 
gawking at the problem 
she said the press must take care in telling these dreadful 
stories that the public does not tune out and along with 
reporters become desensitized 
moreover the press must recognize a simmering distrust of 
the media in the black community and must make sure its reporting 
standards and its practices are fair and colorblind 
but mostly she said the press can use its news and opinion 
pages to help point to solutions 
im not talking about feel good stories that gloss over 
problems and generalize solutions in vaguely optimistic terms 
she said im talking about substantive reporting on what people 
and institutions are doing to cope with and try to overcome the 
problems we face

the environmental protection agency which 
monitors and regulates the nations air quality doesnt have to go 
far in the search for sick air only to its own headquarters 
the epa acknowledged tuesday it has major indoor air pollution 
problems after a survey of employees at its headquarters found as 
many as 40 percent complain of headaches dizziness and other 
ailments they blame on the air at the office 
senior epa officials promised to move as quickly as possible to 
correct the situation and make epa a truly healthful place to 
work 
union leaders praised the effort but noted workers complaints 
about poor office air quality and its unhealthy effects were 
largely ignored for years 
epa employees have a long history of buildingrelated 
illnesses and a deteriorating indoor air environment said bob 
carton an official of the national federation of federal 
employees which represents some epa workers 
union officials said similar problems can be found in other 
offices and are too often ignored 
this same legacy of inattention and neglect about indoor 
pollution is one that is played out not only at epa but in many 
other federal state and private sector buildings both in washington 
and around the country said kirby biggs chairman of the health 
and safety committee of the american federation of government 
employees 
many of the epa health problems have been blamed on poor air 
circulation and chemicals alleged to come from carpeting at the 
agencys maze of offices over a southwest washington shopping mall 
because indoor air quality is an emerging field we do not 
have a scientific baseline to gauge where our facilities rank in 
terms of other buildings said charles l grizzle assistant epa 
administrator for resource management however we regard the 
level of employee health problems reported in the survey to be 
unacceptable 
earlier this year epa administrator william reilly ordered a 
series of reports on air quality in epa headquarter offices and the 
employee survey of 4900 epa employees was the first of the reports 
to be made public special monitoring for pollutants is underway at 
more than 100 locations within the office complex to try to 
determine the cause of the problem 
eightyone percent of the epas headquarters employees responded 
to the questions including 1400 workers who added described their 
health problems and concerns in greater detail 
according to the survey at least 40 percent of the 3995 
workers who responded complained of ailments associated with poor 
indoor air quality these included complaints of frequent 
headaches dizziness fatigue mucous membrane irritation and 
tearing or itching eyes 
about 10 percent of the respondents said they experienced such 
problems frequently or always when at work and that conditions 
improved when they left the epa offices 
concerns about the air quality at the epa headquarters emerged 
in late 1987 when several employees became ill after the agency 
began installing 27000 square yards of new carpeting union 
officials say some of those workers still cannot work in their 
former offices without becoming nauseous breaking out in hives or 
having breathing difficulty said carton the union official 
the epa recently began removing some of that carpeting which 
workers complain is giving off unhealthy chemicals a 
labormanagement health and safety committee has been formed to 
identify problems and set priorities for corrective action 
said grizzle

the mood was triumphant on 
wenceslas square as more than 150000 people gathered to hear 
banned playwright vaclav havel and other leading dissidents report 
on their firstever meeting with authorities 
it was the opposition leaders first address to the masses after 
12 long and lonely years of campaigning for human rights 
havel 53 czechoslovakias bestknown dissident excused his 
brevity with the quip that if he said everything he wanted to they 
would be standing in freezing temperatures until the microphones 
were turned off 
but the rev vaclav maly a roman catholic priest summed up the 
mood when he told them we are grateful to all of you that we can 
speak at this thrilling exciting time pregnant with expectation 
he spoke tuesday just after the opposition posted a big 
breakthrough a meeting with communist premier ladislav adamec 
the city was electric with excitement and the tension was 
palpable because of widespread rumors that police planned a major 
crackdown on demonstrations following mondays march through prague 
by about 200000 people 
students hurriedly distributed leaflets appealing to the 
population to stay calm and steer clear of any provocations 
grabbing bowls of soup or food provided by sympathetic citizens 
students at the damu acting school one of the centers of a 
student strike hammered furiously at typewriters and shouted 
orders to each other 
outside a large national flag and a banner with the words if 
not now when if not us who fluttered in the breeze 
curious passersby many wearing ribbons in the national colors 
of red white and blue clustered at the windows of scores of 
shops restaurants and offices plastered with protests and 
petitions denouncing fridays brutal police attack on peaceful 
students calling for democratic change 
it was the brutality and the example of the tumultuous changes 
in east germany until last month the closest ally of pragues 
hardline government that provided the longawaited spark for mass 
prodemocracy protests in czechoslovakia 
the wenceslas square rally was haunted by the presence of those 
who were not there communist leaders whose resignation was loudly 
demanded and at least 30 political prisoners 
as long as there is a single political prisoner we cannot 
talk about a fundamental change in the political climate said 
milan hruska a miner who helped found the new civic forum 
opposition movement and the only worker to speak so far there has 
been little involvement by workers in the protest movement 
maly read an emotional appeal by cardinal frantisek tomasek for 
everybody to work for change 
we must be free to elect a government that will be for us not 
against us the 90yearold cardinal said in the message his 
words provoked a roar of free elections free elections from 
the tightly packed crowd 
an almost eerie silence settled over the vast square before the 
crowd followed marta kubisova an officially banned folk singer and 
heroine of the 1968 movement in an emotional rendition of the 
national anthem 
thousands raised their fingers in the vforvictory sign

prosecutors say charity began at home for the 
woman known as robin hud who was charged with stealing 56 
million from the department of housing and urban development and 
claimed she gave much of it to the poor 
former escrow agent marilyn louise harrell was indicted by a 
federal grand jury tuesday on fraud and embezzling charges in one 
of the most prominent cases stemming from the hud scandal 
testifying before congressional committees investigating 
mismanagement and political favoritism at the agency during the 
reagan administration harrell admitted taking money she was 
supposed to hold in escrow for the government 
federal authorities said tuesday she spent most of the money on 
herself her family and her friends buying 40 cars making house 
payments and purchasing a 2500 tv console and other items 
the single largest charity by far was herself said 
breckinridge l willcox us attorney for maryland 
she gives charity a bad name hud secretary jack kemp told 
reporters 
harrell 46 was charged with embezzling 56 million from hud 
making false statements to the federal government and making false 
statements in connection with a loan application if convicted she 
could be fined up to 1 million sentenced to up to 22 years in 
prison and ordered to make restitution 
attorney general dick thornburgh said the case appeared to be 
the largest single theft of government funds charged against an 
individual 
oh lordy lordy harrell said when informed of the 
indictment she said her attorney advised her to plead innocent 
most of what i gave to my family was my own money money that 
i had legitimately earned said harrell who is now unemployed 
and working on a book about herself i dont understand why they 
want to make it sound like i am such a terrible person 
harrell is one of a dozen escrow agents suspected of keeping 
more than 10 million from the sale of homes whose owners defaulted 
on governmentinsured mortgagages she is the second of the agents 
to be charged 
two weeks after she testified in congress hud seized her house 
in washingtons maryland suburbs as well as several other 
properties she said she purchased with hud money to help charities 
and homeless families 
according to willcox about 625000 of the embezzled funds have 
been recovered from harrell im not sure theres a whole lot 
left he said 
willcox said harrell has cooperated with investigators 
by her own accounting last june harrell spent 135 million to 
buy and rehabilitate 16 homes for needy families 810000 on 
salaries for excriminals employed by her construction company 
450000 in donations to seven charities 368000 on payments and 
insurance for 40 cars given to individuals and charities and 
300000 for a shelter being built by maryland suburban rescue 
charlotte chepaitis who worked with harrell to take care of 
poor people in baltimore denied prosecutors statements that 
harrell was merely helping herself 
they dont know what theyre talking about when they say mrs 
harrell never did anything to help the poor she said but she 
added that harrell did not require an accounting of her money 
we didnt keep any books chepaitis said the books was 
kept only by god he carried the pencil and paper and jesus said 
do your alms in secret and the father in heaven will reward you 
several members of congress have accused the justice department 
of failing to aggressively prosecute hudrelated crimes 
the departments statement announcing the indictment indirectly 
responded to such criticism noting that the government had 
obtained 140 hudrelated convictions nationwide in fiscal 1989 and 
nearly 600 in the last four years 
most of those cases have involved individuals charged with 
defrauding hud loan programs congressional critics have said 
thornburgh shows little zeal for investigating former top agency 
officials and prominent republicans who participated in hud 
programs found to have been tainted by political influence 
thornburgh has rejected the criticism as partisan sniping

nicaraguas government is planning to call for 
an emergency meeting of central american presidents following a 
breakdown in ceasefire talks between the sandinistas and the 
contra rebels 
the negotiations were suspended tuesday night after the contras 
refused to go along with a sandinista demand for a partial 
withdrawal of rebel forces to base camps in honduras 
that was the leftist governments price for agreeing to a 
ceasefire but the contras declined to go beyond a pledge not to 
infiltrate more troops from base camps in honduras 
the chief contra negotiator col enrique bermudez blamed the 
sandinistas for suspension of the talks saying the rebels were 
willing to continue efforts to work out an agreement 
but an american negotiating for the sandinistas paul reichler 
said that when the talks reconvened tuesday afternoon at an 
organization of american states office everybody realized we had 
come to an impasse nobody suggested we keep talking 
the talks were convened nov 9 eight days after president 
daniel ortega suspended a ceasefire that had been in effect on an 
informal basis for 19 months ortega said the contras had been 
engaging in widespread terrorist activities 
the contras and the state department warned ortega might be 
laying the groundwork for postponing national elections set for 
feb 25 but ortega has insisted the elections will take place as 
planned 
tuesday morning tinoco issued what he called a major 
concession dropping a previous demand for the total withdrawal of 
contra forces and insisting that about 2300 about half the 
estimated total in nicaragua pull back to the base camps in 
honduras 
but the contras maintained that a withdrawal of forces to a 
neighboring country had no precedent in any ceasefire negotiation 
with adequate unsponsored verification the contras maintained 
the peace could be assured without a rebel withdrawal 
tinoco insisted a separation of forces was necessary to 
avoid the type of situation which has prevailed in el salvador 
where all ceasefires have been shortlived 
he said the contra refusal to withdraw troops to honduras 
shows they are not interested in peace he also criticized the 
state department for doing absolutely nothing to facilitate an 
agreement 
in calling for the withdrawal of 2300 contras to honduras 
tinoco said that is the number of rebels who have infiltrated into 
nicaragua over the past several weeks 
contra spokesman bosco matamoros insisted there was no contra 
infiltration only a rotation of forces but earlier this 
month the state department confirmed an infiltration had indeed 
taken place 
mediators from the organization of american states and the 
united nations issued a statement tuesday night saying they will 
remain in contact with both sides so they can reconvene the 
discussions at the earliest date 
after the talks broke down reichler said the sandinistas may 
demand the honduran government expel the remaining rebels from the 
base camps the contras have been using for years 
they the hondurans have a legal obligation to do that 
anyway reichler said more than 6000 rebels are at the honduran 
camps sustained by ussupplied food shelter clothing and 
medical services 
combined with the escalating violence in el salvador the 
suspension of the talks cast doubt on the future of the central 
american peace process 
at their most recent meeting last august central american 
presidents called for the demobilization of the contras by dec 5 
and there was some optimism at the time that a peaceful settlement 
might be reached

military spending bill despite disappointment that it includes the 
first budget reductions in the star wars missile defense system 
the bill the president signed late tuesday provides 38 billion 
in fiscal year 1990 for star wars also known as the strategic 
defense initiative and less than the administration requested for 
the b2 stealth bomber program 
working from a stack of legislation approved by congress as it 
rushed to leave town for the year bush also signed 
a measure to guarantee reparations to japaneseamericans 
interned in us camps during world war ii the provision part of 
a 172 billion appropriation for the state justice and commerce 
departments contains no money for the estimated 60000 camp 
survivors but says up to 500 million would be provided as an 
entitlement in 1991 
congress has authorized 20000 for each survivor a total of 
12 billion 
a ban on smoking on virtually all domestic airline flights an 
expansion of current rules forbidding passengers from lighting up 
on routes lasting two hours or less the new regulations take 
effect 96 days after signing which would be feb 25

funds for the food and drug administrations fight against aids 
the 157 billion labor health and education appropriations 
bill stripped of abortion provisions that prompted a veto earlier 
the 34 billion district of columbia appropriations bill also 
stripped of abortion provisions to which the president objected and 
which led to yet another earlier veto 
the defense bill provides 11 billion less than bush requested 
for this year for the star wars program the first budget reduction 
in the program in its sixyear history 
bush said he was disappointed by the cut and expressed hope that 
congress would support the administrations future requests 
the measure provides 43 billion for two b2 stealth bombers 
430 million and one plane less than the administration sought in 
the fiscal year that began oct 1 
the money also will be used for some advance procurement costs 
for five planes to be bought in fiscal 1991 and for spare parts 
approximately 11 billion is included for the 10warhead 
railbased mx and the singlewarhead truckbased midgetman nuclear 
missiles

robert fulghum sometimes tells strangers hes a 
nun or a taxidermist with a fondness for bears not the 
bestselling author he is 
fulghum wrapping up a promotional tour for the book it was on 
fire when i lay down on it said fellow airplane passengers 
invariably ask him what do you do he often doesnt give a 
straight answer 
the 52yearold author of two books of short inspirational 
essays that top the new york times list of bestselling 
nonfiction has been dreaming up stories since he was a boy 
its a way to keep your mind alive he said tuesday 
what i like to do is engage my seatmate in a game of 
imagination said fulghum who has been traveling frequently 
these days for the rest of the flight we pretend to be something 
we always wanted to try being 
once i was a nun that was great from san diego to phoenix 
yesterday i was a taxidermist he recalled telling one fellow 
passenger a systems analyst who confessed he always wanted to be a 
plumber 
todays creative thought often has been the start of something 
big for fulghum a former unitarian minister who lives on a 
houseboat within view of seattles skyscrapers 
his first book all i really need to know i learned in 
kindergarten made the times list three weeks after it was 
published last year about 125 million hardcover copies are in 
print and 15 million in paperback 
it was on fire was published in september and quickly pulled 
into second place on the times list behind the conversational 
kindergarten 
the new books title comes from a newspaper story that described 
the rescue of a man from a smoldering bed when rescuers asked how 
the fire started the man said i dont know it was on fire when 
i lay down on it fulghum wrote 
he said the mans answer was a lifestory in a sentence out 
of the frying pan into the hot water 
the first book came about in a roundabout way 
after attending a unitarian seminary in berkeley calif 
fulghum decided to revise his philosophy he whittled a 400plus 
page statement of beliefs to a list he read at a private school 
anniversary in seattle 
daniel j evans a us senator from washington at the time was 
in the audience he liked it so much he read it into the 
congressional record 
the list spread a church bulletin in kansas city mo 
published it the kansas city times ran a copy friends sent 
mimeographed copies to friends 
and a connecticut teacher sent a copy home with her class one 
students mother a literary agent contacted fulghum to see if he 
had more observations on life 
fulghum had boxes 
the first time i saw his manuscript was on a friday 
afternoon said diane reverand executive editor and vice 
president at villard books fulghums publisher 
i was working late and picked it up i read the first essay 
and had a visceral reaction mrs reverand said we bought it 
on monday 
what sold mrs reverand and millions of readers is the way 
fulghum makes life seem simple 
these are complicated times everyone feels overwhelmed 
mrs reverand said but he gets us back to basics theres a 
comfort to his message that things arent as complicated as they 
seem to be 
one example is the lesson of the sandbox share everything be 
fair dont hurt others dont hit put things back where you found 
them clean up your own mess 
fulghum born in waco texas led a lonely life where making up 
stories became a way to pass time in his strict baptist home 
during the late 1950s he lived as a beatnik and studied zen in 
a japanese monastery but he discovered he already knew what he 
needed to know 
when the book promotion is done fulghum will head to a quiet 
place in utah with a reading list that includes italian novelist 
umberto eco a couple of guides to sharpening knives and a book of 
milton berles 10000 best jokes 
my own books are letters to a friend theyre meant to be read 
that way fulghum said when people ask me what i do i never 
answer writer im not like faulkner im more of a letter 
writer 
fulghum fans can expect to see another book of essays once hes 
finished campaigning for the reelection next year of a friend 
rep jim mcdermott dwash but they wont see fulghums oneliners 
on coffee cups or tshirts 
i had to turn em down he said he also turned down a 
television production company that was planning a situation comedy 
based on his life john denver would have played him 
and what of the proceeds of his books he said hell turn them 
over to his children who are all married in exchange for a 
regular salary when he turns 55 
he didnt want to discuss his earnings ivy books reportedly 
paid 21 million for paperback rights to kindergarten the 
price was a record for a nonfiction book 
fame and fortune can destroy happiness he said i was 
happy before all this started and with any luck ill survive it

the camera work wont win any awards and the plot 
dragged a bit but the first television coverage of the house of 
commons won generally favorable reviews today 
the cameras took the first peek tuesday at proceedings in 
parliaments lower house the start of a controversial eightmonth 
experiment 
the british broadcasting corp independent television news and 
sky television all reported calls from satisfied viewers 
the first televised session was a debate on a speech given 
earlier tuesday by queen elizabeth ii in the house of lords the 
queen outlined proposed legislation that prime minister margaret 
thatchers conservative government will introduce in the coming 
year 
the queens speech an annual event carried out amid colorful 
pageantry is written by the government of the day the house of 
lords which has had tv cameras since 1985 is the unelected upper 
chamber of parliament 
independent television news said in a statement the commons 
pictures are fairly stiff but not as bad as we might have feared 
most of the viewers who have called us said they liked it although 
one man from dagenham said it sent him to sleep 
tony hall head of news and current affairs at bbctv said the 
live coverage from the eight remotecontrol cameras was exciting 
and lively but he added we still dont have the full flavor of 
the house because of the restrictions imposed on us but we were 
pleased 
the bbc expects big ratings for tuesdays program but said 
official viewing figures will not be known for at least a week 
the times said in an editorial for the great majority who 
have never seen the commons at work the first opportunity to 
see the commons as they are made riveting television 
the 650member commons which voted 318264 in february 1988 to 
allow television coverage has appointed an independent company to 
operate the cameras and sell the pictures to the bbc and other 
broadcasters 
mrs thatcher was among those who opposed letting the cameras 
in saying she feared for the good reputation of the house which 
is often disrupted by noisy scenes 
the house has ruled that when proceedings get rowdy the cameras 
must shun the disturbance and focus on house speaker bernard 
weatherill 
wideangle shots are allowed at other times but the house has 
said for the most part cameras should go for headandshoulders 
shots of the legislator speaking at any one time 
reaction shots are forbidden unless a legislator is specifically 
referred to by the member speaking at the time 
british news reports noted that a brawl on the floor of the west 
german parliament can be freely shown and that president mikhail s 
gorbachevs soviet parliament like others in the eastern bloc 
give broadcasters more leeway than does the commons 
the bbc noted in news reports that television has come to the 
commons 30 years after its introduction in west germany and 10 
years after cameras were first allowed in the us house 
the us senate has had the cameras since 1986 
radio broadcasting from the commons began 14 years ago and 
newspaper reporters were first let into the house 218 years ago 
the first televised speech from the commons was by conservative 
legislator ian gow who to loud shouts of hear hear from 
supporters said i have always voted against the televising of 
the proceedings of this house and i expect that i always will 
but weatherill who approves of the cameras said in a bbc 
interview tuesday that he hoped television would show the house 
of commons at work as it really is

congress yielded today to the complaints of 
many older americans and voted to repeal a farreaching medicare 
expansion designed to protect retirees against being bankrupted by 
a catastrophic illness 
republican lawmakers said president bush will sign the repeal 
by voice vote this morning the senate accepted a house demand 
that the law be repealed the house had restated its position by a 
34655 vote tuesday night 
sen john mccain rariz who had tried to salvage parts of the 
program called the votes a victory for the nations seniors 
because an income surtax on higherincome retirees was repealed 
but he expressed disappointment that valuable benefits also were 
lost 
senate majority leader george j mitchell dmaine decried the 
votes by repealing the legislation we havent repealed the 
problem he said congress must return next year to deal with the 
problems of the aging of the population of this country and the 
growing need for health care mitchell said 
rep henry waxman dcalif an author of the original law but 
backer of repeal seemed to agree the only sensible thing for 
congress to do is repeal it and come back next year and figure 
out something on catastrophic that the elderly want and they are 
willing to pay for he said 
the surtax on higherincome retirees which was the target of 
most of the complaints against the program would be repealed 
retroactive to jan 1 the date it took effect the 4amonth 
special premium that most medicare recipients are paying would 
remain in effect through dec 31 
the extended hospital coverage that has been available to 
retirees this year would expire at yearend along with liberalized 
skilled nursing care scheduled limits on outofpocket expenses 
for doctors bills and prescriptions would die before taking effect 
when congress returns on jan 23 said sen orrin hatch rutah 
well be listening to our constituents horror stories about 
seniors being forced out of hospitals because we have repealed the 
extended hospitalcare benefit 
we are going to see on the first of the year whopping 
increases in medigap insurance premiums predicted rep willis 
gradison rohio referring to the private insurance policies that 
many older americans have bought to provide coverage beyond regular 
medicare benefits 
some insurance companies have predicted those private policies 
could cost up to 25 a month more when the catastrophic benefits 
are wiped out 
the farreaching expansion of the medicare program was enacted 
last year with broad support in both parties but many retirees 
began flooding congress with complaints after learning that the 56 
percent with the highest incomes would have to pay the surtax of up 
to 800 a year 
other complaints came from seniors who already had private or 
employerprovided policies protecting against catastrophic expenses 
senators yielded to repeal only after the house rejected the 
senates final proposal it would have repealed the surtax but used 
the monthly premium to pay for limited hospital coverage and a 
package of minor benefits including mammograms home health care 
and hospice care 
repeal would leave many of the 328 million retirees without 
insurance coverage or finances to pay hospital doctor and drug 
bills associated with a major illness 
under the catastrophic law a retiree hospitalized for 150 days 
this year for example has to pay only 560 even if there were 
two or more separate hospital stays without catastrophic 
protection the outofpocket bill would be 21560 for one stay 
and even more for multiple stays 
repeal would wipe out these major benefits 
hospital a 560ayear limit on outofpocket hospital 
expenses patients would be liable for coinsurance on part of a 
stay and for separate deductibles for multiple stays in a year 
doctors fees starting in 1990 a ceiling of 1370 on 
outofpocket expenses repeal would leave the voluntary part b 
coverage which older americans buy with a monthly premium but 
regular part b has no limit on outofpocket expenses 
drugs starting in 1991 60 percent of drug costs after the 
patient pays 600 a year out of pocket the share would rise to 80 
percent in 1993 
nursing up to 150 days a year of skilled care in a nursing 
facility after patient pays a daily rate of 2550 for eight days 
regular medicare covers far less and only after patient has spent 
at least three days in a hospital

deposits of surplus food at the nations food banks have 
declined this year as the ranks of bank patrons the poor and 
hungry continue to grow 
the federal government and private corporations are donating 
less food to private charities than in the past according to food 
bank officials in several cities 
at the same time said kevin fagan director of development for 
the greater philadelphia food bank theres no question that 
demand is just flying through the ceiling 
food bankers blame the decline in part on a frenzied pace of 
corporate takeovers that have left food industry executives glued 
to the bottom line and less concerned about the needy 
i think corporations are not as generous as they have been in 
the past said rodney bivens executive director of the oklahoma 
city food bank where contributions were down 41 percent by the end 
of september 
donations have picked up slightly since then bivens said but 
are far from meeting the rising demand for food the reality is 
the agencies that we serve end up giving out less he said 
once a poor family might have been able to count on a loaf of 
bread with sandwich meat in its weekly food bag from a charitable 
organization now bivens said the bag may contain two loaves of 
bread but no meat 
donations to the philadelphia organization are down at least 15 
percent from last year 
the ultimate loser is obviously the most needy of us all 
said fagan 
the organization is fairly typical of the 200 food banks that 
have sprung up around the nation since the first one was 
established in phoenix in 1967 
about half its food comes from second harvest a chicagobased 
distributor of surplus food that is the largest single supplier for 
most food banks second harvest collects products that are 
considered unmarketable by major corporations because they are 
mislabeled underweight or overweight too close to an expiration 
date discontinued or repackaged 
the rest of the banks donations come from local sources 
supermarkets manufacturers charitable organizations or private 
individuals 
the food is distributed to a network of local organizations that 
are involved in one way or another with feeding the needy 
although some food banks say their local contributions remain 
steady all have been hurt by the first year of decline at second 
harvest since the organization was founded more than 10 years ago 
corporate contributions are expected to be down 16 percent this 
year from last 
the decline would be even larger second harvest officials say 
were it not for a spurt of corporate charity following hurricane 
hugo and the northern california earthquake 
the federal government used to supply a substantial portion of 
the food given out by private organizations but that amount has 
been shrinking too second harvest officials say they received 172 
million pounds of surplus government food in 1987 but half that 
amount in 1988 and this year 
the us department of agriculture estimates it will distribute 
239 million pounds of food to charitable organizations this year 
down from 272 million pounds the previous year 
the main reason for the decline usda spokesman phil shanholtzer 
said is a sharp drop in the amount of surplus dairy products in 
part because of a change in federal price support payments 
the president of second harvest philip r warth jr said the 
change hit food banks hard after that he said the drop in 
corporate support was a downturn coming on the heels of a bigger 
downturn 
warth said the slowdown in the corporate spigot is partially due 
to the merger mania that has swept the food industry in recent 
years but he refused to say which companies have become less 
generous food bankers are acutely sensitive about biting the hand 
that feeds their clients 
we still consider the nature of our relationship to be very 
much a partnership so our task is to very gently tug on the 
coattails of the industry warth said 
the directors of several food banks did name some companies 
that they claimed have been donating less since being purchased 
by other corporations among those named repeatedly were pillsbury 
general foods kraft and nabisco 
but officials at three of those companies all but kraft 
denied that they were giving less those at pillsbury and general 
foods said they were giving more a spokeswoman for kraft which 
merged with philip morris last year said she didnt know how much 
the company was giving second harvest

the army ousted five soldiers from an elite 
combat unit and stripped an officer of his command after a 
20yearold soldier committed suicide reportedly because he was 
hazed by his comrades 
the shakeup in givati brigade came after saturdays suicide of 
eli shahar a brigade sergeant 
maj gen matan vilnai head of the armys southern command 
decided the five soldiers are no longer worthy of serving in the 
givati brigade the army said in a statement on tuesday 
the army said vilnai removed shahars company commander from his 
post and reprimanded a senior officer who served as a regiment 
commander the five soldiers ousted from givati are being 
investigated by the military police the statement said 
the suicide brought criticism from legislators and warnings that 
the harsh methods used to put down the 23month palestinian 
uprising were creeping into soldiers behavior towards each other 
shahar shot himself at a base in the israeliannexed golan 
heights on saturday the givati brigade is often assigned to quell 
riots in the occupied west bank and gaza strip shahar reportedly 
had asked for reassignment 
israeli newspapers reported that the suicide was triggered by 
harassment from fellow soldiers during a mock trial staged to 
punish shahar for removing his helmet during target practice 
legislator sarah doron of the rightwing likud bloc urged that 
steps be taken to prevent similar hazing incidents 
we have to ensure that such an ugly and dangerous thing 
doesnt happen again she said in a letter quoted by the yediot 
ahronot daily 
initial findings of the army probe published by two newspapers 
tuesday show the soldiers roused shahar from sleep for the mock 
trial after being ordered by the company commander to give him a 
motivation lecture 
the unit commander entered the tent during the trial and brought 
it to an abrupt halt the maariv daily said 
but the officer then reportedly ordered shahar punished by 
serving two hours guard duty wearing a helmet it was after the 
order that shahar shot himself

both houses passed and sent to the president 
early today a package of reforms for management of the department 
of housing and urban development legislation that grew out of the 
multibilliondollar scandals that have rocked hud 
both houses acted by voice vote 
the package includes hud reforms proposed by secretary jack kemp 
and by both house and senate housing subcommittee members that 
arose from congressional investigations of the departments fraud 
influencepeddling and political favoritism scandals 
the action came after a house panel last week stripped away a 
larger proposal to revamp federal housing programs some democrats 
had hoped to keep the two linked as a way to force congressional 
action on the housing program revision but they relented and 
agreed to push through the reform package alone before congress 
ended its session for the year 
the bill requires that consultants and lobbyists working on hud 
programs register with the department and identify for whom they 
are working as well as any fees they receive recipients of hud 
grants would have to report their use of consultants and lobbyists 
hud would be required to publish notices of funding availability 
and application procedures selection criteria and other 
information including any waivers of regulations as a way to 
prevent subsidy awards based on insider information 
other provisions would 
create a new hud chief financial officers position as well as 
a comptroller of the federal housing administration to oversee 
financial management 
apply new restrictions on the section 8 moderate rehabilitation 
program which provided subsidies for renovating lowincome housing 
that were at the heart of evidence of influencepeddling and 
political favoritism in the hud scandals 
make it illegal for consultants to sell their influence in 
securing housing subsidies for a contingent fee or a perunit fee 
as occurred during the reagan administration 
strengthen the secretarys ability to enforce new hud laws with 
civil money penalties against developers consultants applicants 
and mortgage lenders it would restrict the secretarys ability to 
use discretion in awarding housing assistances 
the senate deleted a proposal by kemp to require a greater focus 
on antipoverty uses for awards made under the community development 
block grant program it also deleted a prohibition against fha 
loans for vacation homes or investment homes provisions to protect 
the inspector general from dismissal and to give him the power to 
subpoena were deleted in the house 
the senate also added provisions that extend many of the hud 
reforms to the farmers home administration which oversees rural 
housing programs and is under the department of agriculture

nevada legislators voted unanimously to 
erase a 300 percent pension increase they gave themselves last june 
and hope voter outrage that forced the repeal will fade by the 1990 
elections 
gov bob miller signed the pension repeal bill two hours after 
getting it from lawmakers who met tuesday in a twohour special 
session that set a record for its brevity assembly democrats asked 
the governor to convene the session 
its over miller said the action is in the best 
interests of the taxpayers of the state because the possibility of 
future payments at that inflated 300 percent level no longer 
exists 
the democratic governor said he wasnt trying to salvage any 
political careers in the legislature by calling the session to 
repeal the increase that he had vetoed earlier in the year 
legislators overrode the veto the same day 
miller said his concern was the potential expense of millions 
over the years unless the benefits were reduced 
under the increase pensions for the parttime lawmakers rose 
from 25 a month per year of service to 100 a month per year of 
service 
representatives of the citizens lobbying group common cause led 
the fight against the increase circulating a petition to put the 
issue on the 1990 ballot 
im really feeling good today common cause spokeswoman 
leola armstrong said as the increase was canceled 
despite the repeal legislative leaders conceded voter outrage 
that led to the session may come back to haunt them next year 
democratic assembly speaker joe dini said the pension increase 
will remain a campaign issue that hurts everybody who voted for 
it 
dini said the low pay for parttime lawmakers still should be 
raised the legislators draw about 12000 in pay and various 
expense money for about six months of work every other year

beijings main art museum has opened an exhibit 
called baptism of blood and fire an array of artwork 
glorifying the military assault that crushed the prodemocracy 
movement 
the china art gallery show of 113 paintings photographs 
sketches cartoons and works of calligraphy is the governments 
latest effort to justify junes quelling of what it calls a 
counterrevolutionary rebellion 
the exhibit includes several paintings of wounded soldiers one 
of whom shouts im for the people the people are for me as he 
is helped through the smoke and fire of the june turmoil by a 
sympathetic citizen 
another with a similar depiction of a soldier dripping blood has 
the inscription the blood of this soldier awakened the people 
ink sketches paintings and photos show soldiers painting fences 
and watering plants in the capital washing clothes together with 
women citizens and giving haircuts to beijing residents 
another painting has a young girl drawing a sketch of an armed 
soldier and a poster shows a similar armed soldier with doves 
flying in the background and the inscription he guards the people 
of the capital 
a work of calligraphy reads the army and the people are as 
fish and water 
one cartoon shows a character with a grotesque mouth shaped like 
a loudspeaker spitting out a tape on which is written voice of 
america 
the us governmentrun voa has been denounced by the government 
for its reports on the prodemocracy movement voa has been accused 
of aiding those attempting to overthrow the government 
the government propaganda campaign began immediately after the 
june 34 military attack on studentled demonstrators in which 
hundreds perhaps thousands of people were shot and killed 
staterun television repeatedly broadcast tapes of people 
throwing rocks and attacking military vehicles and showing the 
charred mutilated bodies of soldiers burned and killed 
bookstores have sold similar videos and photo albums all 
depicting mob brutality and the heroic deeds of the military but 
editing out all evidence that soldiers opened fire on unarmed 
crowds of people 
the beijing daily today said the city was coming out with a book 
that would expose the evil doings of elites during the turmoil 
it said the book would show how people such as dissident 
scientist fang lizhi who is now hiding in the us embassy in 
beijing and political scientist yan jiaqi who fled the country 
after june fanned rebellion plotted the overthrow of the 
government and promoted bourgeois liberalism 
the largest exhibit on the rebellion opened at the military 
museum in august and drew more than 600000 people in its first 
month mostly students and workers bused in to receive the 
governments version 
the art exhibit which opened tuesday was more low key with 
most of the viewers being students and young people who had 
wandered in after visiting other shows in the gallery 
one university student said he found the exhibit very 
educational but most were noncommittal or shied away when asked 
what they thought of the art work an attendant told reporters they 
were not allowed to ask questions 
despite the barrage of propaganda praising the military many 
beijing residents particularly those who joined the spring 
demonstrations in private express strong resentment toward the 
peoples liberation army and its role in the violent suppression of 
the prodemocracy movement 
martial law remains in effect in beijing although most military 
guards were replaced by armed police at the beginning of this month

congress adjourned for the year early 
wednesday after a nearly allnight session in which it approved a 
147 billion deficitreduction bill and repeal of medicare 
coverage of longterm medical care for the elderly 
on a pair of quick voice votes that belied the preceding months 
of partisan battling on both issues the senate sent both measures 
to president bush who was expected to sign them 
the end product is one i think we can take some pride in 
senate budget committee chairman james sasser dtenn told his 
colleagues as they began considering the budget cutting bill at 
about 145 am 
about an hour earlier the house voted 272128 to approve the 
deficit bill 
after the vote house leaders made their traditional 
endofsession telephone call to president bush who was asleep 
when the 1247 am call was made 
weve had a good session house majority leader richard 
gephardt dmo told the president house speaker thomas s foley 
dwash and minority leader bob michel rill also spoke of 
lawmakers accomplishments while michel added apologies for 
waking you up at this ungodly hour 
bush was roused again however at 348 am when senate 
majority leader george mitchell dmaine and republican leader bob 
dole of kansas telephoned him to report the chambers work was 
finished 
when all the dust settles i think you had a pretty good 
session of the whole congress bush told the two leaders 
the senate adjourned for the year at 407 am while the house 
followed 24 minutes later 
earlier in the evening the house as it has been doing for 
weeks insisted that medicare benefits for elderly people with 
longlasting diseases be completely repealed lawmakers rejected 
senate language retaining parts of the program by 34655 and voted 
by voice to eliminate the entire program 
the senate decided to finally accept repeal rather than return 
to their districts to face seniors angry over the surtax they must 
pay to support the initiative 
lawmakers also became embroiled in a conflict with the bush 
administration over whether the executive branchs foreign policy 
powers should be restricted 
the house stripped language offensive to the white house out of 
a bill authorizing state department operations for the next two 
years and sent the new bill to the senate hopes of finishing the 
measure before adjournment but the legislation became the victim 
of a jurisdictional dispute between committees and will await 
action next year 
the measure contained a provision stemming from the irancontra 
scandal providing criminal penalties if the administration 
pressured foreign governments into carrying out policies that break 
american law the administration believed the language could tie 
its hands in discussions with other governments 
and they passed a series of other measures ranging from senate 
approval of a resolution condemning violence in el salvador to 
house adoption of a measure proclaiming national drunk driving 
awareness week 
debate on a 147 billion deficitreduction bill for the current 
fiscal year was delayed as lawmakers worked out differences on the 
final shape of the measure 
congressional leaders and the bush administration had agreed to 
the deal in negotiations that ended in tuesdays early morning 
hours but they had to spend nearly 12 hours preventing stray 
provisions such as an effort to put the fairness doctrine 
requiring broadcasters to give equal time to differing viewpoints 
from finding their way into the measure 
the deficitcutting package contained some actual savings as 
well as some only on paper such as shifting the moneylosing 
postal service off the budget it also relies heavily on 
acrosstheboard cuts triggered last month by the grammrudman 
deficitreduction law a mechanism most legislators see as an 
unthinking way of shrinking federal spending 
the day began with a rhythm that has become familiar to capitol 
denizens in recent days little action on the floors of both houses 
but many closeddoor meetings to hammer out final deals 
layered over that was an atmosphere often observed in the 
closing days of school a tangible restiveness to go home for the 
year which leaders promised would occur if the deficitcutting and 
medicare bills were completed 
people have made up their minds said rep jack buechner 
rmo they have their families packed up in cars and theyre 
ready to go home for thanksgiving 
the deficitreduction package culminated a year of turmoil that 
started with a muchheralded budget pact between congress and the 
white house 
but that degenerated into bitter partisan fighting over 
president bushs illfated attempt to slah capital gains tax rates 
because of the gridlock the grammrudman law chopped 161 billion 
from most federal programs oct 1 excluding social security and 
many other benefits 
democrats and republicans agreed that the deal worked out met 
bushs demands for 14 billion in legitimate savings white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said the president considered it an 
excellent bill 
it lets the grammrudman cuts stay in effect until early 
february producing savings of 46 billion over the entire 1990 
fiscal year which began oct 1 the reductions would cut domestic 
programs by 15 percent and defense spending by 14 percent 
the package also raises 6 billion in new taxes most levied on 
corporations of the total 27 billion comes from speeding up 
payroll gasoline and aviation tax collections a step the 
administration insists is merely an accounting gimmick netting no 
real new revenues 
another 400 million comes from including deferred compensation 
such as the earnings some employees place into 401k retirement 
plans in the formula that determines the amount of wages subject 
to social security taxes that could require workers in the 50000 
range to pay social security tax on slightly more of their earnings 
beginning in 1990 
reductions in medicare mainly cuts in payments to doctors and 
hospitals would save 28 billion cuts in deficiency payments for 
corn and other crops would save 235 million boosting nuclear 
regulatory commission fees would raise 54 million and extending a 
1 percent fee for veterans affairs housing loans would net 169 
million 
on the more questionable side the package claimed savings of 
17 billion for ignoring the postal services projected losses and 
700 million by stretching out retirement payments to federal 
workers 
in their other undertaking lawmakers set about rolling back 
catastrophic care benefits for 33 million senior citizens that were 
enacted last year with broad popular support 
the cheers turned to boos this year when many older americans 
began complaining about the surtax imposed to pay for the benefits 
that tax peaked at 800 for the most welltodo 40 percent of 
senior citizens 
as enacted in 1988 the benefits covered longterm doctor and 
hospital bills prescriptions and minor expenses such as 
mammography and hospice care

a man who authorities said put parts of 
his slain wifes body through a woodchipping machine has been 
convicted of murdering her he plans to appeal the conviction 
an attorney for richard crafts said after the verdict was 
announced tuesday that he would argue in the appeal that publicity 
about the case including a recently published book deprived the 
defendant of a fair trial 
hes calm he does wish for us to appeal and he still 
maintains hes innocent of this crime said crafts attorney 
gerard smyth 
the defense argued that crafts danishborn wife helle may 
still be alive the former flight attendant hasnt been seen since 
nov 18 1986 
the prosecution never produced a body and submitted as evidence 
only threequarters of an ounce of human remains it claimed were 
those if mrs crafts 
crafts a 51yearold former airline pilot appeared unemotional 
with his hands clasped behind his back when the verdict was read 
after a nineweek retrial 
sentencing was set for jan 8 murder carries a sentence of 25 
years to 60 years which is considered a life term in connecticut 
the pretrial publicity included numerous media stories about the 
first trial which ended last year in a mistrial and a book about 
the case the woodchipper murder by arthur herzog that hit 
the bookstores in october 
when you take all those things together its difficult to say 
none of those things affected the outcome smyth said 
the appeal also will focus on jury selection and the narrow 
conditions under which the jury could have convicted crafts of the 
lesser crime of manslaughter smyth said 
crafts first trial in new london ended in a mistrial last year 
when one juror after 17 days of deliberations held out for 
acquittal 
the norwalk jury took less than three days to convicted crafts 
the prosecution alleged crafts killed his wife at their newtown 
home late nov 18 or early on next day cut the body with a chain 
saw and used a rented wood chipper to dispose of some of the pieces 
in a stream 
the evidence included bits of bone a fingernail hair samples 
and other body parts recovered from the site witnesses testified 
that they saw a man using a wood chipper on a bridge during a 
rainstorm nov 20 1986 
the defense argued that none of the body pieces could be 
identified conclusively as mrs crafts and that without a body 
the jury had to find crafts innocent 
but states attorney walter flanagan said the evidence taken 
together revealed a carefully crafted plot to kill mrs crafts and 
get rid of the evidence 
he alleged that crafts couldnt stand the thought his wife 
wanted a divorce and described mrs crafts as a devoted mother of 
three who wouldnt simply abandon her family as the defense 
suggested

producer says 
its going to be a very realistic portrayal producer david 
gadberry said were going to show how it hurts when two gays

city earlier this month rejected a gayrights ordinance

orange county and the story will revolve around recent reallife 
county events such as violent clashes over a homosexual pride 
festival in santa ana and irvine voters removal of protection for 
homosexuals in an antidiscrimination law

dimsdale a conservative minister who preaches that homosexuals are 
devils 
i wonder who that could be said the rev louis sheldon an 
evangelical presbyterian minister who heads the traditional values 
coalition 
sheldon said the show is going to make the inner workings of his 
opponents lifestyle regular tv fare 
theyre promoting the homosexual lifestyle if theyre bringing 
a soap opera on cable television throughout the nation and the 
city he said

sponsors who advertise on shows containing what the group deems 
material offensively violent too sexually oriented or hostile 
toward organized religion murphree said

a hardline communist who served as party boss in 
moscow for the past two years has been replaced in the powerful 
post 
lev n zaikov 66 was named president mikhail s gorbachevs 
top deputy on the soviet defense council 
party officials called the move a promotion for zaikov a member 
of the ruling politburo member but the new job also means zaikov 
who many muscovites say has become increasingly unpopular will not 
have to run in local elections this winter and risk defeat 
zaikov assumed the moscow party post in november 1987 after 
gorbachev engineered the firing of boris n yeltsin who had 
objected to the slow pace of gorbachevs economic and social 
restructuring program 
zaikovs twoyear tenure coincided with dwindling food supplies 
in staterun stores and he was blamed by some muscovites for a 
host of ills ranging from filthy streets to the shortage of 
detergent and soap 
according to the official news agency tass zaikovs replacement 
is connected to his appointment to the post of first deputy 
chairman of the defense council of the ussr 
tass said zaikov received the gratitude of the moscow party 
committee that voted in plenary session to replace him indicating 
he was leaving in official good graces 
yuri prokofiev 50 who as second party secretary in moscow had 
been zaikovs deputy was elected his successor by secret ballot 
beating two other candidates tass said 
it said gorbachev attended the meeting indicating the kremlin 
leader accorded high importance to the personnel switch 
in his functions as president gorbachev chairs the defense 
council a littleknown body that helps formulate national defense 
policy and whose membership was long a virtual secret 
gorbachev in july disclosed for the first time that the role of 
the defense council had been enhanced and said the body was being 
restructured 
he hinted he planned to make the defense council the main body 
that decides soviet military policy in the future and zaikovs 
appointment to a post that previously had never been mentioned 
publicly may be a step in that direction 
zaikov has experience in militaryrelated matters since he 
served under gorbachev as the partys top official overseeing the 
defense industry and from 1983 to 1985 as party chief in the 
leningrad region an armaments industry center 
one of the most powerful officials in the communist party 
apparatus zaikov has supported the policy of promoting scientific 
and technological progress but has called for strict limits in the 
partys drive for glasnost or greater openness in society 
this spring yeltsin and zaikovs party apparatus clashed in the 
countrys first contested elections in seven decades yeltsin was 
seeking the moscowwide seat in the new congress of peoples 
deputies 
muscovites showed their support for yeltsin giving him 89 
percent of the vote against the party machine candidate the 
director of a moscow automobile and truck works 
as party chief in moscow zaikov would have been expected to run 
in the march 4 elections for the citys governing council many 
muscovites had predicted zaikovs defeat which under party policy 
could have led to stripping him of his party post 
however a secretary at the party committee in moscows frunze 
district rejected a western reporters suggestion that zaikov had 
been ousted because of sagging popularity 
oh no you cant be more mistaken she said by telephone 
he wasnt fired far from it he was promoted a duty officer 
at city party headquarters also said zaikov had received a higher 
position

does mount rushmore need a facelift 
in an effort to answer that and other questions a helicopter 
will hover beside mount rushmore national memorial next week as 
engineers photograph cracks and other rocky wrinkles in the aging 
60foottall presidential faces 
this is the first time that a total structural analysis has 
ever been done mount rushmore superintendent dan wenk said 
tuesday we hope it will give us some longterm knowledge with 
which to manage this great resource 
late sculptor gutzon borglum carved the faces of george 
washington thomas jefferson abraham lincoln and theodore 
roosevelt a halfcentury ago from a granite peak in the black hills 
the engineering study is part of a 40 million project to spruce 
up the memorial for its 50th anniversary in 1991 and to preserve 
the shrine of democracy for future generations 
one of the things that gutzon borglum recognized when he 
carved the mountain was that there were a number of cracks wenk 
said weve never known the longterm impact of those cracks 
each fall workers seal the cracks with a mixture of granite 
dust white lead and linseed oil to lessen the damage when cool 
weather causes the rock to contract the engineering study will be 
used to develop a more comprehensive maintenance plan wenk said 
we want to find out what the structural integrity is and what 
we can do if there is a problem he said 
the study is being conducted by respec inc a rapid city 
engineering firm staff geologist tim vogt said the company is 
using a technique called photogrammetry or measuring with 
photographs 
what were doing is making a very detailed precision map of 
the sculpture area he said once we have that very detailed 
map we can determine the structural stability of the mountain 
if weather permits engineers on monday will chart reference 
points on the faces with black markers 15 inches in diameter 
closeup photographs will be taken tuesday 
the faces will look funny for a couple of days vogt said 
he said the entire structural analysis should be completed by 
summer 
mount rushmore isnt in immediate danger of disintegrating vogt 
said 
the park service is just doing their job to make sure theres 
no longterm degradation 
vogt said an engineering project of mount rushmores scale is a 
challenge 
its a unique application of an engineering problem he said 
at least one piece of mount rushmore lore stems from the cracks 
in the granite faces 
president jeffersons likeness appears to be looking at a 
higher plane than the other presidents wenk said the romantic 
view of that situation is that gutzon borglum saw him as a 
visionary the reality is that there was a crack in the granite 
that ran through jeffersons nose borglum had to keep tilting the 
head back in order to ensure that the crack would not cause the 
sculpture to fail prematurely 
the 50000 first phase of the structural analysis is being 
funded by the mount rushmore national memorial society a private 
nonprofit group formed 60 years ago to support and promote the 
monument a drive is under way to raise 40 million for the entire 
improvement project

owners of a car damaged in a crash can be 
sued for failing to keep it as evidence a state appeals court said 
in a ruling that one judge predicted would make the state a giant 
junkyard 
in a 21 decision released tuesday the 1st district court of 
appeal said the owners had a duty to preserve the car if they 
should have known it was needed by an opposing party in the case 
the ruling reinstated a claim by solano county against the 
family of brian delancy driver of a car that overturned in august 
1985 injuring delancy and a passenger 
the passenger faith lynn owens sued delancy his parents ew 
and katherine delancy and the county blaming the crash on 
careless driving negligent entrustment of the car to the youth 
and an unsafe road 
the county seeking to reduce its own damages then filed a 
claim against the delancys saying the car had been defective 
the county said it should be entitled to reimbursement from the 
delancys because the family had destroyed the car before the 
original suit was filed allegedly after inspecting the car and 
finding defects 
superior court judge richard harris dismissed the claim based on 
cars destruction 
but the appeals court disagreed 
the opinion by justice james perley said the county was entitled 
to seek reimbursement for any harm it suffered if it could prove 
the delancys either knew or should have known that the car was 
needed as evidence when they destroyed it 
in a dissenting opinion justice carl anderson said the ruling 
would impose a burden by forcing owners to preserve wrecked cars 
indefinitely without having been sued or notified of the need to 
keep the car intact 
the owner of all wrecked cars will now be forced to store the 
wreck or drive the partly damaged car without repair for an 
intolerable period of time anderson said what little 
landscape our everencroaching civilization has left will hence 
forward be transformed into one giant junkyard 
perley joined by justice marc poche dismissed andersons 
prediction as hyperbole 
the delancys could have fulfilled any duty they owed by writing 
to the county and saying they planned to destroy the car on a 
certain date unless the county took over the cost of preserving it 
perley said 
the intolerable burden we supposedly place on parties in the 
delancys position is no more than the cost of copying and 
postage perley said

a classaction lawsuit by five blacks is 
challenging as unconstitutional a boston police practice of 
stopping and searching suspected gang members and their friends on 
sight 
others claim the tactic is a valuable weapon against crime in an 
innercity area plagued by nine slayings in less than a month 
the lawsuit filed tuesday alleges officers searched one man 
merely because he wore a new york giants cap and tshirt clothing 
associated with a gang of the same name and forced another to lie 
in a puddle of urine 
the suffolk superior court lawsuit was filed by two adults and 
three teenagers against the city and nine police officers on 
behalf of blacks and hispanics ages 15 to 30 who live work or 
travel through a section of boston that police call area b 
the area the neighborhoods of roxbury mattapan and part of 
dorchester has seen a steep increase in the past year in violent 
crime that police blame on drugs and gang disputes 
in may police announced they would conduct onthestreet 
searches of known or suspected gang members and people associated 
with them 
the lawsuit argues the practice violates the fourth amendment 
protection against unreasonable search and seizure it seeks an end 
to the practice and unspecified money damages for the plaintiffs 
police spokesman jim jordan declined to comment on the lawsuit 
but referred reporters to a earlier memorandum by police 
commissioner francis roache explaining the policy 
the memorandum reminds officers that the policy is to protect 
constitutional rights but it also noted that police may stop 
anyone reasonably suspected of criminal activity 
simply stated roaches memo said this means that if an 
officer observes activity which based on his training and 
experience leads him reasonably to suspect on grounds that he 
could explain that a person has is or is about to commit a crime 
the officer may briefly detain that person to investigate 
he continued this detention may be based on less than 
probable cause but reasonable suspicion is more than a hunch or 
mere suspicion or good faith belief 
police superintendent paul evans in charge of patrol officers 
said tuesday the origin of the controversy was nine slayings in 24 
days that left officers in area b perplexed 
frustrated commanders announced what they called a 
searchonsite policy it never translated as a departmentwide 
policy evans said it was only meant to be a warning to youth 
gangs with guns theres a lot of guns out there 
as for the cases cited in the lawsuit evans said police are 
aware of the need to observe civil rights were not correct 100 
percent of the time but as to an unconstitutional policy violating 
peoples rights thats not the case at all he said 
the lawsuit prepared by the civil liberties union of 
massachusetts outlines experiences of the plaintiffs in recent 
police encounters 
one plaintiff rolando carr 30 a demolition worker was shot 
and wounded by an officer on oct 10 while walking down a road in 
the public housing project where he lives the lawsuit alleges that 
carr who is recovering from his wound was searched after he was 
shot but that police failed to find evidence of a weapon or 
criminal activity 
another plaintiff kenneth lowe 25 a sheetmetal worker from 
everett was searched at gunpoint a month earlier forced to lie in 
a puddle of urine and made to take off his shoes and pull down his 
trousers and underpants the lawsuit alleges police told him he 
was being searched because he wore the new york giants tshirt and 
cap according to the lawsuit 
none of the plaintiffs belonged to a gang or associated with 
gang members and no charges were ever filed as a result of the 
searches said attorney margaret burnham

afghan rebels plan to free two soviet 
soldiers the first release of soviet pows since the red army ended 
its decadelong occupation of afghanistan in february a soviet 
official said today 
the soldiers will be reunited with their mothers in the 
pakistani frontier city of peshawar after more than three years of 
captivity said vladimir ivanov a soviet embassy spokesman in 
islamabad 
we dont know exactly when yet but i think it will be within 
a week ivanov said of the release 
the two soviets are to be released through the international 
committee of the red cross with the pakistan foreign ministry 
acting as mediator guerrilla sources confirmed the plan but gave 
no further details 
ivanov said the two army privates identified as andrei lopuhk 
and valery prokapchuk were captured by the anticommunist rebels 
in 1986 
guerrilla sources have however claimed that lopukh defected to 
their side in 1987 
the insurgents called mujahedeen or islamic holy warriors 
offered to release lopukh in june but he told a news conference he 
wouldnt go home until kabul releases an estimated 35000 rebel 
prisoners 
asked whether lopukh had changed his mind ivanov said 
apparently so 
soviet forces fought to prop up afghanistans marxist government 
between december 1979 and february 1989 
the guerrillas many of whom are based in neighboring pakistan 
say they hold about 75 soviet pows but moscow says about 300 of its 
soldiers are still missing 
the guerrillas released two afghan pows last week but have not 
said how many of their own countrymen they hold 
pakistan in addition to the united states has backed the 
guerrillas throughout their struggle to topple the kabul government 
and establish an islamic republic of afghanistan 
afghan government forces continue to control the countrys major 
cities despite relentless rebel attacks the insurgents have 
refused to negotiate peace with kabul officials whom they blame 
for inviting the soviet intervention

items found on a body discovered near a 
peruvian jungle town indicated it was that of a reporter for the 
tampa tribune and that he was killed by leftist insurgents his 
newspaper reported today 
todd smith 28 who was researching stories on cocaine 
traffickers and leftist guerrillas was last seen friday as he left 
for the airport on the outskirts of uchiza 245 miles northeast of 
lima 
the tentative identification was made late tuesday said tom 
leary assistant press attache for the us embassy in peru he 
said an autopsy was to be performed today in uchiza 
the body was found three blocks from the central square of the 
town in the huallaga valley in central peru a notoriously lawless 
cocaineproducing region he appeared to have been beaten and 
strangled said british journalist simon strong who accompanied 
us officials to the scene 
at least 15 peruvian journalists have been killed in perus 
guerrilla and drug trafficking violence but smith would be the 
first american reporter slain 
a placard found with the body suggests the slaying was the work 
of the maoist rebel group shining path strong said 
the wooden sign denounced the united states in this way die 
north american spies linked to the pentagon who are carrying out an 
antisubversive plan in latin america and especially in peru 
death to the north american imperialism long live the 
communist party long live the war of the people 
his body was identified from a taxi receipt bearing his name 
found in his pocket strong said 
smith who was due back in tampa on monday was in peru on 
vacation said lawrence mcconnell the tribunes managing editor 
i think it was his intent to come back and write about what he 
found there but we didnt assign him mcconnell said 
this is one of the trickiest areas to work said michael 
smith a correspondent for the washington post and newsweek who has 
lived in peru for 16 years if he was doing it alone thats even 
more difficult most journalists i know try to work in pairs when 
they go to the huallaga its not the kind of place to go alone 
the upper huallaga region the worlds largest source of the 
coca leaf used to make cocaine has been in turmoil since the 
shining path recently started extorting payments from peasant 
farmers and colombian traffickers the terrorists use the profits 
to finance their revolution 
smith a latin american scholar had reported previously on 
jungle warfare in central america 
in 1981 he studied at the instituto fenix language school in 
cuernavaca mexico and in 1983 he won the lee scholarship for 
latin america research at the library of congress 
after three years with the st petersburg times he left in may 
1987 to become a freelance reporter in central america 
he traveled extensively compiling a series on 10 weeks he spent 
with the nicaraguan rebels he reported their 200mile treks from 
rebel bases in honduras to combat zones in northern nicaragua the 
series was published in the st petersburg times and the san

sources of income 
it already has deals with us cable networks and pbs that 
account for half its coproduction business checkland said in a 
luncheon speech here to the international radio amp television

do business with them too i very much hope we can longterm

coproduction deals on individual programs with us networks about 
20 years ago but has done nothing since

longterm coproduction possibilities in recent weeks and were 
just generally talking about that with abc and nbc

a college professor from new mexico who 
was trapped in a hotel by a salvadoran rebel attack said he 
barricaded his room with mattresses as a precaution against stray 
bullets 
ron blood a professor of education administration at the 
university of new mexico described in a telephone interview from 
el salvador on tuesday how government troops landed on the roof of 
the el salvador sheraton and led him and others to safety through 
heavy fighting 
ive been in tough spots before but never like that blood 
said 
blood 57 was in the capital for work with a university office 
that works with the us agency for international development he 
was staying in a section of the luxury hotel separate from 
fivestory annex where rebels temporarily trapped dozens of 
foreigners 
early today the only foreigners remaining in the hotel annex 
occupied by the rebels were eight armed us army green berets who 
apparently were waiting for the insurgents to slip away from 
encircling salvadoran government troops under cover of darkness 
the battle just closed in around the hotel and it became 
apparent the army was not going to be able to clear it he said 
blood barricaded himself in his room covering his windows with 
mattresses and hiding in his bathtub because he had been told that 
was the safest place 
he got through to the us embassy on a walkietalkie system 
which the universitys san salvador office shares with aid 
they told us the guerrillas had entered the hotel after that 
i stopped using the radio because it beeps and people with radios 
are likely targets 
the battle just went on and on you could hear the glass 
breaking he said 
by afternoon salvadoran government troops he likened to 
commandos landed on the roof of the sheraton he said 
they entered from above and helped clear the building 
they took us down through the building and out to a little armored 
vehicle called a tanqueta or little tank blood said the 
hotel was still under very heavy fire 
in contrast a portland ore couple who were trapped in the 
hotel for 14 hours said they didnt feel threatened 
larry miller and his wife charlotte miller both 71 were freed 
unharmed along with other foreigners said their son lyman miller 
of portland he spoke with his parents by telephone tuesday evening 
they were well treated they never had a gun pointed at them 
directly or were threatened in any way and it was clear the 
guerrillas objective was never to harm them in any way miller 
said 
the millers had been in el salvador since oct 15 with the 
international executive service corps an agency that sends retired 
us business executives to advise their counterparts in developing 
nations miller went to work with an asphalt manufacturing company 
blood director of the universitys office of international 
technical cooperation was in el salvador to prepare for the 
planned closing of the universitys education office next month 
the office which is finishing contract work for aid will close 
today because of the fighting blood said

a hiker lost for two weeks in rugged south 
carolina wilderness may have hid from a search party because she 
believed she was being chased by men intending to harm her 
authorities said 
from the very beginning before the search was initiated she 
became frightened or paranoid that somebody was trying to run her 
down said oconee county sc emergency preparedness director 
walt purcell 
we feel that had she wanted to come out and be rescued the 
opportunity was probably there numerous times he said 
although the hiker 22yearold eloise lindsay insisted tuesday 
that men chased her along the trail authorities said they have no 
such evidence and have no plans to investigate further 
officials who interviewed the backpacker said the most likely 
scenario is that she became frightened and panicked when she saw 
hunters and later thought her rescuers were the same men chasing 
her 
we dont believe anybody was chasing her said tim morgan 
assistant sheriff of pickens county sc 
on monday two days after authorities called off the search that 
involved more than 100 people for seven days miss lindsay was 
found by a deer hunter a few miles north of the 43mile foothills 
trail in table rock state park 
six months out of college miss lindsay told reporters she had 
gone backpacking to think about what to do next with her life she 
said she left the main trail and got lost when she sensed she was 
being followed by men 
i could tell there was no good intent involved she said 
although there was no clear indication the men meant to harm her 
i used instinct like a deer she said adding that the men 
carried walkietalkies and that she could hear them talking about 
her 
miss lindsay who began the hike alone on nov 4 first began to 
fear she was being tracked by area construction workers nov 7 
long before she exhausted her sevenday food supply 
oconee sheriffs office chief deputy james singleton said he 
believes miss lindsay heard workers talking over walkietalkies 
amplified through speakers on their trucks and thought they were 
discussing her 
miss lindsay said she later knew rescuers were searching for her 
but said she still believed other men also were trailing her 
the hiker who suffered infected blisters on both feet cuts 
and abrasions recalled her ordeal at a news conference under a 
tree wrapped in yellow ribbons outside her parents home in atlanta 
she saw rescue helicopters overhead but she didnt build a fire 
to attract attention she said because it might have given her 
away to the men she believed were chasing her

the episcopal churchs presiding bishop says the 
killings and arrests of church workers in el salvador show that the 
bush administration should change its latin american policy 
there comes a time when accountability must be demanded of our 
governments actions the most rev edmond l browning leader of 
the episcopal churchs national council told reporters tuesday 
an episcopal missionary from the united states and at least five 
other lay workers arrested by the salvadoran national guard have 
been released but 12 more all salvadorans were still being 
held browning said 
altogether 19 episcopal lay workers were arrested monday 
morning at the st john evangelist church in san salvador a 
sanctuary for 400 refugees browning said 
six were released tuesday including the american josie 
beecher 37 of olympia wash three spaniards who were ordered 
deported a canadian and a guatemalan 
it was unclear whether another worker marcela rodriguez who 
holds dual colombian and us citizenships was released 
three episcopal priests from los angeles have gone to san 
salvador to try to secure the release of those who remain in 
custody browning said 
i havent been this incensed about anything in a long time 
he said 
in a letter to salvadoran president alfredo cristiani browning 
appealed for the church workers safety and release copies were 
sent to president bush other government officials the archbishop 
of canterbury and other anglican leaders 
the united states has provided billions of dollars in aid to the 
government of el salvador which has been engaged in a 10year 
civil war with leftist rebels 
many clerics there have been accused of siding with the rebels 
the rev luis serrano pastor of st john evangelist has been 
in hiding for 1 weeks we believe hes safe said browning 
adding we daresay he was on the list of those targeted for 
arrest 
the whereabouts of beechers 4yearold daughter mariana was 
unknown but friends may have taken her in when her mother was 
arrested said browning 
among the salvadorans still believed in custody were juan 
antonio berti quinones assistant director of the episcopal relief 
agency that runs the refugee center and his wife ana rivera de 
quinones 
six prominent jesuit priests including the rector and vice 
rector of the countrys prestigious central american university 
were slain last week as the salvador government stepped up its 
campaign against the roman catholic and protestant clergy 
the murder last week of the six jesuits and their housekeepers 
has been but the most dramatic in a chilling sequence of threats 
and actions against church and humanitarian workers in el 
salvador said browning

thousands of mourners accompanied the body 
of a slain basque politician through city streets today and 
demonstrators around the basque region burned barricades and closed 
businesses to protest his death 
jon josu muguruza was killed monday by two suspected 
rightwing gunmen as he sat in a madrid restaurant with other 
basque legislators of his radical coalition the herri batasuna 
popular union party he was elected to parliament oct 29 
muguruzas body accompanied by 5000 supporters waving basque 
flags and chanting antigovernment slogans was carried to city 
hall where it will lie in state 
a second deputyelect from the same party was shot in the 
attack which came on the eve of the swearingin ceremonies for the 
new parliament he has improved considerably since undergoing 
surgery for four bullet wounds doctors said 
herri batasuna is widely regarded as the political wing of the 
separatist group eta which claims responsibility for attacks that 
have killed more than 600 people in a 21year campaign for 
independence for the spanish basque region 
most businesses in the region closed for the day heeding the 
partys call for a general strike or succumbing to pressure from 
roving groups of protesters who advised them not to open news 
reports said 
youths burned barricades on highways in the three basque 
provinces and neighboring navarre and officials suspended bus 
service in the provincial capitals of san sebastian bilbao 
vitoria and the navarran capital pamplona 
one resident of the town of santurce who identified herself 
only as susana told spanish radio that masked youths had shut down 
her bread store were scared she said 
socialist prime minister felipe gonzalez has called the shooting 
horrendous and said apprehending the gunmen was a top priority 
for the government 
several spanish dailies citing interior ministry sources said 
investigators believe the two men who burst into the madrid 
restaurant and opened fire with pistols were aiming at the injured 
politician inaki esnaola and accidentally killed muguruza 
two other deputies three senators and three others were seated 
at the table but uninjured in the attack 
the dailies said the fact that the attack occurred on the 14th 
anniversary of the death of authoritarian ruler gen francisco 
franco and that the gunmen used militaryissue ammunition led 
police to suspect a link with ultraright army factions 
the attack bears the unmistakable signs of fascism 
leading daily el pais said in an editorial 
both muguruza who was 31 and the 41yearold esnaola were 
regarded as moderates who favored the resumption of talks 
between government representatives and eta suspended by gonzalez 
in april after eta broke a moratorium on its attacks 
they also supported herri batasunas decision to take its seats 
in parliament for the first time since the countrys return to 
democracy in 1977 a decision party spokesman jon idigoras said it 
would stick to despite the attack 
until now herri batasuna members had refused to swear 
allegiance to the 1978 spanish constitution a prerequisite for 
parliamentary participation

georgias supreme court has unanimously decided 
the right to privacy allows a man paralyzed in a motorcycle 
accident to shut off the breathing apparatus that has kept him 
alive for four years 
the right to privacy is guaranteed in the state and us 
constitutions and outweighs whatever interests the state has in 
preserving the life of 33yearold larry mcafee the court ruled 
tuesday 
mcafee already had permission from a triallevel judge to use a 
special device to shut off his ventilator and to receive a sedative 
to alleviate any pain that resulted the judge suggested the state 
appeal so the supreme court could issue guidelines for future 
cases but the high court suggested that is a legislative task 
arthur caplan director of the center for biomedical ethics at 
the university of minnesota said the rulings emphasis on privacy 
rights could influence a us supreme court case next month 
the federal justices are scheduled to hear arguments dec 6 on 
behalf of nancy beth cruzan a jasper county mo woman injured in 
a car accident six years ago at age 25 
in the cruzan case part of the argument is whether the right 
to privacy extends to these types of decisions caplan said 
mcafees attorney randall davis said the young man is most 
gratified that the highest court in georgia has affirmed his right 
to decide his own destiny 
he is currently reviewing several options which have been 
offered to him but he does not necessarily believe that he will 
change his mind as to the removal of his life support system 
davis said 
mcafee living in an alabaster ala nursing home has said he 
planned to return to georgia sometime after the holiday season to 
shut off his ventilator but he has met with people who said they 
could show him he could live a better life with the aid of new 
technology 
mcafee suffered a severe spinal cord injury in a 1985 motorcycle 
accident that left him a quadriplegic he cannot breathe without 
artificial assistance 
some advocates for the disabled said mcafees situation resulted 
from insensitive government policies that do not give people like 
mcafee a chance to live outside institutions 
essentially states like georgia give disabled people two 
choices the nursing home or the cemetery said paul longmore a 
california historian and quadriplegic 
the supreme court noted the existence of a living will law 
in georgia that allows competent adults to direct doctors not to 
use extraordinary procedures to keep them alive if they become 
terminally ill but the court said mcafees case doesnt fit those 
conditions 
lawmakers said tuesday that they probably will consider 
guidelines next month that could enable families and physicians 
involved in righttodie cases to act without fearing legal action 
no one likes to see a fellow human being die but there are 
some things worse than dying said state sen donn m peevy so 
i suppose if we are to be civilized we need to propose a legal 
guideline for those rare situations

orders to us factories for big ticket 
durable goods fell 06 percent in october the second consecutive 
monthly decline the government reported today 
the commerce department said orders for durable goods items 
expected to last three or more years dipped to a seasonally 
adjusted 12459 billion last month following a 11 percent drop in 
september 
while the october decline had been expected the real surprise 
was a sharp revision to the orders number for september which a 
month ago had been reported as a small increase of 02 percent 
the backtoback declines in orders provided fresh evidence that 
the us manufacturing sector is facing a severe slowdown many 
economists are forecasting that the country will dip close to a 
recession in the coming six months as a slump in manufacturing 
spills over into the rest of the economy 
much of the weakness so far has been in the auto industry where 
weak sales have already prompted layoffs and production cutbacks 
for october transportation orders rose by 3 percent to 3354 
billion recouping some of a giant 108 percent drop in september 
however the october strength came from inceased demand for 
military ships and civilian aircraft orders for motor vehicles 
were down again 
the total demand for defense equipment fell by 124 percent to 
933 billion however this followed a huge 339 percent increase 
in military orders in september 
the september advance had originally been reported as an even 
larger 60 percent increase but the commerce department said 
changes in the original company reports triggered a big downward 
revision that transformed the overall september figure from a small 
positive to the big decline 
excluding the volatile defense category orders would have risen 
05 percent in october after posting a 35 percent decline in 
september 
orders in the key category of nondefense capital goods 
considered a good indication of industry expansion plans rose 32 
percent in october to 3650 billion but this followed several 
months of weakness 
analysts believe that capital investment which has been one of 
the main factors propping up economic growth in the past two years 
will weaken significantly in coming months 
orders for the machinery category that includes computers 
dropped 46 percent to 2153 billion while the noncomputer 
machinery category fell 38 percent to 2016 billion 
shipments of durable goods fell 17 percent to 1224 billion 
following a 3 percent decline in september

a union representing 40000 telephone workers in 
the northeast signed a tentative agreement with nynex early today 
to end the last of the baby bell strikes begun in august 
the settlement was announced by the communications workers of 
america and nynex which serves 105 million customers in new york 
connecticut rhode island massachusetts new hampshire vermont 
and maine 
the bitter 16week strike over health care issues left one 
worker dead delayed directory assistance repairs and installation 
and was marked by more than 500 reported acts of vandalism 
the cwa and 20000 members of the international brotherhood of 
electrical workers went on strike aug 6 against nynex one of four 
regional phone companies struck that week the other baby bell 
strikes were settled by september 
the cwa and the ibew agreed with nynex nov 13 on a settlement 
framework then began negotiating local issues the ibew returned 
to work monday at new england telephone a nynex subsidiary today 
the cwa signed with nynex subsidiary new york telephone as well as 
with nynex 
nynex spokesman john obrien in announcing the tentative 
threeyear pact said union members would vote on the agreement by 
dec 1 and return to work dec 4 
with this proposed accord we have saved our health care 
said jan pierce cwa vice president 
the biggest issue in the strike was a company attempt to shift 
the cost of health care to the workers with costs ranging up to 
1500 a year 
the settlement does not include any healthcare costshifting 
pierce said nor does it include a lumpsum bonus or profitsharing 
plan the company had previously offered 
the settlement includes raises of 3 percent the first year and 
15 percent in each of the remaining two years plus costofliving 
allowances in the second and third years 
as talks continued and broke off repeatedly nynex reported 
numerous acts of vandalism and offered 100000 for information on 
the alleged sabotage two weeks ago some 361000 customers north 
of new york city lost service 
sticking points included what would happen to the more than 150 
workers suspended or fired during the strike for alleged offenses 
ranging from harassing management workers to assaulting them and 
damaging their cars 
cwa spokesman bob master said that under the settlement the 
disciplined workers will have the right to go through a grievance 
procedure 
i think the tremendous challenge to us is the tremendous 
animosity built up during the strike said cwa president morton 
bahr this company needs cooperation to be a viable 
profitmaking corporation 
a 34yearold striker died in a confrontation aug 15 at a nynex 
office in suburban valhalla police said he jumped onto the hood of 
a nonstriking workers car as she crossed a picket line then fell 
off and struck his head

an american journalist and three 
namibians were convicted of insulting the head of namibias 
election commission and have been fined nominal amounts 
windhoek regional court judge js verwey ruled tuesday that 
scott stanley head of the conservative american press 
international was guilty of violating a law that makes it a crime 
to insult disparage or belittle the election commission 
stanley was fined 250 rand 95 while the two namibian editors 
and a publisher convicted under the same law were fined amounts 
ranging from 20 rand 8 to 150 rand 58 
according to court testimony stanley visited namibia in july 
and interviewed bryan olinn a respected lawyer and head of the 
election commission established to investigate charges of 
intimidation prior to the nov 711 polls 
stanley then returned to his washingtonbased news agency and 
filed a report to us radio stations that suggested that olinn 
was biased in favor of the southwest africa peoples organization 
known as swapo and therefore unfit to head the commission 
according to testimony 
the report criticized olinn but did not address any specific 
cases handled by the commission 
leftist swapo which waged a 23year war against south african 
rule of namibia won 57 percent of the vote in the preindependence 
election 
stanley sent a transcript of his radio report to namibian 
newspapers two of which published stories quoting his work 
the publisher of the newspapers diether lauenstein and the 
editors of the publications the windhoek advertiser and the 
germanlanguage allegemeine zeitung were convicted along with 
stanley 
olinn testified that stanleys report was inaccurate and 
misleading 
the law prohibiting criticism of the election commission was 
enacted in a proclamation by namibias south african administrator 
louis pienaar swapo had no role in the running of the commission 
south africa which has ruled namibia for 74 years has agreed 
to grant independence to the territory under un supervision

congressional sponsors of a sweeping medicare 
overhaul say changing the way physicians are reimbursed would help 
slow climbing health care costs in the program and eventually in 
the nation 
the changes also will improve access to medical services for 
medicare recipients and ultimately for all americans and begin a 
trend toward more preventive care and fewer expensive hightech 
procedures they said 
in the next three or four years youll see a tremendous shift 
in physician behavior to more appropriate care sen jay 
rockefeller dwva an architect of the plan said tuesday 
there is going to be significant change in terms of 
procedures he said theres going to be much greater emphasis 
on primary care wellness and preventive care 
these changes would occur first for medicares 33 million 
elderly and disabled beneficiaries and eventually they would be 
adopted by private insurance companies and spread throughout the 
nations health care system he said 
medicare is the driving force in medicine because of its 
budget he said physician payments have been increasing 16 
percent a year for a decade and are expected to reach 44 billion 
this year 
the measure was worked out by house and senate negotiators 
monday as part of the budget reconciliation bill congress 
completed action on the overall bill early today 
the american medical association supports the plan saying it 
will help keep costs stable john zapp the associations director 
of government relations said most medicare recipients probably 
wouldnt notice much difference in medical care 
opponents say the plan would lead to a decline in the quality of 
services edmund haislmaier a healthcare policy analyst at the 
conservative heritage foundation said the plan may initially level 
out costs but there are not enough incentives to control 
expenditures over the long term 
he said it could lead to rationing of medical services over time 
the plan includes a new schedule for reimbursing physicians who 
treat medicare patients to be phased in over five years beginning 
in 1992 reimbursements are now based on a physicians customary 
charges which can have little relationship to cost and can vary 
greatly among doctors 
the new rates would boost fees for family and general practice 
physicians and internists fees would be lowered for surgeons 
radiologists and other specialties that are based on procedures 
when the system is in place however surgeons and other highpaid 
specialists typically would make more overall than those in general 
practice 
the fees would be standardized by specialty with adjustments to 
account for regional cost differences physicians who practice in 
poorly served areas notably inner cities and rural areas would 
get a 10 percent bonus 
the american society of internal medicine the leading 
professional organization for internists backs the plan saying 
the fee schedule will neutralize incentives for physicians to 
practice a very hightech oriented style of medicine 
a spokeswoman for the american college of surgeons said right 
now were very favorable although its officials must still read 
the final measure 
this group realizes the world is different and theres a 
certain reality out there said spokeswoman linn meyer theres 
a lot of concern with the costs of medicine there has to be 
belt tightening all healthcare sectors are going to be affected 
another part of the plan would slow the increase in payments to 
physicians by linking payment increases to a medicare spending 
goal reimbursement rates could be cut if physician payments exceed 
the goal 
the plan also requires physicians to submit claims for 
beneficiaries about 20 percent now require the patient to pay the 
bill and seek reimbursement from medicare 
a related feature also included in the budget bill would enable 
rural hospitals to receive the same medicare payments as their 
urban counterparts for treating elderly and disabled patients 
the disparity in medicare reimbursement rates at least 12 
percent for rural hospitals has been blamed by some congressman 
for the deterioration in rural health care and closing of rural 
hospitals 
under the plan medicare payments to rural hospitals would be 
equalized over five years initially however medicare payment 
rates to rural hospitals would be increased by 42 percent

a jury awarded a 275000 to a former borough 
lawyer who sued the pittsburgh press for libel over an article on 
his role in a political dispute 
press editor angus mceachran said that he was shocked by the 
verdict tuesday and that the newspaper would appeal 
the common pleas jury awarded 75000 in actual damages and 
200000 in punitive damages to william murray 53 of palm beach 
gardens fla 
murray formerly a solicitor for brentwood sued over a 1985 
article quoting a judge as saying murray may have lied to him 
the day after the article appeared the judge told the paper that 
it was murrays assistant who appeared before him not murray and 
the press ran a clarification the same day 
scott melton one of murrays attorneys argued that the 
clarification was insufficient because it did nothing to let 
readers know that mr murray never lied to a judge in court 
the article focused on a dispute involving a former mayor who 
sued the borough in late 1984 over speaking privileges at borough 
council meetings 
mceachran suggested jurors failed to understand the judges 
instructions that murray as a public figure had to prove actual 
malice that the report was published with knowledge it was false 
or with reckless disregard for the truth 
the press competitor the pittsburgh postgazette lost the 
largest libel judgment ever paid by a newspaper the 22 million 
award went to a former judge who sued over a 1979 article about a 
disputed will he handled as a lawyer

the government has proposed a record 377240 
fine against new york telephone for allegedly failing to tell 
workers how to handle hazardous materials 
if the fines proposed tuesday are approved they would be the 
highest ever imposed by the occupational safety and health 
administration against a telecommunications company 
the accusations stem from 26 unannounced visits to new york 
telephone work sites throughout the state in july when the 
communications workers union lodged complaints with osha 
osha found 62 willful violations 16 serious violations and two 
otherthanserious violations 
its a very widespread case said edward jerome an official 
at oshas albany regional office its unusual in that extent 
that we had so many facilities not in compliance 
anthony desiervi osha assistant regional administrator in new 
york city noted that most of the citations involved paperwork 
we are not alleging employees were overexposed to these 
materials he said 
new york telephone spokesman tony pappas denied the allegations 
this company has always been interested in safety he said 
a willful violation is not something the company would do we are 
going to contest that 
the company has until dec 12 to contest the citations 
the agency claimed that the company willfully violated osha 
standards by failing to inform employees about hazardous materials 
and train workers in handling such substances 
other alleged violations involved failure to properly store 
compressed gas cylinders and test employees for exposure to lead 
the mentioned substances which included compressed gases 
leaded solder and solvents can cause reproductive system problems 
nerve disorders dizziness skin and eye irritation breathing 
problems headaches and nausea 
marsha love a health and safety director for the cwa said the 
company had eight years to implement safety measures under state 
law which was superseded by federal law in 1988

the worlds most populous democracy 
began deciding today whether prime minister rajiv gandhi gets 
another chance to govern or falls victim to the most cohesive 
opposition challenge ever mounted in india 
at least 22 campaign workers and voters were killed in scattered 
bombings knifings and shootings on the first day of the 
parliamentary election which continues friday and sunday 
as polls closed today reports of rising violence and ballot 
fraud mounted in gandhis own constituency of amethi police 
residents and both political parties reported several clashes 
between supporters of the congress party and the janata dal the 
major partner in the opposition coalition 
more than 100000 paramilitary troops were deployed across this 
nation of 880 million people to help local police stem campaign 
violence which has killed at least 66 people since parliamentary 
elections were announced oct 17 
preliminary reports indicated voter turnout of about 50 percent 
a normal turnout 
only 15 of indias 25 states and five of its seven federally 
governed territories voted today the rest of the country with the 
exception of assam state votes friday and sunday 
voting was postponed indefinitely in assam because electoral 
rolls were incomplete 
at stake in the elections are 524 of the 543 seats in the lok 
sabha or house of the people the policymaking lower house of 
parliament 
opinion polls conducted this month for two major indian news 
magazines indicated the congress party haunted by allegations of 
highlevel corruption would get 180 to 215 of the seats that 
would either doom it to defeat or force it to seek a difficult 
coalition with smaller parties 
in uttar pradesh the state that elects 85 of the seats 
opposition leaders charged the electoral roll did not contain the 
names of many 18yearolds who are eligible to vote for the first 
time this year 
its a calculated step to prevent the young generation who are 
opposed to the congress party to cast ballots madhukar dighe 
spokesman for the opposition janata dal party said in the state 
capital of lucknow 
this years election violence is ahead of the 38 deaths reported 
in the last campaign five years ago 
the health minister of western gujarat state was fatally stabbed 
tuesday night after addressing a congress party rally in 
hatmatiana 600 miles southwest of new delhi united news said a 
21yearold man was arrested but a motive was not known 
three bomb blasts rocked the kashmir valley near the pakistani 
frontier where moslem militants who want to secede from 
predominantly hindu india have warned voters to boycott the 
election no injuries were reported but press trust of india said 
the militants set fire to three polling stations and snatched 
ballots from poll workers at two other sites 
a local opposition leader sanjay singh the janata dal partys 
candidate in a simultaneous state legislature election was shot in 
the arm three miles from amethi aides said they claimed the 
gunman was a congress party activist 
no limbs were broken but the limbs of democracy have been 
broken said janata dal spokesman yashwant sinha 
gandhi and his chief opponent janata dal leader vishwanath 
pratap singh are running in separate constituencies in uttar 
pradesh 
gandhi was expected to win in the amethi constituency where he 
was opposed by the janata dals raj mohan gandhi grandson of 
indias beloved independence leader mohandas k gandhi 
raj mohan gandhi who is no relation to the prime minister was 
roughed up by police when he complained of ballotstuffing in 
jagdishpur one of main towns in the amethi district party 
headquarters in new delhi reported 
the whole election in amethi has become a farce said dinesh 
goswamy spokesman for the national front opposition coalition 
comprising the janata dal and four other parties 
the congress party meanwhile accused janata dal activists of 
killing three congress supporters in haryana state just north of 
the capital 
this is a desperate and final assault on indian democracy by 
the fascist opposition congress party spokesman anand sharma 
told a news conference in new delhi 
despite the latest opinion polls the prime minister professed 
confidence as he voted in new delhi 
were going to win he told reporters after he and his wife 
sonia and their 18yearold son rahul voted across the street 
from their house 
the opposition was buoyed by the jubilant receptions according 
singh in uttar pradesh and bihar states this week 
the national front has built its platform on pledges of honest 
capable government accusing gandhi of presiding over a coterie of 
corruption and inefficiency 
gandhi grandson of indians first prime minister jawaharlal 
nehru and son of prime minister indira gandhi has maintained that 
only his familys congress party can govern effectively 
the congress party has governed india for all but 29 months 
since independence from britain in 1947 
even when the congress party was ousted in a 1977 election the 
opposition was not nearly as united as the national front is toda 
the vote then was considered more a vote against mrs gandhi and 
her emergency rule than a vote for the opposition and mrs gandhi 
returned to power shortly afterward 
gandhi was swept into office on a massive sympathy vote in 
december 1984 two months after his mother was gunned down by two 
of her bodyguards

by trying to force two law firms to identify 
cashpaying clients the government is asking lawyers to violate 
their ethical codes defense lawyers contend 
i think its just another attempt by the government to use 
every law that can be used against lawyers and their clients in the 
name of the war on drugs said neil sonnett president of the 
national association of criminal defense lawyers on tuesday 
the government last thursday filed lawsuits under a 1984 
internal revenue service law aimed at controlling moneylaundering 
by requiring anyone conducting business to report cash transactions 
of 10000 or more 
the law is regarded as an important tool of lawenforcement 
officials to obtain information about the financial dealings of 
drug traffickers 
crack and what its done to america has given the government 
the confidence that it can push aside not only civil liberties but 
legitimate concerns that lawyers have for their clients said 
michael ross chairman of the american bar associations grand jury 
committee 
the two law firms fischetti pomerantz amp russo and goldberger amp 
dubin have represented alleged mob figures and drug suspects they 
filed reports required under the money laundering law but refused 
to identify the clients who paid in cash saying doing so would 
violate the constitutional rights of their clients and the 
attorneyclient privilege 
if they fail to comply they could face criminal penalties 
including prison terms and fines up to 500000 
mark pomerantz of fischetti pomerantz said the lawsuit would 
be contested 
we believe that the governments attempt to make us disclose 
the identity of our client is an improper intrusion in the 
attorneyclient relationship he said it should not be law 
that a private attorney should function as an agency for the 
government to gather information that can used against the client 
assistant us attorney kay k gardiner said the government was 
merely enforcing the law 
ross however said that when the law was adopted in 1984 the 
government agreed not to subpoena or summon lawyers except when the 
information was essential to an investigation and the information 
was not available from any other source

plo chief yasser arafat urged president bush to 
adopt a more aggressive stance toward israel and criticized the 
israeli proposal for elections in the occupied territories 
staterun radio said today 
but in a message sent to bush in washington the palestinian 
leader did not rule out talks between israel and palestinians 
under the right conditions israel radio said 
the radio did not say how it obtained a copy of the message 
which it said was marked classified the radios arab affairs 
reporter read a hebrew translation of the message 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said on tuesday that bush 
had received a message from arafat in the last couple of days 
but he refused to divulge its contents it was a private message 
and was sent orally in order to keep it private fitzwater said 
in the message arafat said an increasing number of palestinians 
believe israel is not seriously searching for a political solution 
according to the radio report 
this is creating an atmosphere that rouses the radicals 
against the moderates and it makes it difficult for us to keep up 
the hopes of our people patience is waning arafat was quoted as 
saying 
the palestinian nation believes the united states obligation 
to israels security should not prevent it from acting with a 
balanced policy that takes into account the legitimate rights of 
the palestinian nation and the needs of both sides of the 
conflict arafat reportedly said 
a more aggressive attitude by the us toward israel would 
raise our hopes all the while goading israel to adopt a 
reasonable stance he was quoted as saying 
in the message arafat said israels plan for elections in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip is really aimed at establishing a 
body to replace the plo the radio reported 
understandably our people in the occupied territories are 
aware of this israeli tactic and will foil every israeli attempt to 
achieve this goal arafat was quoted as saying 
israels foreign ministry refused to react to the message or 
speculate on how it may have been leaked to israel radio

east germanys ruling politburo facing 
growing challenges to communist domination today proposed talks 
with other political forces to discuss free elections and other 
reforms 
the wording of the brief statement from the official news agency 
adn appeared to indicate that the growing opposition movement would 
be included at the proposed roundtable talks 
adn did not specify a date for the talks 
it was one of the communists most significant concessions to 
the opposition in the current unrest 
leader egon krenz is clearly concerned that even though he has 
allowed free travel and opened the berlin wall huge crowds are 
still demanding further political reforms such as those under way 
in poland and hungary 
the roundtable format was used in poland to help bring 
about the solidarityled government there it was not clear whether 
the east german politburo intends to follow the same format 
according to adn the politburo presented the proposal for the 
political parties united in the government coalition to meet at a 
round table with other political forces in the country 
the other political forces appeared to refer to the 
indepenedent prodemocracy groups that have mushroomed in recent 
weeks the smaller established political parties already are part 
of the government coalition 
there at the talks the ideas about a new elections law the 
implementation of free democratic elections and a reform of the 
constitution could be discussed the adn dispatch said 
parliament already is considering a change to rid the 
constitution of the communist monopoly on power free elections 
have been promised for next year or 1991 
earlier today krenz said the party remains vital to the 
countrys future 
krenz who faces an early challenge to his leadership at a party 
congress next month also indicated today that he intends to stay 
in his post 
speaking at a factory krenz said the party will keep its grip 
on the nations factories a traditional source of local control 
and wont let itself be pushed up against the wall by the 
growing oppostion adn said 
krenz is likely to have to fight for his job when the special 
party congress meets dec 1517 with power to redefine communist 
policy and to choose a new leadership krenz has been party chief 
since oct 18 
i didnt take over to push for change just for four weeks 
krenz told workers in east berlin according to adn 
krenz said the party congress must address the question of 
responsibility for the current situation but cautioned against 
prejudgment a parliament committee already is weighing 
possible criminal charges against krenzs predecessor erich 
honecker and his inner circle 
west germanys masscirculation bild newspaper said today that 
guenter mittag honeckers former righthand man and economy czar 
was questioned for 14 hours last week it said investigators want 
to find out in which swiss bank accounts the secret police and 
communist party hid hundreds of millions of west german marks 
east germanys liberal democrats long allied with the 
communists have been leading calls for an end to the communist 
monopoly on power 
the partys no 2 official hansdieter raspe told adn the 
liberal democrats are proposing to put one of their members into a 
revised presidential post as head of state 
at present krenz holds the post of head of state as well as 
party chief his title as head of state is chairman of the council 
of state that post would be abolished under the liberal democrats 
plan 
manfred gerlach who heads the liberal democrats said at his 
first open news conference today that the government should 
recognize democratic movements like the new forum group and allow 
them to compete with established parties 
krenz has come under bitter attack from the growing opposition 
movement as well as by the governmentcontrolled national zeitung 
newspaper 
the national zeitung said people do not believe krenz will carry 
out reforms many of which he has discussed in careful generalities 
the critics have stressed krenzs role as a member of honeckers 
old guard his support for the chinese crackdown on the 
prodemocracy movement in june and his alleged involvment in 
election fraud

dozens of people marked todays 26th anniversary 
of president kennedys assassination by visiting the plaza where he 
was gunned down 
it was a gray cloud over dallas for such a long time i think 
its an event that needs to be remembered but not dwelled upon 
said ron thompson 34 a lifelong dallas resident making his first 
visit to dealey plaza 
thompson said he was in third grade when kennedy died 
it was a strange day he said i was in school and all of 
a sudden everybody was crying i was real young but still it was 
something else 
rain kept early visitors from dealey plaza but by midmorning 
about 70 tourists and dallas residents had stopped neither the 
kennedy family nor the city stages any public memorial at the 
assassination site 
we had to stop here said max ooley of borden ind who was 
traveling with his wife to visit their son in san antonio for 
thanksgiving 
i always wondered about the conspiracy aspect of it he said 
as he looked across elm street at the grassy knoll which figured 
in the warren commission investigation of the assassination 
conspiracy theorists believe there was more than one gunman and 
that some of the shots came from the knoll the warren commission 
said lee harvey oswald acted alone firing from the sixth floor of 
the former texas school book depository 
in februrary the dallas county historical foundation opened an 
exhibit on the sixth floor previously a cenotaph or empty tomb 
was the citys only kennedy memorial 
exhibit security supervisor david kilbourn said about 900 people 
tour the exhibit each day but tuesdays total was almost double 
that and he expected more people would show up today 
certainly dallas is linked in the minds of people with three 
things the assassination the cowboys and the tv show said bob 
hays interim director of the historical foundation 
you go out here any hour of the day or night and see people 
standing in dealey plaza pointing and taking photographs

congress came together early today to complete 
work on catastrophic health care and the budget deficit and adjourn 
for the year leaving behind a record notable as much for its own 
internal business as for public policy 
as they headed for the exits the house and senate adopted a 
147 billion deficitcutting bill that relied heavily on 
accounting gimmicks to make the required savings and voted to 
cancel a program that covers catastrophic health care costs for the 
elderly 
both bills were forwarded to president bush for his signature 
and the senate adjourned at 407 am with the house following 
suit 24 minutes later 
before leaving the house and senate also managed to complete 
work on all 13 money bills needed to run the federal government for 
the coming year but as they looked back on 1989 they saw little 
to brag about 
we made no new bold initiatives in public policy said house 
minority leader robert michel rill the best that could be said 
he added was that house leaders have laid aside the bitter 
atmosphere in which the year started and set the stage for real 
achievements next year 
in the annual adjournment telephone call to the president at 
1247 am michel told bush the whole attitude around here has 
had a decided change to underscore that point michel won 
approval on the house floor of a resolution thanking speaker thomas 
s foley dwash for his impartial stewardship of the house 
when senate leaders called bush three hours later the president 
said when all the dust settles i think you had a pretty good 
session of the whole congress 
foley who took over the reins at midyear when his 
ethicsscarred predecessor jim wright resigned agreed he listed 
creating a mood of comity and confidence as his top 
accomplishment 
but much of the session was consumed by controversies over the 
ethics of members of congress and efforts to raise lawmakers pay 
wrights ethics case tied up the house for nearly half the year 
and six senators became snared in ethics controversies as the year 
ended 
this is the unfinished congress said rep newt gingrich 
rga the no 2 gop leadership official in the house the jury 
is still out 
among accomplishments were the first increase in the minimum 
wage since 1981 although it was less than democrats sought a new 
bipartisan approach toward us policy in nicaragua passage of a 
massive bailout for the savings and loan industry aid to encourage 
political and economic reforms taking place in poland and hungary 
and an extensive antidrug package 
the capitols democratic leaders also claimed credit for barring 
several things that didnt take place the nomination of john tower 
to be secretary of defense a constitutional amendment banning flag 
desecration and a cut in the tax rate on capital gains 
at years end congress also summoned its courage and approved 
another initiative which lawmakers wont claim much credit for a 
pay raise for themselves and other top federal officials with it 
came a series of ethics reforms including a ban on acceptance of 
speaking fees 
under a complicated formula house members will see their 
current 89500 salary boosted to at least 120800 over the next 
13 months in exchange for giving up their speaking fees 
senators will get only an 8900 raise but they will be able to 
keep speaking fees until the honoaria system is phased out over 
many years 
its a session that began with some despair based on the 
internal bickering and ended with buoyancy based on the congress 
coming together on the pay raise said rep jim leach riowa 
he said the session reflected tension between a white house and 
a congress dominated by different parties in which the executive 
has prevailed in setting the agenda and reining in the instincts of 
congress to spend more at the same time congress and world 
events have laid the basis for greater executive branch restraint 
on military spending in the coming years he added 
foley listed an ambitious legislative agenda for the 101st 
congress in 1990 including clean air legislation a major child 
care initiative new progress on reducing the budget deficit and 
campaign finance reform he said congress may also need to 
readdress the need for catastrophic health care coverage for the 
elderly 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan agreed that some of 
those would be high priorities well be off to a fast start 
when congress returns in january he said 
in the final hours of the 1989 session the house insisted on 
complete repeal of the catastrophic health care law which paid for 
longterm care in return for a surtax on wealthier retired people 
it was the surtax that prompted an outcry that led to moves to 
scuttle the law 
the final deficitcutting package contained some actual savings 
as well as some that were more illusory such as shifting the 
moneylosing postal service off the budget it imposed some 6 
billion in new taxes most on corporations and relied on 
acrosstheboard cuts triggered last month by the grammrudman 
deficitreduction law for another 46 billion 
one bill that missed the adjournment boat was a twoyear 97 
billion authorization measure for the state department the us 
information agency and the board for international broadcasting 
the measure which also codified a series of trade sanctions 
against china over its bloody crackdown on prodemocracy protesters 
last spring will have to be taken up again next year

attorney general dick thornburgh today 
filed an unprecendented national security declaration that could 
kill the irancontra criminal case against a former cia station 
chief 
for the first time the government invoked a provision of 
federal law to bar disclosure of certain classified information a 
step that could lead to dismissal of criminal charges against 
joseph fernandez 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh the irancontra 
prosecutor immediately deplored the move accusing thornburgh in a 
statement of trying to protect fictional secrets in a way that 
could block the trial from going forward 
thornburghs action was disclosed at a pretrial proceeding 
before us district judge claude hilton the judge scheduled 
another court session for friday morning to provide an opportunity 
to review the declaration 
as cia station chief in costa rica fernandez assisted white 
house aide oliver norths secret contra resupply network at a time 
when congress had banned military assistance to the nicaraguan 
rebels by us intelligence agencies 
fernandez is accused of obstructing the cia inspector generals 
office and the tower commission that investigated the irancontra 
affair and of making false statements about his activities on 
behalf of north 
evidence that fernandez plans to use in his defense would cause 
serious damage to the national security of the united states 
thornburgh said in a statement 
outside the us courthouse associate independent counsel 
laurence shtasel said we are disappointed that the affidavit is 
extremely broad and blocks the disclosure of information that 
is generally known to the public 
an important prosecution is at stake shtasel said joseph 
fernandez is the highestranking cia official ever indicted 
justice department spokesman david runkel said the department 
believes the fernandez case still can be brought to trial despite 
the declaration 
ron noble a deputy assistant attorney general in the 
departments criminal division said there is always a 
possibility that the government can come up with a way to bring 
at least some of the charges against fernandez 
it is my abiding sense that further judicial examination 
will establish the potential for accommodating both the defendants 
rights and the national security interests at stake thereby 
allowing this case to be tried to conclusion thornburgh said in 
his statement which noble read in court 
fernandezs lawyer thomas wilson said the sword of 
damocles had been hanging over his clients head for three years 
and that hilton should dismiss the case now that the declaration 
has been filed 
lawyers in walshs office asked the judge to let them respond in 
writing before he makes a decision on any national security 
affidavit filed by the department 
after the hearing walsh issued a statement saying we deplore 
the fact that the attorney general for the first time has filed an 
affidavit to protect fictional secrets which could prevent the 
trial of a former highranking cia official 
in july hilton said fernandez must be allowed to present in his 
defense details concerning cia programs in costa rica and the 
locations of agency stations in honduras and el salvador 
fernandez was to have gone to trial july 24 but hilton rejected 
a proposal by prosecutors that would have limited disclosure of the 
classified material 
the justice department sought to appeal hiltons rulings to the 
us court of appeals in richmond va but that effort failed 
meanwhile businessman albert hakim pleaded guilty tuesday to a 
misdemeanor while one of his corporations used to divert arms sale 
profits pleaded guilty to a felony 
the iranianborn hakim said in court that he helped pay for a 
security fence at norths home with money from the enterprise 
the complex of foreign companies hakim operated in the irancontra 
scandal 
lake resources inc a swiss company used as a conduit for iran 
arms sale money and aid to the contras pleaded guilty to theft of 
government property a felony carrying a maximum penalty of up to 
500000 hakim who faces sentencing feb 1 was the principal 
shareholder in lake resources 
the plea agreement says that from late 1985 to november 1986 
hakim his business partner richard secord north and national 
security adviser john poindexter used their influence to generate 
and divert approximately 162 million to enterprise bank 
accounts 
us district judge gerhard gesell accepted the agreement after 
meeting with prosecutors and defense attorneys

an american airlines pilot confronting bad 
weather en route to the east coast left it up to the passengers 
whether to continue or return to ohare international airport 
according to a report published today 
on a show of hands the passengers voted to continue to new 
york two passengers said 
the weather during the flight thursday became so bad that the 
plane had to land about 60 miles away at stewart airport near 
newburgh ny the trip was completed by bus 
american airlines today said it is investigating the chicago 
suntimes report involving flight 492 to laguardia airport 
american spokesman tom stack said the airline had not been able 
to determine whether the pilot actually left the decision up to 
passengers 
normally i would think those kinds of things are decided by 
air traffic control in conjunction with the pilot said stack 
he added we dont have any reaction because were investigating 
the circumstances 
the plane carried a cockpit crew of three and 62 passengers 
stack said he declined to identify the pilot 
federal aviation administration spokesman don zochert would not 
say if the agency is investigating and referred calls to american 
passengers fred and muriel sider of suburban chicago said they 
still cant believe what happened 
ive been a travel agent for 20 years and never saw anything 
like this said ms sider 
the passengers were asked if they wanted to go ahead to new 
york where there were bad storms or return to ohare said her 
husband president of fred sider advertising in northbrook 
passengers who live in new york and people headed there on 
business raised their hands that they wanted to go ahead ms 
sider said they were in the majority 
sider said that after they landed he asked the pilot why he let 
the passengers decide 
he said he was following instructions from the tower sider 
said 
not this tower said ralph korner manager of stewart 
airport that would be strictly an airline carriers decision i 
never heard of such a thing it sounds a bit strange 
a safety officer at stewart airport who declined to give his 
name confirmed that the plane landed at the airport at 1021 am 
thursday but said he hadnt heard about the incident 
there was severe weather at that time he said that 
particular morning there was a small tornado in the area 
at an elementary school near the airport seven students were

jeanne sharp whose ancestors lived and 
farmed in this rural new york community before the american 
revolution is learning a hard lesson about rebellion governments 
often fight back 
sharp and more than 300 other residents who filed a lawsuit 
trying to block construction of a garbage incinerator are in turn 
being sued by lawmakers 
ive been thinking a lot about ethan allen said sharp i 
have some idea of what my ancestors went through to get here 
if they can put up with it so can i 
residents sued washington county and adjoining warren county 
last year over the proposed incinerator which is to be built in 
hudson falls about 40 miles north of albany to burn garbage for 
both counties they contend that local officials approved the plan 
without a proper public hearing 
the counties and their industrial development agency 
countersued seeking 15 million from 320 plaintiffs most of them 
washington county residents washington county later dropped out 
but warren county and the ida remain 
the residents recognizable around the area by the bright orange 
plaintiff bumper stickers affixed to their cars say the 
countersuit was filed to harass them into dropping their lawsuit 
environmentalists say it could have national implications for 
other citizen action groups that turn to the courts to challenge 
controversial projects the environmental movement even has a name 
for it a slapp suit or strategic lawsuit against public 
participation 
its a strategy to hush people up and stop them from speaking 
out said lois gibbs who led the fight over the love canal toxic 
dump in niagara falls and now runs the virginiabased citizens 
clearinghouse for hazardous waste 
this case stands out as the only one of its kind that i know 
of where government chooses to sue its own people said will 
collette citizens clearinghouses slapp suit expert 
other slapp suits which collette calls legal terrorism 
have been brought across the country by private companies involved 
in projects the idea is to squash the opposition 
people who bring slapp suits dont expect to win them he said 
they all get dropped they never go to trial warren county has 
no expectation of winning its case 
in washington county some supervisors told people they might 
lose their homes or cars as a result of the countersuit the 
plaintiffs claim 
theyre trying to harass us and intimidate us down to a 
handful of manageable troublemakers said melody brown who 
admits to being one of the more vocal incinerator opponents being 
sued 
the countersuit contends the citizens lawsuit was frivolous and 
that actions by the incinerator opponents during the sale of bonds 
for the project cost the counties 15 million 
at the original closing date for the bond sale there were 
committed purchasers as the result of the activities of the 
citizens those contracts were abrogated it was necessary to enter 
into new contracts and passage of time and a change in the market 
brought a 15 million loss said benjamin pratt a glens falls 
lawyer for the counties and ida that loss increased the cost of 
the project and with it the cost of burning garbage 
now the incinerator opponents want to add more litigation to the 
fray a federal civil rights lawsuit in response to the lawsuit 
against them theyve hired atlantabased civil rights lawyer 
robert remar 
the first amendment to the constitution gives all of us the 
right to freedom of speech freedom of association and the right to 
petition government for redress of grievances said remar when 
a government seeks to basically punish the citizens for having 
exercised those rights thats a violation of the constitution 
pratt said the counterclaim doesnt violate anyones civil 
rights 
they have the right to speak with respect to the proceedings 
and actions being taken by the government they have a right to sue 
their government if they feel that something is done improperly 
but they dont have the right to perform in such a fashion that 
they interfere with the contractual rights that the government has 
with third parties and cause a 15 million loss 
hammond robertson chairman of the warren county board of 
supervisors said he supports the counterclaim as has a majority 
of that board every time someone moves to drop it 
i have to recognize that people have some strong feelings on 
this issue said robertson but there are 110000 people in 
these two counties we have some obligation to the other 100000 
people 
while the lawsuits go on over the 80 million incinerator 
resolution isnt expected until some time next year excavation is 
nearing completion at the plant site next to the hudson river 
meanwhile the incinerator has hit a legal snag in yet another 
lawsuit a state judge ruled that the state should have required 
more environmental assessments of the project before renewing its 
latest permits that suit was brought by the village of hudson 
falls construction has stopped while the state considers whether 
to appeal 
the main point of the original lawsuit whether there was a 
public hearing on the project is still in dispute while robertson 
said a hearing wasnt required pratt said the twocounty ida held 
one 
stephanie wenk another active incinerator opponent said the 
ida hearing lasted just 45 minutes and that everyone wasnt allowed 
to speak 
the public hearing was a sham said wenk who has been known 
to tie a gag over her mouth at supervisors meetings they let 11 
people speak out of 49 then they just banged the gavel and that 
was it

broadcasts of the protest in downtown wenceslas square showing 
interviews with actors at the demonstration interspersed with film 
of rock bands 
but an announcer then came on the air and said the broadcasts 
were being temporarily stopped because some employees of the 
czechoslovak state television did not agree with them 
this was after they had shown a worker a communist party member 
for 20 years who questioned official accounts of a demonstration 
friday that was brutally dispersed by police 
what is the government afraid of they may be afraid because 
they are lying to us for 20 years said the worker identified as 
honza lexa

country 
elsewhere in czechsolovakia 80000 students and intellectuals

conciliatory moves by the communist premier 
sharp divisions emerged in the ruling elite 
while jakes has maintained a hard line against the protesters 
premier ladislav adamec on tuesday met with a delegation that 
included prominent dissidents an unprecedented event that all but 
legitimized the burgeoning opposition movement 
members of the group said adamec was conciliatory telling them 
authorities were open to dialogue with the opposition whose 
leaders have long been harrassed by police and jailed on charges of 
antisocialist agitation 
he reportedly told them that neither martial law nor police 
force would be used to block protests 
church sources said a jakes ally met today with roman catholic 
cardinal frantisek tomasek who lent his influential voice to the 
prodemocracy movement in a strongly worded appeal tuesday 
the sources who asked not to be identified said tomasaks

creative artists and support a general strike on nov 27 he 
added

the factory as saying employees would join the studentled strike 
then make up the two hours of missed work later 
more than 150000 people rallied on pragues central wenceslas 
square on tuesday emboldened by the tide of democratic change that 
is ending oneparty rule in poland and hungary and has brought 
broad changes to east germany 
thousands of other protesters gathered in at least 14 other 
cities and towns the largescale provincial demonstrations were 
the first since a 1968 sovietled invasion crushed the prague 
spring reform movement 
havel and others spoke from the balcony of the building housing 
offices of svobodne slovo the voice of the socialist party and the 
first official newspaper to denounce the police repression of a 
rally friday in prague police have since shown restraint

president rene mouawad was killed today 
when a bomb exploded on a street in moslem west beirut as his 
motorcade passed by he had been president only 17 days 
a police spokesman said mouawad died instantly in the blast 
which came minutes after the president held a reception marking 
lebanons independence day the spokesman refused to say why police 
initially reported mouawad was not hurt in the blast 
at least 23 other people were reported killed including 10 of 
mouawads bodyguards 
col mohammed khashab a police bomb squad official said the 
bomb was hidden in a small shop and detonated by remote control he 
denied earlier reports that a car which was set ablaze by the 
blast had contained the explosives 
there was no immediate claim of responsibility the bomb went 
off at 145 pm on bustros boulevard in the sanayeh district it 
was so powerful it hurled the presidents bulletproof mercedes 
limousine several yards off the street 
mouawad 64 a maronite catholic had long advocated 
christianmoslem reconciliation in his country he was elected nov 
5 at a special parliament session as part of an arab 
leaguesponsored peace plan aimed at ending lebanons 14yearold 
civil war 
he was sworn in the same day despite strong objections by the 
christian leader gen michel aoun who opposed the plan the 
parliamentary session was moved to syriancontrolled north lebanon 
after aoun threatened to shell it 
mouawads top aides prime ministerdesignate salim hoss a 
sunni moslem and parliament speaker hussein husseini a shiite 
moslem also were in the 10car convoy in the vehicle behind the 
presidents police said they were not hurt 
it is a national disaster hoss said in a radio address to 
the nation 2 hours after the explosion president rene mouawad 
was assassinated by the hand of treason he said his voice 
breaking with emotion 
syrias staterun media issued a similar statement today 
condemning the assassination and blaming it on the hand of 
betrayal and treason 
president bush denounced the assassination as disgraceful 
terroristic and pledged continued us assistance for efforts to 
end lebanons civil war it is a disgraceful performance and is 
condemned by the united states of america bush said 
however we must not let this brutal killing stand in the way 
of trying to bring peace to the troubled corner of the world i 
would like to offer the help of americato bring these killers to 
justice bush said 
in other early reaction an israeli official described the 
murder as a defeat for syria in paris national assembly deputies 
held a moment of silence 
a statement from hosss office said hoss and husseini had 
convened in crisis talks to prepare for a quick parliament 
session to elect a successor to mouawad 
the statement stressed that the leaders were trying to avoid a 
political vacuum that would undermine the peace plan which was 
approved last month 
aoun objected to the plan because it did not include a timetable 
for the withdrawal of the 40000 syrian troops in lebanon he 
denounced mouawad as a syrian puppet 
the syrians were deployed in lebanon in 1976 under a 
peacekeeping mandate to quell civil war fighting aoun said they 
abrogated the mandate by siding with the moslems in the civil war 
and he has vowed to drive them out 
on sept 14 1982 presidentelect bashir gemayel a maronite 
was assassinated 
his brother amin gemayel became president and served until his 
term ran out in september 1988 from that time until mouawads 
election lebanon had been without a president because parliament 
was unable to agree on a president 
the police spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity in line 
with standing regulations said 23 people including 10 of 
mouawads bodyguards were also killed today he identified the 
dead bodyguards as six syrian army soldiers and four lebanese 
soldiers 
the spokesman also said 36 people including many civilians 
were injured 
mouawad and his aides had just left government house in sanayeh 
where they were hosts to foreign diplomats parliamentarians and 
other dignitaries at a reception marking independence day 
lebanon gained independence from france on nov 22 1943 
hundreds of syrian soldiers and lebanese army troops and 
policemen converged on the scene the syrians fired their rifles 
and several rocketpropelled grenades in the air to clear the way 
for ambulances most of the victims were quickly picked up by 
civilian cars and rushed to hospitals before ambulances arrived 
the streets emptied of civilians who apparently feared an 
outbreak of shelling duels between aouns troops and allied syrian 
and moslem forces 
voice of lebanon radio broadcast appeals for blood donations 
the independence day celebration in sanayeh was markedly 
lowkey but all ambassadors accredited to lebanon attended 
underscoring their countries recognition of mouawad as head of 
state 
in east beirut about 1000 soldiers of aouns mainly christian 
units held a symbolic parade at the military academy in the 
garrison town of fayadiyeh 
the french british italian turkish and chinese military 
attaches attended the celebration seven helicopters hovered 
overhead as three aging hawker hunter jets fighters made a single 
low run over the parade grounds 
brig gen issam abu jamra one of the three officers in aouns 
breakway military cabinet presided over the parade 
aoun reportedly fears an attempt on his life and seldom ventures 
out of the bunker under the devastated presidential palace in the 
beirut suburb of baabda 
mouawad is survived by a wife nayla koury and two children 
michel 17 and rima 22 
before being elected president mouawad had been a member of the 
99seat parliament since he was elected to represent his home 
region of zghorta in 1957 at the age of 32 his assassination 
leaves only 72 surviving members of the parliament

congress early today repealed catastrophic 
health care passed a deficitreduction bill and adjourned for the 
year leaving behind a record notable as much for its own internal 
business as for public policy 
president bush said he was pleased with the outcome especially 
the deficit package that took most of the year to complete he 
praised both democrats and republicans for a spirit of real 
cooperation 
we have laid the foundation for a very productive session 
when congress returns in january senate majority leader george 
mitchell dmaine told reporters 
as they headed for the exits the house and senate adopted a 
147 billion deficitcutting bill that relied heavily on 
accounting gimmicks to make the required savings and voted to 
cancel a program that covers catastrophic health care costs for the 
elderly 
both bills were forwarded to bush for his signature and the 
senate adjourned at 407 am with the house following suit 24 
minutes later 
before leaving the house and senate also managed to complete 
work on all 13 money bills needed to run the federal government for 
the coming year but as they looked back on 1989 they saw little 
to brag about 
we made no new bold initiatives in public policy said house 
minority leader robert michel rill the best that could be said 
he added was that house leaders have laid aside the bitter 
atmosphere in which the year started and set the stage for real 
achievements next year 
in the annual adjournment telephone call to the president at 
1247 am michel told bush the whole attitude around here has 
had a decided change to underscore that point michel won 
approval on the house floor of a resolution thanking speaker thomas 
s foley dwash for his impartial stewardship of the house 
when senate leaders called bush three hours later the president 
said when all the dust settles i think you had a pretty good 
session of the whole congress 
foley who took over the reins at midyear when his 
ethicsscarred predecessor jim wright resigned agreed he listed 
creating a mood of comity and confidence as his top 
accomplishment 
but much of the session was consumed by controversies over the 
ethics of members of congress and efforts to raise lawmakers pay 
wrights ethics case tied up the house for nearly half the year 
and six senators became snared in ethics controversies as the year 
ended 
this is the unfinished congress said rep newt gingrich 
rga the no 2 gop leadership official in the house the jury 
is still out 
among accomplishments were the first increase in the minimum 
wage since 1981 although it was less than democrats sought a new 
bipartisan approach toward us policy in nicaragua passage of a 
massive bailout for the savings and loan industry aid to encourage 
political and economic reforms taking place in poland and hungary 
and an extensive antidrug package 
the capitols democratic leaders also claimed credit for barring 
several things that didnt take place the nomination of john tower 
to be secretary of defense a constitutional amendment banning flag 
desecration and a cut in the tax rate on capital gains 
at years end congress also summoned its courage and approved 
another initiative which lawmakers wont claim much credit for a 
pay raise for themselves and other top federal officials with it 
came a series of ethics reforms including a ban on acceptance of 
speaking fees 
under a complicated formula house members will see their 
current 89500 salary boosted to at least 120800 over the next 
13 months in exchange for giving up their speaking fees 
senators will get only an 8900 raise but they will be able to 
keep speaking fees until the honoaria system is phased out over 
many years 
its a session that began with some despair based on the 
internal bickering and ended with buoyancy based on the congress 
coming together on the pay raise said rep jim leach riowa 
he said the session reflected tension between a white house and 
a congress dominated by different parties in which the executive 
has prevailed in setting the agenda and reining in the instincts of 
congress to spend more at the same time congress and world 
events have laid the basis for greater executive branch restraint 
on military spending in the coming years he added 
foley listed an ambitious legislative agenda for the 101st 
congress in 1990 including clean air legislation a major child 
care initiative new progress on reducing the budget deficit and 
campaign finance reform he said congress may also need to 
readdress the need for catastrophic health care coverage for the 
elderly 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan agreed that some of 
those would be high priorities well be off to a fast start 
when congress returns in january he said 
in the final hours of the 1989 session the house insisted on 
complete repeal of the catastrophic health care law which paid for 
longterm care in return for a surtax on wealthier retired people 
it was the surtax that prompted an outcry that led to moves to 
scuttle the law 
the final deficitcutting package contained some actual savings 
as well as some that were more illusory such as shifting the 
moneylosing postal service off the budget it imposed some 6 
billion in new taxes most on corporations and relied on 
acrosstheboard cuts triggered last month by the grammrudman 
deficitreduction law for another 46 billion 
one bill that missed the adjournment boat was a twoyear 97 
billion authorization measure for the state department the us 
information agency and the board for international broadcasting 
the measure which also codified a series of trade sanctions 
against china over its bloody crackdown on prodemocracy protesters 
last spring will have to be taken up again next year

chinese university students must adhere to 
socialist collectivism and love labor according to a new code 
from the state education commission 
the code will help students grow up to be socialist successors 
more rapidly said education commission official zhang renxian 
the official xinhua news agency which carried the remarks by 
zhang did not provide details of the code but said it demands 
that students defend the interests of the motherland abide by 
the constitution adhere to socialist collectivism and love labor 
it also takes up moral behavior maintaining public order and 
abiding by the discipline of foreign affairs 
the government says that inadequate attention to mental and 
physical discipline and political education led to the spring 
prodemocracy student movement that was ended by a bloody military 
crackdown on what authorities say was a counterrevolutionary 
rebellion 
since june all university students have been required to attend 
classes on party doctrine and ideology 
there also has been a renewed stress on physical labor an 
educational practice largely abandoned in the past decade

as far back as jumia davi can remember 
she has been voting for the ruling congress party and each time 
she votes the local party man has given her 10 rupees about 60 
cents 
on wednesday the greatgrandmother didnt get a thing 
but i am still a supporter said mrs davi ive seen a 
lot more than broken campaign promises in my 100 years 
mrs davi who turned 100 last month was one of tens of 
millions of people to cast their ballots in the first day of 
indias national elections to decide the fate of prime minister 
rajiv gandhis government 
for mrs davi who is bent with age and unable to walk voting 
was difficult she rode to the poll in the back of a bicycle 
rickshaw accompanied by relatives including her greatgrandson who 
walked alongside the family is poor and cant afford a taxi 
her 70yearold son carried her to the ballot box but on the 
way he slipped and mrs davi fell to the ground skinning her elbow 
once inside the booth mrs davi had to search for several 
minutes to find the symbol of the prime ministers congress party 
like 63 percent of her countrymen she is illiterate 
i was looking for the big hand she said extending her palm 
in a gesture similar to the congress party symbol but i couldnt 
find it the ballot was too big 
the ballot 2 feet long and a foot wide was filled with the 
names and symbols of 38 candidates 
finally her daughterinlaw found the symbol and mrs davi 
shakily placed an ink stamp on the box 
mrs davi says she was perturbed this year that no one paid her 
any money to vote 
the congress people promised it but they failed me she 
said i could use the money only my son is working but he also 
is getting old 
votebuying is a tradition in india local party offices 
function like businesses dispensing jobs and money in exchange for 
votes 
in one section of the capital hundreds of people were lined up 
to vote and all of them said they had chosen congress 
they built all of our houses and gave most of us jobs said 
the headmaster of the school where the voting was being conducted 
we owe it to them 
mrs davi who has long gray hair and twinkling black eyes is a 
hindu who was born in what is now lahore pakistan she moved to 
india shortly before independence in 1947 and said she has never 
missed an election 
you can call me an old women but i love democracy she says 
daubing her injured arm with a piece of scrap cardboard look i 
am even bleeding for it

grants pass ore daily courier on east bloc reform and cuba 
more than 40 years of pentup frustration continues to spill 
dramatically from the tear in eastern europes communist 
political fabric 
the restless peoples of the east bloc have told their 
governments they will no longer be put off in their desires for 
basic personal freedoms and for political and economic reforms 
manufacturing facilities rust in a sea of obsolescence 
collective farms have failed to feed the population that the 
factories have failed to clothe 
all of which must be giving the shakes to fidel castro 
all of the problems plaguing eastern europe plague cuba as well 
and castro must know the day is coming when the cuban people demand 
basic travel trade and political freedoms 
that day will be hastened when the soviet union now propping 
up the anemic cuban economy with massive financial aid and sugar 
price subsidies weans castro from his umbilical cord to moscow 
and tells him its time for cuba to shift for itself in the real 
world

the sad truth is that the us cant help walesa now or 
anytime soon the marshall plan that saved western europe in the 
late 1940s and early 50s cost 13 billion multiply that three or 
four times to imagine what it would cost today 
then remember also that we are spending 165 billion each year

baraboo wis newsrepublic on national coordination against 
abductions 
the recent abduction of 11yearold jacob wetterling near his 
hometown of st joseph minn once again casts an ugly light on 
the fact that this country does not have a national clearinghouse 
for information regarding missing children 
while posters featuring the boys picture and other relevant 
information have been distributed throughout the nation they 
include three different telephone numbers for people to call with 
information 
mothers have been told by police that it is easier to trace a 
stolen automobile than it is to trace a missing child 
that is a national disgrace 
with advanced technology in the field of communications there 
is no justifiable reason the nation does not have one central place 
where information regarding missing children can be processed 
that clearinghouse could be the repository for information 
regarding known child abductors and sexual molesters as well as a 
funnel for information regarding sightings of possible victims 
such a service would not only aid authorities in their search 
for missing children but would also offer parents with missing 
children a chance to keep completely up to date on the search for 
their children 
while the plight of jacob wetterling has touched millions across 
this nation even if he is found safe and sound the publicity 
surrounding this case will all be for naught if congress does not 
begin to seriously consider a national missing childrens center

27 years in so doing they dealt colombia and the united states a 
serious defeat in the cocaine war 
 
it seems obvious that the united states should not have taken a 
bite out of colombias export earnings from coffee while it was 
asking the colombians to help curtail an even larger export 
cocaine indeed it was obvious to president bush and drug czar 
william bennett once they learned of the walkout 
coffee consumption is slipping only an estimated 52 percent of 
americans for example now drink coffee down from 75 percent in 
1962 colombian farmers most of whom are impoverished already 
have enough incentive to switch from coffee to coca without 
american trade negotiators helping out 
apparently american negotiators had objected to the coffee 
producers sales to eastern bloc nations at discounted prices and 
they wanted a change in the quota structure to allow the united 
states to receive higher grades of beans 
bennett must also keep an eye on obscure but important decisions 
being made by such agencies as the commerce department and the 
office of the special trade representative

greensboro nc news amp record on nuclear arms 
the thrill of exerting world power isnt all thats behind the 
formidable us defense machine but its one factor in keeping it 
intact in the next few years unless us leaders remain blind to 
warning signals that powerhigh may have to come down 
one obvious signal of course is the cut in soviet defense 
forces this year long promised by soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev it appears that a 1 percent cut has already occurred and 
that cuts will increase next year 
gorbachev has little choice the expense of waging a nuclear 
arms race against the united states and of defending eastern europe 
ravaged the soviet economy 
occurring as they do sidebyside with the new openness of 
glasnost soviet defense cuts and economic shifts are easily 
interpreted by westerners as ideological turnarounds far from it 
soviet ideology lives 
but the ledger has the same columns the world around soviets 
cant afford to wage the cold war any longer and the united states 
cant either watching the soviets face facts in red and black ink 
should prompt americans to do the same 
the postwar alignment has cost this country dearly in 
protecting and gaining the allegiance of other nations it may have 
drawn us concerns outward at the expense of domestic needs now 
perhaps the strongest warning signals of all 
its hard to find a time in us history when there were more 
urgent crises in housing and education the drug trade has thrust 
an unprecedented challenge on our society 
solving these will require wholesale budget changes that far 
exceed simply meeting grammrudman requirements they demand 
nothing less than a revised set of national priorities 
at a time when europeans are looking beyond immediate political 
changes and talking about longrange goals so americans should be 
assessing where we want to be in five years and 10 and 20 our 
world position then is likely to be determined by our domestic and 
economic health at home

the albuquerque nm tribune on a plane for house speaker 
thomas foley 
the house of representatives wisely put air foley out of 
business before the plane got off the ground 
proposed legislation would have set aside an air force c20 for 
the exclusive use of speaker thomas foley dwash 
only foley would have been able to say who could fly and when on 
the plush jet transport which comes with galley deep seats and

move over ll bean 
the new guy on the block is a catalog company that sells 
everything from recycled toilet paper to a 2295 trip to the costa 
rican rain forest and gives free birch tree seeds with every 
order 
sound quirky its owners used to think so but the catalog for 
the environmentally conscious is winning praise from interest 
groups that hope it soon will be as mainstream as the freeport 
maine outfit 
its 100 percent business 100 percent philosophy said alan 
newman coowner of seventh generation products for a healthy 
planet if we are successful we will be successful because of 
our ability to sell to someone who doesnt consider themselves 
environmentalists 
jonathan schorsch of the council for economic priorities and 
coauthor of the book shopping for a better world said seventh 
generation is on the leading edge of a spreading movement he said 
a few similar companies have sprung up on the west coast 
i dont think that means buyers can be less aware schorsch 
added it still requires a certain amount of homework on how 
green these products are 
seventh generation sells biodegradable garbage bags cleaners 
made of organic ingredients beeswax crayons organic flea powder 
portable water filters solar flashlights and energyefficient 
lighting products 
joanne hurley of the sierra club applauded the companys 
educational approach the catalog explains products and their 
benefits and tells readers where to get more information 
john rustin an economic analyst for the new yorkbased 
environmental defense fund said walmart a major retailer has 
been looking for environmentally sound products to sell in its 
discount stores 
newman peering out from behind lime green glasses and clad in 
jeans a flannel shirt and birkenstock sandals owns the catalog 
company with his pinstriped new york partner jeffrey hollender 
their styles are as different as their wardrobes newmans 
battered address book is covered in scribbled notes hollenders is 
columned and neatly printed but they share a devotion to the earth 
its nice to have a business that is so supportive of a 
philosophy ive had for years newman said its also nice that 
our success is directly linked with the degree we help our 
customers clean up the environment 
seventh generation is filling more than 1000 orders a week and 
fighting a backlog the company also has turned down 2500 items 
for the catalog 
newmans favorite item is the toilet paper made from recycled 
paper products newman figures if people are brave enough to try 
recycled toilet paper theyve crossed a prissy line and are open 
to other products 
i remember when it used to be quirky newman said but 
its something so simple and really makes a difference here was 
have something that was on its way to clog a landfill and using it 
causes us to not have to cut down more trees 
newman and hollender entered the project last year with a wary 
eye 
i really thought the marketplace was five or eight years away 
and the marketplace has a way of chewing up people who get in ahead 
of their time newman said 
he had been running another catalog company and was advising the 
national advocacy group renew america with its catalog operation 
renew america decided to get out of the catalog business and 
offered to sell to newman 
he said their catalog targets environmental groups other 
catalog mailing lists and those who inquire about it but the key 
to converting the public they say is to make it easy and 
inexpensive to be environmentally conscious

mayor edward i koch claims a hotel partly owned 
by his longtime nemesis billionaire developer donald trump owes 
the city 28 million under a lease agreement but a state agency 
is cool to the idea 
the mayor said tuesday he had asked the state to demand payment 
from the grand hyatt hotel 
harold holzer spokesman for the state urban development corp 
which acts as the citys agent in the lease arrangement said the 
udc wants an independent auditor to make sure the case is 
separate from city halls relationship with donald trump 
the hotel issued a statement calling the citys claim a 
blatantly political attack and one last cheap shot at trump 
by koch 
totally untrue the mayor responded 
koch said an audit reveals disturbing accounting practices 
that we want rectified he said the audit was initiated without 
my knowledge 
the hotels statement characterized the issue as a dispute 
amongst accountants and attorneys over technical accounting 
determinations and legal interpretations 
karen burstein the citys auditor general said that in 1985 
hyatt revenue reached 78 million and the operating partnership 
paid 37 million as percentage rental but the following year she 
said revenue rose to 799 million and rental paid to the city 
fell to 667155 under new accounting procedures

the trouble of recruiting doctors to 
smalltown america prompted a hospital official to support a 
lighter prison term for a felon he wants to hire as a doctor 
an administrator for jarman hospital in tuscola asked us 
district judge michael mihm on tuesday for an early release for 
monty mcclellan convicted of felony bankruptcy fraud 
mcclellan also has a malpractice charge pending against him 
stemming from the death of a patient in 1984 
but administrator mark fedyk who said he was unaware of the 
malpractice charge insisted the hospital needs a doctor its 
very difficult to recruit people to small towns he said 
tuscola is a town of 3800 about 100 miles southeast of peoria 
mcclellan was convicted in january 1988 and sentenced to eight 
years in prison but a federal appeals court ruled mihm erred by 
giving him more than the maximum five years allowed for bankruptcy 
fraud 
at the resentencing hearing tuesday mihm agreed to delay a 
decision until jan 19 and urged hospital officials to scrutinize 
mcclellans record 
mihm said utahs medical licensing board limited mcclellans 
practice for gross incompetence in treating patients 
if i were to let him out early and something were to happen 
while he was working there i dont want any blame for that mihm 
said ordering part of mcclellans confidential file turned over to 
hospital and city officials 
i want to make sure they are fully informed of any warts 
and wrinkles we are informed of 
we wouldnt have any problem letting the whole community know 
about his problems said richard parsons mcclellans attorney 
i hasten to point out to the court that malpractice suits against 
doctors are common 
mcclellan filed for bankruptcy protection in illinois in 1984 
and moved to west jordan utah he was convicted of bankruptcy 
fraud mail fraud and lying to a bank about his income to secure 
loans prosecutors said he sold two sports cars to his father 
shortly before his bankruptcy filing to hide them from creditors

south carolina gov carroll campbell on 
wednesday thanked americans for their help in the wake of hurricane 
hugo and urged tourists to return to prime vacation spots in his 
state 
this storm left us bent and bruised but thanks to all the 
outside help and the strength of our people were not broken he 
said 
south carolina is coming back strong anybody who says 
otherwise is packing more wind than hugo 
campbell said at a news conference that tourism is a major 
industry in south carolina bringing in 47 billion in revenue and 
providing 97000 jobs 
he said many hurricaneravaged tourist areas rebounded quickly 
unfortunately some of the publicity we received as a result 
of the storm created misconceptions and made many potential 
visitors uneasy campbell said we want to make sure travellers 
know that our vacation destinations are on line and can still 
provide visitors with a great experience 
hugo he said killed 18 people and caused an estimated 6 
billion in damage when it slammed into the south carolina coast 
sept 22 he said about 16000 state residents are still homeless 
because of the storm 
wylie whisonant jr deputy undersecretary of commerce for 
travel and tourism appealed to the media to give as much 
coverage to the recovery process as was afforded the destruction 
this is particularly vital to the tourism industry which 
relies on image to induce sales he said often the effects of 
inaccurate or incomplete coverage can be just as damaging 
economically to an area as the initial destructive force

when hurricane hugo hit south carolina two 
months ago pamela muirhead lost her home her belongings and the 
silversmith tools she used to make her living 
but ms muirhead and her friends will put their problems aside 
for a time and gather thursday for a special thanksgiving dinner 
im really lucky that i can look forward to a good potluck 
with friends who i love a lot said ms muirhead of folly beach 
near charleston i feel really bad for the people who are here 
who dont have the friends i have 
because life has not returned to normal for thousands in south 
carolina who survived hugo the american red cross and naacp have 
joined with churches to prepare thanksgiving dinner at 13 sites for 
about 5000 people 
volunteers will serve 350 turkeys 330 pounds of stuffing 15 
cases of cranberry sauce 24 cases of canned sweet potatoes 25 
cases of peas and 300 pumpkin pies said red cross spokeswoman 
barbara lohman in charleston 
the naacp donated the turkey the red cross bought the 
trimmings and church workers and community volunteers will do the 
cooking 
while this isnt the first time the red cross has sponsored a 
holiday dinner it seemed particularly appropriate this year 
ms lohman said 
hugo swept ashore in south carolina on sept 21 killing 29 and 
causing an estimated 4 billion in damage in the hardesthit 
areas the rebuilding process is slow making the holiday season 
even rougher 
isle of palms mayor carmen bunch contended federal help has been 
slow and with the holidays coming on it will be lonely for a lot 
of people 
the island near charleston where nearly every house was 
destroyed or damaged by hugos 135 mph winds will host a 
thanksgiving dinner for about three dozen residents police 
officers and firefighters 
i think people are still very unhappy a lot of them are in 
a state of shock theres despair but i think they will overcome 
it the mayor said 
in charleston several churches planned to deliver turkeys and 
hams to hurricane victims as well as hold dinners 
we got a lot to be thankful for and this is the time to give 
thanks for that said city councilman robert ford who represents 
many of the citys poorer areas everything we lost in charleston 
was mostly material anyway 
people should be grateful for the fact that they have their 
lives and health and wellbeing 
even volunteers will get the chance to sit down for a holiday 
feast 
the mennonites who have been in south carolina repairing 
stormdamaged homes will serve dinner to eight red cross 
volunteers who were going to help them with building repairs on 
thursday afterward all will eat dinner together in moncks corner 
north of charleston 
somebody is giving care to the caregivers as well ms 
lohman said 
but the storm still has cast an unforgettable shadow across the 
lives of thousands even those who did not lose their homes and 
belongings 
im glad the holidays are here it takes my mind off the 
broken house and insurance people kathy troughton of mount 
pleasant said 
people are really more thankful or theyre trying to put it 
all behind them and really celebrate she said after what 
weve been through its time to celebrate instead of taking it 
for granted like we normally do 
robert green lost his home on johns island south of charleston 
im thankful because my family made it through green said 
we lost things but our lives were spared and well get into 
another place its not the same but its not too bad either

a group of us army green 
berets escaped from a luxury hotel in san salvador this morning 
after leftist guerrillas abandoned their 28hour siege of the 
building and fled 
the soldiers sprinted from a fivestory hotel annex when 
salvadoran security forces outside assured them the rebels were no 
longer in the area 
the green berets ran crouched carrying m16s with grenades on 
their belts to waiting police pickup trucks that sped off with them 
reports in el salvador varied on the number of soldiers had been 
trapped overnight in the building but a us official in 
washington said there were 12 
president bush said today that a unit of us armys elite delta 
force commandos was sent to el salvador and liberated the hotel 
from rebels without a shot but it appeared the rebels had left the 
hotel before the us special operations force arrived 
the 12 soldiers inside the hotel normally stationed with the 
7th special forces group in fort bragg nc had been in the 
country at the end of a twoweek training mission said a bush 
administration official they were scheduled to return to the 
united states tuesday when the hotel was beseiged by the rebels 
the official said on condition of anonymity 
most of the from 15 to 20 leftist guerrillas in the hotel 
apparently slipped away during the night the green berets said 
we watched them and could have shot them if we wanted to but 
thats not our job said one of the green berets 
the raid on the hotel by the guerrillas tuesday was their latest 
action in an offensive against government troops that began nov 
11 at least 1000 people have been killed in the offensive the 
biggest in the rebels decadeold war against a succession of 
usbacked governments 
the green berets had been holed up near a stairwell on the 
fourth floor of the fivestory vip tower while government 
troops conducted a housetohouse search in the wealthy san 
salvador neighborhood of escalon 
three bodies were lying in one street dozens of telephone poles 
were toppled and thousands of bullet holes were in the hotel rifle 
shots rang out in the area until just 30 minutes before the green 
berets left the hotel 
reporters who went through the third and fifth floors of the 
hotel where the rebels were on tuesday found none this morning the 
hotel is known as the el salvador sheraton although it is no 
longer part of the usbased hotel chain 
farabundo marti national liberation front guerrillas had seized 
the hotel annex tuesday trapping the americans civilian guests 
and the secretarygeneral of the organization of american states 
who was on a peace mission 
salvadoran soldiers surrounded the building and oas chief joao 
baena soares and the civilians were evacuated later tuesday 
col carlos avilas a salvadoran military spokesman claimed 
baena soares who returned to washington late tuesday was the 
target and said two of the diplomats salvadoran bodyguards had 
been killed 
but it was not clear if the rebels had intended to seize the 
annex 
the group of fighters was not large enough to seize the 
sprawling hotel complex and the rebels denied trying to kidnap the 
oas chief one of the trapped us soldiers said the guerrillas 
appeared surprised and confused when they entered the annex 
the attack on the western neighborhood turned the area into a 
battle zone and stunned a warweary city that had just begun to 
return to a semblance of normality 
the attack provoked a strong reaction from president bush who 
hinted that us military force might be used to assist the trapped 
americans the united states also has said it would expedite 
military aid to the salvadorans and a large us military cargo 
jet was seen landing at the international airport at 5 pm tuesday 
the men were not part of the group of 55 advisers stationed in 
el salvador a number set by congressional limitation the 
congressional stricture allows however for the transitional type 
of training teams that the men were part of the us official in 
washington said 
the united states also has provided 35 billion in aid to el 
salvador during the 10yearold guerrilla insurgency which has 
claimed the lives of more than 71000 people mostly civilians

the son of president nicolae ceausescu 
on wednesday lauded the ironwilled leader who has defied the 
reforms sweeping the east bloc and he urged a communist party 
congress to reelect his father the brilliant genius of the 
nation 
nicu ceausescu himself a senior communist official led an 
orchestrated joyful demonstration from the more than 3000 
delegates at the 14th party congress as he extolled the virtues of 
his father 
the elder ceausescu 71 stared stolidly from a stage holding 
top party functionaries 
ceausescu cpr the crowd thundered using the abbreviation 
for the romanian communist party and clapping in unison until 
silenced by a wave of the hand from the conducator or leader 
the conferences staged shows of affection unmatched anywhere 
in the east bloc since the stalinist era have been the most 
visible sign of the hold ceausescu has on the meeting his keynote 
speech monday rejecting reforms was met by the same tumultuous but 
clearly staged shows of affection and respect 
the brilliant genius of the nation should be reelected as 
general secretary declared the younger ceausescu a nonvoting 
member of the 39member politburo 
he extolled his fathers opening speech as a brilliant 
analysis of the shining path carved by our nation since 1965 
when ceausescu took power 
picking up a theme sounded by his father the younger ceausescu 
criticized reformminded warsaw pact allies moving toward 
multiparty democracy declaring that our policies have never been 
dictated by opportunistic considerations 
voting on party leadership is slated for friday with ceausescu 
the sole candidate for the post of secretary general he is 
expected to win 
views first expressed by the president monday also were 
reflected in a speech tuesday by his wife elena a full member of 
the politburo and the secondmost powerful figure in the tightly 
ruled country 
mrs ceausescu said the ninth party congress that installed her 
husband put an end to the practice of the mechanical copying of 
the socialist model and of accepting everything foreign the 
party daily scinteia reported 
the theme of independence has been sounded stridently in recent 
months apparently to justify romanias decision to remain true to 
its rigid controls in all sectors despite democratization elsewhere 
in the soviet bloc 
in a possible allusion to moldavia the neighboring soviet 
republic where ethnic romanians have been agitating for more 
national identity mrs ceausescu urged romanians to return to the 
orthography of the latin alphabet 
residents of moldavia known as bessarabia until the soviets 
took it over were granted the right by moscow this summer to use 
the latin alphabet instead of the cyrillic alphabet 
ceausescu indirectly appeared to urge the return of bessarabia 
on monday calling for the abrogration of the hitlerstalin pact of 
1938 that carved up parts of europe ceding moldavia to the soviets 
romanian officials and western diplomats speaking on condition 
of anonymity suggested the statement was primarily a political 
assertion of independence instead of a true call for a return to 
prewar borders 
these comments were sure to worsen bilateral relations already 
strained by romanias rejection of reforms at a time of fundamental 
change in the soviet union and in other allied countries 
the strain was reflected in a scinteia account of the meeting 
between ceausescu and soviet politburo member vitaly vorotnikov 
the head of the soviet delegation to the congress 
the presence of the soviet delegation emphasized the good 
relations between the two parties said the report indirectly 
suggesting that soviet attendance had not been taken for granted 
several nations communist parties mostly from the west but 
also from reformminded hungary did not send delegations to show 
their disagreement with romania 
china which quashed a prodemocracy movement in june was 
graciously welcomed ceausescu extended a warm friendly salute 
to politburo member qiao shi the delegation leader and both sides 
expressed satisfaction over ascending contact between the two 
parties scinteia said 
the domestic situation is aggravated by recurring shortages of 
food and energy that leave shelves sparsely stacked houses chilly 
and cars idle 
western diplomats say there is too much fear of ceausescu for 
any opposition to form 
mrs ceausescu served notice of the intent to continue 
suppression of all opposition saying we are prepared to firmly 
reject all actions of imperialist and reactionary circles to 
destabliize and undermine socialism

president bush warming up for a 
primetime address on the political upheaval in eastern europe 
today gave a thanksgivingeve salute to memphis citizens involved 
in public service and volunteer efforts 
we are nearing the dawn of a new decade he said let it 
be a decade with no dark corners no forgotten people no forgotten 
places 
the president delivered his speech outdoors in a cold driving 
rain before an audience of hundreds of people standing in several 
inches of mud 
he stood before the crowd without an umbrella and the rain 
plastered his hair across his forehead i hope you havent gotten 
pneumonia he said in closing 
encouraging americans to reach out to help others bush said 
everyone has a gift to give everyone of us has a special talent 
that can help solve americas problems and every institution in 
america can make the kind of commitment youve made here 
after a twohour stop in memphis bush was to fly back to 
washington for a helicopter hop to camp david the presidential 
retreat in marylands catoctin mountains where he will spend the 
holiday 
the president scheduled a 9 pm est televised speech from camp 
david about the dramatic opening of the berlin wall democratic 
reforms in eastern europe and his summit next week with soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said the events in 
eastern europe tend to lend themselves to presidential 
analysis and reassurance to the nation of the course that the 
united states is taking 
secondly its far enough past the diminishing of the berlin 
wall so that we can reflect on that with some ability to put events 
in perspective he said 
bush has a good prop for the speech if he wants it on tuesday 
west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher gave him a slab 
of concrete from the berlin wall 
todays trip was linked to a series of articles published by the 
memphis commercial appeal about people whose volunteer efforts help 
improve the lives of others 
the newspaper calls the series a thousand points of light 
borrowing the presidents own phrase about volunteer and public 
service efforts 
in his speech bush singled out some of the individuals who have 
been featured by the newspapers from a teenager involved in 
helping rebuild houses to an 82yearold woman who teaches reading 
to illiterate prisoners 
they are great american success stories and theyre powerful 
reminders that everyone can do something for someone else the 
president said 
bush also honored the newspaper saluting it as the first in a 
series of individuals and organizations recognized by the white 
house as daily points of light 
challenging others to follow the newspapers example bush 
called on every publisher every broadcaster ever member of the 
american news media to follow the lead of the commercial appeal 
many have begun to do so 
all three of the major networks have started regular features 
on volunteers in america and local papers and stations have 
become involved many more can he said 
bush also stopped at st jude childrens research hospital one 
of the nations top research facilities for catastrophic diseases 
in children he was greeted by the facilitys founder entertainer 
danny thomas and then met with several young cancer patients 
including a child from the soviet city of leningrad 
among the hospitals specialties is research into leukemia the 
disease that claimed the life of one of bushs own children robin 
who died in 1953 two months shy of her fourth birthday 
when bush arrived in memphis he stopped at memphis baptist 
medical center to see roy lee chucky mullins football player 
for the university of mississippi who suffered an injury in an oct 
28 game that left him paralyzed from the neck down 
the plight of mullins 20 a defensive back from russellville 
ala has sparked attention across the country and the white house 
said 405000 has been collected to set up a trust for him 
bush and his wife barbara in a letter to mullins lauded his 
strength to meet this adversity mullins was born in poverty 
and won a scholarship to the school

worker 
we have never missed a demo added another he said they 
were there friday when police brutally cracked down on a peaceful 
rally but we ran away in time he said 
the giant plant at vysocany made history in 1968 shortly after 
soviet tanks moved into the center of prague in the last attempt 
to save the prague spring reforms a hastily convened communist 
party congress at the plant called for the immediate withdrawal of 
the sovietled invasion force but the resolution was later 
declared illegal by the hardline government 
the driver of a passing car honked his horn in sympathy as he 
passed the young workers and a small group of middleaged 
machinetool operators on the other side of the street held up a 
banner proclaiming ckd is with you 
ninety percent of the workers are passive supporters of the 
prodemocracy movement and 40 percent are active backers said 
radek 
members of the group said there were continuing rumors the 
communist partys paramilitary militia was preparing a crackdown 
they are on alert since 10 pm last night at ckd one 
worker said they are on guard at every gate youd better not go 
in there 
at another ckd semiconductor plant in suburban polovodice 
employees who insisted on anonymity confirmed reports by dissidents 
that a meeting there had voted 14072 monday to adopt a resolution 
endorsing the demands of the civic forum opposition groups 
under the leadership of our party we fulfill the decisions of 
the 17th congress proclaimed a sign hung high on the walls of 
the complex it had apparently been there for years 
but a makeshift poster pasted to the entrance gate said we 
support the general strike called for two hours on nov 27 
mimeographed typewritten pages with statements from the opposition 
groups were also stuck to the gate with adhesive tape 
militia people were here during the night and removed them 
said a bystander but now they are on again 
a woman in a glass booth controlling visitors to the plant 
replied angrily when asked about the notices 
they are putting them on they are taking them off what do i 
care she said 
the demonstration meanwhile had begun at wenceslas square and 
czechoslovak tv for the first time showed live excerpts the 
program interviewed a worker who said footage shown on austrian tv 
of fridays police crackdown cast doubt on a party newspaper report 
that it was the students who attacked police 
what is the government afraid of the worker asked is it 
because they have been lying to us for the past 20 years

in the past six months margaret thatcher has 
suffered an election upset lost her treasury chief in a policy 
dispute tumbled in the opinion polls and stirred dissension in the 
ranks of her conservative party 
now a colleague says he will probably challenge her for her job 
and a prime minister who until recently looked unassailable is 
suddenly looking embattled 
mrs thatcher has never before been opposed in the annual 
election of the party leader and her challenger lawmaker sir 
anthony meyer concedes he is a complete outsider with no chance of 
winning 
instead he told bbc radio wednesday he hopes to provoke enough 
abstentions to send mrs thatcher a message that support for the 
prime minister is slipping 
meyer said he would mount his challenge unless somebody much 
better qualified came forward an apparent invitation to more 
likely successors such as former defense secretary michael 
heseltine to join the race 
the election by the 374 conservative members of parliament must 
be held before dec 19 and a complex procedure requires mrs 
thatcher to get a majority of 57 percent to win outright 
if she fails a second round is held in which other candidates 
may enter 
nobody imagines mrs thatcher losing on the first round but a 
large number of abstentions and novotes would prove a crippling 
blow the independent newspaper said last week it had polled every 
tory lawmaker and found that 217 would back her 86 would oppose 
her and 71 were undecided or wouldnt say the paper said that if 
more than 100 voted against her she would be in serious trouble 
mrs thatchers problems seemed to begin in june when a 
thrashing in elections to the european parliament suggested her 
combative attitude toward integration into the european economic 
community was out of step with the voters 
inflation meanwhile had risen above 8 percent interest rates 
headed to an eightyear high of 15 percent the trade deficit was 
running at record levels and the tories were as much as 11 points 
behind the opposition labor party in the polls 
also her widely unpopular reform of property taxes was 
confronting homeowners with higher bills and there were 
indications that mrs thatcher herself was beginning to listen to 
those who counseled a kinder more caring approach 
but last month came a stunning setback when chancellor of the 
exchequer nigel lawson resigned in a quarrel with mrs thatcher 
over how to rescue the economy 
his successor john major has warned the public to expect a 
bleak 1990 
reelected for her third consecutive term in june 1987 mrs 
thatcher doesnt have to call an election until mid1992 and her 
supporters say her problems are not unusual for a government in 
midterm 
but meyer said there was a much more profound discontent 
with the tories and that mrs thatcher was out of sympathy with 
what peoples deeper instincts are 
the trouble is i dont think she is capable of changing 
either her attitudes or her policies he said on london 
broadcasting co radio 
every time theres a great dustup with her ministers and its 
said that from now on shes going to listen she doesnt actually 
listen shes so convinced that shes right that she doesnt 
listen 
meyer is one of those tories who believe the issue is europe and 
britains place in it they believe the public does not share mrs 
thatchers fear of a european superstate unraveling her 
antisocialist program they believe the public unlike mrs 
thatcher sees nothing wrong with britain adopting the welfare and 
working standards of the continent 
mrs thatcher has always thrived on confrontation and she 
looked her usual fighting self in parliament on tuesday during the 
first debate to be televised live from the house of commons 
her 1990 legislative program was full of the hallmarks of 
thatcherite free enterprise new curbs on union power and more 
deregulation of national industries and services 
but in the influential financial times an editorial tuesday 
already was looking forward to the postthatcher era arguing that 
she has accomplished all she can in reviving britains fortunes and 
has no more peaks to climb 
a political race deprived of her commanding presence can now 
be envisaged it said the question for the uk is whether the 
country builds on the achievements of thatcherism while remedying 
its defects or sees them demolished instead

a judge ordered the man accused of 
killing black panther party cofounder huey p newton to stand 
trial for murder after refusing to hear testimony supporting a 
claim of selfdefense 
muncipal court judge george nelson ruled tuesday at a 
preliminary hearing for tyrone d robinson who did not testify 
prosecutor teresa drabec argued successfully that the testimony 
of defense witnesses was inadmissible hearsay because none of them 
actually saw the confrontation between newton and robinson that the 
defense says led to the aug 22 curbside killing 
nelson did allow testimony by prosecution witness brian walton 
who identified robinson as having shot an unarmed newton three 
times 
robinsons lawyer al wagner said he planned to produce at 
least two witnesses who would testify they saw newton armed and 
high on cocaine and that he had threatened to blow someone 
away wagner said he planned to appeal the judges ruling 
robinson says he shot in selfdefense because newton was armed 
and demanded cocaine 
the prosecution portrayed robinson as having killed newton to 
advance his standing with the black guerrilla family a gang whose 
narcotics dealers newton robbed

a man who claims his family was given most 
of the northern united states by the king of england during 
colonial times has sued to get it back 
robert brewster of longmont colo said in his us district 
court lawsuit filed in cheyenne that he wants the land to set up 
his own country for blue and greeneyed people 
brewster claimed his family was given the land between the 40th 
and 48th north latitudes from ocean to ocean the 48th parallel is 
approximately at the canadian border and the 40th parallel 
stretches approximately from eureka calif across the united 
states to new york city 
it is now necessary for the brewsters to reclaim their land 
before the federal government loses its ability to return the 
land the lawsuit said the usa has lost its vision and is 
collapsing every day with newspapers reporting each morning of 
massive land purchases by japan or opec 
the lawsuit filed monday said brewster is a descendant of 
william brewster a founder of the plymouth colony in 1620 in what 
is now massachusetts 
the lawsuit said william brewster and his companions were given 
the land by the king of england when they left that country to move 
to the new world 
brewster said he wants the land back so he can form an area 
where only greeneyed and blueeyed persons will be permitted 
people with green and blue eyes are superior to those with brown 
eyes brewster said but will soon be extinct unless they are 
protected 
brewster also asked the court for permission to establish a 
standing army to protect the borders of his country 
the united states as represented by the us attorneys office 
in cheyenne has 30 days to respond to brewsters lawsuit 
according to a woman in the us district court clerks office she 
said wednesday that the case has been assigned to judge alan b 
johnson but no hearing date has been set

lebanons political history has been 
plauged by violence and turmoil 
since independence from france in 1943 lebanons nine 
presidents have grappled with sectarian fighting coup attempts and 
invasion by foreign forces 
the latest victim was rene mouawad who was elected president by 
an emergency session of parliament nov 5 in syriancontrolled 
north lebanon and served only 17 days before his assassination 
wednesday 
the first president was bishara khoury who was released from 
his cell in a french prison when parliament elected him sept 21 
1943 the frencheducated trial lawyer headed the christianmoslem 
national resistance against the french who ruled lebanon under a 
league of nations mandate from 1920 to 1943 
in 1950 forces loyal to khoury and his sunni moslem prime 
minister riyad solh suppressed a twoweek revolt by the syrian 
social nationalist party aimed at making lebanon part of a 
greater syria syrian nationalist leader antoine saadeh was 
executed 
a year later solh was assassinated on a visit to jordan 
in 1952 khoury resigned after protest demonstrations broke out 
when he sought to amend the constitution to extend his term 
parliament elected camille chamoun a former un ambassador and 
a maronite catholic chieftain who survived four assassination 
attempts to complete his sixyear term 
chamoun asked for american help in 1958 when he faced a moslem 
revolt inspired by egyptian leader gamal abdel nassers radical 
panarabism president dwight d eisenhower sent 10000 us 
marines to beirut in july 1958 and the rebellion fizzled 
chamouns successor army gen fuad chehab crushed a coup 
attempt on new years eve by prosyrian army officers in 1959

palestinian guerrillas built up their power base in lebanon in 
1969 the lebanese army clashed with arafats fighters in street 
battles in south beirut 
helous successor prosyrian maronite suleiman franjieh 
oversaw the clashes between christians and palestinians that 
triggered the civil war in april 1975 more than 150000 people 
have died since then 
parliament came under shellfire when elias sarkis a former 
central bank governor was elected in 1976 with strong syrian 
backing during his term the israelis invaded in 1978 and 1982 
bashir gemayel the israelibacked commander of the christians 
main militia was elected to replace him gemayel 34 was 
assassinated in an east beirut bombing sept 14 1982 a week 
before he was to be sworn in 
parliament unanimously elected his elder brother amin his 
reign saw the advent of iraniansponsored shiite terrorism 
including the kidnapping of westerners and the suicide bombings of

manufacturing orders for big ticket 
durable goods fell in october for the fourth time in six months 
the government said wednesday in a report economists termed further 
evidence that us industry is facing a sharp downturn in activity 
the commerce department said orders for durable goods items 
expected to last three or more years dipped 06 percent to a 
seasonally adjusted 12459 billion last month after a 11 percent 
drop in september 
analysts who had been looking for an october decline were 
suprised by the sharp downward revision in september a month when 
the government had earlier reported that orders posted a small 02 
percent increase 
the backtoback monthly declines coming on the heels of even 
bigger decreases in july and may were viewed as ominous for the 
health of the manufacturing sector 
the us manufacturing sector is in a recession very few 
industries are hiring and most are laying off employees said 
john hagens chief economist for the wefa group an economic 
forecasting company in bala cynwyd pa 
the open question economists said was whether the sluggishness 
in manufacturing would spill over into the rest of the economy and 
spell an end to the economic recovery which has already lasted a 
peacetime record of seven years 
cynthia latta an economist with drimcgraw hill predicted that 
economic growth would dip below an annual rate of 1 percent in the 
final three months of this year and she said economic activity 
would remain lackluster through the first half of 1990 
we are not forecasting a recession but we are forecasting 
miserable growth it is so close to the edge that the economy could 
slip into negative growth she said 
the last time the economy faced such an extended period of 
weakness was in mid1986 when us manufacturers were battling 
massive imports and weak foreign sales however manufacturing 
rebounded in 1987 and 1988 as a declining dollar helped spur a boom 
in export sales 
analysts said they were not looking for that to recur this time 
in part because overseas growth in many countries is slowing 
there is very little on the horizon to revive manufacturing 
over the next six to nine months said allen sinai chief 
economist of the boston co 
he said a slump in manufacturing which accounts for 18 percent 
of us jobs would not be enough by itself to trigger a recession 
but he said he was forecasting a mild slump next year because of a 
belief that services industries will see weak sales as well 
much of the industrial slowdown so far has been in the auto 
industry where slumping sales have already prompted layoffs and 
production cutbacks 
for october transportation orders rose by 3 percent to 3354 
billion recouping some of a giant 108 percent drop in september 
but the strength was concentrated in increased demand for military 
ships and civilian aircraft orders to automakers were down again 
military orders fell by 124 percent to 933 billion however 
that followed a huge 339 percent military increase in september 
excluding the volatile defense category orders would have risen 
05 percent in october after posting a 35 percent decline in 
september 
orders in the key category of nondefense capital goods rose 32 
percent in october to 365 billion but that was concentrated in 
demand for civilian aircraft and did nothing to dispell concerns 
that this sector will weaken as businesses facing a profits 
squeeze cut back on expansion plans 
orders for the machinery category that includes computers 
dropped 46 percent to 2153 billion while the noncomputer 
machinery category fell 38 percent to 2016 billion 
shipments of durable goods fell 17 percent to 1224 billion 
after a 3 percent decline in september

president bush said today that an american 
special operations force liberated a hotel in el salvador where 
leftist rebels had trapped a dozen us army green berets but an 
administration official said later that the force never went into 
action 
it appeared the 12 soldiers had fled the hotel after the rebels 
withdrew and the white house issued a statement saying updated 
information showed us forces did not actually enter the hotel 
entry proved to be unnecessary 
bush speaking to reporters aboard air force one said the us 
team was joined by special operations forces from the salvadoran 
government he said he consulted with salvadoran president alfredo 
cristiani about the action but that the decision to go forward was 
his alone 
they were our special operations that i sent down there 
bush said when you see americans held hostage like this theres 
a message in all this this president backed by our defense 
secretary will stand to protect the lives of americans wherever we 
can 
but in washington an administration official knowledgeable 
about the earlymorning operation said the us special operations 
forces never went into action 
they were sent they were in position but as the 
operation evolved they never went into action said the 
official who insisted on anonymity the bad guys melted away and 
the 12 came out 
the official said the elite commando units were sent to salvador 
on a pure contingency basis they could have been used but there 
wasnt a need for them 
another adminstration official who also demanded anonymity 
said the 12 green berets normally stationed with the 7th special 
forces group at fort bragg nc had been on a twoweek training 
mission in el salvador they were scheduled to return to the united 
states on tuesday when the hotel was beseiged by the rebels the 
official said 
that hotel was liberated with finality from the clutches of 
this outrageous guerrilla attack bush told reporters while en 
route to memphis for a speech 
he said the special force a unit of the armys elite delta 
force commandos swept the sheraton hotel for mines and that there 
was no fighting thank god they didnt have to fire a shot he 
said 
but presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater hours later issued a 
statement that said updated information showed us forces did 
not actually enter the hotel their entry proved to be 
unnecessary 
reports from el salvador indicated the rebels apparently left a 
fivestory hotel annex sometime before dawn bush said the us 
operation occurred early this morning 
we must not stand by and fail to support a country that has 
oved down democracys path the president said its our 
responsibility 
congress has limited the number of us military advisers in el 
salvador to 55 but allowed for transitional training teams the 
trapped green berets fell into this area 
the men were in el salvador on a mission to evaluate us 
training programs for the salvadoran government troops and to 
engage in their own unilateral training the us official said 
earlier fitzwater hinted at possible us military 
intervention he said the predawn attack tuesday against the hotel 
showed the true colors of the guerrillas fighting to overthrow 
the salvadoran government 
they are attacking defenseless citizens in a civilian hotel 
and using the surrounding neighborhood of defenseless salvadoran 
citizens as a shield against the government forces said 
fitzwater 
he said top pentagon cia state department and national 
security council officials met twice in the white house on tuesday 
to monitor events the panel known as the deputies committee was 
formed to improve coordination in the aftermath of the abortive 
coup in panama 
the situation was being watched on through the night by 
staff at both the state department and national security council 
said fitzwater 
the united states stands committed to the people and the 
government of el salvador he added 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said the 
farabundo marti national liberation front rebels had revealed 
themselves as terrorists pure and simple 
an associated press reporter in el salvador saw armed military 
men believed to include us advisers brandishing m16 rifles and 
barricaded on the fourth floor of the hotel 
guerrillas were believed to have been be on the third and fifth 
floors 
on capitol hill tuesday the senate voted for a resolution 
condemning continuing violence on all sides in el salvador and 
vowing to reconsider us aid if the killers of six jesuit priests 
are not brought to justice 
the resolution also asked that the bush administration report to 
congress by feb 20 on the status of the investigation into the 
deaths last week 
the new guerrilla attack came one day after bush reaffirmed 
strong us support for cristianis rightist government the united 
states has provided about 35 billion to oppose the insurgency 
over the last decade 
the state department warned us citizens not to travel to el 
salvador and urged americans already there to register with the 
us embassy 
ms tutwiler said some 20 hotel guests including several 
americans who had been in the unoccupied part of the hotel were 
led out by salvadoran armed forces and taken to army high command 
headquarters tuesday afternoon 
although the hotel that was attacked tuesday is called the 
sheraton the usbased hotel chain said it sold its interest

memphis ap president bush on wednesday urged the news media 
and other organizations to join his crusade for volunteerism by 
publicizing good works until they become part of everyday

honoring as heroes those who are engaged in the war against drug 
abuse illiteracy aids homelessness hunger and other problems 
bush said in a speech at the commercial appeal newspaper 
we are nearing the dawn of a new decade let it be a decade 
with no dark corners no forgotten people no forgotten places 
bush made the comments at a soggy outdoor ceremony to honor the 
commercial appeals ongoing campaign focusing on people involved in 
community service 
the daily points of light feature in the newspaper stems 
from bushs inauguration call for 1000 points of light it is 
one of his favorite themes and he uses the phrase to refer to 
individuals businesses and groups whose volunteerism makes society 
better for everyone 
bush also paid a visit to st judes childrens research 
hospital where he was greeted by the facilitys founder 
entertainer danny thomas 
bush looked in on a handful of children cancer victims and said 
he regretted he had never before visited the renowned center which 
specializes in fatal childhood diseases 
in his remarks at the commercial appeal bush said other media 
organizations should follow the newspapers example in encouraging 
community service 
id like to challenge every publisher every broadcaster 
every member of the american news media to follow the lead of the 
commercial appeal he said 
imagine an america where service to others is a fact of life 
part of everyones everyday thinking 
bush told a crowd that gathered in a pouring rain outside the 
newspaper that every one of us has a special talent that can help 
solve americas problems so if youve got a hammer find a 
nail if you can read find someone who cant if youre not in 
trouble seek out someone who is because everywhere there is a 
need in america there is a way to fill it 
bush also announced the white house would begin a points of 
light program to each day single out a person or institution that 
exemplifies the concept of community service 
each day the white house will recognize one individual or 
institution who has successfully addressed our most dire social 
problems by engaging in community service the white house said

deficit reduction and health care for the 
elderly the two big issues congress handled in its waning hours 
early wednesday will be back next year house and senate leaders 
say 
and president bush predicts some fights down the line when 
congress returns in january 
shortly before adjourning for the year in a nearly allnight 
session the house and senate approved legislation repealing the 
new medicare catastrophic health insurance plan 
designed to protect the elderly from financial ruin because of 
extended illness the catastrophic law passed the last congress 
with great fanfare and bipartisan support but organizations 
representing the elderly organized against the plan and especially 
its surtax of up to 800 which would have hit the wealthier 
retirees next year 
the senate tried to save the part of the plan that extended 
medicare to cover long hospital stays but the house insisted on 
total repeal and in the legislative equivalent of an 
acrossthecapitol arm wrestle the house won early wednesday 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine told reporters 
later he expected to work next year on catastrophic illness and 
nursing home care coverage 
we repealed the law but we could not repeal the problem he 
said 
on the other big finalnight item of business mitchell and 
house speaker thomas s foley defended the 147 billion deficit 
reduction bill passed as lawmakers were about to leave town but 
they conceded more was needed 
none of us is satisfied foley said 
the bill includes several minor tax increases leaves in place 
the grammrudman laws acrosstheboard spending cuts into 
february trims medicare costs and has a new system for paying 
doctors under the program 
even with the reductions some of which are mere bookkeeping 
changes the deficit in the current fiscal year will be well above 
grammrudmans target of 100 billion for fiscal 1990 according to 
congressional estimates 
bush who submits his first full budget for fiscal 1991 to 
congress in january told reporters he was pleased the deficit bill 
was finally passed he praised the spirit of cooperation behind 
the effort 
the democratic leaders blame bush for the fact that the plan 
isnt more substantial especially the presidents insistence for 
much of the year that it had to include a cut in capital gains tax 
rates bush agreed a few weeks ago to wait until next year to try 
again for that cut which democrats contend is a giveaway to the 
richest in america 
asked wednesday about his sometimes contentious relations with 
congress bush said he wanted to be a healer on the day before 
thanksgiving 
this is not the time to pick a fight he said but 
acknowledged there will be some fights down the road 
consumer advocate ralph nader promised wednesday he would launch 
a fight for congress to repeal next year the pay raise it voted to 
give itself

the state department citing the democratic 
evolution in hungary and poland today stopped processing new 
applications for refugees allowed to emigrate to the united states 
from those east bloc countries 
unless we change our present policy and practices we will be 
unable this year to process and admit other deserving applicants 
from such countries as bulgaria and romania spokeswoman margaret 
tutwiler said 
she said the majority of the 6500 slots for refugees from 
eastern europe came from poland and hungary and that there was a 
backlog of 20000 people from those countries awaiting resettlement 
in the united states while living in western europe 
under the new policy no new applications will be taken from 
hungarians and poles unless they are in immediate danger for 
political reasons ms tutwiler said 
the hungarians and poles with ties in the united states who 
previously registered for immigration interviews before today will 
be heard she said 
in the interests of insuring that our refugee resources are 
allocated to the most needy and in recognition of the democratic 
evolution in hungary and poland the administration has decided to 
change the refugee programs for those two countries the 
spokeswoman said 
exceptions to this policy will be granted only on a limited 
casebycase basis with the approval of washington ms tutwiler 
said regular us immigration programs will of course continue 
to be available to all eastern europeans

bombings stabbings and shootings left 
35 people dead wednesday the first day of voting to determine if 
prime minister rajiv gandhis congress party or a newly energized 
opposition governs india for the next five years 
each side accused the other of massive fraud 
fifteen of indias 25 states and five of its seven federally 
ruled constituencies voted wednesday balloting continues friday 
and sunday but no results are to be announced before sunday night 
voters will choose 524 members of the lok sabha or house of the 
people the lawmaking lower chamber of parliament the lok sabha 
will choose the next prime minister 
gandhi the 45yearold grandson of jawaharlal nehru 
independent indias first prime minister and son of slain prime 
minister indira gandhi sought to portray the election as a choice 
between stability and chaos only his familys party he said 
could guarantee economic improvement and combat ethnic and 
religious tensions 
he was challenged by a fiveparty opposition coalition known as 
the national front a loose alliance of parties spanning the 
ideological spectrum and led by former finance and defense minister 
vishwanath pratap singh it built its platform on promises of 
honest leadership accusing gandhis government of highlevel 
corruption and ineptness 
opinion polls suggested the congress party could lose power for 
the second time since 1977 but gandhi professed confidence we 
are going to win he said after casting his ballot 
preliminary reports after polls closed estimated voter turnout 
at 55 percent about normal 
more than 100000 paramilitary troops were deployed to bolster 
security but reports of violence mounted indian elections 
traditionally are violent and the killings brought to 79 the total 
deaths since parliamentary elections were announced oct 17 
in gandhis amethi constituency a remote rural area in northern 
uttar pradesh state where gandhi is seeking reelection to 
parliament the prime ministers opponent was roughed up by police 
when he complained of ballotstuffing the candidate raj mohan 
gandhi is the grandson of independence leader mohandas k gandhi 
a local opposition leader sanjay singh was shot in the arm 
about three miles from amethi town said aides they claimed the 
gunman was a congress party worker 
dinesh goswamy spokesman for the national front in new delhi 
alleged police helped congress party workers rig a large number of 
polling booths 
anand sharm the congress partys chief spokesman scoffed at 
the allegations and accused the opposition of rigging votes 
three bombs rocked the kashmir valley near the pakistan border 
where moslem militants who want to secede from predominantly hindu 
india warned voters to boycott the election no one was injured 
in the town of anantnag militants placed two coffins near a 
polling station with signs that read whoever votes will meet 
this fate 
kashmir election officials estimated voter turnout at less than 
5 percent 
violent clashes between congress party workers and opposition 
supporters were reported in northern haryana and southeastern 
andhra pradesh states 
in uttar pradesh state where the congress partys traditionally 
heavy suppport has been eroded opposition leaders charged the 
electoral roll did not contain the names of many 18yearolds 
eligible to vote for the first time 
the congress party has ruled india for all but 29 months since 
independence from britain in 1947 
even when the congress party was ousted in a 1977 election the 
opposition was not nearly as united as the national front is today 
the vote then was considered more a vote against thenprime 
minister indira gandhi and her emergency rule than a vote for the 
opposition mrs gandhi returned to power shortly afterward 
gandhi was swept into office on a massive sympathy vote in 
december 1984 two months after his mother was assassinated 
the initial aura of confidence and optimism inspired by the 
youthful gandhi a westerneducated former airline pilot has faded 
as allegations of corruption dogged his friends his party and his 
government 
the main accusation stems from newspaper reports that the 
swedish arms manufacturer ab bofors paid up to 50 million in 
kickbacks to win a 1986 contract to sell india 14 billion in 
artillery guns 
gandhi denied that any indian received kickbacks or commissions

a memo posted in the squad room of a sheriffs 
substation told deputies the county would issue them three 
undocumented aliens they each should carry in the trunks of their 
patrol cars 
this is very much a racist document said louis quijas a 
police captain in kansas city mo who is president of the latino 
police officers association 
written on county stationery the memo stayed tacked up for 
about a week at the poway substation before an angry deputy took it 
down and sent a copy to the national association poway is a city 
20 miles north of downtown san diego that contracts with the 
sheriffs department for public protection 
the deputy sgt joseph lopez said tuesday he was transferred 
to the overnight shift at another substation within two weeks of 
telling internal affairs investigators that he sent the copy to the 
association 
the transfer was too coincidental it was to get me out of 
there he said they think im too vocal but i always stand up 
for what i believe in 
capt jc lasuer commander of the poway station said the 
reassignment was prompted by unrelated personality conflicts 
he acknowledged that the memo which was accompanied by a 
photograph of what it described as the countys standardissue 
undocumented workers was in bad taste 
its a shame because we work so darn hard to try to get 
positive things going with the migrants up here he said this 
is something that should not have been done 
he said the internal investigation has ended but no decision 
has been made on any action

inspection visit to rural inyo county that he arranged a personal 
invitation from the owners of the eastern sierra news service to

prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki the 
east blocs first noncommunist government leader travels thursday 
to the soviet union in hopes of resolving sensitive issues and 
making headway on economic reforms 
more than 40 years of communist rule in poland ended aug 24 
when the parliament elected mazowiecki a former solidarity editor 
and close adviser to lech walesa to lead the new government 
the soviet government sent its friendly congratulations upon 
mazowieckis election mazowiecki has said poland would respect its 
warsaw pact obligations but that relations between the two 
countries must be based on reciprocity 
though bound by economic and military treaties to moscow the 
new government is emotionally distant from its powerful neighbor 
which installed communists in poland after world war ii 
mazowieckis first foreign trip took him to rome to meet with 
polishborn pope john paul ii and not to moscow as tradition 
required of his communist predecessors 
during the trip mazowiecki intends to raise the painful matter 
of blank spots in history such as the massacre of polish 
officers during world war ii in the katyn forest as well as seek 
an improvement in the situation of an estimated 2 million poles 
living in the soviet union 
poland also would like to renegotiate the terms of trade with 
the soviet union which accounts for onethird of polands foreign 
trade a highlevel delegation of economic officials is 
accompanying mazowiecki 
poland conducts onethird of its foreign trade with the soviet 
union and is seeking soviet support for its transition to a 
marketoriented economy and efforts to make its currency the 
zloty convertible 
the soviet union exercises considerable influence on the polish 
economy because it supplies almost all of polands oil natural 
gas and iron ore as well as many of the cars planes washing 
machines and televisions 
polish government spokesman malgorzata niezabitowska said the 
current situation in east germany and the issue of eventual german 
unification would be among the issues discussed 
both poland and the soviet union have suffered from german 
aggression in the past and appear to be wary of the potential 
emergence of a powerful german nation in the heart of europe 
mazowiecki is to spend two days in moscow meeting with soviet 
officials including president mikhail s gorbachev 
mazowiecki a roman catholic is to travel sunday to the city of 
zagorsk the site of a russian orthodox monastery 
later that day he is scheduled to travel west to the katyn 
forest where more than 4300 polish officers were murdered in 
world war ii 
katyn is one of the wars most painful memories for poles and a 
soviet memorial to the officers places responsibility for the 
murder on hitlers army 
most poles and western historians believe that the officers were 
massacred by the soviet secret police in the spring of 1940 after 
they were deported to the soviet union following the oubreak of 
world war ii 
a joint sovietpolish historical commission established by 
gorbachev and polish president wojciech jaruzelski in 1987 to clear 
up the blank spots has yet to deliver a verdict 
this year the polish side of the commission said there is no 
reasonable doubt the soviets were responsible 
mazowiecki is also planning to meet with representatives of the 
estimated 2 millionmember polish community in the soviet union 
millions of poles were deported to the soviet union during world 
war ii and many were not allowed to return after the war 
niezabitowska said poland wants poles living in the soviet union 
to have greater possibilities to cultivate their native culture and 
traditions 
mazowiecki also will visit leningrad

a national environmental group on wednesday 
asked federal regulators to set special rules for independent power 
producers to build or run nuclear power plants 
the move by public citizen an antinuclear group founded by the 
consumer activist ralph nader was in anticipation of a trend 
toward independent power producers companies other than electric 
utilities seeking to run nuclear stations 
public citizen filed a petition with the nuclear regulatory 
commission calling for the agency to require independent producers 
to meet special regulations governing the issuance or transfer of 
plant construction permits or operating licenses 
the nrc regulates all us commercial use of nuclear energy the 
110 nuclear plants now in operation are owned by electric 
utilities but some nonutility companies recently have expressed 
interest in entering the field 
joseph fouchard an nrc spokesman said the commission has never 
had a license application from an independent and has never 
considered tailoring licensing requirements for specific types of 
owners or operators he added that the commission would consider 
the public citizen petition and respond as soon as possible 
public citizen said its main concern was that the longterm 
financial stability of independent power producers may be less 
certain than that of utilities because independent producers are 
not governed by state regulatory bodies that assure the utilities a 
set return on their investment in power plants 
if a nuclear independent cant produce enough power or sell 
enough of the power it produces it may not be able to pay for the 
necessary maintenance and repair of its plant said daniel 
borson a nuclear analyst at public citizen that in turn could

an envelope bearing two rare 
misprinted stamps was withdrawn from auction wednesday after 
bidding failed to reach the minimum asking price of 19 million 
the auctioneers christies said 
christies auction house will negotiate a private sale with an 
international group that had expressed interest in purchasing the 
mauritius post office cover but failed to raise the necessary 
funds before the auction said spokeswoman katharina feller 
ms feller said bidding stopped at 16 million the auctioneers 
had predicted the stamps would bring up to 25 million which 
would be a record for any philatelic item 
she described the outcome as rather unexpected 
ms feller declined to reveal the identity of the seller an 
independent financial concern or the prospective buyers 
the envelope bearing two of the finest known examples of the 
red mauritius post office one penny stamp was originally 
purchased for 5 rupees at an indian bazaar in 1897 
it was addressed to a mr jerrom secretary to the bombay 
auxiliary bible society the esplanade bombay india 
only 15 copies of the indian ocean islands one penny stamp are 
known to exist most of which are held in museums or the british 
royal familys collection 
the post office stamps were the first to be issued by a 
british colony they were originally meant to read post paid 
but the reportedly poorsighted watchmaker who engraved the plate 
for the stamps used the words post office instead 
in 1968 the envelope was bought for 380000 by the brothers 
raymond and roger weill stamp dealers from new orleans 
the stamps were put up for auction by the financial concern 
which subsequently purchased the weill brothers collection 
ms feller said another lot from the weill collection the 
british guiana 2cent cotton reel brought 366000 at 
wednesdays auction 
the record price for a stamp stands at 1 million for a us 
postmasters provisional cover called the alexandria blue boy 
sold privately in 1981 the highest price at auction is for a west 
german baden 9 kreuzer stamp printed in the wrong color which 
brought 680000 in 1985

congress has told president bush to hold back 
115 million in contributions to the world bank unless he certifies 
its loans to china will promote individual freedom and human 
rights officials said wednesday 
the bank owned by 152 countries is the largest source of aid 
to the third world its president barber conable and its largest 
contributions come from the united states 
most of its funds come from its borrowing on world markets 
the bank halted new loans to china in june after the government 
cracked down on the prodemocracy student movement but it 
continued to disburse money on loans granted earlier 
conable has said he hopes to resume new lending soon but has 
not set a date 
bush on tuesday signed into law a bill that would make available 
965 million for the international development association a part 
of the bank that lends to the poorest countries but the law says 
that 115 million of that will not be available until jan 1 
it also provides that the money will not be available then 
unless the president certifies that any loans the bank makes to 
china help the movement toward democracy 
the 965 million brings the united states up to date on its 
contributions to the eighth replenishment of funds for the poorest 
countries known as idaviii that totaled 124 billion for 
the three years ending next june 
of 34 donors the united states is the only one that has not 
agreed to a contribution to the ninth replenishment if it 
continues to contribute 22 percent of the total bank officials 
calculated that congress would have to appropriate 318 billion 
which would be 300 million more than under idaviii for the next 
threeyear period 
conable said monday that the bush administration wants to ask 
congress for the money but is working out what its place in the 
federal budget should be 
a meeting of representatives from the donor countries is 
scheduled for next month

casino whiz steve wynn promised a wonderment 
the world will flock to see and delivered on that promise 
wednesday with his glitzy 630 million mirage hotel including a 
scented volcano 
the 3049room hotel opening five weeks ahead of schedule is 
the first new resort on the strip in 15 years and already has 
sparked a 25 billion building boom in this gaming and 
entertainment capital 
weve been waiting four years going on 20 to say welcome to 
the mirage wynn said weve often said fantasy becomes 
reality but fantasy is a dream its not real at least not until 
today 
thousands of people poured into the resort when the doors opened 
at noon the first two guests to check in were two white tigers 
belonging to illusionists siegfried and roy 
the 30story showplace cost more than 100 times the value of the 
cluster of casinos that dotted the strip when wynn first visited 
here as a 10yearold in 1952 
the hotels 6000 employees and a like number of guests were 
given a preview look at the mirage on monday and tuesday 
tuesday night saw a flurry of activity as workers stocked plush 
stores and put the finishing touches on an exotic habitat for the 
white tigers siegfried and roy have signed a 58 million contract 
with wynn and will open in the hotels new 1500seat showroom dec 
26 
that was the date wynn planned to open the mirage until he 
landed the sugar ray leonardroberto duran championship fight 
which will be staged dec 7 
outside tourists gawked and traffic stopped on the busy 
sixlane strip this week while workers conducted final tests on the 
54foot volcano that erupts with flames in front of the resort 
wynn was upset by the smell of the eruptions and persuaded 
utility executives to come up with a fuel mix that has the scent of 
pina colada 
the volcano and nearby waterfalls out front are designed to 
block the neon lights of other resorts across the flashy strip 
im burned out on neon said wynn whose downtown golden 
nugget hotel is also void of any neon i think its cheap to me 
neon is yesterday las vegas 
the hotels pool is one quarter of a mile around nearby is 
planned a 15 milliongallon saltwater dolphin habitat approved by 
the national marine fisheries service 
guests registering for rooms with rates running from 89 to 129 
are greeted by a 12 million aquarium containing 20000 gallons of 
water and fourfoot sharks 
nearby is a ninestory atrium with 70foot palm trees and 
theres a plan for the jackson attraction featuring 
memorabilia of wynns friend michael jackson 
the casino covers an area more than twice the size of a football 
field features range from nickel slots to an elegant room for high 
rollers where 1000 chips are the minimum available 
running along the perimeter of the casino are restaurants that 
will serve 2500 people and 30000 square feet of retail space 
catering to an upscale clientele 
wynn chairman and majority owner of golden nugget inc a 
public company that owns the golden nugget and the mirage is 
confident his new property will be profitable despite the high 
cost saying it can earn the necessary 1 million a day 
he said it would have 15 billion to build it in atlantic city 
nj where donald trumps new 1200room taj mahal is expected to 
cost 12 billion when completed next year 
wynn whos had offandon battles with billionaire developer 
trump said he wants to be known as a hotel operator not the 
star 
i want people to say that steve wynn built the best hotel in 
the world i dont want to say i own it i want to be the guy that 
designed it thats my edge

discovery was set to light up the 
sky tonight in a dazzling holiday liftoff that may be visible for 
hundreds of miles as the shuttle streaks toward orbit with five 
astronauts on a secret military mission 
the thanksgiving eve launch was scheduled sometime between 630 
pm and 1030 pm if a forecast of clear skies holds the 
700foot geyser of fire from the crafts solid fuel booster rockets 
could be visible over a 700mile track from key west to charleston 
sc 
but while the weather here looked favorable air force 
meteorologists said it had deteriorated at an overseas emergency 
landing runway a location called a transatlantic abort site or 
tal that is needed for launch 
without revealing the overseas site because the shuttles route 
was classified air force spokesman ron rand said the weather at 
the tal site does not look good and it doesnt look like its 
going to get better 
he said observers at the site believed to be ben guerir air 
base in morocco would continue to monitor the situation and hope 
for a break as the discovery countdown continued 
technicians during the day pumped 528000 gallons of liquid 
hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants into discoverys 154foot 
external fuel tank and nasa reported no problems with the 
countdown 
the countdown is on schedule everything is going fine nasa 
spokeswoman lisa malone reported today shuttle crews had made up 
12 hours preparation time lost last week in replacing a faulty 
rocket control unit 
forecasters said the weather should be 80 percent favorable for 
a launch raising confidence that the astronauts will have turkey 
in space on thanksgiving 
an accident involving a truck pushing a forklift into a bunker 
near the launch pad late tuesday will not affect the mission nasa 
said the bunker contains lasers used to position the shuttle 
precisely on the pad but they were not damaged 
because the shuttles satellite is classified the pentagon will 
not permit nasa to disclose the exact launch time until nine 
minutes before liftoff but it is expected to be about 730 pm 
there also will be a news blackout throughout the mission 
military officials say the secrecy is necessary to make it more 
difficult for soviet reconnaissance satellites and a spy ship off 
cape canaveral to track the shuttle 
critics argue that the secrecy is unnecessary because the 
soviets with their intelligence capability undoubtedly already 
know a great deal about the mission and that once discovery is in 
orbit they will be able to track it precisely and know what is 
doing 
sources close to the project reported the astronauts are to 
deploy a 300 million 2ton signal intelligence satellite designed 
to eavesdrop on military and diplomatic communications in the 
soviet union and other countries a similar satellite was released 
on another shuttle flight in 1985 
the flight crew is headed by air force col frederick c 
gregory the first black named to command a shuttle flight the 
others are air force col john blaha the pilot and three mission 
specialists navy capt manley l carter jr f story musgrave and 
kathryn c thornton 
the menu for the mission includes thermostabilized turkey 
and gravy which means the food has enough preservatives to be 
carried without refrigeration 
we are hopeful the crew will have thanksgiving dinner in 
space said dick young spokesman for the national aeronautics 
and space adminstration 
the launch will be only the third after nightfall in 32 shuttle 
missions gregory and the pilot air force col john blaha 
practiced night landings on the shuttle runway here in a jet 
equipped to handle like a shuttle 
the expected fourday mission will end with a nighttime landing 
at edwards air force base calif 
gregory and blaha also would have to land the shuttle in the 
dark here or at emergency runways in spain or north africa in case 
of an abort after liftoff

rene mouawad native of a mountain region 
known for its violent feuds was a cooltempered lawyer who 
advocated dialogue in his divided country 
mouawad killed by a bomb wednesday after only 17 days as 
lebanons president was an early advocate of reconciliation 
as minister of education in 1981 he sliced through sectarian 
hatreds to organize examinations for christian and moslem 
youngsters whose studies had been interrupted by the civil war 
he requisitioned schools in three districts east of beirut so 
the students could do their work protected by a multisect brigade 
from the lebanese army 
it was the fist time in six years that christian and moslem 
students were able to do that 
an art lover mouawad sponsored an operation to salvage 1000 
paintings and sculptures from education ministry warehouses set on 
fire in israeli air raids in 1982 during israels invasion of 
lebanon 
only a day before his death mouawad urged the lebanese to come 
together and work to end the bloody conflict 
enough agony enough blood enough destruction enough 
impoverishment enough adventures said the 64yearold maronite 
catholic president 
lets at long last close ranks and build the new lebanon he 
said in a televised independence day address 
mouawad elected president nov 5 as part of an arab 
leaguesponsored peace plan was unable to spread his governments 
hold beyond syriancontrolled regions and a part of the christian 
enclave north of beirut 
the most vocal opposition to his presidency came from a fellow 
maronite army commander gen michel aoun who denounced mouawad as 
a syrian puppet and claimed his election was unconstitutional 
mouawad took part in a 20member national dialogue committee 
formed in september 1975 to find a settlement to the civil war 
then five months old 
violence cannot solve problems dialogue is the only way to 
find solutions he said at the time 
but that peace effort collapsed as have many others since 
unlike the tough mountain warriors in his rugged home region of 
zgorta known for its hot tempers mouawad often was referred to as 
the cool zgortan 
the mouawad family and the issa khoury clan to which his wife 
naila belongs are allied with the powerful franjiehs in the 
northeastern region 
the franjiehs are headed by former president suleiman franjieh 
one of the last of the oldstyle maronite warlords 
mouawad had been a member of the 99seat parliament since he was 
elected to represent his home region in 1957 at the age of 32 his 
assassination left only 72 surviving members 
he spent the first year of his parliamentary term as an exile in 
the syrian port city of lattakia after a member of a rival family 
accused him of taking part in an interclan clash in june 1957 in 
which 16 people were killed 
mouawad returned to lebanon in 1958 shortly after newly elected 
president fuad chahab dropped charges against him for lack of 
undisputed evidence 
later the witness who testified against mouawad withdrew his 
allegation saying it was politically motivated 
mouawad graduated with a law degree in 1947 from the 
frenchaffiliated st joseph university in christian east beirut 
he started his own practice in the northern provincial capital 
of tripoli two years later but gave it up when he entered 
parliament 
he was named minister of telegraphs and telecommunications in 
1961 and held the post until february 1964 he was named minister 
of public works in 1969 and minister of education in 1980 
mouawad is survived by his wife nayla and two children 
23yearold rima a law student in paris and 17yearold michel a 
high school senior in paris

president bush prepared to address the nation 
wednesday night on the momentous events in eastern europe which 
will be at the center of next weeks summit with soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev 
bush was to deliver the primetime thankgivingeve speech from 
camp david where he is spending the holiday with his wife barbara 
it was the first time the presidential retreat in marylands 
catoctin mountains has been used as the site for a nationally 
televised speech bushs remarks set the stage for talks with 
gorbachev dec 2 and 3 on warships in the mediterranean off the 
coast of malta 
the meeting originally billed as a relaxed getacquainted 
session has been transformed into a highly charged summit by the 
opening of the berlin wall and the loosening of hardline communist 
policies in east germany hungary poland czechoslovakia and even 
bulgaria 
its impossible to deny the fact that we are at a moment in 
history when many nations of the world are in transition and when 
democracy and communism are in transition white house press 
secretary marlin fitzwater said in previewing the speech 
bush and gorbachev have voiced hope for a calm and peaceful 
period of change in eastern europe and central europe bush has 
emphasized that the summit is not intended to reshape the future of 
europe 
the meeting may produce a joint pledge not to interfere in the 
political turmoil 
bush has said he will use the meeting to promote the process of 
reform and democracy the soviets say the meeting could produce a 
timetable for resolving key issues facing the two superpowers 
the president told reporters aboard air force one that he was 
looking to the malta summit with the boy scout motto be 
prepared 
ive got a lot of homework to do he said were going in 
a spirit of total good will we are not going to blindside our 
allies 
bush said he would not have a yaltatype meeting trying to 
divvy up anything or decide the fate of any sovereign nation 
it would be presumptuous and arrogant for the president of the 
united states superpower though we may be to try to decide the 
future of europe in a way that would impinge on the sovereignty of 
any country east or west 
on the eve of bushs speech gorbachev said in moscow that the 
soviet union was well disposed to the changes sweeping eastern 
europe the soviet union and east european countries he said 
miscalculated the need for overhauling their badly strapped 
economic structures 
now we have to make up for lost time and this requires a more 
rapid pace of change gorbachev said he predicted the reforms 
will affect everything in eastern europe and said he was in 
favor of a society that is more open to the world and is ready 
for cooperation 
bush before delivering his speech made a twohour visit to 
memphis tenn to salute citizens involved in volunteer and 
community service efforts the kind of work that he calls a 
thousand points of light 
as bush left for memphis a contingent of red army soldiers 
waving american flags greeted him on the white house lawn bush 
shook hands with some of the 40 members of the red army chorus 
which is touring the united states and canada 
on his return to washington bush was to fly directly to camp 
david where he will remain until sunday 
bush will hold presummit talks at camp david with british prime 
minister margaret thatcher on friday as he continues his 
preparations for his first meeting with gorbachev as president

when robert mays had to tell his only 
child she was not his biological daughter she cried and cried 
for a long time then asked what the news meant he said wednesday 
his voice at times breaking mays spoke publicly for the first 
time since learning that genetic tests showed 10yearold kimberly 
michelle mays was the daughter of another couple 
i held her she just simply wept i was crying myself she 
said daddy daddy daddy what does this mean 
i told her honey it means only that you are not my 
biological daughter and that means nothing in our life ive loved 
you raised you and cared for you and thats not going to 
change mays said 
mays said he was shocked disappointed and let down friday 
when he learned the results of genetic tests that showed two 
families had raised each others child 
kimberly was born to ernest and regina twigg who reared a girl 
named arlena arlena who died of heart disease last year was born 
to mays and his wife barbara who died of cancer in 1981 
kimberly and arlena were born within three days of each other at 
hardee memorial hospital in rural wauchula 
just before arlenas death in pennsylvania the twiggs learned 
through genetic testing that she was not related to either one of 
them 
the twiggs claimed in a federal lawsuit that a swap occurred in 
the hospital and began a 14month search for the child they lost 
the twiggs parents of seven other children recently moved to 
sebring where twigg is a railroad ticket agent and mrs twigg is a 
substitute teacher 
sebring is 65 mile east of sarasota where mays is a roofing 
contractor 
mays did not rule out a lawsuit of his own when questioned by a 
throng of reporters in his attorneys office he said his thoughts 
now are only about kimberlys welfare 
its history its over its time for both sides to just 
think of her he said kim is damaged kim will probably suffer 
from this for the rest of her life in some manner or form 
he said he felt no anger toward the twiggs 
i sincerely believed kimberly was my biological daughter up 
until last friday mays said 
mays said he would never have agreed to genetic testing of the 
slender hazeleyed blonde if the twiggs hadnt signed an agreement 
in october promising not to seek custody of kimberly no matter what 
the test results revealed 
he described kimberly as a very sensitive child who is 
totally confused right now and worried about hurting feelings 
on either side 
when kimberly came home from school friday mays had their 
suitcases packed for an outing on their boat 
she noticed a look of concern on my face and asked what was 
wrong i just sat her down on the edge of her bed and told her 
mays said 
after he broke the news to kimberly they left for a few days on 
the boat where mays tried to console the girl and help her adjust 
to the idea although theres no timetable the next step is for 
kimberly to meet with psychologists who will make recommendations 
about a first meeting and subsequent visitation schedule with the 
twiggs 
he said it would be her decision on how to proceed he said he 
would be there to advise her 
on one hand mays called it a sense of relief for me im glad 
its over it was a tremendous burden not knowing 
but we cant change anything he added the facts are the 
facts 
mays hasnt come to grips yet with arlenas death 
i certainly feel a sense of loss he said adding that he 
had been deprived of any contact with his biological daughter he 
added there will always be a question in his mind could i have 
made a difference in her life 
kimberly has celebrated her birthday on nov 29 and wont switch 
to dec 2 the day the twigg baby was born 
im sure if its left to kim shell celebrate it on both 
days said mays we decided wed do it on the 29th sort of as 
a remembrance to arlena

the congress that adjourned early wednesday 
started last january by rejecting a pay raise spent 11 months 
doing preliminary work on clean air child care the deficit and 
other matters then voted itself a raise and left town 
mighty debates were held on abortion flag burning capital 
gains taxes and the unprecedented resignation of the speaker of 
the house none of which added much to a meager legislative 
portfolio 
theres a sense that we didnt do a damn thing this year 
said a discouraged rep robert matsui dcalif 
its sort of the lost year agreed rep vin weber rminn 
thats not to say there were no accomplishments 
the minimum wage was raised for the first time since 1981 
a costly but important bailout and reregulation of the savings 
and loan industry was enacted 
a legislative truce was reached phasing out military aid to 
the contra rebels in nicaragua 
separate bills were passed by the house and senate on oil spill 
liability to help prevent or deal with another exxon valdez 
disaster but resolving the differences between them was put off 
until next year 
aid was approved for poland and hungary and more money 
earmarked for antidrug efforts 
and congressional leaders trying to put a positive face on 
things say they laid a lot of groundwork make judgments next 
year when we have completed action senate majority leader 
george mitchell dmaine implored reporters 
but while some was done more noteworthy were the things and 
people that were undone 
the most celebrated undoings of the year were the cases of two 
texans house speaker jim wright and former sen john tower 
bushs nomination of tower as secretary of defense seemed a sure 
winner at first the senate almost never rejects an alumnus 
but tower became portrayed as a drunk and a womanizer who had 
negotiated treaties for the united states and then turned around 
and cashed in his knowledge with private interests the rejection 
gave bush a black eye with his administration barely out of the 
gate 
the tower episode left partisan scars in the senate but nothing 
like the institutional heart attack suffered in the house 
democrat wright was toppled after the house ethics committee 
charged him with violating rules that limit gifts and outside 
income received by lawmakers wright maintained his innocence but 
resigned before the full house could rule 
then his third in command house majority whip tony coelho 
dcalif quit rather than face an inquiry into his private 
financial dealings 
given the way we started the year i think the big success is 
were up and running again said rep mike synar dokla 
an entire new house democratic leadership team headed by 
speaker thomas s foley was installed wrights chief accuser 
rep newt gingrich of georgia was promoted to the no 2 spot among 
house republicans and himself became target of an ethics probe 
and other ethics cases linger 
five senators are under investigation for intervening with the 
government on behalf of a savings and loan executive who gave their 
campaigns thousands and whose thrift later went under at a cost to 
the taxpayers of billions 
several house members are being investigated after allegations 
of sexual misdeeds including one convicted of sex with an underage 
girl and another who hired a male prostitute as a personal aide 
a spectacular legislative undoing was the case of the medicare 
catastrophic illness law 
passed only a year earlier with great bipartisan fanfare it 
promised to protect retirees from financial ruin in cases of 
extended serious illness but congress repealed it this year after 
protests from angry elderly constituents who objected to paying up 
to 800 a year to cover the costs 
the democraticcontrolled congress spent most of the year 
disagreeing with bush over the minimum wage legislation to raise 
it to 425 an hour was passed this month only after both sides saw 
embarrassment if they didnt act before the visit of polish 
solidarity leader lech walesa 
another stalemate over bushs proposal for a cut in the capital 
gains tax poisoned the atmosphere for any serious effort to reduce 
the federal deficit 
bush eventually agreed to wait until next year on his tax cut 
and a lastminute deal was struck that claimed 147 billion in 
deficit reduction at a time of 150 billion deficits and much 
of it was just accounting changes 
two supreme court rulings resulted in huge debate but little 
legislation 
when the high court gave states more ability to restrict 
abortion it rekindled an issue that had been quiet for years 
suddenly lawmakers who had comfortably sat on the fence were 
pushed over to the prochoice side 
but president bush used his veto to beat back attempts by 
congress to restore federal spending on abortions for poor women 
who were raped or victims of incest 
when the court ruled unconstitutional a texas law banning flag 
burning bush with rhetoric and events reminiscent of his 
presidential campaign pressed for a flagprotecting constitutional 
amendment 
democratic leaders stalled action until public opinion turned 
against such tinkering with the bill of rights and congress passed 
a simple statute designed to meet the courts objections if the 
new statute is also overturned the issue will be back 
the democrats point to the flag abortion and especially 
capital gains as examples of how bush took stands which had little 
to do with problems congress is equipped to solve next year they 
vow to move their agenda and bring bush along 
republicans defend bush as taking a wise and prudent course and 
share with democrats the defense that this was only the first year 
of a twoyear congress 
a significant amount of shadow boxing occurred but that isnt 
all bad said sen pete v domenici rnm shadow boxing 
sometimes gets people ready 
for example next years clean air and child care legislation 
are going to be much better for it he said 
an ambitious clean air bill to attack the three major problems 
of air pollution acid rain urban smog and toxic chemicals in the 
atmosphere got bogged down in the house in regional disputes over 
acid rain and requirements for clean burning motor vehicle fuels 
separate measures to increase federal child care assistance passed 
the house and senate but endofsession arguments in the house 
prevented final agreement 
lawmakers are hoping theyll accomplish so much next year that 
voters wont be upset next november about the pay raise they voted 
themselves 
a storm of public protest forced rejection of a 51 percent pay 
raise proposal last winter congressional leaders never gave up 
and this month approved with broad bipartisan support a new plan 
by jan 1 1991 house salaries will jump to about 125000 
with members then barred from making paid speeches before interest 
groups senate salaries will probably just top 100000 by then 
but theyll keep taking the lobbyists speech money members of 
both houses now make 89500 
speaker foley said the ethics reforms make the house bill a 
landmark and many house and senate members said the senate will 
be forced to revisit its decision next year

the federal government opened the new fiscal 
year with a deficit of 2609 billion in october four times higher 
than the imbalance the previous month the treasury department said 
wednesday 
while the flow of red ink was in line with expectations 
analysts said it pointed up the huge task the government is facing 
in trying to meet the deficit reduction targets called for in the 
grammrudman deficit reduction law 
the deficit law sets a target of 100 billion for the fiscal 
year that began oct 1 that would mean that with the budget year 
just a month old the government is already onefourth of the way 
toward hitting the deficit target for the entire year 
congress completed work early wednesday on a deficit reduction 
bill that would trim spending by 147 billion with a goal of 
reducing this years deficit to about 103 billion according to 
supporters of the measure 
however private economists said that estimate was based on 
optimistic assumptions and that the actual deficit was likely to be 
well above that figure 
michael evans head of a washington forecasting company said he 
believed the 1990 deficit would hit 165 billion up from an actual 
deficit of 15515 billion in the fiscal year that ended sept 30 
we are not making any progress on the deficit evans said 
adding that his forecast is based on the assumption that the 
country will avoid a recession next year if a downturn which some 
forecasters consider likely does occur evans said the deficit 
will top 200 billion 
the deficit in september the last month in the 1989 budget 
year totaled 607 billion this smaller deficit resulted from 
higher government tax revenues reflecting quarterly tax payments 
made by corporations and individuals 
without that higher revenue the october deficit climbed to 
2609 billion this was still slightly below the october 1988 
deficit of 27 billion 
government revenues in october totaled 6843 billion while 
spending was 9452 billion 
as usual the biggest spending categories were for the military 
social security and other programs in the department of health and 
human services and interest on the national debt 
military spending totaled 1915 billion in october and is 
projected to total 28689 billion for the entire fiscal year 
social security payments amounted to 1986 billion last month 
and are projected to total 24295 billion for the full budget year 
while other programs in hhs including medicare and medicaid 
totaled 1335 billion in october and are expected to cost 19017 
billion for the full year 
interest on the 289 trillion public debt amounted to 1646 
billion last month and is expected to total 25436 billion for the 
full fiscal year 
the administration is projecting that spending for all 
government activities in fiscal 1990 will amount to 1179 trillion

the government wednesday proposed an 
austerity program for next year that would forsee a 15 percent 
increase in consumer prices and a big reduction in subsidies to try 
to cut the budget deficit 
the budget directives for 1990 presented in parliament by 
finance minister laszlo bekesi provoked sharp criticism from 
legislators who feared it would lead to higher inflation and 
unemployment 
on tuesday premier miklos nemeth said hungarys foreign debt 
was expected to reach 20 billion by the end of the year 
hungary has embarked on an ambitious program of political 
reforms last month legislators adopted a series of laws to lay 
the legal groundwork for the first free multiparty elections in 
more than 40 years 
nemeth said tuesday that measures necessary to stimulate the 
stagnating economy and gain credibility for foreign investors would 
not be as popular 
bekesi said a 15 percent increase in consumer prices was 
envisioned for next year and subsidies were to be cut by 17 
percent according to the mti news agency the subsidy cuts would 
result in a further price rise of 15 percent to 2 percent 
particularly affecting transport energy water and rents 
bekesi said the goal was to cut the budget deficit from 330 
million to 250 million 
lawmakers also reviewed the governments threeyear economic 
program in a first reading which drew considerable criticism 
sandor nagy the leader of the official trade unions said in 
the nationally televised debate that the program would lead to 
stagnation inflation impoverishment and unemployment 
mti said wednesday in a separate report that unemployment was 
expected to double next year to between 50000 and 60000 people or 
about one percent of the workforce 
it quoted csaba halmos who heads the state office for wages and 
manpower as saying unemployment was expected to reach more than 
five percent over the next few years he was not more specific 
about the timeframe 
bekesi said that in order to counterbalance the increased cost 
of living spending on education and health would be increased by 
40 percent 
according to mti a 600 million package earmarked for social 
welfare would allow an increase in the monthly pensions of 13 in 
two stages and an increase in family allowances of 5 
pensioners in hungary last year received an average of about 
75 but 250000 pensioners are believed to live below the 
governmentaccepted minimum subsistence level of about 66 the 
average monthly wage is about 133 
pay raises of about 16 percent are envisioned in the program in 
the fields of education scientific research health justice and 
in the police force mti said 
the economic proposals will be reviewed again by the government 
next month taking into account the changes suggested by the 
legislators

the senate early wednesday confirmed president 
bushs choice for the key job at the national labor relations 
board but the administrations nomination for one of three other 
slots at the agency was returned to the white house because of 
republican opposition 
confirmed as nlrb general counsel was jerry hunter the state of 
missouris former top labor official the general counsel is 
independent of the board and chooses the cases the panel will hear 
the nominations of hunter and bushs three choices for the board 
itself dennis m devaney clifford r oviatt jr and donald 
rodgers were being treated as a package until opposition to 
rodgers surfaced 
the national right to work committee has opposed rodgers a 
former teamsters union official on grounds he supports compulsory 
unionism the organization has mounted an aggressive lobbying 
campaign to defeat the nomination and won at least a temporary 
victory as the senate rushed toward adjournment early wednesday 
by law all nominations must be returned to the white house if 
they have not been considered and the senate is adjourning for a 
period of longer than 30 days unless senators agree unanimously to 
carry the nomination over until congress reconvenes 
unanimous consent was granted to requests to hold over the 
nominations of oviatt and devaney but conservative republicans 
forced the rodgers nomination back to the white house bush either 
would have to renominate rodgers name him as a recess apppointment 
while congress is out of session or name a replacement 
the senate did vote to allow devaney himself a recess 
appointment of former president reagan to continue serving until 
dec 16 his nomination for a full term will be taken up after 
congress returns

the work was finished the panels 
had been replaced and space shuttle workers were packing up their 
tools when a technician noticed he was missing a screwdriver 
like everything else having to do with the space shuttle this 
event tuesday night prompted a hurried meeting of top brass 
launching space shuttle discovery with a screwdriver rattling 
around somewhere in its innards does not fit with nasas mission 
plans 
we could only assume that it had been left in the aft 
compartment you have to assume the worst said lee solid site 
director for rocketdyne contractors for the space shuttle main 
engines 
the aft compartment contains the shuttles three huge engines 
all technicians who had worked in the area searched their tool 
kits looking for the phillips screwdriver weighing 42 grams no 
luck 
engineers for rocketdyne nasa and robert crippen the man who 
has the final word on launching the shuttle met to discuss the 
problem 
we had assessed whether it would have been a problem and 
accepted the risk said solid an analysis showed he said that 
the errant screwdriver would cause no problem even if it hitchhiked 
in the aft compartment 
in the 31 previous shuttle flights indeed in all the manned 
space launches many tools have gone along unintentionally 
although solid said we have very stringent toolcontrol 
in the end it was much ado about nothing 
the screwdriver was found on the floor

a jesuit leader charged wednesday that the 
united states was handing weapons to butchers in el salvador 
suggesting that washington shares responsibility for the slaying of 
six priests there 
the rev joseph ohare president of fordham university spoke 
at a mass for the slain priests that drew more than 1000 
worshipers including new yorks roman catholic cardinal john j 
oconnor three bishops and the vaticans representative to the 
united nations archbishop renato martino 
the slain priests including the rector and vice rector of 
central american university in san salvador were dragged from 
their beds and shot to death last week their two housekeepers also 
were slain 
human rights observers blamed the salvadoran army or rightwing 
death squads for the murders while the usbacked government 
denied involvement clerics in el salvador long have been accused 
of siding with leftist rebels 
ohare in his homily decried the billions of dollars in 
military aid given to el salvador by the united states while us 
policy in theory at least has had respectable objectives he 
said its effect has been to escalate violence and thwart political 
negotiation 
he said the killings of the priests pose with brutal clarity 
the question that continues to haunt the policy of the united 
states toward el salvador can we hand weapons to butchers and 
remain unstained by the blood of their innocent victims 
the comment was greeted with a halfminute of applause a most 
uncommon event during mass 
the slain priests and their housekeepers were martyrs ohare 
said champions of the poor killed for their commitment to 
human rights we can only be humbled by their commitment to the 
truth he declared 
one worshipers was bill ford brother of ita ford a maryknoll 
nun who was killed with two other nuns and a lay worker in el 
salvador nearly nine years ago he spoke outside the church of his 
sense of deep disappointment that eight years nine years have 
made really no difference 
the killers are still armed and financed by the united states 
government ford said and i just have to wonder how many more 
people have to die before our government realizes that we are 
giving guns and ammunition to murderers 
oconnor did not speak at the mass and left without commenting 
to reporters

china will continue as one of the worlds 
biggest wheat importers at least through the coming decade an 
agriculture department report said wednesday 
wheat is currently in great demand as a preferred food 
grain said the departments economic research service due to 
population growth and income increases china will remain a major 
wheat importer through the end of the century 
the brief report noted that china was the biggest importer of 
us wheat in 198889 those sales totaled 81 million metric tons 
in the marketing year that ended last may 31 the soviet union by 
comparison imported less than 5 million tons in the same period 
despite the political turmoil in chinas major cities this 
spring agricultural production has been virtually unaffected 
the report said however chinas agricultural trade 
particularly imports will grow more slowly because of the lower 
availability of foreign exchange resulting from a slower rate of 
foreign investment and less tourism following the unrest 
but the report added that chinas wheat imports will remain 
high to avoid unrest among urban consumers

producers who have 1985crop corn and grain 
sorghum stored under federal price support loans in the 
farmerowned reserve program will be allowed to extend these loans 
for another year the agriculture department said wednesday 
keith bjerke executive vice president of the departments 
commodity credit corp said the loans are scheduled to mature 
after dec 31 
this action will ensure that adequate supplies are maintained 
in the feed grain for reserve program he said 
farmers who put grain in the reserve normally must leave it 
there until market prices rise enough to trigger its release or 
until the loans come due at that time the grain is available for 
use or sale on the market 
by extending the loan period the grain can be kept off the 
market for an additional time during which the farmer can draw 
federal rental payments at an annual rate of 265 cents per bushel 
bjerke said the oneyear option also will be availalbe to those 
producers who previously extended their loans for six months 
but 1989crop feed grains will not be allowed entry in the 
reserve program since a substantial portion of these crops have 
already been marketed he said decisions about the reserve and the 
1990 crops will be made later 
farmers should contact local offices of the agricultural 
stabilization and conservation service for details bjerke said

a 25yearold man was convicted 
wednesday of killing 15 people when in a fit of jealousy he set 
fire to a rooming house 5 years ago 
an essex county superior court jury deliberated 10 hours over 
two days in the case of james carver 
as the jury announced its verdict carvers wife maryjane 
began to screech no no no and cried out he didnt do it 
carver kept his eyes straight ahead but when handcuffs were 
clapped onto his wrists he buried his head in his hands 
mrs carver was taken to anna jacques hospital in newburyport 
and released later 
carver faces a mandatory life sentence with a minimum 15 years 
in prison sentencing was set dec 1 carvers attorney dennis 
jackson immediately filed an appeal 
the prosecution said carver a former truck driver set the fire 
july 4 1984 because he was jealous that his former girlfriend was 
dating a man who lived at the elliott chambers rooming house in 
beverly 15 miles north of boston 
the rooming house had 33 residents when the fire broke out 13 
died in the fire a 14th was killed jumping from a window and 
another victim died weeks later 
asked how the case was lost jackson said the jury had to 
believe the confessions the alleged confessions and disbelieve 
the mother 
gail carver took the stand at her sons trial to say she saw him 
asleep at her home in danvers at the time of the fire 
now i hope that the families and friends of those 15 people 
who died can have some peace said district attorney kevin 
burke 
burke said the heart of the prosecutions case was carvers own 
words 
its an accumulation of evidence but it was the statements of 
the defendant himself the admissions he made to several people 
burke said 
it was carvers second trial on the charges the first ended in 
a mistrial in march when a prosecutor found he had failed to give 
the defense a statement that incriminated carver 
burke noted that as a result of the tragedy legislation was 
enacted requiring water sprinklers in rooming houses

reforms sweeping the soviet bloc dont 
appear to be reaching communist north korea but the united nations 
command still hopes for reduced tension on the korean peninsula a 
senior commander said wednesday 
us navy rear adm larry vogt said the small amount of 
information coming out of north korea indicates the communist 
nation is concerned about reforms in eastern europe and opposes any 
attempt to emulate it people in north korea probably have not been 
told about the changes in east europe he said 
they just dont want to change said the senior 
representative of the united nations command to the military 
armistice commission that polices the ceasefire that ended the 
korean war in 1953 the un command comprises the united states 
and 15 other nations that aided south korea during the korean war 
vogt said in an interview that contacts with north korea through 
armistice commission meetings at the panmunjom truce site have 
helped reduce tension and brought improvements along the 
demilitarized zone dividing the nations 
both sides are exchanging information and ideas so were very 
helpful we will see some changes vogt said 
progress is measured probably in milimeters compared to whats 
going on in europe but the fact that we can still see the south 
and north getting together shaking hands over a conference table 
and holding talks thats extremely important he added 
north korea and south korea technically remain at war since no 
peace treaty was signed at the end of hostilities in 1953 the two 
bitter rivals have been holding talks in recent months on easing 
tension 
the armistice commission can only police the ceasefire along the 
dmz and not seek any larger political solution to the korean 
confrontation vogt said but the commission has made progress in 
easing tension even if it has been gradual he said 
violent and other serious confrontations between north and south 
have declined steadily over the years vogt said our main 
purpose is to maintain the truce weve done that for 36 years 
he said 
vogt noted that north korea maintains the worlds fifthlargest 
army and the divided peninsula remains a major potential trouble 
spot 
us forces can help preserve peace by remaining in south korea 
until a political solution is found to the confrontation with north 
korea vogt said 
were a trip wire we actually are a deterrent here that the 
north koreans have to deal with he said 
some us congressmen have called for a reduction in the 43000 
us troops in south korea to save money us and south korean 
government officials oppose any reduction saying it would be 
premature 
any talk of force reductions could lead north korea to 
miscalculate vogt said

afghan moslem insurgents announced 
wednesday that relatively fair elections would be held within 
five months in guerrillacontrolled areas of afghanistan and 
refugee camps in pakistan 
the election would be run by a selfstyled guerrilla government 
based in pakistan six of the seven major guerrilla parties have 
agreed on the logistics said syed gallani justice minister of the 
guerrilla government 
voting would be completed no later than april but hopefully it 
will start before the end of this year gailani said no doubt 
conditions in afghanistan are rather difficult for elections 
but it will be relatively fair 
the usbacked guerrillas have been fighting for 11 years to 
oust successive communist governments in kabul they have promised 
elections several times but postponed them for various reasons 
another guerrilla spokesman azim nasserzia said the 
fundamentalist hezbiislami faction has refused to participate 
claiming elections are contrary to the tenets of islam 
gailani said the polls will elect a council of 500 afghans who 
will either give the existing guerrilla government a vote of 
confidence or replace it with another 
the insurgents proclaimed a governmentinexile in february to 
coincide with the withdrawal of soviet combat troops from 
afghanistan after nine years of intervention 
western observers had predicted an early collapse of the kabul 
government following the red armys departure but afghan president 
najib remains in power and his communist troops control 
afghanistans major cities 
the guerrillas however control most of the countryside 
gailani said afghans living in governmentcontrolled cities 
wont vote effectively eliminating a third of afghanistans 
estimated 15 million people 
it is also doubtful that women will vote nasserzia said some 
of the hardline guerrilla groups reject female voting as 
unislamic 
about 35 million war refugees live in refugee camps in 
pakistans northwest frontier province another 2 million afghans 
fled to iran 
ballot boxes will be located in refugee camps in pakistan but 
gailani refused to explain how the voting would be done inside 
afghanistan where fighting continues or in iran where most 
refugees live in cities not camps 
he said details will be released in the near future

honduras and costa rica on wednesday 
rejected nicaraguas suggestion for an urgent meeting of central 
american presidents following the collapse of peace talks with 
usbacked rebels 
with civil war raging in el salvador it seemed unlikely such a 
meeting could occur anytime soon 
also wednesday a foreign ministry spokeswoman said a us state 
department videotape purporting to show leftist salvadoran 
guerrillas training in nicaragua was a fake and a cheap 
propaganda move by washington 
nine days of peace talks between the leftist sandinista 
government and the contras as the usbacked rebels are known 
ended tuesday in stalemate at the washington headquarters of 
organization of american states 
the talks dealt with reinstating a 19month ceasefire that 
nicaragua president daniel ortega ended nov 1 and demobilization 
of the contra force most of whom are in border camps in honduras 
victor hugo tinoco the deputy foreign minister leading the 
nicaraguan delegation at the talks said his government would call 
for an emergency meeting of the presidents of honduras el 
salvador guatemala and costa rica 
presidents of the four countries and ortega agreed aug 7 that 
the contras should dismantle by dec 5 a deadline the sandinista 
delegation offered to extend until dec 31 
the contras were not part of the pact and have refused to 
demobilize before general elections scheduled for feb 25 in 
nicaragua 
this effort of peace proposed by president daniel ortega 
succumbed because of the intransigent attitude of the 
counterrevolutionary delegation said a communique from ortegas 
office 
it blamed the united states for the failure of the talks saying 
washingtons continued funding of the rebels allowed them to remain 
in place and it said honduras was harboring the contras 
there is no doubt that the principal responsibility for the 
existence and permanence of the contras in honduras falls on the 
honduran government which is the one that should impede the use of 
its territory as a base of aggression against a neighboring 
county the communique said 
president jose azcona hoyo of honduras said wednesday he would 
not attend an emergency meeting azcona said the five presidents in 
the aug 7 pact signed in tela honduras had agreed to a dec 89 
meeting which he would attend 
ortega is losing much prestige azcona told reporters at an 
airport news conference before leaving for vacation wednesday 
morning ortega is being called upon to maintain a steady and 
serene position and not to be worrying the area with his 
attitude 
honduras is holding general elections on sunday and azcona who 
by law cannot seek reelection after his fouryear term is to hand 
over power to his successor jan 27 
carlos rivera acting foreign minister of costa rica told 
reporters in san jose on wednesday that his country would not 
attend an emergency meeting 
we do not believe that an emergency meeting is necessary 
rivera said after meeting with president oscar arias we have 
programmed a meeting of the presidents in nicaragua for december 
and there we can discuss the contra demobilization 
in el salvador fierce fighting now in its 12th day between the 
farabundo marti national liberation front guerrillas and the 
rightist government made it unlikely that president alfredo 
cristiani could attend an special summit soon 
there was no immediate response from guatemalan president 
vinicio cerezo 
the fighting in el salvador drew attention away from the 
sandinistacontra talks 
but nicaragua was back in the spotlight on monday when the state 
department screened a video it said showed top leaders of the 
guerrillas taking part in training maneuvers at el tempisque 
training center north of managua 
the united states regularly accuses the sandinistas of training 
supplying and supporting the salvadoran guerrillas the nicaraguan 
government has said it hasnt done so since 1980 
this video does not contain definite proof said foreign 
ministry spokeswoman mercedes borge we consider it a montage 
this is just cheap propaganda by the state deparment 
there is increased likelihood now of a sandinista final 
offensive such as the one in march 1988 that drove right into 
honduran territory 
that offensive called danto 88 took place shortly after 
congress refused to keep funding the contras militarily and forced 
the rebels to the negotiating table with the sandinistas since 
then congress has been giving the contras aid in the form of tents 
and other nonlethal military supplies 
the sandinistas who in 1979 ousted the government of rightist 
president anastasio somoza said that as of mid1989 the 8yearold 
war with the rebels left 57000 dead injured or missing

here is a transcript of president bushs 
informal questionandanswer session with reporters wednesday 
aboard force one en route to memphis tenn 
bush let me just make a couple of general comments first im 
very pleased that the congress has adjourned we are pleased with 
the reconciliation bill that finally was passed i thank the 
leadership republican and democrat on both sides both the senate 
and the house for a spirit of real cooperation there 
now this is important legislation in terms of driving that 
deficit down so that worked out well the legislative session i 
got some not all of what i wanted but it ended up in a good 
spirit and i told the leaders leaders of the house right after 
midnight and the leaders of the senate about 300 or 400 this 
morning that i thanked them for what they did 
in terms of the lebanon we are distressed about the reported 
killing of president moawad and it is a disgraceful terroristic 
happening if true and i want to say that because at this 
juncture though it looks to be true weve not had final 
confirmation and i think it is a direct setback for the tripartite 
efforts that were trying to bring peace to lebanon 
it is a disgraceful performance it is condemned by the united 
states of america and however we must not let this brutal 
killing stand in the way of trying to bring peace to this troubled 
corner of the world and i would like to offer the help of america 
for the officials there the prime minister and others to bring 
these killers to justice and its hard to do that in that part of 
the world but i think all people of conscience will want to join 
us in trying to not only bring those to justice who were 
responsible for this killing but in a broader sense to help the 
peace process in lebanon 
and then the third subject i want to comment on is the salvador 
guerrillas coming into areas with civilian populations terrorists 
themselves in my view coming in and taking over a hotel this 
morning lebanese i mean salvadoran special operation forces 
joined by us elements special operations went through that 
hotel and i can tell you that im very pleased that all the 
americans have been released and there was no loss of life in this 
sweep this morning as that hotel was liberated with finality from 
the clutches of these outrageous guerrilla attacks 
q mr president can you tell us were any of the salvadorans 
killed any of the rebels killed this morning in that 
bush in that sweep of the hotel no apparently not 
q can you explain what elements of us troops were involved 
were they sent down 
bush special operations forces 
q were they sent from ft bragg 
bush there were i cant ill leave others to tell you about 
where they came from but they were our special operations and 
when you have 
q does the army have a base there 
bush no that i sent down there and when you see americans 
held hostage like this theres a message in all of this this 
president backed by our defense secretary is going to protect the 
lives of americans wherever we can and go to any end we can to 
protect the lives of american citizens and so it all worked out 
and im very pleased we moved rapidly we had a very good orderly 
process that resulted in our being able to do this 
q what beyond the events of this morning what kind of 
military further military assistance are you going to give to 
cristianis government because of the situation still going on in 
the capital with the 
bush well he hasnt asked for any further military assistance 
he knows that we support his government it was after all 
democratically freely elected and then you have a handful of 
marxist guerrillas that are being financed by heaven knows who but 
they are out of step with the changes that are taking place in the 
world and we must not stand by and fail to support a country 
thats moved down democracys path and were going to do it 
q does that mean that you are prepared then if he asks to 
send some something other than advisors 
bush your question is too hypothetical i dont answer 
hypothetical questions like that 
q how close did you come to canceling this trip today to stay 
in washington 
bush i didnt come close at all i you know had i had 
there been some emergency situation that was looked like it 
needed management from the white house i would have stayed there 
but thats not the fact so it really we felt we have felt 
thats been reasonably well under control my main concern being 
safety of american citizens 
q was there any fighting this morning during the sweep 
bush i havent heard any report of any oh you mean not during 
the sweep of the hotel no

a woman has been acquitted of killing 
her husband on a day he began drinking at 7 am assaulted her 
three children and told her its time to get rid of you 
robin elson 28 didnt deny she shot her husband unemployed 
auto mechanic jack elson on dec 17 1988 elson 44 died of 
wounds to the back 
but the jury agreed tuesday with her lawyer lynda vitale that 
it was selfdefense after 6 years of beatings and abuse 
court clerk allyn mattoxs voice choked with emotion when she 
read the verdict and elson embraced vitale tears streaming down 
their faces while tears filled the eyes of most people in the 
court 
the threeweek trial focused on the socalled battered wife 
syndrome 
psychologist nancy kaserboyd said during nearly three days of 
testimony that women often endure abuse because they become afraid 
to leave feel helpless have low selfesteem and limited resources 
testimony revealed that while elson had been beaten by her 
husband in the past the day he died was worse than usual 
he had been drinking since about 7 am he beat and choked 
stepdaughter renee now 11 kicked and punched son camrin 3 and 
harassed son brock 1 
he turned a hose fullforce on the familys pet dog and threw 
the animal three times onto the roof of their home in east long 
beach 
that afternoon he told his wife he felt suicidal accused her 
of being a poor mother and said its time to get rid of you 
he forced her to point his rifle at him as part of what he 
called a selfdefense lesson poking the gun in her chest when she 
refused to learn when the lesson ended he put the rifle on 
the living room floor and said its hot and ready to go 
elson said that in her mind that meant he was going to kill her 
and the children 
she said she later went back into the living room picked up the 
gun and shot her husband he was hit twice in the back a medical 
examiners report said he had a blood alcohol level of 016 
deputy district attorney tom holmes questioned the jurys 
decision 
the rules regarding selfdefense do not permit this kind of 
result holmes said there has to be an imminent danger of 
great bodily harm or injury this simply was not a correct 
verdict 
juror susan jepsen said i really hope women learn from this 
not to let it go this far

un chief javier perez de cuellar president bush and other 
leaders worldwide denounced the killing wednesday of president rene 
mouawad of lebanon but hoped lebanese could transcend the dark 
shadow it cast on the region 
the un general assembly and the french parliament held a 
moment of silence and syria declared seven days of mourning for 
mouawad who was killed in beirut by a remotecontrol bomb minutes 
after marking lebanons independence day 
those who perpetrated this abominable crime are the enemies of 
lebanons unity syrian president hafez assad said in a telegram 
to lebanese parliament speaker hussein husseini he said the 
assassination should trigger a new impulse to double support for 
lebanon so it can destroy the evil in its nest 
saudi arabia which played a key role in brokering the taif 
peace pact for lebanon expressed its sorrow in a statement by the 
official saudi press agency that was monitored in cyprus 
the statement called the murder a beastly and wanton act 
saying saudis shared the grief of the lebanese people and asked 
god to help them overcome this painful event so that lebanon may 
live in peace again 
saudi arabia will spare no effort in the quest for restoring 
security and stability in lebanon the statement added 
the syrian news agency blamed the killing on lebanese christian 
army gen michel aoun who did not recognize mouawads 17day 
administration aoun denied responsibility 
bush called it a disgraceful terroristic happening and 
pledged us assistance for efforts to end lebanons 14year civil 
war 
we must not let this brutal killing stand in the way of trying 
to bring peace to the troubled corner of the world bush said on 
air force one en route to memphis tenn i would like to offer 
the help of america to bring these killers to justice 
perez de cuellar called mouawad a lebanese patriot who assumed 
his responsibility in full knowledge of the dangers and challenges 
involved and for this he earned widespread admiration and respect 
the un chief said it was especially tragic that the slaying 
should have taken place on lebanons national day and at a time 
when there was hope that such acts of violence which have plagued 
the country for so long were things of the past 
mouawad 64 had promised to enact a arab league peace plan to 
end the civil war 
the us ambassador to the united nations thomas r pickering 
said the mouawads courage should strengthen the resolve of all 
lebanese as well as of the arab league in their efforts to 
restore the unity and territorial integrity and independence of 
lebanon 
the arab leagues un envoy clovis maksoud said he hoped and 
expected the lebanese parliament to convene as soon as possible 
perhaps within 24 hours to elect a new president to fill the 
vacuum 
i hope this tragic development will jolt everyone to recover 
lebanese sovereignty independence institutions and reform said 
maksoud this is a cruel interruption in the process for peace 
and reconciliation in lebanon but it is not a breakdown 
the official jordan news agency said the kingdom expressed 
deep and great sorrow and an official jordanian spokesman told 
the agency 
this murder which is considered a lebanese and an arab 
tragedy has thrown a dark shadow over the whole region 
a foreign ministry statement in cairo said egypt strongly 
condemns this criminal terrorist act and calls on the lebanese 
people to hold on to their unity and put aside their differences at 
this difficult time 
avi pazner a spokesman for israeli prime minister yitzhak 
shamir said the killing of mouawad is new proof that israel must 
take all measures necessary to assure its security 
in france national assembly deputies held a moment of silence 
after hearing the news of moawads death 
i am overwhelmed by this murder that cost president moawad his 
life edwige avice a junior minister in the french foreign 
ministry told the assembly 
the belgian government said in a communique that belgium 
condemned in the strongest manner the assassination of a lebanese 
politician who was well known for his moderation and feels that 
this attack imperils the reestablishment of legality in a country 
which has already suffered too much

abroad with his deployment of a highly secret us commando unit in 
el salvador but his public disclosure raised eyebrows at home as 
well among officials normally barred from acknowledging such units 
exist 
we have specially trained forces they are trained to do this 
kind of mission they were put on alert they were sent and they 
performed their mission and thank god they didnt have to fire a 
shot bush said 
he said that exclaimed one pentagon officer shaking his 
head in wonderment when told of bushs comments well i guess he 
can hes the commanderinchief 
the us troops bush ordered to el salvador did not enter the 
hotel tower where 12 green berets had been under siege by leftist 
rebels and they left el salvador without engaging in any rescue 
attempt military sources said 
bush dispatched two planeloads of special operations squads 
specially trained to conduct guerrilla warfare counterterrorist 
operations and hostage rescues and they were positioned near the 
hotel one administration official said commenting on condition he 
not be named 
but the soldiers never went into action because the leftist 
rebels left during the night white house and other officials said 
bush said that the hotel was liberated with finality with 
the help of the special unit and that it had swept the hotel for 
mines or lurking guerrillas later however white house spokesman 
marlin fitzwater issued a statement saying updated information 
showed us forces did not actually enter the hotel entry proved 
to be unnecessary 
still bush said giving prominent mention to defense secretary 
dick cheney the message of the day was this president backed 
by our defense secretary will stand to protect the lives of 
americans where we can 
bush and cheney worked handinhand to plan the us military 
action in order to avoid any of the communications glitches that 
occurred during the failed coup attempt last month against 
panamanian gen manuel antonio noriega several pentagon sources 
said 
cheney was back and forth to the white house they were in 
constant touch said one senior official 
after bushs comments on the special troops officials confirmed 
that the units numbering somewhat less than 200 men dispatched 
to the scene were from the us special operations command which 
is centered in fort bragg nc 
these are the snakeeaters the covert operations guys said 
one administration official familiar with their training but 
theyre not glory boys they just do their job and dont get the 
credit 
the special operations units sometimes known to the public 
as the delta force grew out of the 1980 hostagerescue attempt in 
iran during the carter administration these units may use 
specialized air force transport teams and navy divers 
overall the special operations command set up in 1987 under a 
congressional mandate totals 35000 active reserve and national 
guard personnel organized in a variety of units said col tom 
jones spokesman for the command at fort bragg 
in contrast the 12 men that were inside the hotel are part of 
the green berets the special forces units also based in fort 
bragg 
the dozen men had been on a twoweek training mission in el 
salvador and were scheduled to return to the united states on 
tuesday the day the hotel was besieged by the rebels 
the mission of the green berets is unchanged from their days in 
vietnam when they trained troops in foreign countries to fight for 
themselves 
the first group was formed and then deactivated during world 
war ii they found a special patron in president kennedy who built 
their numbers and authorized their specialized headgear which had 
been banned in the army

transportation secretary samuel skinner on 
wednesday helped colorado officials celebrate the longawaited 
construction of the nations first new major airport in 15 years 
skinner joined federal aviation administration chief james 
busey gov roy romer denver mayor federico pena and other 
colorado dignitaries who had a hand in the battle for the new 
denver international airport on the rolling plains northeast of 
denver it will replace cramped stapleton international airport 
the airport which could boost the number of jobs in the denver 
area by more than 20000 is being touted as one solution to a 
projected national airtransportation crush that is already causing 
congestion and delays 
youll be putting in place today in the next few years a 
facility that will help not only colorado but our nation skinner 
said 
busey said the new airport will reduce delays here and at 
major airports throughout the nation 
stapleton one of the major hubs for continental and united 
airlines is the fifth busiest airport in the united states 
projections for the new airport would make it second only to 
chicagos ohare in the next 20 years it is expected to open in 
1993 
heavy equipment has been moving earth on the airport site for 
several weeks prior to wednesdays ceremony which featured a 
marching band from denvers public schools and a flyover by 
military jets 
the new airport beset by controversy since planning started 
more than 15 years ago is expected to cost 23 billion and will 
be largest single public works project in the history of colorado 
it on 45 square miles of land the city is buying from adams county 
10 miles northeast of stapleton 
the project is the nations first major airport construction 
since 1974 when the dallasfort worth airport was completed 
president bush on tuesday signed into law the fiscal 1990 
transportation appropriations bill which includes 40 million for 
the first purchases of air traffic control equipment for the 
airport 
funding for the project got a kickstart last month when skinner 
earmarked 60 million in fiscal 1989 discretionary funds to begin 
construction 
in may 1988 adams county residents voted to allow denver to 
annex the land needed for the airport but a snag in the plan 
appeared last january when some lawmakers pushed an alternative 
plan to expand stapleton onto the adjacent rocky mountain arsenal 
pena turned the issue over to the denver electorate which voted 
in may in favor of the new airport site 
proponents of the airport say it will boost the denver and 
colorado economies by creating 2500 construction jobs immediately 
and 20000 fulltime jobs eventually they also say the airport will 
create 51 billion in additional business revenue pear year and 
draw domestic and international businesses to colorado 
an faa report early this year estimated a new airport could 
reduce delays at denver by about 90 percent an estimated 32 
million to 34 million passengers are expected to use stapleton in 
the year 2000 compared with 161 million in 1987 the faa report 
said

the justice department in an effort to bar 
the disclosure of classified information stepped into the 
irancontra case of a former cia station chief wednesday in an 
unprecedented move that could scuttle the case 
acting at the request of us intelligence agencies attorney 
general dick thornburgh filed the unprecedented national security 
declaration that could lead to dismissal of charges against joseph 
fernandez who assisted oliver norths secret contra resupply 
network in 1985 and 1986 
however thornburgh said in a statement that further judicial 
examination of the rulings which cause me to enter this declaration 
will establish the potential for accommodating both the defendants 
rights and the national security interests at stake thereby 
allowing this case to be tried to conclusion 
fernandez is accused of lying about his activities to the tower 
commission and the cia inspector general 
thornburgh said evidence fernandez plans to use in his defense 
would cause serious damage to the national security of the united 
states 
but independent counsel lawrence walsh said we deplore 
thornburghs action because it protects fictional secrets 
we are disappointed that the declaration is extremely 
broad and blocks the disclosure of information that is 
generally known to the public said associate independent counsel 
laurence shtasel the prosecutor in the fernandez case 
an important prosecution is at stake shtasel said joseph 
fernandez is the highestranking cia official ever indicted 
us district court judge claude hilton scheduled another court 
session friday morning giving prosecutors time to propose ways of 
preserving portions of the two obstruction and two false statement 
charges against fernandez 
hilton will decide whether some or all of the criminal charges 
must be dismissed a decision that could be appealed 
fernandezs lawyer thomas wilson said the sword of 
damocles had been hanging over his clients head for three years 
and that hilton should dismiss the case now that the declaration 
has been filed 
shtasel declined to say whether the declaration makes the case 
untriable 
on july 24 the judge said fernandez must be allowed to present 
in his defense details concerning cia programs in costa rica and 
the locations of agency stations in honduras and el salvador as 
well as the location of a third cia latin american facility 
that prompted the justice department to seek to appeal hiltons 
ruling to the us circuit court of appeals in richmond va that 
court said only walshs office had the power to appeal 
prosecutors had proposed referring to the cia facilities by 
number and dropping a portion of one count so the cia projects in 
costa rica wouldnt have to be mentioned but hilton said that 
would not satisfactorily protect fernandezs right to a fair trial 
one of the cia projects thornburgh is protecting involves us 
efforts to improve the effectiveness of costa ricas defense 
forces according to court papers a second involves a 
sophisticated communications station to bolster costa ricas 
security and a third deals with nicaraguan nationals in costa rica 
the last project was designed to enhance costa ricas 
preparation for a possible attack by nicaragua 
one of the charges against fernandez is that he lied when he 
said the construction of an airstrip in costa rica was an 
initiative by that countrys government 
in another irancontrarelated case us district court judge 
harold greene said wednesday that rep lee hamilton dind is 
among the anticipated prosecution witnesses in the trial of former 
national security adviser john poindexter 
greene made the disclosure in an order scheduling a dec 4 
pretrial hearing 
hamilton was chairman of the house intelligence committee during 
the irancontra affair and his testimony at poindexters trial 
scheduled to begin jan 22 could figure in four of the five 
criminal charges in the case 
hamilton made inquiries at the white house in 1986 about 
possible improper activities by north 
poindexter is accused of obstructing congress making false 
statements to hamiltons committee and conspiracy

party leaders the official news agency reported it did not say 
what would become of the sacked party chief anatoly gerasimov

and open 
open accusations of indecisiveness incompetence trying to 
avoid decision of contemporary problems were addressed to many 
party and government leaders tass said

a federal judge wednesday upheld a bankruptcy 
courts 1987 finding that the justice department used fraud and 
deceit to steal software from a computer company 
us district judge william b bryant rejected the justice 
departments appeal of the earlier ruling by thenbankruptcy judge 
george bason jr 
bason had awarded 679 million plus attorneys fees to inslaw 
inc the computer company that has since emerged from bankruptcy 
bryant reduced the award by 655200 but upheld basons finding 
that through trickery fraud and deceit the justice department 
stole enhancements to a wordprocessing system for us attorneys 
offices that were developed by inslaw 
bryant also upheld basons conclusion that the department never 
negotiated in good faith to settle inslaws claims it owned the 
software enhancements 
once the software was in the possession of doj there is no 
evidence that the government ever negotiated in good faith 
bryant wrote 
by failing to acknowledge or accept inslaws claims the 
government continued its fraudulent behavior toward inslaw this 
behavior persisted long after inslaw filed for reorganization 
under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code bryant noted 
justice department spokesman amy brown said agency lawyers were 
studying the opinion 
inslaw accuses the justice department of driving it into 
bankruptcy by allowing the official who oversaw the contact c 
madison brewer to wage a personal vendetta 
bryant upheld basons finding that inslaw was the victim of 
animosity displayed by brewer and other officials of the department 
what is strikingly apparent from the testimony and depositions 
of key witnesses and many documents is that inslaw performed its 
contract in a hostile environment that extended from the higher 
echelons of the justice department to the officials who hasd the 
daytoday responsibility for supervising its work bryant said 
bryant also found the justice department violated the automatic 
stay of bankruptcy proceedings by installing the enhanced computer 
system in 45 us attorneys offices 
bryant also rejected government claims that bason was biased 
against the department because he was not reappointed to another 
term as bankruptcy judge 
but the judge reduced the award by 655200 the amount 
represented 12 percent of the companys license fee that was to 
cover maintenance of the software 
bryant said the justice department should not have to pay for 
services that inslaw did not perform 
nancy hamilton the companys vice president and wife of founder 
william hamilton said the decision means bason has been 
vindicated i think its a little hard to say that two judges are 
biased 
we think right now this decision is pretty important and 
pretty difficult for the justice department to ignore she said 
the company emerged from bankruptcy last year after receiving a 
25 million loan from ibm mrs hamilton said the company will 
continue its lawsuit to obtain punitive damages against the justice 
department

about 1000 people visited a new exhibit on the 
sixth floor of the former texas school book depository on 
wednesday the 26th anniversary of the day that president john f 
kennedy was shot from one of its windows 
across the street at dealey plaza many stopped to read the 
memorial of kennedys assassination and to gaze at the downward 
slope of elm street where the presidents motorcade had passed 
some visitors recalled how the presidents death changed their 
lives 
it was a gray cloud over dallas for such a long time i think 
its an event that needs to be remembered but not dwelled upon 
said ron thompson 34 a lifelong dallas resident who said this was 
his first visit to dealey plaza 
he was in third grade when kennedy died 
it was a strange day i was in school and all of a sudden 
everybody was crying i was real young but still it was something 
else thompson said 
wet weather kept early visitors from dealey plaza but by 
midmorning about 70 tourists and dallas residents had stopped 
we had to stop here said max ooley of borden ind who was 
traveling with his wife to visit their son in san antonio for the 
thanksgiving holiday 
i always wondered about the conspiracy aspect of it he 
said as he looked at the grassy knoll which played a large part 
in the warren commission investigation of kennedys death 
conspiracy theorists believe more than one gunman fired shots 
and that some of the shots came from the knoll the warren 
commission said lee harvey oswald acted alone firing the shots 
from the sixth floor of the depository 
neither the kennedy family nor the city of dallas stages any 
public memorial to the event at the assassination site 
an empty tomb was the citys only kennedy memorial before the 
dallas county historical foundation opened the sixth floor exhibit 
in february five wreaths lay on the tomb wednesday morning 
cosy mclemore spokeswoman for the foundation estimated 1000 
people viewed the new exhibit wednesday 
certainly dallas is linked in the minds of people with three 
things the assassination the cowboys and the tv show bob hays 
interim director of the historical foundation told the dallas

settlement of an illinois legal dispute over 
abortion wednesday eliminated perhaps the greatest immediate threat 
to the supreme courts 1973 decision legalizing abortion 
this is a tremendous political victory for the prochoice 
movement said dawn johnsen legal director of the national 
abortion rights action league its a relief having this case off 
the supreme courts docket 
johnsen said illinois attorney general neil hartigan who helped 
engineer the settlement clearly has reacted to pressure from the 
prochoice majority 
the nations highest court had been scheduled to hear arguments 
in the illinois case dec 5 but the settlement ends the legal 
controversy the formality of seeking a dismissal remains such 
action when requested by both sides in a case is not rare 
the justices will hear arguments next week in a pair of abortion 
cases from minnesota and ohio in those the court must judge the 
validity of state laws requiring doctors to notify the parents of 
young unmarried girls before performing requested abortions 
the courts decisions in both cases expected by july would not 
necessarily involve the core holding of the 1973 decision in roe 
vs wade that women have a constitutional right to abortion 
in that landmark ruling the court said states may not interfere 
with a womans decision to have an abortion during the first three 
months of her pregnancy the court said states may seek to protect 
the womens health during secondtrimester abortions and may seek 
to protect fetal life in rare thirdtrimester abortions 
a more politically conservative court last july gave states 
greater leeway in regulating abortions but its ruling in a 
missouri case did not abolish the trimesterbytrimester structure 
adopted in roe vs wade 
it was that structure criticized in recent years by five of the 
courts nine justices which was threatened in the illinois case 
the key issue was a set of stringent regulations imposed on 
illinois clinics where most earlypregnancy abortions are performed 
a federal judge struck down many of the regulations ruling they 
unnecessarily and unconstitutionally would have forced abortion 
clinics to become the functional equivalent of small hospitals 
for no valid purpose 
the 7th us circuit court of appeals agreed calling many of 
the regulations totally unjustified from a medical standpoint 
had the supreme court allowed such regulations roe vs wades 
ban on state firsttrimester regulation effectively would have been

striking nynex workers signed a tentative 
agreement early wednesday ending a 3month strike that affected 
millions of customers and led to the death of a worker on a picket 
line 
the agreement with the communication workers of america ended a 
season of bargaining that began with a strike the week of aug 6 by 
four regional telephone companies all but nynex had settled by 
september 
cwa workers start voting for ratification next week and should 
be back to work dec 4 
the strike delayed directory assistance repairs and 
installation for nynexs 105 million customers in new york state 
two cities in connecticut rhode island massachusetts new 
hampshire vermont and maine 
it was a long struggle and got very acrimonious and bitter 
said jan pierce the cwa vice president who lead the negotiations 
for the union we had a lot of members that were fired some that 
were hurt one that got killed 
its hard to look at that struggle in victorious terms when we 
paid such a price he added but it was a victory for the cwa 
and every worker in america who works for a company that has a 
companypaid insurance plan 
under the agreement the company will continue paying for health 
costs proposals for lumpsum bonuses and profit sharing were 
dropped wage increases will be 3 percent the first year and 15 
percent the second and third years with cost of living increases 
added the second and third years 
even in the announcement of the settlement there was discord 
the cwa announced early wednesday that an agreement had been 
signed however nynex disputed that not until 730 am did both 
sides agree that they had signed a tentative deal 
a sticking point was how to treat workers suspended or fired 
during the strike for alleged offenses ranging from verbally 
harassing management workers to physically assaulting them and 
damaging their cars 
bob master a cwa spokesman said that the disciplined workers 
would have the right to go through a grievance procedure including 
a review by a joint unionmanagement panel and arbitration he said 
about 75 workers were fired and 80 suspended during the strike 
one striker died after a confrontation aug 15 at a nynex office 
at valhalla in westchester county police said the man jumped onto 
the hood of a nonstriking workers car crossing a picket line 
then fell off and struck his head the union claimed the driver 
struck the striking worker 
two small groups remain on strike dissatisfied with the wage 
hike 59 cwa workers at nynex materiel enterprises in 
massachusetts a centralized purchasing agent for nynex and 84 
workers at nynex information resources a yellow pages publisher in 
new york city 
we hope to clear up the issues separating us before the dec 
4 backtowork date pierce said 
the cwas 40000 members at nynex subsidiary new york telephone 
and 20000 members of the international brotherhood of electrical 
workers at new england telephone struck nynex on aug 6 
the strike centered on the company proposal to shift some of the 
costs of health care to union workers from weekly premiums to 
yearly deductibles of up to 1500 a year for families 
talks were sporadic and mediators had to be called in 
the ibew reached an agreement late friday and its workers 
returned to work monday with the blessing of cwa officials but 
the cwa talks broke down early saturday resumed informally monday 
and concluded with the tentative deal wednesday 
nynex reported more than 500 acts of vandalism and offered 
100000 for information on the alleged sabotage two weeks ago 
some 361000 customers were temporarily without service in 
southeastern new yorks ulster orange sullivan and dutchess 
counties

the bodies of two texas boys allegedly 
kidnapped and killed by their father were flown home wednesday and 
maine authorities disputed allegations that they could have done 
more to prevent the deaths 
state police refused to say what they found in the lake cottage 
where roy irwin abbott sr was believed to have stayed with his 
young sons shortly before shooting them to death on a dirt road 
monday 
abbott 52 apparently used the cottage without the permission 
of its owner his brother benjamin abbott of portsmouth nh 
it is very unlikely were going to be describing what if 
anything we found said stephen mccausland spokesman for the 
maine department of public safety 
the bodies of roy irwin abbott jr 6 and ronney abbott 4 
were put on a flight wednesday to texas where services are planned 
saturday in denton county said john black a funeral home manager 
in nearby springvale 
autopsies showed the boys died of multiple wounds from a shotgun 
fired at close range maine authorites identified the younger boy 
as ronney but texas authorities said his name was rooney 
according to court papers abbott walked into a sheriffs office 
monday and said i need to see a police officer ive killed my 
kids he was arraigned tuesday made no plea and was held for a 
nov 29 bail hearing 
authorities in maine and texas said that abbott took his sons on 
sept 1 the day his divorce became final from maria louisa abbott 
saying he would return them after the weekend 
in shapleigh where the lake cottage is located some residents 
have said that the sheriffs office apparently did not pursue the 
case vigorously enough to stop the killings 
he made no secret of the fact he had fled texas with the 
children and he was hiding from his wife said store owner 
barbara belanger 
authorities had known since midoctober that abbott may have 
brought his sons to maine state police sgt michael harriman said 
tuesday 
officers looked for him in eliot his hometown augusta 
kittery and portsmouth nh where his brother lives harriman 
said 
each time we checked these locations there was another move 
on his part indicating he was aware he was being hunted 
harriman said after abbotts arraignment 
york county sheriff c wesley phinney jr said wednesday that 
the complaints about his department were just simply not 
accurate 
after deputies learned abbott had talked of kidnapping the boys 
they traced his cars license plate back to texas where it was 
registered to someone else and had been on a car sold to a junk 
dealer phinney said 
even though that car was different from the car abbott was 
driving the sheriff said deputies turned up nothing to lead them 
to abbott 
denton police told york county authorities that the person who 
originally got the license was not involved in any kidnapping and 
phinneys department closed its case on that complaint the sheriff 
said

more than a dozen journalists have been killed 
or injured in recent months in the upheaval in eastern europe and 
fighting in latin america monitors say 
in el salvador david blundy reporter for the sunday 
correspondent in london was killed last week covering the civil 
war and another briton was wounded this week 
in czechoslovakia police and security forces beat up at least 
five american one dutch and two british journalists and destroyed 
or confiscated their equipment during proreform demonstrations 
this past weekend according to preliminary counts by western 
groups that monitor such activity 
in peru american reporter todd smith of the tampa tribune in 
florida was found dead five days after he disappeared while 
investigating drug traffickers 
at least five colombian reporters have died since the bogota 
daily el espectator was bombed sept 2 one of the highest tallies 
in that south american countrys war on drugs according to sally 
chew an editor at the new yorkbased committee to protect 
journalists 
the newspaper is one of several in colombia that have carried 
out campaigns against drug trafficking 
aside from china in june in the last two months weve had 
more cases than the rest of the year ms chew said it may 
drop but now its very high 
governments even hardline ones sometimes respond to public 
pressure but against rebels and drug traffickers theres 
nothing you can do to protect yourself ms chew said these 
stories need to be covered all we can do is insist on a certain 
amount of respect for journalists 
leonard sussman an expert on press freedoms at the new 
yorkbased human rights organization freedom house said 60 
journalists worldwide have been killed in 1989 compared with 46 
last year 32 in 1987 and 19 in 1986 
one can make a very rough estimate that what were seeing now 
is the loosening of government oppression in places which means 
that there is dissent in some places for the first time sussman 
said when one has the fresh flavor of dissent people including 
governments dont know how to handle it and violence comes into 
play 
sussman said reporting of attacks on journalists is better in 
recent years but theres no escaping the fact that violence is 
on the increase the ultimate answer is to democratize the 
societies so that it doesnt happen

protest leaders vowed wednesday to 
go ahead with a general strike amid signs of growing worker 
support and 200000 people in wenceslas square chanted the name of 
alexander dubcek the ousted leader of the failed prague spring 
reforms 
the demonstrators who rallied for a sixth straight day roared 
their approval when a message was read from dubcek the communist 
leader whose reforms were crushed by a sovietled warsaw pact 
invasion in 1968 
they also cheered banned playwright vaclav havel who said the 
hardline leaders are now afraid of us 
dubcek a 68yearold pensioner living in bratislava said in 
his message that he vehemently backed demands for the resignation 
of president gustav husak who succeeded him as communist leader in 
1969 and current party chief milos jakes responsible for purging 
dubcek and a halfmillion other communists 
as the crowd chanted dubcek dubcek dissident venek silhan 
announced that the once popular leader hoped to address the crowd 
in the nearest future 
in bratislava capital of slovakia about 15000 protesters 
demanded free elections and shouted long live dubcek outside 
the palace of justice trial of prominent dissident jan carnogursky 
earlier wednesday dubcek briefly addressed a crowd of a few 
thousand people after attending the morning court session 
witnesses said dubcek told the demonstrators to maintain calm 
and order he agreed with them that the sedition and subversion 
charges against carnogursky were unfair 
staterun tv for the first time in years showed dubcek briefly 
as he attended the trial 
the state news agency ctk reported that the politburo met and 
decided to call a meeting of the partys central committee on 
friday apparently in response to the unprecedented rallies that 
show no signs of abating 
elsewhere in czechsolovakia 80000 students and intellectuals 
staged sitin strikes and vowed to go ahead with a general strike 
planned for monday they claimed growing worker support 
workers interviewed at pragues giant ckd works where at least 
1400 voted to back the twohour work stoppage said units of the 
peoples militia the communist paramilitary police were guarding 
gates at their plant 
havel czechoslovakias most prominent dissident joyously 
greeted the crowd in wenceslas square and said that after 20 
years of timelessness history is coming back to this country 
those who have for long years made bloody vengeance to those 
who opposed them are now afraid of us havel said 
viewers were able for the first time to watch live clips from 
the square on state tv but the broadcast was abruptly halted after 
a worker interviewed by a reporter on the square accused the 
government of lying 
what is the government afraid of they may be afraid because 
they are lying to us for 20 years said the worker identified as 
honza lexa 
an announcer appeared to say the broadcast was temporarily 
halted because some unidentified television workers disagreed with 
it clips from the square resumed 35 minutes later 
the incident reflected the smoldering emotions touched off 
around the country by the protests the biggest challenge to the 
hardline government since 1968 
the communist party apparently anxious to stem the wave of 
protest triggered by police brutality against student 
demonstrators has held meetings with influential voices who have 
supported the prodemocracy movement 
demonstrators have claimed that a mathematics student was killed 
by police during a rally nov 17 the government denies it 
jakes and his ally prague party chief miroslav stepan strongly 
attacked the organizers of the rallies as antisocialist 
but stepan held a surprise meeting wednesday with the 
influential head of the roman catholic church cardinal frantisek 
tomasek who issued a statement tuesday strongly backing the 
demonstrators in another first state tv showed excerpts of that 
meeting as well 
premier ladislav adamec who broke with years of policy tuesday 
by receiving a delegation that included prominent dissidents met 
the head of the writers union miroslav valek according to ctk 
one of the strongest sources of support for the striking 
students has been the intelligentsia actors in dozens of theaters 
have been on strike since the weekend turning their stages into 
political debating clubs thousands of artists have joined them 
ctk carried an interview with dissident jan ruml one of four 
members of the new opposition group civic forum who met adamec 
tuesday 
ruml was quoted as stressing that the meeting with adamec did 
not mark the start of a governmentopposition dialogue and that 
civic forum would persist in backing the nov 27 strike and calling 
for the resignation of jakes and other top communists

botanist linda leigh who has spent the 
last three weeks literally in her element called her stay in an 
experimental biosphere a success wednesday but said shes ready to 
return to earth 
when ms leigh exits thanksgiving afternoon from 21 days inside 
an airtight 17000cubic foot glassandsteel structure she will 
have been the longest inhabitant of a completely enclosed 
ecosystem with air and water generated and recycled independently 
of earths 
ill be emerging tomorrow at 2 pm as scheduled and 
everything is rolling she said 
ms leigh has been living inside a test module for biosphere ii 
a 30 million project under construction scientists plan to place 
four men and four women inside a much larger sealed structure for 
two years to determine whether humans can duplicate earths life 
systems for possible use in space 
the one thing that i really do miss is just companionship 
ms leigh said wednesday in a telephone interview from within the 
module located on a ranch about 30 miles north of tucson 
i dont think that its a matter of feeling lonely but 
theres just something about direct human contact and sitting with 
somebody and pouring them a cup of tea or a cup of coffee and 
having that morning discussion its very different than doing it 
over the phone or over the video she said 
other than that im quite content on the inside i feel like 
i could stay in here indefinitely 
since entering the module nov 2 ms leigh has been in frequent 
daily contact with her outside support team by telephone video 
conference twoway radio and just looking through the glass 
windows 
three daily medical checks including pulse at rest and after 
exercise blood pressure pulmonary function blood oxygen 
saturation and urine tests have shown her health is unbelievably 
positive the physicians on the outside cant believe it she 
said 
two people also check her psychologically each day ms leigh 
said just to make sure that my state of mind or humor is 
normal 
ms leigh baked herself a 39th birthday cake on nov 12 of 
sorghum rice flour and sweet potatoes harvested from her 
minifield her colleagues serenaded her with happy birthday by 
video and directed her to gifts hidden in her living area 
other crops have ranged from jalapeno peppers to kohlrabi lemon 
grass mint tarragon and fennel are among the herbs she has used 
to season her meals and make tea she also has a tank of talapia 
fish 
i had talapia vera cruzana the other night she said 
water for drinking cooking and showering is dehumidified from 
the air samples are passed through a special port for outside 
analysis along with samples of waste water and her urine the rest 
of the waste water is fed into a marsh recycling system 
the botanist also has had to be a mechanic and technician 
repairing the loose belt of a large fan that heats and cools the 
module and finetuning the irrigation system 
ms leigh said she hasnt felt isolated because her support team 
is excellent in fact she occasionally has had to pull the 
curtains in her living area to get away from the observing eyes 
outside either that or i go out into what we call the 
wilderness and just stay out within the plants

a police officer apologized to 
the families of two 13yearold immigrants killed by a blast from 
his shotgun but said the shooting was justified because he thought 
the boys were armed 
i am the father of three sons and a daughter i feel a great 
loss and a deep grief kenneth murphy wrote in a letter to the 
families of thai yang and ba see lor both hmong immigrants from 
southeast asia 
i only hope you can accept my sincere apologies and 
sympathies in my 21 years as a police officer i had hoped that i 
would never face this type of situation he wrote according to a 
copy of the letter released by his lawyer tuesday 
the boys both of st paul were shot in the back from about 30 
yards away while fleeing through a field in suburban inver grove 
heights last week after abandoning a stolen car following a 
highspeed chase investigators said 
the state bureau of criminal apprehension is investigating the 
shooting and two special prosecutors have been appointed to take 
the case to a dakota county grand jury next month 
murphy 54 has been placed on paid administrative leave from 
the inver grove heights force 
in his first public comments on the shooting murphy said in 
interviews tuesday that he feared for his life when he saw what he 
thought was a gun the object turned out to be a screwdriver 
i felt there was a weapon involved knowing their behavior and 
what they had done murphy said his eyes tearing and voice 
choking as he referred to the alleged car theft and police chase 
the first thing i thought of was a silver or chrome barrel of 
a pistol 
murphy said he fired at yang not realizing that lor was nearby 
when medical help arrived murphy said he noticed an 8 to 
10inchlong screwdriver on the ground and realized he had mistaken 
the gleam of tools shaft for a gun 
accompanied to one interview by three of his grown children and 
his lawyer murphy said he didnt know the two victims were so 
young until one of his sons told him almost nine hours after the 
shooting 
its bad enough that it was anybody but especially 
13yearolds he said 
lor and yang both born in refugee camps in thailand after their 
families fled their homes in laos were buried several feet away 
from each other sunday in st pauls oakland cemetery 
minnesota has the largest hmong community in the country after 
california and members of the community have alleged that the 
shooting was racially motivated but murphy and his attorney paul 
rogosheske said race had nothing to do with it 
we do realize how difficult it is to move and start a new 
life murphy said in his letter my wife also was an immigrant 
to this country she feels your anguish as only a mother can and 
i as only a father can 
murphys wife is a native of yugoslavia

in the 1940s west berlin remained free because harry truman 
said hands off in the 1950s ike backed americas words with 
muscle in the 1960s west berliners took heart when john f 
kennedy said i am a berliner in the 1970s presidents nixon ford 
and carter stood with berlin by standing with nato and in the 
1980s ronald reagan went to berlin to say tear down this wall 
now we are at the threshold of the 1990s and as we begin the 
new decade i am reaching out to president gorbachev asking him to 
work with me to bring down the last barriers to a new world of 
freedom let us move beyond containment and once and for all end 
cold war 
we can make such a bold bid because america is strong and 40 
years of perseverance and patience are finally paying off more 
recently quiet diplomacy working behind the scenes has achieved 
results we can now dare to imagine a new world with a new europe 
rising on the foundations of democracy 
this new world was taking shape when my presidency began with 
these words the day of the dictator is over during the spring 
and summer we told the people of the world what america believes 
and what america wants for the future america believes that 
liberty is an idea whose time has come in eastern europe 
america wants president gorbachevs reforms known as perestroika 
to succeed and america wants the soviets to join us in moving 
beyond containment to a new partnership some wondered if all 
this was realistic now though we are still on the course set last 
spring events are moving faster than anyone imagined or predicted 
look around the world in the developing nations the people 
are demanding freedom poland and hungary are now fledgling 
democraties a noncommunist government in poland and free 
elections coming soon in hungary and in the soviet union itself 
the forces of reform under mikhail gorbachev are bringing 
unprecedented openness and change 
but nowhere in the world today or even in the history of man 
have the warm hearts of men and women triumphed so swiftly so 
certainly over cold stone as in berlin indeed in all of east 
germany if i may paraphrase the words of a great poet robert 
frost there is certainly something in us that doesnt love a wall 
when i spoke to the german people in mainz last may i applauded 
the removal of the barriers between hungary and austria saying 
let berlin be next and the west german people joined us in a 
call for a europe whole and free 
just yesterday the west german foreign minister gave me a piece 
of the berlin wall it is on my desk as a reminder of the power of 
freedom to bring down the walls between people 
it brought back memories of seven years ago when i went to 
modlareuth a small town in germany also known as little berlin a 
divided village really its cobbled streets blocked by barbed wire 
and concrete on the one side freedom on the other despair i 
talked with the townspeople not a hundred and fifty yards from the 
specter of armed guards in towers some day id like to go back to 
little berlin and see families reunited see neighbors once apart 
coming together

change is coming swiftly and with this change the dramatic 
vindication of free europes economic and political institutions 
the new europe that is coming is being built must be built on 
the foundation of democratic values but the faster the pace the 
smoother our path must be after all this is serious business 
the peace we are building must be different than the hard 
joyless peace between two armed camps weve known so long the 
scars of the conflict that began a halfcentury ago still divide a 
continent so the historic task before us now is to begin the 
healing of this old wound 
during our visit to poland and hungary last july i found new 
encouragement that we were on track and that there was at long 
last the chance for fundamental change i saw firsthand acts of 
healing and reconciliation it was in warsaw at my lunch for 
general jaruzelski and the leaders of solidarity that i met a woman 
who had worked at great personal risk for the release of jailed 
solidarity members she was asked how is it possible after such 
a short time to break bread with the men who ordered those 
imprisonments why the absence of bitterness and she replied 
our joy at what is happening now is more powerful than memory 
i wish you could have been there for what we witnessed was 
extraordinary the old antagonisms melted away as former 
adversaries stood up often with tears in their eyes and toasted 
the future our guests knew that history would judge them by how 
well they would cooperate well there is a spirit of cooperation 
in eastern europe the result poland and hungary are being 
transformed 
they deserve our support and theyre getting it we have 
matched our words with action new loans and grants teams of 
american economic experts working to help them adjust to a free 
market economy clearing the way for us investment and trade 
with poland and hungary now the peoples of these nations can 
finally expect their hard work to lead to a better life 
these same winds of change are sweeping our own hemisphere 
democracy transforming the americas with stunning speed 
regrettably there are some exceptions panama nicaragua and 
cuba and these last two are holding out against their people only 
because of the massive support of weapons and supplies from their 
communist allies so when i see president gorbachev ill ask him 
to join with us to help bring freedom and democracy to all the 
people of latin america 
so as we celebrate the events of eastern europe remember that 
some walls still remain between east and west these are the 
invisible walls of suspicion the walls of doubt misunderstanding 
and miscalculation 
it was while in eastern europe last summer that i decided to 
make a personal effort to break through these last barriers 
back in may i set down five steps president gorbachev should 
meet if we are to take his new thinking seriously first reduce 
soviet forces second support selfdetermination in eastern 
europe third work with us to end regional disputes fourth 
achieve a lasting pluralism and respect for human rights and 
fifth join with us in addressing global problems including the 
international drug menace and dangers to the environment serious 
problems still remain especially regional conflicts the soviet 
union has made progress in these five areas that is undeniable

with that in mind and the momentous changes in eastern europe i 
invited president gorbachev to meet me 10 days from now this is a 
first meeting a time for exploration it is not a time for 
detailed arms control negotiations best left for next years summit 
i want president gorbachev to know exactly where the united 
states stands let me be clear america stands with freedom and 
democracy we are not meeting to determine the future of europe 
after all the peoples of europe are determining their own future 
though there will be no surprises sprung on our allies we will 
miss no opportunity to expand freedom and enhance the peace 
and to those who question our prudent pace they must understand 
that a time of historic change is no time for recklessness the 
peace and the confidence and the security of our friends in 
europe its just too important 
we will seek president gorbachevs assurance that this process 
of reform in eastern europe will continue and we will give him our 
assurance that america welcomes reform not as an adversary seeking 
advantage but as a people offering support 
our goal is to see this historic tide of freedom broadened 
deepened and sustained 
we find enormous encouragement in its peaceful advance and its 
acceptance by the soviet union we can now raise our hopes on other 
issues our common environment our common war against drugs as 
well as on human rights and the regional conflicts that remain 
immediately after my visit with president gorbachev i will go 
to brussels to consult with our partners in nato the very 
alliance that has kept the west free for 40 years i will assure 
them that no matter how dramatic the change in eastern europe or 
in the soviet union itself the united states will continue to 
stand with our allies and our friends 
for in a new europe the american role may change in form but 
not in fundamentals after all the soviet union maintains hundreds 
of thousands of troops throughout eastern europe 
study the map review history and youll see that this presence 
with the soviet unions natural advantage of geography cannot be 
ignored 
so even if forces are significantly reduced on both sides a 
noble goal indeed we will remain in europe as long as our friends 
want and need us

off the island nation of malta mikhail gorbachev and i will 
begin the work of years we can help the peoples of europe achieve 
a new destiny in a peaceful europe whole and free i will tell 
president gorbachev the dynamic architect of soviet reform that 
america wants the people of the soviet union to fulfill their 
destiny and i will assure him that there is no greater advocate of 
perestroika than the president of the united states 
when we meet we will be on ships at anchor in a mediterranean 
bay that has served as a sea lane of commerce and conflict for more 
than two thousand years this ancient port has been conquered by 
caesar and sultan crusader and king its forts and watchtowers 
survey a sea that entombs the scuttled ships of empires lost 
slave galleys galleons dreadnoughts destroyers these ships 
once meant to guard lasting empires now litter the ocean floor 
and guard nothing more than reefs of coral 
so if the millennia offer us a lesson perhaps it is this true 
security does not come from empire and domination true security 
can only be found in the growing trust of free peoples 
it has been said that peace is not the work of a single day nor 
will it be the consequence of a single act yet every constructive 
act contributes to its growth every omission impedes it peace 
will come in the end as a child grows to maturity slowly until 
we realize one day in incredulous surprise that the child is almost 
grown 
it is our hope that malta will be such a constructive act 
guiding brave pilgrims on their journey to a new world of freedom

q there were pockets of marines who were actually in the hotel 
also at the same time that the hostages who were actually 
barricaded and had weapons and were safe yesterday were they 
involved at all in helping this morning 
bush helping what 
q helping this operation the marines who were barricaded 
bush i dont know yet i dont know yet 
q do we have any intelligence available as to why this 
offensive by the fmln occurred when it did 
bush desperation but i havent seen more than that i mean 
they see the tide moving against them they see the embarrassment 
that ortega went through when the arms coming through salvador were 
exposed publicly and they saw how he was almost i mean not 
ortega yeah ortega almost isolated from the other democracies 
and i think they see that their cause has very little following as 
the world moves away from marxism that they that they have as 
their creed and so i think theres a certain desperation on 
their part 
q so you think theyre concerned about inaudible east 
germany and other eastern bloc nations 
bush well i dont know but i would think so i would think 
theyd be concerned about a lot of things 
q are you saying that back on the cristianis troops moving 
in on the churches are you saying that they were justified they 
have been justified 
bush im not justifying it at all ive told you what i think 
q you made it sort of hypothetical you said if if 
theyre harboring fugitives then thats okay to move in on them 
but otherwise you would condemn it im wondering what your 
assessment is of whats been going on in this case 
bush i cant assess it for you because i dont know about all 
i dont know about the cases youre talking about i just gave you 
a broad parameter of inaudible 
q mr president if we could switch to eastern europe for a 
moment things look like theyre loosening up now in 
czechoslovakia what are your feelings or emotions about that 
bush well do you want me to be more emotional on it than i was 
about east germany is that the case 
q well have to listen to your piece tonight 
bush yeah listen tune in up there tune in and i think now 
people understand why i didnt go rushing off to the wall in 
berlin i think theres worldwide understanding about that 
q off mike 
bush maybe one or two in this country that dont understand it 
but those who are involved in all of this seem to understand it 
very clearly 
q on this trip today critics like jesse jackson say this is 
nothing but public relations the thousand points of light is 
just a pr gimmick to tell the american people that you dont want 
to put federal increase federal spending for social programs 
what is your response 
bush well id i dont want to respond to your question 
because i havent heard jesse jackson say that 
q youll read his comments 
bush well when i get there but let me put it in a more 
positive note whats happening in terms of the concept of a 
thousand points of light is very very exciting and its in 
keeping with our great american tradition of one american helping 
another and when you see what this one newspaper is being able to 
do to by encouraging individuals to help others it is staggering 
it is monumental and it is terribly exciting and people helping 
people and the volunteer sector can do so many more things in 
totality than the federal government can do so if he doesnt 
understand that i need to sit down with him and try to make him 
understand how beautiful it is and how much good is being done and 
thats what this is all about 
so i cant im not going to take on jesse its the day 
before thanksgiving i mean ive got a lot of things to be 
thankful for 
q off mike 
bush what no i wont take him on i mean hes out there 
let him do his thing the american people understand this and its 
beginning to be much clearer to them its a wonderful concept 
q its another way of saying read my lips no taxes 
bush absolutely not was that his allegation 
q well thats what some the democrats are saying 
bush oh well 
q could we could we have one on congress here 
bush its thanksgiving 
q over the months youve had inaudible rhetoric with 
congress saying you know a lot of partisanship and now that is 
all is said and done you seem to be inaudible do you plan to 
make more conciliatory comments 
bush im a dealer its the day before thanksgiving i have a 
lot to be thankful for one is that there was a reconciliation 
bill one is that there was some progress and two is that theyre 
leaving town so weve got a lot to be grateful for and this is no 
time to pick fights you guys want to push me into these fights 
and ill get into them once in a while but i want to continue to 
extend a bipartisan hand get out there and try to solve some 
problems here and i think we have solved some im glad we moved 
on an ethics package i wish wed moved on an environmental 
package im glad we got a reconciliation bill i wish wed moved 
on my antidruganticrime proposal 
so we get some we give a little here and compromise and im 
in a spirit of goodwill today the day before thanksgiving but 
youre right there will be some fights down the line but 
fortunately now with congress out of town we can focus on the 
upcoming meetings with mr gorbachev and we can get wrestling with 
our very difficult budget problems which are facilitated i might 
add by the bipartisan effort on reconciliation theyre not 
solved but theyre facilitated so i have a lot to be thankful

q when are you signing it 
bush aside to staff when are we signing i dont know i 
thought maybe i had laughs as soon as it appears 
staff i dont think weve received the package yet 
bush when the carrier pigeon comes alongside bring him in i 
want to get that 
q the summits 10 days away sir are you a bit more confident 
that you can sort of set the atmosphere you want to inaudible 
and how are you going to do it 
bush yes yes do what keep on doing what were doing boy 
scout motto be prepared yes theyre going theyre going on 
yes 
well have a visit with margaret thatcher on friday ill be on 
the phone to some more european leaders and maybe leaders in our 
hemisphere because i dont want to send a sign to the western 
hemisphere that because of this malta meeting we are losing 
interest in the problems here and that im not interested in their 
opinion as to what goes on in eastern europe or what might be on 
the minds of the soviet leaders 
mulroneyll be weighing in hes had a good meeting with mr 
gorbachev so ive got a lot of homework to do were getting good 
advice from outsiders people not in the government were dealing 
im dealing with some at what i would call the expert level a 
little below cabinet level in our government and thats a good 
thing to do because weve got some wonderful people in our career 
services intelligence foreign service that are very 
knowledgeable and ive got a lot of preparation to do but i look 
forward to the meeting with mr gorbachev were going in in a 
spirit of total goodwill we are not going to blindside our allies 
and itll be a good meeting 
q inaudible 
bush not at not yalta that is correct we are not trying to 
divvy up anything or decide the fate of any sovereign nation that 
is not what we will do we have large partners in nato we have 
small partners we have countries in europe that are not in nato 
and it would be presumptuous and arrogant for the president of the 
united states superpower though we may be to try to decide the 
future of europe in a way that would impinge on the sovereignty of 
any country east or west and that is not what were going to be 
and im sure from various ways i am certain that president 
gorbachev understands that 
this is going to be a good meeting and you know i think given 
the even though this the genesis for this meeting was several 
months ago the rapidity of change in eastern europe might have 
dictated that such a meeting be held even if we hadnt planned it 
so when i said in that david frost interview that some of them 
some of us missed the nuances of it three times that the wall 
would come down i did not have that in mind when we set this 
meeting two months before that but i would like people to note 
that i felt that way and sure enough it is happening faster 
than many of us might have thought but we dont want to miss an 
opportunity were not going to miss an opportunity 
you know thanksgiving is the time to count blessings some of 
you know that part of mine are our 11 grandchildren and i like to 
put this meeting now at least at this time of year in the context 
of how will this these discussions and then what we do later on 
affect the lives of our family and of all the other families that 
are going to be praying together and celebrating together tomorrow 
at thanksgiving and this kind of meeting where you eliminate 
misunderstanding and look down the road a decade or so can be 
extraordinarily helpful in guaranteeing a peaceful future for kids 
all over including the soviet union so its im thinking of it 
rather philosophically now with thanksgiving tomorrow 
q inaudible decisions on the military inaudible 
bush no because you see were part of an alliance and a 
decision to do something of that nature has got to be a collective 
decision and ive always felt that way and you know hell 
understand that i mean that doesnt mean you cant philosophize 
but there would be the inhibition and the inhibition is were part 
of an alliance and what the french think the brits think the 
germans think and the danes belgians everybody involved is 
very important to me so we wouldnt we arent going to be 
dealing out cards that affect somebody else commit somebody else 
to something we cant do that 
lest i not have another opportunity i hope all of you have a 
very happy thanksgiving too thank you 
q thank you

bulgarias communist leadership set up a 
commission wednesday to investigate corruption under ousted leader 
todor zhivkov and fired his son vladimir as head of a party 
department the state news agency bta said 
the communist partys ruling politburo also decided at its 
meeting in sofia to turn over to the public official residences and 
hunting retreats used mostly by zhivkov and his guests 
for the first time the council of ministers appointed a 
government spokesman filip bokov 41 an englishspeaking foreign 
ministry official trained in moscow 
vladimir zhivkov lost his job at the central committees culture 
department 1 weeks after his father was toppled as party chief and 
state president on nov 10 
after his fathers departure the younger zhivkov denounced by 
some bulgarians as having an excessive life style seemed certain 
to lose his post 
todor zhivkov who held power for 35 years has since been 
accused of living in luxury at the peoples expense at recent 
rallies sanctioned by authorities protesters demanded he be tried 
in court 
according to bta the politburo also decided to convene the 
policysetting central committee on dec 11 to discuss the economic 
and social crisis and other issues 
the politburo set up a special 11member state and party 
commission to consider what bta called some urgent problems 
related to distortions in social and economic life 
its chairman will be former foreign trade minister andrei 
lukanov who was elevated to the politburo and became a central 
committee secretary in a reshuffle soon after zhivkovs fall 
the panel also includes the chief prosecutor and the chairman of 
the supreme court making it likely the commission will prepare 
cases for prosecution in court 
bta said 13 plush official residences were turned over to 
charitable student and tourist groups including one at pravets 
zhivkovs hometown 
six hunting retreats used by zhivkov and his entourage will be 
made available to the ministry of agriculture and to a tourism 
organization promoting international hunting bta said 
the agency said most of any tourism revenue gained this way will 
go to national medical care needs

crews of the sr71 
blackbirds bade farewell wednesday to their spy jets shot down by 
budget cuts after dodging attackers at the edge of space for 24 
years by flying faster than a speeding bullet 
it feels like a death in the family maj don watkins an 
sr71 pilot said after a news conference announcing that tuesday 
marked the final operation of the highestflying and fastest 
airplane which can photograph a license plate from more than 15 
miles up 
col james savarda commander of the 9th strategic 
reconnaissance wing said the emotional end to an era in aviation 
history came when president bush signed a budget measure deleting 
more than 200 million for the sr71 the nations original stealth 
aircraft 
savarda would not rule out that the decision could leave a gap 
in the nations spying capabilities during some future crisis but 
he said budget cuts have forced the military to rely solely on 
satellite surveillance and the much slower and lowerflying u2 spy 
plane 
critics of the sr71 including top defense department and air 
force officials have said satellites provide adequate spying 
capabilities 
defenders of the blackbird including the state department and 
cia contend that satellites risk being shot down and are not as 
versatile as the plane which has overflown crisis flashpoints 
since its introduction in january 1966 
nearly three decades after the first sr71 prototypes were built 
by lockheed the twinengine planes based at beale air force base 
110 miles northeast of san francisco still hold world records for 
speed and altitude 
the blackbird also has fascinated air show audiences its dagger 
shape black and sinister resembles a starship out of the movies 
its unusual form has been used on the cover of numerous aviation 
books 
the sr71s top capabilities remain secret but the air force 
says it flies higher than 85000 feet at more than 2100 mph or 
over three times the speed of sound thats roughly 33 miles a 
minute faster than a bullet fast enough to streak from san 
francisco to new york in 1 hour 45 minutes 
its pilots and navigators wear spacesuits they say they have 
been attacked numerous times by ground and air missiles but the 
plane can easily outrace enemy missiles and fighters in fact the 
blackbirds do not even return fire they are unarmed 
the plane was the first to employ the stealth or radarevading 
technology that is the hallmark of the nations newest military 
aircraft 
there are reportedly only nine of the 30 original sr71s still 
in operation some have crashed others simply have worn out 
blackbirds at forward fields in mildenhall england and kadena 
air base in okinawa japan will be flown to beale they eventually 
may be sent to museums base officials said

a longshoreman testified he saw a policeman squat 
by his parked car aim his gun and kill a black motorcyclist as the 
prosecution concluded its case wednesday into two deaths that 
sparked rioting in january 
the state presented 27 witnesses over six days in its effort to 
prove that colombianborn officer william lozano 31 was guilty of 
manslaughter in the slayings of clement lloyd 23 and his 
passenger allan blanchard 24 who died of injuries suffered when 
the motorcycle crashed after the shooting 
the jan 16 shooting in the predominantly black neighborhood of 
overtown triggered three days of rioting that left one looter shot 
dead 11 people injured by gunfire and 13 buildings burned down 
longshoreman lonnie vickers said he was standing outside a bar 
when he first heard and then saw the motorcycle being pursued by a 
squad car in the opposite traffic lane vickers said lozano was 
standing by the rear of his parked patrol car 
as the motorcycle approached he just got down and pointed his 
gun vickers said he followed the motorcycle right around and 
bam he just shot 
under crossexamination by defense attorney roy black vickers 
insisted that the motorcycle which he estimated was going 40 to 50 
mph was already on its way past lozano when the officer fired 
vickers also maintained that lozano remained right beside his 
parked car in the opposite lane that is a crucial point for the 
defense which claims the motorcycle was barreling down on lozano 
in the same lane when he shot in selfdefense 
previous witnesses said the officer took several steps out into 
the street before pulling his gun 
unlike the previous eyewitnesses vickers was not a resident of 
a nearby apartment building and did not know the residents the 
defense claims that the other prosecution witnesses all of whom 
are black met during the riot and changed their stories to 
implicate lozano 
hilda mcphee a resident of the adjacent apartment building 
testified that she saw the motorcycle just as it reached the 
squatting officer 
after the motorcycle got in my view i heard a pow she 
said adding that the motorcycle remained in the lane opposite from 
lozano and that the officer was never in danger 
under crossexamination however she said the shot came just 
after the motorcycle passed lozano that would clash with 
prosecution evidence indicating that lloyd was shot from in front 
also testifying was maj mike gonzalez homicide investigation 
director for the miami police department who talked to lozano 
about an hour after the shooting 
he quoted the officer as saying i went out in the street he 
was coming right at me 
lozano then told him he did not know if he had hit lloyd 
gonzalez said 
it didnt seem like it he didnt act like it gonzalez 
said lozano told him 
prosecutors say that shows lloyd continued in a straight line 
and therefore was never headed directly at the policeman 
the defense which will open its testimony on friday has not 
said whether lozano will take the stand in his own behalf nor how 
long their presentation will take

here is the text of president bushs 
thanksgiving address to the nation 
good evening like many of you im spending tomorrow with 
family well say grace carve the turkey and thank god for our 
many blessings and for our great country 
this holiday also marks the adjournment of congress and ive 
worked with congress extending my hand across the party aisle 
advancing legislation to free our streets of the fear of crime and 
drugs we proposed ways to clean the air the water and the land 
around us and weve joined with the nations governors to enter an 
historic compact to better our schools and especially touching is 
that so many americans have answered the call for community 
service the thousand points of light by rolling up their sleeves 
and pitching in for the hopeless the helpless each volunteer a 
beacon of light for someone who has lost his way 
and this will be a very special thanksgiving it marks an 
extraordinary year but before our families sit down tomorrow we 
will give thanks for yet another reason around the world tonight 
new pilgrims are on a voyage to freedom and for many its not a 
trip to some faraway place but to a world of their own making 
on other thanksgivings the world was haunted by the images of 
watchtowers guard dogs and machine guns in fact many of you had 
not even been born when the berlin wall was erected in 1961 but 
now te world has a new image reflecting a new reality that of 
germans east and west pulling each other to the top of the wall 
a human bridge between nations entire peoples all across eastern 
europe bravely taking to the streets demanding liberty talking 
democracy this is not the end of the book of history but it is a 
joyful end to one of historys saddest chapters 
not long after the wall began to open west german chancellor 
kohl telephoned and he asked me to give you the american people 
a message of thanks he said that the remarkable change in eastern 
europe would not be taking place without the steadfast support of 
the united states fitting praise from a good friend for 40 years 
we have not wavered in our commitment to freedom we are grateful 
to our american men and women in uniform we should also be 
grateful to our postwar leaders you see we helped rebuild a 
continent through the marshall plan and we built a shield nato 
behind which americans europeans could forge a future in freedom 
for so many of these 40 years the test of western resolve the 
contest between the free and the unfree has been symbolized by an 
island of hope behind the iron curtain berlin

the governmentappointed peoples 
power assembly on wednesday elected gen manuel antonio noriega to 
his first major civilian post as national coordinator of the 
lawmaking body 
noriega is military chief and as such the countrys most 
powerful individual the new position allows him to officially call 
special sessions and assume functions assigned to him by the 
510member assembly 
the assembly also declared a state of general alert and asked 
provisional president francisco rodriguez to declare a state of 
national urgency because of the political crisis here 
the peoples power assembly was designated to replace the 
national assembly after noriega had rodriguez installed as 
president on sept 1 when the previous civilian governments term 
expired 
may elections were annulled when it became apparent noriega 
opponents were winning 
the general state council which includes the cabinet and top 
military officers gave the assembly authorization on nov 9 to 
elect a national coodinator who was not a member 
noriega was chosen because it is fundamental to make political 
decisions that guarantee the permanence of the republic and the 
national sovereignty the assembly resolution said 
assembly member ramon ashby said in proposing noriega that he 
should be a spokesman and defender of the assembly 
the panama city city council late tuesday unanimously agreed to 
ask the general state council to name noriega chief of government 
the united states has been applying political and economic 
pressure to force noriega to quit as military chief since february 
1988 when noriega was indicted on federal drug trafficking charges 
in florida 
noriega denies the charges he calls them a us attempt to 
avoid complying with the 1977 panama canal treaties which require 
the united states to turn over control of the waterway to panama at 
the end of 1999

parliament said he would resign after the next election scheduled 
for october 1990 he is 51 
under prime minister david lange douglas revolutionized what 
was one of the worlds most regulated economies by removing import 
protection cutting income taxes introducing a consumption tax and 
imposing management systems on the public sector 
when lange and douglas publicly feuded over the pace of economic 
reform lange ousted douglas from the cabinet last december 
douglas retaliated by campaigning against lange and he was 
reinstated in august as minister for police and immigration 
lange then resigned as prime minister that same month and was 
succeeded by geoffrey palmer 
i think the time has come for me to pursue a career other than 
politics douglas said i have decided to make this 
announcement now because the labor party is calling for nominations 
and that process will close in january 
if i stayed here and as i said i still believe ive got a 
contribution to make here i would really in three or six years be 
locked in here for another 10 or something like that and i just 
didnt want that to occur he said in a statement 
palmer said douglas was responsible for making bold innovative 
decisions that provided a solid future for this island nations

a major abortionrights case that the state 
attorney general feared would be used by the us supreme court to 
restrict abortions has been settled the state announced wednesday 
the settlement would guarantee women continued access to 
abortions in illinois said dr bernard turnock director of the 
illinois department of public health 
attorney general neil hartigan said for the settlement to stand 
the high court would have to delay a scheduled hearing in the case 
and refer it back to the us district court in chicago which 
would have to approve the settlement 
we have reached the goal we set at the beginning of our 
negotiations hartigan said the principals in this case 
have created a system that protects a womans health and safety 
while exercising her right of choice 
hartigan and some abortion rights forces had feared that without 
a settlement the supreme court might use the case to completely 
overturn its 1973 roe vs wade decision which legalized abortion 
the settlement proposes to resolve a legal challenge to illinois 
regulations that set elaborate rules for building codes and other 
requirements for abortion clinics 
turnock said at a news conference that the settlement will 
refine or refocus the current regulations governing abortion 
clinics to dispense with those that are unnecessary 
inappropriate or excessive 
annlouise lohr staff counsel to the americans united for life 
legal defense fund said the antiabortion group was extremely 
disappointed that hartigan didnt let the case go to the supreme 
court 
she called the settlement a backroom deal that will compromise 
the ability of all states to protect the health and safety of 
women 
but molly yard president of the national organization for 
women said i think it is very clear that neil hartigan has read 
the message of the majority of voters on the whole question of the 
right of a woman to control her reproductive choices 
the agreement will modify illinois abortionclinic regulations 
challenged in 1985 by dr richard ragsdale of rockford who was 
represented by the american civil liberties union of illinois 
ragsdale who had lost his lease in his building and been unable 
to find new office space that met the old codes argued that the 
requirements for nonhospital surgical centers were medically 
unnecessary and forced him to build the equivalent of a small 
hospital for a simple procedure 
he maintained the regulations were a veiled attempt by the 
illinois department of public health and turnock to restrict 
womens access to abortion in the state 
four years ago ragsdale won a preliminary injunction against 
illinois existing regulations in us district court in chicago 
barred from enforcing the regulations turnock and hartigans 
office appealed arguing that the rules are necessary to protect 
womens health 
in 1987 the us 7th circuit court of appeals sided with 
ragsdale upholding the lower courts ruling and agreeing that the 
regulations place an unconstitutional restriction on womens right 
to undergo abortion 
the requirements include 250squarefoot surgical rooms some 
corridor widths of eight feet lounges lockers and separate 
toilets for male and female employees and a janitors closet 
adjoining the surgical suite 
under the modified rules abortion clinics would not be required 
to modify their buildings in any significant way said aclu 
attorney colleen k connell 
will the price of an abortion go up she asked no 
in addition abortions will continue to be performed by private 
physicians in their offices by doctors at walkin surgical clinics 
and by physicians at fullservice hospitals officials said 
but walkin surgical centers that perform abortions as their 
sole or majority business will be subject to inspections beginning 
as early as next year by the department of public health turnock 
said 
surgical centers whose sole business is abortions will be 
limited to performing them before the 18th week of pregnancy 
surgical centers licensed to perform both abortions and other 
outpatient procedures may perform them after 18 weeks he said 
the us supreme court had agreed to hear the case on july 3 
and had scheduled oral arguments for dec 5 
abortion rights groups have said that if the supreme court 
upheld the rules for illinois other states might take it as a 
signal to adopt similar restrictions 
a survey released last week indicated 98 percent of abortion 
clinics nationwide would be violating at least one of the illinois 
rules if they were adopted by the clinics home states 
threefourths of the clinics said the regulation would force 
them to relocate and could drive them out of business according to 
the national abortion federation and planned parenthood the groups 
that released the results 
with the agreement reached today hartigan said we 
believe that we now have a system that addresses the public health 
concerns relating to abortions performed in ambulatory surgical

the leaders of eastern airlines pilots union 
voted wednesday to end their bitter sympathy strike and notified 
the company they were ready to return to work 
the abrupt decision eight months into a strike by the carriers 
machinists union deals a severe blow to both the machinists and 
organized labor which has used the pilots support of the strike as 
a symbol of its newfound solidarity 
wayne dolan an eastern pilot and spokesman for the air line 
pilots association said the unions 20member master executive 
council for eastern made the decision at a meeting in reston a 
suburb of washington 
he said the union would notify eastern management the pilots 
were ready to return to work eastern has been hiring replacement 
pilots and using the union pilots who crossed picket lines and it 
was not immediately clear whether it would welcome the striking 
pilots back 
technically under the railway labor act which governs airline 
contract disputes only the machinists are on strike the pilots 
and easterns union flight attendants have been honoring machinist 
pickets in legal sympathy strikes 
the airline has replaced many of the 3600 pilots who went on 
strike march 4 with nonunion pilots and eastern said wednesday 
there were no jobs for the strikers 2250 remaining as of 
wednesday to return to 
john peterpaul vice president of the international association 
of machinists said in a telephone interview late wednesday 
were not calling this thing off 
what they the pilots do is their affair he said 
eastern said in a statement issued at its miami headquarters 
its a very interesting development our only regret is that it 
didnt come earlier and we could have avoided all the trauma that 
has come to eastern airlines 
eastern said returning pilots will be recalled as jobs come 
open in the future and invited them to sign the recall list 
there airline has 1800 pilots currently 
the machinists went on strike after refusing to agree to a 
demand for 150 million in concessions on wages work rules and 
other subjects by frank lorenzo chairman of easterns parent 
company texas air corp the machinists said later they would agree 
to similar or greater concessions if lorenzo would sell eastern 
but sale attempts have fallen through 
the stunning decision by the pilots union came a day after 
president bush vetoed a bill that would have created a special 
congressional panel to investigate the strike and propose a 
solution 
congress cant try to override the veto until it reconvenes in 
two months peterpaul said he thought there was a good chance 
congress would vote to override 
alpa president henry duffy spoke to the eastern council meeting 
duffy last week was denied a seat on the aflcio executive council 
after narrowly missing being chosen for a vacancy two years ago he 
was said to be irate at not being chosen particularly because of 
the support alpa has given the machinists 
sources who attended the meeting said duffy endorsed a return to 
work 
the pilots union has a history of crossing the picket lines of 
other unions limiting the effectiveness of airline strikes but it 
stood with the machinists until wednesday though more than 200 
pilots had returned to work on their own according to eastern and 
union officials 
the decision to return to work was the most difficult decision 
we have had to make since eastern was acquired by texas air 
corp said skip copeland head of alpas eastern master 
executive council 
copeland blamed bushs veto for the decision saying it left the 
pilots with little choice but to return to work because prospects 
for a settlement of the machinists strike in the near future were 
virtually nonexisstent 
copeland said the decision is a best a small victory for 
eastern and lorenzo but it in fact should give eastern more than 
enough pilots to complete its planned reorganization 
copeland replaced jack bavis in august who was recalled by the 
membership after he endorsed a return to work then 
eastern which filed for bankruptcy protections five days after 
the strike began has been rebuilding by hiring replacement 
workers and pilot shortages and training problems have been the 
biggest personnel problem 
however it was not clear that pilot shortages were now a 
problem theyve got all the pilot they need said paul karos 
airline analyst at first boston corp the strike has been mainly 
symbolic 
copeland said the pilots have been instructed to contact the 
company about returning to work 
the time has come now to go back rebuild eastern and get on 
with our lives and professions copeland said 
the white house announced the veto at 1135 pm tuesday the 
measure would have become law at midnight had bush not acted by 
then in his veto message bush said congress which would have 
conducted the investigation had no business interfering in the 
contract and court disputes over the 8monthold strike he refused 
in march to use his power to block the strike by naming an 
emergency mediation board 
lorenzo in a letter to bush praised the president for having 
the political courage to veto the measure and a clear vision of 
the need to keep the airline industry competitive 
but the presidents action prompted stinging attacks from 
easterns unions which pointedly recalled bushs remarks to the 
aflcio convention last week praising the role of unions in 
promoting democracy and workers rights abroad 
there he expressed concern for working men and women and 
their families said george kourpias president of the 
machinists by vetoing the eastern bill he kicked a large 
segment of those workers in the teeth 
the unions accused bush of supporting what they deem as efforts 
by lorenzo to use the bankruptcy protection to reorganize eastern 
as a nonunion carrier 
by failing to sign the eastern bill the president embraced 
the meanest workerhating boss in the nation frank lorenzo 
said george kourpias president of the machinists union 
the president has dropped any pretense of fairness and chosen 
sides with frank lorenzo a symbol of the worst type of american 
employer the aflcio said in a statement that called the veto 
a strong message to every working american that the president is 
not on their side

been better constructed to withstand the tornado 
the state is determined to do all that it can to prevent 
another tragedy like that which occurred at the east coldenham

taken today will help assure that this process moves ahead

president bush on wednesday hailed the 
dramatic changes sweeping eastern europe as a joyful end to one 
of historys saddest chapters and urged soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev to work with him at next weeks summit and beyond to 
once and for all end the cold war 
in a thanksgivingeve speech broadcast to the nation from camp 
david bush said he would seek assurances from gorbachev that the 
process of reform will continue in eastern europe 
and we will give him our assurance that america welcomes this 
reform not as an adversary seeking advantage but as a people 
offering support bush said our goal is to see this historic 
tide of freedom broadened deepened and sustained 
the sweeping rhetoric made clear that bush now sees the the 
summit as going far beyond the relaxed feetup getacquainted 
meeting that he originally envisioned he pledged there would be 
no surprises sprung on our allies at the shipboard meeting in 
the waters of the mediterranean off malta on dec 2 and 3 
after all the peoples of europe are determining their own 
future 
bush delivered his remarks in a librarylike setting in front 
of a fireplace in laurel lodge which houses his office at camp 
david as well as dining facilities 
bush spoke at a time of momentous events in eastern europe 
dramatized by the opening of the berlin wall a piece of which was 
given him by a visiting west german official and the loosening of 
hardline communist policies in east germany hungary poland 
czechoslovakia and bulgaria at home critics have charged bush 
with being timid in responding to the reforms 
bush praised gorbachev as the dynamic architect of soviet 
reform but he tempered his remarks by saying that nicaragua and 
cuba retained authoritarian governments because of massive support 
of weapons and supplies from their communist allies bush said he 
would ask the soviet leader to help bring freedom and democracy to 
latin america 
so as we celebrate the events of eastern europe bush said 
remember that some walls still remain between east and west 
there are the invisible walls of suspicion the walls of doubt 
misunderstanding and miscalculation 
house speaker thomas s foley interviewed on cnn after the 
speech said that in the past bush appeared perhaps too detached 
and too calm too relaxed about things that are truly exciting 
but he added i think that democrats now expect the 
president to approach these historic issues with determination and 
prudence 
bushs speech marked the first time that the presidential 
retreat in marylands catoctin mountains was used as the site of a 
nationally televised address the president is spending 
thanksgiving weekend at camp david with his wife barbara 
this will be a very special thanksgiving bush said 
around the world tonight new pilgrims are on a voyage to freedom 
and for many it is not a trip to some faraway place but to a 
world of their own making 
bush said that in a new europe the american role may change 
in form but not in fundamentals the united states has been the 
guarantor of west european security since world war ii 
he said that even if us and soviet forces are significantly 
reduced as both superpowers have proposed we will remain in 
europe as long as our friends want and need us 
bush hailed gorbachev as the dynamic architect of soviet 
reform and said that in malta i will assure him that there is 
no greater advocate of perestroika than the president of the united 
states perestroika is gorbachevs beleaguered program to 
restructure his countrys faltering economy 
bush said that as the nation heads into a new decade i am 
reaching out to president gorbachev asking him to work with me to 
bring down the last barriers to a new world of freedom 
let us move beyond containment and once and for all end the 
cold war bush said 
in his prepared text bush referred to ending cold war 
gorbachev has opened the floodgates for the reform sweeping the 
soviet bloc he said tuesday that he favored a more rapid pace of 
change in the region to make up for lost time 
bush said that for the first time since the berlin wall was 
erected in 1961 the world has a new image reflecting a new 
reality that of germans east and west pulling each other to the 
top of the wall a human bridge between nations 
entire peoples all across eastern europe bravely taking to 
the streets demanding liberty talking democracy this is not the 
end of the book of history but it is a joyful end to one of 
historys saddest chapters the president said 
bush however did not address the issue of german reunification 
he said that with the events in eastern europe change is 
coming swiftly and with this change the dramatic vindication of 
free europes economic and political institutions the new europe 
that is coming is being built must be built on the foundation 
of democratic values 
but the faster the pace the smoother our path must be bush 
said 
bush said that last may he set down five points that the soviet 
union should pursue that would inevitably result in improved 
relations with the west the soviet union has made progress in 
each area bush said that is undeniable 
the areas are reductions in soviet forces support for 
selfdetermination in eastern europe cooperation with the united 
states to end regional disputes respect for human rights and joint 
efforts to address global problems such as the environment and the 
drug epidemic 
with the soviet record and the changes in eastern europe in 
mind bush said he invited gorbachev to meet him in the 
mediterranean a summit just 10 days away 
this is a first meeting a time for exploration it is not a 
time for detailed arms control negotiations best left for next 
years summit bush said referring to an expected late spring or 
early summer summit in the united states 
he said he hoped the malta meeting would be a constructive act 
guiding brave pilgrims on their journey to a new world of 
freedom 
earlier wedneday the president told reporters aboard air force 
one that he was looking to the malta summit with the boy scout 
motto be prepared 
ive got a lot of homework to do he said 
bush will hold presummit talks at camp david with british prime 
minister margaret thatcher on friday as he continues his 
preparations for his first meeting with gorbachev as president

resolutions calling them unbalanced and unconstructive western 
european nations joined them in opposing some measures 
one resolution passed by consensus supported the right of the 
south african people to reach a negotiated political settlement 
with south africas government to end racial conflict

the backing of the more than 100 votes of the nonaligned movement 
key provisions of the 12 resolutions include 
a call for all nations to cut off trade banking investment 
cultural and sports links with south africa 
criticism of west germany which recently emerged as the 
leading trading partner of south africa no figures were given 
but the united states japan and britain also were high on the list

minority regime of south africa in the military and nuclear 
fields israel has been accused of helping pretoria develop a

los angeles daily news on senators and the sampl crisis 
if sen alan cranston dcalif is wondering why people 
question his integrity he need look no further than his own 
contradictory statements about allegations that he and four other 
senators attempted to interfere with a federal probe of lincoln 
savings and loan 
as recently as last thursday nov 16 cranston contended that 
he and three other senators dennis deconcini dariz john 
glenn dohio and john mccain rariz met with edwin j gray 
then chairman of the federal home loan bank board on april 2 
1987 merely to urge gray to bring a lengthy investigation of 
lincoln to a close not to influence its outcome sen donald w 
riegle jr dmich also intervened in lincolns behalf but did 
not attend that particular meeting 
grays subordinates in the san francisco office recommended that 
lincoln be shut down instead a decision to seize the 
failing thrift was delayed for two years 
cranstons most recent statement about the meeting with gray 
seems to contradict his comments last month that he and the other 
senators all of whom received large contributions from lincoln 
chairman charles h keating jr may well have discussed a 
regulation limiting lincolns investments in speculative land 
deals junk bonds and other risky ventures 
he cranston contended in a letter to the senate ethics 
committee that he was simply trying to help a constituent 
californiabased lincoln who felt he was being hassled by the 
feds most important mr keating never received from me any 
reason to believe that those contributions were in exchange for my 
help with the federal home loan bank board or with anybody else 
said the senator 
cranston and his colleagues seemed to be doing all that keating 
could have asked with the possible exception of buying his sampl 
that unfortunate task was left to the taxpayers who must now fork 
over at least 25 billion in liquidation costs to pay for the mess 
that the senators helped create

independent marshall minn on alcoholic beverage container 
labels 
cans of beer and bottles of beer liquor and wine are looking a 
little different nowadays nov 18 was the effective date of a 
federal rule requiring health warnings on all alcoholicbeverage 
containers sold in the united states the requirement was part of 
the antidrug abuse act of 1988 
superseding any state laws on the subject the rule says labels 
must carry the message government warning 1 according to the 
surgeon general women should not drink alcoholic beverages during 
pregnancy because of the risk of birth defects 2 consumption of 
alcoholic beverages impairs your ability to drive a car or operate 
machinery and may cause health problems 
its all part of the big brother syndrome infesting washington 
which finds bureaucrats and politicians falling all over themselves 
to watch out for us can there be any person in america old enough 
to consume alcoholic beverages legally who is not aware of the 
dangers of driving after drinking of course not 
can there be any pregnant woman nowadays who is unaware of the 
health toll exacted by fetal alcohol syndrome the answer is the 
same 
technically speaking the rule is only temporary the us 
bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms has yet to issue a final 
rule which may or may not differ from the one that is attracting 
so much flak 
either way it will demonstrate that big brother is indeed 
watching closely over us

the communist party on wednesday offered to 
hold talks with rival political groups on free elections and other 
reforms demanded during weeks of antigovernment protests 
opposition leaders agreed 
also wednesday a member of the ruling politburo said the 
communists guarantee of a leading role in government affairs is 
unfair and should be abolished 
the dogmatic distorted model of the political system should 
be changed in theory as well as practice poliburo member 
wolfgang herger said at a public lecture his comments were the 
strongest indication to date that the communists acknowledge the 
inequity of a constitutional mandate to rule 
at the same time communist party leader egon krenz said the 
communists wont be pushed around by the opposition and he has no 
intention of stepping down the official adn news agency reported 
in a thanksgivingeve speech president bush called recent 
changes in east germany and other soviet bloc countries a joyful 
end to one of historys saddest chapters he spoke of east 
germanys opening of the berlin wall but did not address the issue 
of possible german reunification 
the offer of talks from the ruling politburo was vague about who 
could take part and did not set a date for negotiations 
elke guenther of new forum the biggest opposition group said 
in response we have wanted to talk to the communist party for 
years and there certainly are enough things to talk about 
lutheran bishop gottfried forck said he expected the proreform 
group democracy now to organize opposition involvement rainer 
eppelmann of the democratic awakening group said his group had 
not received an invitation to take part 
talks between communists and the opposition in poland led this 
year to formation of a government there not led by communists the 
first in the east bloc 
krenz who serves as both party leader and head of state told 
workers at a factory on the outskirts of east berlin the party will 
keep its grip on the nations factories a traditional source of 
local control and wont let itself be pushed up against the 
wall by the opposition 
i didnt take over to push for change just for four weeks 
adn quoted krenz as saying 
krenz replaced his mentor erich honecker on oct 18 after the 
worst unrest in the nations 40year history and the exodus of tens 
of thousands of east germans dissatisfied with years of stringent 
rule 
the government wednesday ordered a ban on taking antiques or 
consumer goods out of the country adn said no details were given 
but the order appeared to be the first step toward halting the 
drain on the economy caused by east germans taking heirlooms and 
statesubsidized goods to the west to sell for hard currency 
the offer to meet with the opposition was one of the communists 
most significant concessions in the current unrest which began in 
september and has grown to include protests by hundreds of 
thousands of people across the country 
more than 100000 east germans left the country this month 
alone testifying to continued dissatisfaction despite the opening 
of the berlin wall and lifting of travel restrictions 
krenzs long partnership with honecker and other communists now 
suspected of having lined their pockets at public expense has 
tainted the new leadership and damaged the party chiefs 
credibility 
before the politburo offer manfred gerlach of the liberal 
democratic party long aligned with the communists said fledgling 
opposition groups such as new forum deserve recognition and a 
greater voice in making decisions 
ms guenther and other opposition leaders however were 
suspicious of his motives having long suspected the liberal 
democrats of trying to establish themselves as the main opposition 
force 
we are profoundly skeptical of the changes claimed by the 
established parties ms guenther said manfred gerlach has 
long been a functionary within the government that has been 
discredited 
hansdieter raspe gerlachs deputy told adn the liberal 
democrats aspire to the presidency in the first free elections 
which some expect as soon as next spring 
gerlach at his first open news conference said opposition 
groups should be allowed to compete with the communists 
this should be done both for the benefit of political 
pluralism and also to get as wide a range of participation as 
possible in deciding a future course gerlach said 
he pressed the communists to relinquish their constitutional 
mandate for a leading role in the government blaming their 
40year monopoly for economic decline and loss of public trust 
the communists meet in a special party congress dec 1517 and 
krenz may be challenged if his popularity does not improve 
i am concerned about proposals to have the delegates directly 
elect the general secretary krenz said wednesday indicating 
opposition to congress procedures that could bring in party members 
whose backing is uncertain 
under the current procedures delegates are elected by local 
party organizations and the delegates vote in a new 163member 
central committee the central committee in turn chooses a party 
leader 
under pressure to earn their posts in competitive elections 
topranking communists have reportedly splintered into groups that 
advocate differing paces of democratic change 
some have also begun shunning privileges theyve enjoyed for 
years such as exclusive villas as opposition demands for criminal 
investigations of former leaders are heeded 
the west german newspaper bild reported wednesday that 
honeckers former deputy ousted politburo member guenter mittag 
was interrogated for 14 hours last week about reports he stashed 
hundreds of millions of marks in swiss banks

lawyers said wednesday they 
have evidence backing allegations by a former policeman who says he 
was part of an authorized death squad that assassinated 
antiapartheid activists 
the lawyers also said authorities were not vigorously pursuing 
the charges by expoliceman butana nofomela and two former 
colleagues who all admit to participating in police killings in 
south africa and neighboring countries 
after only a brief investigation into allegations made by 
nofomela it would appear that significant corroboration exists 
for certain of the allegations said peter harris of the 
lawyers for the independent board of inquiry into informal 
repression a private firm 
nofomela admitted being a death squad member in an affidavit 
signed oct 19 the night before he was scheduled to hang for a 
murder that had no political overtones 
nofomela who has acknowledged involvement in at least eight 
police killings has been granted a temporary stay of execution 
police have denied the existence of a death squad but have 
appointed a commission to investigate 
police gen herman stadler in an interview on government 
television said it was possible policemen could have carried out 
illegal actions without the knowledge of their superiors 
he said police took the death squad allegations seriously and 
intended to get to the kernal of the matter 
last week former police capt dirk coetzee said he had been a 
commander of a death squad and exconstable david tshikalange said 
he also was a member both men have fled south africa 
all three expolicemen have said they carried out the killings 
based on orders from their superiors 
while nofomelas recollection of certain dates may be 
inaccurate the substance of his allegations remain said brian 
currin a lawyer for the board 
the board said their evidence backs nofomelas claims that he 
was present at four separate incidents from 1981 to 1985 in which 
eight activists were killed 
they include 
the slaying of black lawyer griffith mxenge in 1981 
a 1983 raid on a home in swaziland that resulted in the deaths 
of two suspected african national congress guerrillas 
the 1985 murder of security guard japie moponye whose brother 
was linked to the anc 
a 1985 shooting near durban that left four activists dead 
all the cases are unsolved 
police have denied the existence of a death squad but have 
appointed a commission to investigate 
the private lawyers met wednesday with the two men heading the 
commission police lt gen alwyn conradie and the attorney 
general of the orange free state province tp mcnally 
the lawyers provided the commission with evidence they have 
gathered in their investigation including information showing 
nofomela carried four passports with four separate identities 
the lawyers said they understood that the four passports were 
standard issue for security police and allowed them to travel to 
neighboring countries without being identified 
what is apparent to me is that certain very important leads 
appear not to have been pursued as they should have harris said 
the official commission says it hopes to complete its 
investigation by the end of november president fw de klerk is 
not expected to comment on the case until he reviews a report by 
law and order minister adriaan vlok 
almost all the countrys leading newspapers including those 
that support the government have called for a public judicial 
investigation

deposits of surplus food at the nations food banks have 
declined this year as the ranks of bank patrons the poor and 
hungry continue to grow 
the federal government and private corporations are donating 
less food to private charities than in the past according to food 
bank officials in several cities 
at the same time said kevin fagan director of development for 
the greater philadelphia food bank theres no question that 
demand is just flying through the ceiling 
food bankers blame the decline in part on a frenzied pace of 
corporate takeovers that have left food industry executives glued

gary bennett considers himself a 
lifesaver trying to rescue babies from poverty and disease in 
central america 
carol bogart who paid bennett more than 5000 for a little 
girl he never delivered sees him as a false hero 
im angry said bogart 40 of denver im angry about 
what she went through and her mother who knows what that woman 
thinks or believes 
after almost two years bennett hasnt completed a single 
adoption and the state has shut down his agency because he 
allegedly violated adoption rules 
bennett concedes he bit off more than i could chew and says 
he counted too much on friends who liked the idea but couldnt help 
carry it out his good intentions he says were thwarted by red 
tape lack of money and naivete 
the only reason that i started this was the children not 
for me but for these people so their babies wont die 
bennett first took an interest in the miskito indians in 1984 
after he left his 83000ayear airconditioning repair business 
in suburban fort worth and sought a thrill training nicaraguan 
contra rebels a friend invited him to see the miskito coast a 
225milelong strip of jungle along the honduras and nicaragua 
coast with poverty so bad youre not human if you can ignore it 
he said he began taking food and arranging aid shipments to the 
miskitos in 1985 he sought help from the federal government and 
obtained medical visas for four sick malnourished children 
there are four children who will have good lives because of 
him said david sowders sowders and his wife denise became 
foster parents of abandoned twins bennett brought from a military 
hospital on the honduras border in 1985 
the nurse came to gary and said would you please do what you 
can for these kids and so gary went found their father and got 
permission to bring them out on medical visa said sowders a 
dallas times herald editor 
the sowderses paid for the twins medical care and are in the 
process of adopting them bennett helped them look in nicaragua for 
the twins father to get him to relinquish custody 
bennett a 42yearold divorced father of four became the 
foster parent of another of the four children a nicaraguan girl 
named angie now 3 he recently received the final custody 
relinquishment documents from the girls father and said that the 
adoption is in its final stages 
the fourth child is with another dallas couple bennett said 
because of his work with the four children friends urged him to 
start an adoption agency and in late 1987 he got a provisional 
license from the texas department of human services for the 
nonprofit mosquitia coast child find inc 
the provisional license gave the agency six months to prove 
itself by completing an adoption in order to get a regular 
biennial license the state twice extended the license but in 
september refused another because bennett had failed to place a 
child with permanent adoptive parents and apparently had bent 
regulations human services officials said 
carol bogart was one of about 75 people who contacted mosquitia 
coast seeking children bennett says now though at one point he 
told state officials that thousands had called him fewer than 
10 people were interviewed by social workers connected with the 
agency bennett said 
bogart who already had a 4yearold son michael paid 5200 
in adoption deposits and fees and 2000 to an agency that was to 
evaluate her suitability in return bennett promised hed bring 
her a little girl in november 1988 then he said he was certain it 
would be december 
the rest of december came and went she said i was 
calling them frantically constantly they said no question 
you will have this baby for christmas in the months that 
followed they were still stringing me along and sending me the 
pictures i was worried about what was happening to her what kind 
of shape she was in and was she being taken care of properly 
you get so hooked into it that you just can barely stand to 
give it up i couldnt invest myself emotionally in it anymore and 
michael was just having a terrible time he had been waiting for a 
baby sister for months 
bennett said the adoption fell through when his assistant and 
girlfriend pat nealy was jailed for a day in tegucigalpa 
honduras because of questions over kyla sues nationality a 
travel document nealy and bennett obtained for the girl showed she 
was born in nicaragua but in an affidavit relinquishing parental 
rights the girls mother said the child was born in tegucigalpa 
bogart accused bennett of trying to circumvent stricter honduran 
adoption laws by passing kyla sue off as nicaraguan 
the department of human services investigated her claim last 
summer but could not validate it but the department said 
mosquitia coast failed to meet several regulations including 
providing records and properly training staff 
the state had criticized bennett earlier for bringing the four 
children into the united states on medical visas when he intended 
to have them adopted 
bennett says his problems are political our state department 
says one thing and what they actually do is another im just one 
man we havent placed any were just banging our heads against 
the wall 
case records show that the most serious state allegations 
against mosquitia coast involved its inability to retain a 
professional social worker and bennett and nealys competence to 
counsel parents giving up their children 
donna parrish the human services licensing official assigned to 
bennetts agency declined to discuss bennetts qualifications but 
said childplacing is very complicated its very difficult for 
professionals to become involved in it and go through it in the way 
that it needs to be done let alone someone with no background it 
the final report on the agency indicates two families withdrew 
applications they had filed with mosquitia coast as it went out of 
business and several other families were referred to other 
agencies 
bogarts is the only complaint on file with human services 
bennett said he will return her money 
kyla sue and three other children are at a safe house in 
tegucigalpa he said they are his foster children in the 
governments eyes but cant leave because adoptive parents must be 
lined up for each child he said adding he hesitates to look for 
permanent homes for them because he doesnt want to appear to be 
operating an illegal adoption service 
sowders believes bennett will be better off taking help to the 
miskito than bringing children out i saw firsthand how hard it 
is to get one tiny thing done he said it took more resources 
and help than he had available

tom skerritt and max von sydow are two cold 
war adversaries who form a reluctant partnership to prevent an 
assassination in the hbo movie red king white knight 
skerritt is bill stoner a former cia agent and recovered 
alcoholic and von sydow is szaz a retired eastern bloc 
intelligence agent in this taut and interesting thriller that 
premieres saturday on home box office it was filmed on location in 
budapest hungary which gives it a bleak atmosphere that enhances 
the suspense 
american officials hear of plans by the kgb to assassinate the 
soviet general secretary and send stoner to verify its validity 
stoner is selected for deniability in case hes discovered 
because hes no longer an agent 
this appealed to me because its told on two levels said 
skerritt one level is the story of man trying to rehabilitate 
himself after the suicide of his wife and his alcoholism on the 
other level he knows the identity of the man who will attempt to 
assassinate the soviet leader 
as happens so often with people in politics the american 
officials debate whether to tell the russians until stoner and szaz 
are forced to take matters into their own hands 
red king white knight is representative of a new wave of 
political thrillers in which the soviets are no longer completely 
the enemy 
stoner is angry withdrawn and less adventurous said 
skerritt he was probably once an ultraconservative politically 
but all hes gone through and the changes in the past 10 years has 
probably changed his philosophy hes at a time when hes trying to 
recapture his life and selfesteem he hopes this assignment will 
bring back his sense of selfworth 
he also runs into an old love interest anna played by helen 
mirren after their last encounter anna was sent to prison 
skerritt can be seen in the feature movie steel magnolias 
in which he plays sally fields husband and julia roberts father 
he made that a year ago in natchitoches la and since then also 
filmed the heist for hbo 
and he was kirstie alleys boss and love interest for several 
episodes of nbcs cheers 
i did cheers for the sheer pleasure of it he said i 
had no intention of becoming a regular 
his only series was the shortlived ryans four on abc in 
1983 he was a doctor in charge of four young interns 
skerritt grew up in detroit where he attended wayne state 
university before transferring to ucla while still a student he 
was cast in the movie war hunt which also starred robert 
redford sidney pollock gavin mcleod and john saxon 
his film career went on to a small role as a comic motorcycle 
officer in harold and maude and since then he has starred in 
mash turning point alien ice castles and 
top gun he was the third lead in mash as duke he was 
asked to do the television series but the character was dropped 
when he turned it down 
that was a lot of fun he said that was an extraordinary 
experience id worked with robert altman before when he directed 
some combat episodes i was in i knew i could get silly we did a 
lot of improvisation he hired improvisation people as extras and 
put microphones and cameras everywhere to pick up what they were 
doing 
he took a small role in thieves like us so that he could 
monitor altman as director he took the role in harold and 
maude to monitor hal ashbys directing technique 
he and his partner sue aran wrote a screenplay called the 
last of the grape jelly glasses which was optioned by 
guberpeters prior to their new contract with columbia pictures 
skerritt describes it as a human comedy about an older man with 
a heart condition who leaves a retirement home to take a last trip 
on the sacramento delta in his houseboat he would direct and play 
the old mans soninlaw 
im trying to focus on directing now skerritt says

for 20 million japanese hiroshi kume is an anchor 
in the stormy seas of modern life 
the 45yearold boyishlooking newscaster on tv asahis news 
station program anchors one of the nations most popular news 
show drawing viewers with his pioneering opinionated 80minute 
look at the days events 
in a culture that usually leans more to cooperation than 
criticism kume has become a working mans hero for many admirers 
claim he has the common mans touch fearlessly criticizing the 
powers that be in a japan wracked by government scandals 
international criticism and new riches 
with the irreverent style of a quiz show host his former 
occupation he has revolutionized japanese tv news and set off the 
socalled news wars in which competing networks imitated his 
style 
critics and competitors claim hes biased brash and perhaps 
worst of all not a real journalist 
part howard cosell part willard scott and in no way a peter 
jennings a tom brokaw or a dan rather kume rebuffs both the pans 
and the praise 
he avoids including himself in the legions of middleclass 
loyal salary men who glue this country together he points out 
that anyone who earns a tv anchors salary about 700000 
annually tv insiders say can hardly be considered one of the 
trampled masses 
one television critic sadanobu aoki says kumes support comes 
from viewers who desiring political reforms but not revolution 
applaud the unprecedented way he speaks out 
he criticizes authority without hesitating but he also 
balances his criticism people like to think they see a little of 
themselves on the screen when they watch him says aoki 
for some japanese kume is an independent voice the kind of 
voice silenced in prewar japan by fealty to the emperor and muted 
in postwar japan by subservience to japanese business 
kume delights in pointing to his ratings a 20 pecent share of 
the viewing public when confronted with claims he doesnt measure 
up to the staid detached delivery of japans other talking heads 
four years ago tv asahi brought kume on from competitor tokyo 
broadcasting system where he hosted quiz shows cooking programs 
and musicals it then forged a format incorporating kumes views of 
the news 
the move prompted loud criticism from media watchers about 
kumes lack of journalism experience but his outspoken delivery 
quickly attracted viewers what followed was a cavalcade of 
imitations in the same late evening time slot 
kume admits to being worried by the only copycat show that has 
survived the encroaching ratings of public broadcaster nhks 
news today makes him think he should run a tighter ship and 
move from a news show to real news 
i think maybe ill tell fewer jokes says a smiling kume 
who has remarked to japanese interviewers that he learns more from 
watching beat takeshi a popular tv comedian than from other 
newscasters 
on tv kume wears pullover sweaters waves his hands grimaces 
lurches forward into the camera and delights in pointing to scale 
models of volcanoes or train sets while reviewing the days major 
events 
the commentary comes out after an event has been described as 
kume talks over the issues with his coanchors 
among other things kumes newscasts have highlighted the long 
travails of the governing liberal democratic party which has been 
embroiled in influencepeddling and sex scandals 
i feel my mission is to check the activities of the government 
and the liberal democratic party and i would even criticize the 
socialists if they gained power in the government kume said in 
an interview 
im criticized for this but i believe this is my mission and 
will continue doing it its part of what free speech is all 
about 
kume believes his move to news from cooking and quiz shows has 
had an impact on the public they think if this 
lightheartedtype person can talk about politics maybe i can 
too he said 
he does conform to some traditions but adds his own badboy 
twist in japan newscasters end their shows by bowing respectfully 
to the camera from their seats kume bows too 
but as the screen cuts to black viewers see his head fall 
forward onto the desk as if exhausted by the weight of his success

in the 1950s the national council of churches 
with mainline protestantism enjoying an indian summer of 
prosperity didnt seem to need any one else to set the 
moralreligious agenda of the nation 
today for the sake of a christian role in a civil society 
the council needs to embrace the diversity of american religious 
life rather than stand above it said the councils first eastern 
orthodox president 
ironically its in being a catalyst for a more pluralistic 
society that the council can play a more central role in public 
policy debates the very rev leonid kishkovsky said in an 
interview 
it is not in reestablishing an establishment 
the council the countrys largest ecumenical organization 
includes most of the countrys major protestant and eastern 
orthodox denominations 
kishkovsky secretary for ecumenical and external affairs of the 
orthodox church in america was installed last week in pittsburgh 
to a twoyear term as president of the council 
he takes over as president in a time of transition for the 
council when officials are seeking to revitalize the nations 
largest ecumenical organization 
the rev arie r brouwer resigned as chief executive of the 
council in june in a dispute over reorganization plans in spite of 
inflation the contributions from member churches have remained 
stagnant at around 12 million to 13 million for the last 15 years 
while some evangelical churches have grown rapidly and the 
percentage of catholics in the united states has jumped 40 percent 
in the last four decades many of the largest churches within the 
council have suffered significant membership losses the council 
today represents 32 church bodies with a membership of 42 million 
particularly as sectarian tensions divide other nations us 
religious groups need to be a model of showing how people who 
disagree on volatile issues can work toward a common ground 
kishkovsky said 
i think that in modest but in real helpful ways the 
council could help model out in our relations with christians a 
model of living together kishkovsky said americans have a 
kind of key role in that kind of modeling around the world 
for example kishkovsky who was born in warsaw said in poland 
there is a concern among the protestant and orthodox minorities 
that the catholic church could be potentially oppressive as it 
gains political influence with the democratic reforms going on 
there 
kishkovsky said it would be foolhardy for the us council 
to set as its only goal bringing in the 53 millionmember catholic 
church as a member but they can work toward a closer partnership 
i really want to work on that said kishkovsky part of a 
12member council delegation that met with pope john paul ii in 
april i will help as much as i personally can 
the kishkovsky 46 who also is rector of an orthodox church in 
suburban new york includes among his other goals emphasizing the 
spiritual foundation of the council and persuading the ecumenical 
agency to tackle tough issues such as abortion and homosexuality 
many of us have recognized the need to bring into the council 
a spiritual biblical dimension said kishkovshky a member of 
the councils governing board since 1979 it has been seen that 
there is kind of an anemia of the spiritual 
but the tendency to focus on social policy issues with little 
regard to personal spirituality is not limited to the council he 
said 
i think there is a strain in american religion that is highly 
pragmatic according to kishkovsky 
along with service there needs to be emphasis on piety prayer 
and worship in council deliberations he said 
for me the core of it is the spiritual kishkovsky said 
you have to love god and love your neighbor 
but he said that does not mean the council should duck volatile 
issues such as abortion and homosexuality as it has in the past for 
the sake of unity 
i believe that variety pluralism on pretty divisive issues 
isnt something that needs to be feared kishkovsky said its 
necessary for the civil society 
within the council kishkovsky said that day maybe has 
passed when the agency stayed away from discussing controversial 
issues such as abortion for fear of offending groups holding 
traditional views such as the orthodox churches 
its in the air in american religious life kishkovsky said 
serious issues need to be explored among people of different 
opinions

jewish consideration 
jesse jackson has become our banquos ghost hovering 
everywhere in the jewish consciousness we do not have to support 
jesse jackson out of some misconceived jewish guilt i could not 
vote for him but it is sick to let him become the lens through

bishops should be careful about criticizing 
catholic politicians and catholic public officials have a moral 
responsibility to act to limit abortions according to guidelines 
on the abortion debate offered in a religious publication 
in an article in a recent issue of america magazine the rev 
robert j mcmanus vicar for education of the diocese of 
providence ri said catholic bishops need to make clear they 
defend the constituional principle of churchstate separation and 
should be prudent about criticizing the political stance of a 
catholic public official 
such criticism mcmanus warned could reawaken inadvertently a 
latent yet historically evident prejudice that catholics are not 
politically independent enough of their bishops political agenda 
to govern in a pluralist society 
at the same time mcmanus said catholic public officials are 
not morally free to do nothing when capable of limiting the 
legal availability of abortion 
political acquiescence in the face of immoral public policies 
is morally unacceptable for a catholic public official mcmanus 
said

as you shop for a niece a grandson or some 
other young person on your list this holiday season the idea of 
giving a financial gift may strike your fancy 
nobody can expect that the sight of a savings bond or 
mutualfund confirmation statement sticking out of a christmas 
stocking will light up an 8yearolds eyes 
but what an investment gift lacks in shortterm gratification 
can be more than offset by longterm appreciation in both the 
economic and emotional senses of the word 
were not talking just money here but the start of some 
savings and investment program that can be added to and grow over 
time to help a young person start building for the future 
a financial present can be more personal than cash and more 
durable than this years fashions in the words of standard amp 
poors corps advisory publication the outlook 
fine you might say but 500 shares of ibm costs a little more 
than i planned to spend it would run you a little more than 
50000 counting commissions and would saddle you with a 
cumbersome gifttax burden besides 
then what about one five or 10 shares of some company you 
believe provides a good product or valuable service that offers the 
prospect of growth in the years ahead 
a single share of stock doesnt come cheap through the usual 
channels you could be charged as much in commissions as the price 
of the share itself 
if you have a good working relationship with a bank or brokerage 
firm however you might be able to persuade that worthy 
intermediary to waive its usual fees as a courtesy 
alternatively you might try phoning the investor relations 
department of the company itself for suggestions about how best to 
proceed a wellrun company should be eager to acquire young 
potentially longterm shareholders 
while you are at it check to see if the company has a dividend 
reinvestment plan that allows for periodic additional purchases of 
shares without brokerage commissions or possibly even at a 
discount in a few cases it may be possible even to buy the first 
share through the reinvestment plan 
of course the stock of an individual company is only one of 
numerous choices open to financial gift shoppers 
some mutual funds offer to open accounts with initial 
investments of 250 or 500 a few set no minimum at all 
among the simplest of all possibilities are bank investments 
such as certificates of deposit and us savings bonds which can 
be bought for as little as 25 at most financial institutions or 
from your nearest federal reserve bank or branch 
these options come with no commissions or other fees beware 
however of bank accounts that reduce their interest rates and 
impose maintenance charges for balances below specified levels 
or if you are of a mind to protect the youngster from all 
eventualities there is always gold sold by many banks and brokers 
in the form of bars bullion coins or custodial receipts 
though the standard unit for most gold investments is a troy 
ounce recently basepriced at just above 400 several are 
available in fractions of an ounce 
remember that you will pay more per ounce for gold if you buy 
smaller sizes standard amp poors analysts caution 
whatever your preference give some thought to discussing a 
financial gift with a childs parents before it is bestowed if 
only to see that it fits in with whatever other planning and saving 
measures are being taken 
most investment gifts to children are made under arrangements 
such as state gift to minors statutes which require the 
designation of an adult as a custodian 
there is also the matter to be decided beforehand of who will 
take responsibility for any tax bills or other expenses that arise 
from the investment while the child is still growing up

in the long view its not uncommon for 
christian workers to be arrested imprisoned or killed for 
upholding rights of the the poor and weak 
its not an aberration but the regular lot of the church 
an internationally recognized church researcher said about the 
persecution of church workers in el salvador 
if seen in the historical context this is something that has 
gone on since the beginning of christianity said the rev david 
b barrett who has been compiling statistics on repression of 
church workers its always been that way 
only the means and location are unpredictable its just like 
lightning you cant be sure where its going to strike next its 
like cancer you cant stop it 
the church cant minister without this risk whenever 
christians take seriously their commission to witness to the faith 
its going to cost a lot 
barrett a british anglican priest who edits the broadest 
compilation of church statistics the world christian encyclopedia 
now is doing missions research in richmond va for the southern 
baptist foreign mission board 
of the current surge of church persecutions in el salvador 
including the killing of six roman catholic priests and arrests of 
several episcopal church workers he said 
this just happens to be the latest case in a longterm pattern 
in the world nearly every country has had its share of it over the 
last 2000 years now its mainly in third world countries in 
conditions of instability 
the main church pattern today is pursuing ministries to aid 
the poor the dispossessed and marginalized persons of society in 
many countries if you do that you are a marked man with 
rightwing people 
the moment you start taking the christian commitment seriously 
in those situations you or your friends are likely to be picked up 
or shot 
church missions officials say about 50 religious professionals 
protestant and roman catholic have been killed in central america 
alone in the last decade including 20 priests and nuns in el 
salvador and 15 in guatamala 
many other clergy have been arrested or expelled and sometimes 
whole dioceses and church institutions have been temporarily 
evacuated because of military harassment 
el salvadors archbishop arturo rivera y damas whose 
predecessor oscar romero was assassinated in 1980 blames the 
recent killings on the countrys armed forces or its adjuncts a 
salvadoran official has recommended that bishops quit the country 
i hate to think it but this type of thing is becoming more 
and more common said the rev matthew roche of the jesuit 
missions bureau 
the rev donald doherty of the maryknoll fathers said its 
actually nothing new but a reversion back to the militarys 
collusion with death squads there are a lot of threats and a lot 
of actual murders 
in the worldatlarge barretts figures project an average of 
1000 churchemployed workers killed annually in modern times for 
their faith including about 300 protestant and catholic clergy and 
300 nuns 
only a fraction of them gets into media he said its the 
tip of the iceberg most cases are not uncovered until too late to 
be a media story and sometimes word of them doesnt get out for 
three or five years 
scattered reports come from all around in letters and reports 
of mission boards and from the vatican 
the assaults on church personnel seems to come in waves such as 
those in the last decade that swept ethiopia urganda cambodia 
argentina and chile and still beset some latin american countries 
and africas sudan 
among the centurys worst cases were the nazi crushing of 
opposing christians as well as jews the stalinist murders of 
thousands of ministers the slaughter of armenian christians and 
the killings of jesuit priests in the spanish civil war 
people knew what they stood for barrett said they stood 
for justice freedom rights of the underprivileged things that 
dictators cant understand theres a long history of that 
he said the situation is parallel in el salvador and other 
regions where people are oppressed and christians stand up for 
the faith 
clearly the churches are commited to gods preferential option 
for the poor he said its a new insight that came about in 
the roman catholic church in latin america in the 60s that the 
poor were grievously sinned against and something should be done 
about it 
but it is the mandate of the church from its basic documents 
from the bible and the call of christ to witness to the nations 
a group of new york jesuits after learning of the killing of 
their colleagues in el salvador at first were outraged but 
strangely one relates the mood later became a kind of sad 
exuberance 
after all said the rev thomas h stahel associate editor 
of the national jesuit weekly america these happy few had done 
the ultimate jesuit thing jesuite like jesus by laying 
down their lives

roman catholic bishops should be careful about 
criticizing catholic politicians and catholic public officials 
have a moral responsibility to act to limit abortions according to 
guidelines on the abortion debate offered in a religious 
publication 
in an article in a recent issue of america magazine the rev 
robert j mcmanus vicar for education of the diocese of 
providence ri said catholic bishops need to make clear they 
defend the constituional principle of churchstate separation and 
should be prudent about criticizing the political stance of a 
catholic public official 
such criticism mcmanus warned could reawaken inadvertently a 
latent yet historically evident prejudice that catholics are not 
politically independent enough of their bishops political agenda 
to govern in a pluralist society 
at the same time mcmanus said catholic public officials are 
not morally free to do nothing when capable of limiting the 
legal availability of abortion 
political acquiescence in the face of immoral public policies 
is morally unacceptable for a catholic public official mcmanus 
said

american jews should not judge black 
candidates solely by their association with jesse jackson an 
official of reform judaism says 
albert vorspan senior vice president of the union of american 
hebrew congregations said it was unrealistic and wrong to expect 
black candidates to publicly repudiate jackson in return for jewish 
consideration 
jesse jackson has become our banquos ghost hovering 
everywhere in the jewish consciousness we do not have to support 
jesse jackson out of some misconceived jewish guilt i could not 
vote for him but it is sick to let him become the lens through 
which jews see and judge all blacks there is a name for that it 
is racism vorspan said 
jackson referred to new york as hymietown in 1984 a remark 
for which he later apologized

as a smashing finish to what has been the 
movie industrys biggest year the major studios are bringing forth 
brightly wrapped packages to make the holiday season equally 
prosperous 
among the offerings meryl streep and roseanne barr in a 
devilish comedy a remake of a guy named joe from steven 
spielberg denzel washington in glory the story of the first 
black regiment in us history sylvester stallone and kurt russell 
in an action film tom cruise as a disabled vietnam veteran paul 
newman as a louisiana governor entangled with a stripper and chevy 
chase on a christmas vacation 
some may hit some may miss no matter what happens the 
business will be celebrating a record year on new years eve 
the box office will be 5 billion versus last years record of 
446 billion predicts daily varietys financial wizard ad 
murphy even more encouraging than ticket prices is the number of 
admissions 15 billion versus 108 billion last year its the 
highest in five years 
while the number of tickets sold has held steady for 28 years at 
around 11 billion that is not a stagnant figure murphy said ten 
years ago theater rentals represented half of the studios 
receipts from feature films this year the income from theaters is 
onequarter of the lifetime receipts the rest coming from such 
markets as videocassettes television network and syndication 
sales cable and pay tv 
much of the reason for the big box office this year comes from 
the increase in screens adds john krier president of exhibitor 
relations which monitors boxoffice figures you can see the 
difference in the number of new complexes that have opened in los 
angeles and other cities many of them are large theaters 
as a sign of the times krier pointed out the record number of 
films that have soared over the 100 million gross mark this year 
batman indiana jones and the last crusade lethal weapon 
2 honey i shrunk the kids and holdovers from late 1988 
rain man and twins 
in addition three films have sold more than 90 million worth 
of tickets and may hit the magic mark dead poets society 
when harry met sally and parenthood the october 
release look whos talking has made more than 85 million in 
five weeks and seems certain to climb over 100 million 
despite negative reviews eddie murphys harlem nights has 
the same potential 
here are some of the major enticements for the holiday moviegoer 
back to the future part ii more time travel with michael 
j fox and the mad professor christopher lloyd 
the war of the roses a black comedy with michael douglas 
kathleen turner and danny devito directed by devito 
glory edward zwick directs denzel washington matthew

handmaids tale the film version of margaret atwoods

she devil with meryl streep as a romance novelist who 
steals the husband of roseanne barr who exacts a fiendish revenge 
henry v kenneth branagh stars and directs in shakespeares 
play about the embattled british king 
born on the fourth of july tom cruise as the disabled

fastpaced buddy picture 
driving miss daisy jessica tandy morgan freeman and dan 
aykroyd in a movie version of the hit play 
family business a generational saga with sean connery 
dustin hoffman and matthew broderick as bank robbers 
why do the studios send so many top attractions into the 
marketplace at the end of the year partly its in hopes that 
academy award voters will be impressed 
history especially last years oscars has proved that films 
released late in the calendar year have a far greater chance of 
academy consideration 
murphy cites the commercial reason twelve percent of the 
years box office comes in the next six weeks thats amazing 
because its really two hot periods thanksgiving and the christmas 
holidays with a huge chasm in between thats when people are 
shopping and kids are still in school some pictures are unable to 
bridge that chasm and they disappear 
the yearend results will be carefully watched by all the 
studios as they calculate their share of the movie market for the 
year through nov 19 murphy figures warner bros ahead with 173 
percent thanks in large part to batman and lethal weapon 
2 columbiatristar follows with 159 percent then comes 
universal at 15 paramount at 146 and buena vista disney at 
142 orion fox and mgmua languish in single digits 
warner bros seems likely to maintain its lead as long as the 
chevy chase and stallonerussell vehicles perform well but if 
back to the future part ii breaks as big as universal hopes 
the company could take over the lead 
since most of the other films are being released in middle to 
late december they probably wont affect the final tally

hurricane hugo the greatest natural 
disaster to befall south carolina in a century swept thousands of 
poor people and the nearpoor into a maelstrom from which many will 
take years to emerge 
disaster is the great equalizer said barbara lohman of the 
american red cross it reduces us all to the same level but the 
poor will take much longer to recover 
im here in the hands of the good man the lord said 
rosalee johnson whose home in the rural hamlin beach section of 
mount pleasant was destroyed by a wall of seawater that accompanied 
the storm 
youve got to do the best you can its hard until something 
comes around she said as debris smoldered in a fire in front of 
the shell of the building that was once her house 
the devastation could push 184000 south carolinians into 
poverty annual income below 12100 for a family of four said 
marvin lare executive director of the south carolina institute on 
poverty and deprivation that would raise the states poverty rate 
from 166 percent to over 19 percent 
in 17 of 24 counties declared federal disaster areas more than 
20 percent of the population was living in poverty before hugo and 
that will increase at least 10 percent he said ten percent 
would be a very conservative estimate considering the damage to 
homes and jobs especially in areas where you already have high 
rates of poverty the economic viability of those areas could not 
readily snap up the difference 
hugo killed 29 people destroyed 5000 homes and did at least 4 
billion damage on sept 21 an estimated 247000 jobs were lost at 
least temporarily with the hardesthit industries those that 
employed large numbers of lowerincome workers such as tourism 
forestry and agriculture 
for many of the poor recovery will come only through the good 
will of volunteers emergency aid and hard work 
mrs johnson who lives in a trailer donated by a church group 
said the federal emergency management agency has been some help 
but they never give you back what you lost fema says its goal 
is to provide emergency aid not replace what was lost or improve 
on victims predisaster standards of living 
nearby vanessa and nathaniel richardson and their four children 
sought shelter in a donated trailer after hugo washed their modest 
white frame house from its foundation insurance covered only 
25000 owed the builder who held a lien on the home 
not only does mrs richardson not have money with which to 
rebuild she was forced to take a leave from her job in a school 
cafeteria because hugorelated damage closed the daycare center 
three of her children attended 
richardson was laid off as a boat builder and now works odd jobs 
mrs richardson has lived in the closeknit community all her 
life but she is beginning to think about moving just as some 
rural poor are expected to do migrate to urban areas seeking jobs 
and housing 
jobs are available many for hurricanerelated cleanup and 
construction but with so many buildings damaged or destroyed 
housing is at a premium 
youre between the devil and the deep blue sea said floy 
deaton executive director of the charleston interfaith crisis 
ministry you can pay exorbitant rent or live in a shelter right 
now people are desperate for places to live its a sellers 
market 
housing out of reach for many now may be more than a 
shortterm problem 
as landlords get insurance checks they may be more willing to 
do more extensive renovations to lowerincome apartments to attract 
higher rents ms deaton said the interfaith crisis ministry 
shelter which usually houses about 100 men a night now shelters 
160 and there are plans to expand 
agencies serving the poor say the extent of the problems may 
just be coming into focus 
last month the state department of social services issued 62 
million in food stamps in addition to the 13 million usually 
issued monthly it will be months though before officials know 
how many more people than before will now regularly need food 
stamps said leon ove administrator of the program 
immediat storm critics complained that the rural poor eached in 
the relief efforts thats changed bough some say 
the poor people are beingut theyre being reached in the last 
stages ullard director of the missions division of thptist 
convention southern baptists comprise thination in the state with 
700000 members in ing the storm the church provided hot meals 
fople 
the churches are working to reach poornot have received aid but 
many may be reticentdisaster centers to apply bullard said our 
hunch is there are a lot of folks who are not able to read or write 
and may be embarrassed to go and apply in clarendon and 
williamsburg counties as many as 30 percent of the adults cant 
read or write to fill out fema forms 
iris campbell the wife of gov carroll campbell had suggested 
that churches adopt families disped by the storm but some of the 
offers of helpuffed the whole idea of being adopted doesnt 
appeal to them because it takes away some of their pride bsaid 
volunteers from baptist churches will spread out across the 
state during the coming months to lend a hand with rebuilding 
while there are no firm figures some officials believe more 
dwellings occupied by the poor were destroyed because many werent 
very sturdy in the first place but rebuilding too elaborately 
could displace the very people the volunteers wantif property 
values go up bullard said 
y to build them back to about where they were be we dont hurt 
the people by increasing the valu ability to insure and pay for 
it he said

in the poor black enclave of hamlin 
beach the air is acrid with mud and decaying marsh grass two 
months after hurricane hugo flies swarm over discarded furniture 
and shacks still shorn of their tin roofs 
relief has been slow in coming to the rural hamlet nestled on a 
marsh in mount pleasant across the intracoastal waterway from the 
posh wild duness 
the 600 residents many descendants of slaves wonder what to do 
about homes in ruins acked along the road and appliances rendered 
useless by a wall of seawater that accompanied thaking it real 
hard theyre depressed said isaac manigault surveying the 
remains of his home that was ripped from the foun ive never 
seen anything like this added manigault who rode out the last 
great hurricanes to hit the area gracie and hazel in the 1950s 
in that house 
flies circle waterlogged mattresses asketball trophies are 
scattered in the yard a neighbors home lies in splinters and 
marsh grase of pickups destroyed in the storm 
manigaults 76yearold mother mary jane braved 135deep 
waters during the height of hugo to walk more than a mileto an 
evacuation shelter her hointends to rebuild 
i dont know how but i hope i can said mrs manigault who 
is lia mobile home i know the good lord will take care of me 
many in the enclave of poor aith to see them through the job of 
rebuilding but faith will e to be augmented by temporal help 
we suilding supplies plywood lumber and the like said the 
rev aj blake pastor of the goodwill ame churing to get 
mobile homes for residents whose houses were destroyed or badly 
damaged 
most dover their losses of those who did few had flood 
insurance to cover damage from the storm surt in some places along 
the coast 
assistance has reached tholated community but the response is 
not as ought to be blake said adding that many residents have 
not heard from the federal emergency management agcy 
compounding that problem is a reluctance by many to ask for help 
you have a lot of pride among these people he said weve 
had reporters come in from out of state and folks say i dont 
want to be on tv i dont want my picture in the newspaper 
for some there is bitterness that relief shipments slow coming 
at first have tapered off even more since attention was diverted 
to the northern california earthquakehat struck oct 17 
there are a lot more poor people in this area than in 
california and we need the help bad said manigault a plumber 
who lost most of his tools 
fema gave him some money for living expenses and clothing and he 
has picked up some additional money doing odd jobs he will 
rebuild but not in the same spot 
im too scared to come back you never know what will happen 
in the future he said his son however hopes to rebuild on the 
family homestead 
a short distance away elizabeth edwards house is little more 
than a shattered framework of lumber a ceiling fan and chandelier 
hang precariously from the rafters ms edwards has moved into a 
mobile home donated by a boone nc christian aid group 
samaritans purse until her home can be rebuilt 
theres nothing we can do but trust in the lord it could have 
been worse she said we just take it as it comes

the republicans have a game plan for the 
battle over congressional redistricting in 1991 wherever you cant 
beat them sue them 
were going to litigate like crazy in the 1990s a party 
lawyer told aides and political advisers to republican governors 
their first objective obviously will be to win at the polls 
the power to shape redistricting plans themselves and to block any 
the gop deems unfairly tilted against them 
court action will come next and it is certain to be widespread 
by both political parties and by other interest groups no matter 
how the lines are drawn in any state somebody will be dissatisfied 
ben ginsberg the republican national committee counsel said 
the party will raise a variety of redistricting issues seeking 
cases that may lead eventually to a definitive supreme court ruling 
on gerrymandering the practice of shaping congressional districts 
for political advantage 
each party has done it when it could and the other party has 
protested democrats had the upper hand in the last redistricting 
because of their state house legislative strength and they are 
likely to hold the advantage again this time 
in addition the democrats got a head start in using the 
techniques of national politics in the state legislative contests 
that are crucial to control of redistricting they set about it 20 
years ago picking the spots most likely to strengthen their hand 
the objective for either party is to control at least one of 
the three points of state decisionmaking on congressional 
districts governor state house or state senate 
it takes all three to write a redistricting plan but any one of 
them can block it so by winning control in at least one branch of 
the state legislature the party out of power can force the 
governor to bargain and compromise on congressional district lines 
being at the table having a hand on the pencil when it comes 
time to draw the lines is what keeps you in the ball game on 
redistricting said norman mmings political director at the 
republican national committee 
that pushes up the stakes for both partiein the state elections 
of 1990 with state legislatures and 36 governors to be chosen for 
terms that will put em in charge of the redistricting based on the 
1990 census 
republican national chairman lee atwater told gop governors 
meeting in hilton head sc earlier this month that redistricting 
is the key to democratic control of the house 
he claimed that the sword of the gerrymander and the shield of 
incumby keep them in control a catchy line even though it is a 
thin comeback to 35 years of democratic majorities 
both national parties have field staffs assigned to help their 
candidates for the state legislatures 
he republicans tested theirs in virginia and new jersey this 
fall they gained four seats in the virginia house but remain a 
minority they lost control of the new jersey assembly so the 
democrats will coedistricting in 1991 in both those states 
going into the 1990 elections the democrats control both 
branches of the legislatures in 29 states the republ only 8 with 
split control in a dozen there are 29 democratic governors 21 
republicans 
those are the numbers that have the republicans looking to 
theourts as a last line of defense not that court challenges to 
redistricting plans are new business 47 of the 50 state blueprints 
wound up in court last time 
contentious from the beginning redistricting got really tough 
60 years ago when congress set the limit on house seats at 435 
that meant that the only way a growing state could gain eat was for 
another state to lose one 
reapportionment based on the 1990 census is expected to mean at 
let six more seats in the house for california probably four for 
florida and three for texas and one apiece for arizona georgia 
north carolina and virginia 
the likely losers are new york 3 seats pennsylvania michigan 
ohio and illinois 2 apiece and one each from iowa kansas 
kentucky massachusetts west virginia and wisconsin 
gearing up for the competition both parties are pumping their 
computers full of voting records that will enable them to predict 
the party leanings of voters not just by districts but by 
neighborhoods block by block 
ginsberg said that means the gerrymanders of thwill be more 
sophisticated and sometimes more difficult to challenge in court 
in addition he said interest groups and wouldbe watchdog 
organizations will be able to get into the game for the price of a 
small computer

ron webeck could barely walk 
couldnt talk and was nearly blind when he was flown to his 
familys home to die of a devastating aidsrelated brain disease 
that was more than four years ago 
today webeck 42 is thriving and researchers are trying to 
find out why 
i realize that im probably not supposed to be here he 
said ive been given an incredible gift im cured 
tests have failed to turn up the aids virus in webecks blood 
even rarer is that scientists can no longer find a trace of the 
virus that caused his brain infection progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy or pml a disease that preys on aids victims 
and usually kills within six months 
sure hes healthy he looks good he feels good and he can do 
anything he wants to do said dr joseph berger a university of 
miami neurologist and aids researcher who wrote about the case in 
the medical journal neurology 
but id have to say with 99 percent certainty that hes 
sitting on a time bomb berger said that what caused his 
illness in the first place is somehow being suppressed and will 
come back 
aids researcher sidney houff who examined webeck at the 
national institutes of health in bethesda md calls his recovery 
remarkable but hes not ready to call it permanent what 
exactly caused him to survive and recover is a mystery we had 
never seen anyone survive from it before up until that point 
everyone with pml had died a miserable death 
theres no telling what may happen in the future im hopeful 
for him but if his immune system is sufficiently challenged 
theres always the chance the virus that causes pml will reappear 
webeck thinks doctors are being overly cautious 
im going on five years now how long do i have to be healthy 
before they finally give up and agree im well 
for webeck who says he lived in the fast lane of san 
franciscos gay community in his 20s the first signs something was 
wrong came in the spring of 1985 while working as a waiter in 
provincetown mass he felt an aggravating twinge in his neck he 
soon began falling down and had to quit because he could no longer 
add customers bills 
a culture of spinal fluid taken at massachusetts general 
hospital eight weeks later showed the presence of the human 
immunodeficiency virus hiv the virus that causes aids a scan 
revealed lesions on his brain and a biopsy showed that pml had 
infected his brain tissue 
after weeks of violent illness and with his weight at just above 
120 doctors suggested webeck make plans to be with his family 
they thought he only had days to live they didnt have to say 
the word it was written all over their faces they rushed me home 
with no medicine nothing 
they figured whats the use 
dr leonard mueke who treated webeck at massachusetts general 
said he had to tell the patient and his family the dismal prognosis 
based on what we knew about other patients similarly 
diagnosed i dont think we had any option but to conclude that he 
didnt have a very good outlook said mueke now at the scripps 
clinic in la jolla calif 
he was sent home with two medications to treat certain 
symptoms of his illness that he opted not to take but its true we 
had nothing to give him for his primary diagnosis of aids and pml 
under his parents care in st petersburg webeck suffered 
through seizures and a bout with depression that ended in his 
attempt to take an overdose of sedatives after 10 days in the 
hospital he survived 
that was a big turning point for me i met death and was 
spared i started to realize i got some work to do before i go 
thats when amazingly webeck started getting better 
without medical treatment only an attitude shaped by books on 
positive thinking and an insatiable will to live webeck began 
forcing himself to eat and teaching himself to walk again by july 
1986 he set out to find a cause for his return to health he wrote 
to every major medical center and aids researcher in the country 
after scores of encouraging but noncommittal responses berger 
at miami and then houff at nih agreed to make extensive 
examinations some procedures were painful such as tapping bone 
marrow and spinal fluid but webeck hoped for clues that could help 
others 
huff who completed more than three weeks of examinations of 
webeck in june found that all components of his immune system were 
basically normal one odd thing was that webeck had the usual 
number of b lymphocytes white blood cells that produce antibodies 
against disease all other pml patients houff had seen had produced 
vast numbers of tainted blood cells that made their way into the 
brain tissue and caused the infection 
his immune system was able to shut down the production of b 
lymphocytes and slow the progress of the disease houff said 
now how he was able to do that is something we dont know 
houff who has moved to the veterans administration hospital in 
washington dc and the faculty of georgetown university 
currently has five other patients involved in his study four have 
lived after bouts with pml but for much shorter periods than 
webeck and all but one are suffering other aidsrelated infections 
meantime the tanned mustachioed webeck is stronger than ever 
recently put in the peculiar circumstance of being a onetime aids 
patient forced to go on a diet when his weight topped 180 pounds 
webeck receives a disability check from social security so he 
has time to speak to churches and civic groups and to care for a 
friend with aids he hopes to travel fulltime to promote aids 
research and to show that the virus does not always mean a death 
sentence 
i cant even count the number of people ive seen die from 
aids he said many of them were so devastated when they heard 
they had it they sort of gave up if people see me maybe they will 
think twice that miracles do happen

doctors social workers and therapists are giving 
a new name to a syndrome they say is draining their ranks 
compassion fatigue 
it strikes people who take on too heavy a load of other peoples 
burdens leaving little time or energy for themselves victims 
become disillusioned and depressed and often start to show cracks 
in their professional veneer 
everyone that i work with is affected by it ive felt it in 
myself said social worker lydia parsons of the midmaine medical 
center in waterville ive had other people tell me about it 
about me before i was aware of it 
compassion fatigue is gaining recognition a halfdozen 
presentations were devoted to it at a recent national associations 
of social workers conference dr edward poliandro of mount sinai 
medical school in new york said people were hanging from the 
rafters to hear his workshop on stress management 
some hospitals are offering support programs that feature stress 
management classes longer staff meetings and even daily walks 
through the park 
as many as 20 percent of caregiving professionals suffer such 
burnout said dr lyle h miller head of the biobehavioral 
institute in boston 
typical victims sound almost like tv stereotypes of social 
workers or doctors working too much sleeping too little 
sacrificing their own lives and families for case after case 
its the best and the brightest and the most committed and the 
most energetic that burn out miller said 
parsons is a classic example as director of the social work 
department at the redingtonfairview hospital in skowhegan maine 
she was running on empty so often she couldnt do anything very 
well i always felt guilty even going for lunch because there 
was always someone waiting for me 
parsons quit that job and after a break in which she worked 
parttime joined midmaine where there are frequent staff 
meetings and peer support 
thomas a welch a former catholic priest who left a bostonarea 
hospice program after a decade of helping the terminally ill deal 
with the prospect of death said he had been happy with his work 
but that it was too consuming to stay good at it for long 
its very heavy emotional material its not something that 
anyone should do for a very long time said welch who left both 
the church and the hospice in 1985 and now owns an italian 
restaurant you get a sense that the whole world is dying after a 
while i heard a friend say i was a downer i should find a way to 
lighten up 
compassion fatigue went recognized for a long time because of 
the stigma attached to it experts say 
very often people in any line of field would be looked down 
upon if they were to acknowledge they were really stressed out 
said poliandro who teaches stress management at the mount sinai 
medical school 
theres a double standard of being in the helping profession 
that we should be able to see it in ourselves before anxiety 
becomes a crisis said parsons 
when perfect employees ignore their stress they can become an 
administrators nightmare miller said they can develop headaches 
backaches fatigue depression and irritability they might start 
to abuse drugs and alcohol or begin not showing up for work 
poliandro said 
the best way to fight compassion fatigue 
take a vacation poliandro and miller agreed 
administrators can help however the boss can force workers to 
take lunches away from their desk outlaw working past 9 pm or 
forbid employees to work weekends poliandro said 
at mount sinai personnel can enlist in the wellness 
program which offers among other activities daily walks through 
nearby central park its a rapid walk to build up their health 
but also they do it just to enjoy being outside and away from the 
pressures of the office poliandro said 
ultimately professionals who help people have to teach 
themselves how to stave off the needs of their own patients said 
miller and poliandro 
humans have a tremendous capacity to be resilient said 
poliandro they just have to be able replenish their energy

the burning was so painful that reyes 
martinez sometimes couldnt touch the soles of her feet skin pain 
from diabetes was so great that about the only place i went was 
to the doctor and to church 
she found cool relief from an unlikely source capsaicin the 
stuff that makes a pepper sting can help ease skin pain 
i said well i eat a lot of the chili peppers i dont care 
how its made im just glad it helps said ms martinez who 
with other patients at the university of texas health science 
center is using the purified extract of hot pepper resin to soothe 
skin irritations caused by diabetes and shingles 
capsaicin is the active ingredient in a medicated cream called 
axsain being tested at the centers pain clinic and 19 other 
medical centers in the united states and canada axsain isnt the 
first medication to use capsaicin but it contains the most 
concentrated dose said joan hoffman a nurse and pain clinic 
investigator who coordinated the studies at the san antonio center 
i think patients come to studies like this because theyre 
hopeful that its going to work its interesting to them because 
its peppers 
lots of peppers it takes more than 1000 pounds of peppers to 
produce one ounce of powdered capsaicin 
the pain clinic is conducting studies using the hot pepper cream 
one involves 20 patients suffering from postherpetic neuralgia 
or pain caused by shingles a medical center in canada also is 
testing 20 patients with that affliction the other san antonio 
study involves 40 diabetics 
though final results are not in preliminary indications are 
that the cream helps ms hoffman said sixtynine percent of 
patients with pain from shingles showed improvement after 
treatment no results are yet in on the diabetics 
dr michael pfeifer of the diabetes research and analysis 
association and humana hospital in lexington ky cited very 
positive experience with it 
capsaicin helps ease burning by blocking pain messages carried 
to the brain by cfiber nerves associated with hot and cold 
sensations researchers say though the applications relieve pain 
eventually the cream causes a burning sensation at first like 
when you touch jalapenos with your hands said ms hoffman 
well you touch this and then if you touch your eye with that 
cream on your hand it burns it wont damage your eyes but it is 
hot 
the side effect prompted some people to quit the study but 
researchers say the burning subsides with the frequency of 
application 
its kind of like youre desensitized to it just like i 
guess eating jalapenos ms hoffman said 
diabetics usually dont have as much problem as shingles 
patients because the pain they sometimes experience often is 
accompanied by slight numbness 
study participant stella murphy 59 said the burning was 
bothersome but she stuck with the study in an effort to soothe her 
shingles pain it really saved me it was a little bit of a 
hassle 
it does burn pretty much just like hot peppers would 
participants applied cream several times a day for eight weeks 
sometimes they were given the real cream and sometimes a placebo 
after that they enter a oneyear test during which they are given 
the real cream and monitored 
axsain is available at about 90 percent of the nations drug 
wholesalers said bryan ackerman a marketing vice president for 
ilinoisbased galenpharma which was formed last year to produce 
the cream galenpharma is treating axsain as a specialty item that 
like medications such as insulin does not require a prescription 
but must be obtained by asking a pharmacist for it 
the company suggests axsain be used under a doctors 
supervision and ackerman said it also has been used effectively in 
patients with postsurgery neuralgia severe pain after an 
operation 
one possible drawback is axsains cost about 50 for a 2ounce 
tube and some insurance companies wont pay because its sold 
overthecounter 
but ms hoffman says the response at her clinic demonstrates how 
patients are hunting for relief we got just a heap of responses 
hundreds of calls its kind of sad because theyre very 
desperate

zebra mussels accidentally imported to 
the great lakes in the last four years are threatening commercial 
and sport fishing and forcing cities and industries into costly 
measures to protect water supplies 
the 2inchlong mollusk first dropped off an oceangoing 
freighter in lake st clair outside detroit has spread through 
lake erie and a colony was found in lake michigan near green bay 
wis said michael donahue executive director of the great lakes 
commission headquartered in ann arbor mich 
intake pipes for industrial plants and municipal water systems 
are among favorite breeding grounds for the greenishstriped 
mussel monroe mich just south of detroit is designing a system 
to bathe the mouth of its intake system with ozoneinfused water in 
hopes of killing the mussels larvae but there is very little that 
apparently can be done to stem the surge of the mussels 
cleveland is also facing heavy bills to rid itself of an 
infestation and detroit has been forced to partially close its 
water plant 
i will guarantee you that it may be detroit and clevelands 
problem today but it is going to be garys and michigan citys 
problem in the near future donahue said theres just no way 
to stop it 
in addition the mussels feed voraciously on algae that other 
fish and mollusks need and could devastate lake eries walleye 
pike one of the lakes most important commercial fish by 
covering spawning grounds said jon stanley of the us fish and 
wildlife service in ann arbor 
those actions in lake erie we expect will reduce the walleye 
population by about half stanley said a good portion of the 
estimated 600 million a year in lake erie fisheries comes from 
walleye 
beaches also could become fouled by the sharpedged mussel 
shells stanley said you can notice the difference on some 
beaches already they used to be nice soft sand but now they 
crunch underfoot as you walk

thirty dogs will have radon 
detectors attached to their collars as part of a study into the 
effects of the odorless gas 
we hope to find an association between radon exposure and lung 
cancer in dogs and therefore in humans said purdue university 
veterinarian robert teclaw the longterm goal is to find out if 
dogs can serve as warning signals on environmental hazards to 
humans 
dogs were chosen because they are in the house as much or more 
than people who work outside the home and because they have a 
shorter lifespan any health hazards from radon will show up 
earlier in the animals than in humans 
dog owners in tippecanoe county where purdue is located this 
month began fitting their pets with the collars which will be worn 
for three months the detectors weigh less than an ounce and are 
the size of a silver dollar film inside the detector is sensitive 
to ions emitted by radon radon coming in contact with the film 
will leave telltale tracks 
radon is a colorless odorless radioactive gas that comes 
predominantly from the decay of radium which occurs naturally in 
the soil and can accumulate in a house exposure over a long period 
of time has been associated with lung cancer and other health risks 
the owners also will be asked to keep diaries of where the dogs 
spent their time and how long they were in each area of the house 
the radon level in the house will be measured separately

crisp red apples and test tubes of tiny 
trees in a lab cooler represent hope for the future of 
chemicalfree fruit production 
already researchers have developed new varieties with natural 
resistance to major diseases reducing the need for fungicides 
said schuyler safi korban head of the university of illinois 
breeding program who hopes genetic engineering can improve the 
process even further 
now with all the concern over the use of chemicals these 
varieties will become more important growers are coming to us 
asking where they can get these varieties said korban illinois 
program has produced nine varieties since the prima was introduced 
two decades ago to resist apple scab disease 
growers might have sprayed fungicide 12 times a season to 
prevent scab disease but resistant varieties have cut illinois 1 
millionayear chemical bill for apples by 60 percent he said 
newer varieties include jonafree redfree williams pride and 
dayton the apples are resistant to scab and in varying degrees 
fire blight apple cedar rust and powdery mildew among the most 
prevalent diseases in the industry and some are even resistant to 
bugs 
consumers were slow to switch from their favorite red delicious 
and jonathan apples korban said but recent controversy 
surrounding the chemical alar and its link with cancer changed 
that alar was used by some growers to keep apples colorful and 
fresh on trees longer extending the harvest 
were making progress in reducing chemical use though it may 
not be as fast as some would like said paul curtis who operates 
a 5000tree orchard and grows varieties developed at the illinois 
including jonafree 
conventional breeding has led to the new varieties of apples 
with disease and insect resistance korban hopes genetic 
engineering will speed and improve the process and give 
alreadypopular varieties resistance 
it is a great idea but these things take years to develop and 
test said ron meyer of the illinois apple and peach marketing 
board it took 25 years to develop good varieties that were 
resistant to scab

atari corp once a major player in the home 
computer game businesshas rolled out a new handheld machine that 
the company hopes will help it compete with industry powerhouse 
nintendo 
the machine called lynx is a onepound portable video game 
system featuring detailed graphics sharp color and sound effects 
toy analysts say the clarity of its game screen and its 
technological capability give lynx an edge over the handheld game 
boy from nintendo of america inc which diplays a fuzzier image in 
black and white 
however lynx retails for around 179 compared with 8999 for 
game boy both systems come with one game cartridge each cables to 
link machines and certain other accessories individual games for 
lynx cost 35 to 40 while game boys average around 25 
atari spared no hyperbole in touting the new device tuesday at a 
new york news conference the company said lynx has been called 
the most innovative consumer electronics product since the sony 
walkman 
the first day that i saw it it just blew my mind atari 
president sam tramiel gushed 
lynx has gotten raves from reviewers and retailers expect it to 
sell well benefiting from the continuing popularity of home video 
game systems that hook up to televisions 
were very enthusiastic about it said john sullivan a 
buyer for toys r us inc who attended ataris news conference 
jeffrey rothenberg a buyer for fao schwarz said the lynx price 
tag of 179 seems justifiable given the quality of the hardware and 
the software

though video games again will be a big hit under 
christmas trees this year dolls familiar from parents childhoods 
speedy new miniature cars and other traditionaltype toys are 
expected to be popular 
us toymakers likely will have only hohum sales during the 
crucial holiday season but business still promises to be slightly 
better than last years flat sales performance 
most manufacturers are looking at flat sales again my gut 
feeling is its going to be a little better than anticipated 
said larry carlat editor of the trade magazine toy amp hobby world 
michael goldstein vice chairman of toys r us inc said the 
retailer forsees good holiday business based on the performance of 
a proven lineup 
we expect to have a good christmas with strength in video

sales remain brisk for nintendo home video game systems 
compatible game cartridges and other gadgets that work with the 
machines that turn televisions into game screens 
fancier pricier machines from other manufacturers featuring 
souped up graphics also are moving quickly confirming that the 
threeyearold video game fad hasnt faded 
from nec corp comes the turbografx16 system and sega of 
america inc is offering genesis both retail for around 200 
making them about twice the price of nintendos device 
handheld computer games could satisfy shoppers searching for 
something slightly different if they can find them

nintendo has been a standout for the past two christmases while 
the rest of the toy business was slumping nintendo of america 
inc the us subsidiary of japans nintendo co ltd estimates 
that its sales will grow to 26 billion this year from 17 
billion in 1988 industrywide electronic game sales will rise to 
34 billion from 23 billion nintendo says 
nintendos success has come at the expense of american 
toymakers who have been controlling costs more closely and taking 
a cautious approach to new product introductions for fear that a 
major flop could mean major losses 
the cost controls and caution have helped us companies 
maintain profitability despite lackluster sales growth 
in 1989 weve seen every toy company run a very tight ship 
said analyst david s leibowitz of american securities corp the 
bottom line for most of the major toy companies will be running 
significantly further ahead than the top line 
the toy industry is expecting sales excluding electronics as 
high as 1325 billion this year according to the toy 
manufacturers of america a trade group the bulk of that business 
is done at christmas sales totaled 1275 billion in 1988 a small 
improvement from 1987s 125 billion 
besides the wave of video games this years popular toys are 
likely to include many that have been around for awhile in one form 
or another stores and industry experts say 
mattel incs barbie remains the darling of the doll world and 
after 30 hasnt encountered a newcomer she cant clobber in sales

ideal brand name and dolly surprise from hasbro incs playskool 
division 
action figures which start at under 10 will have another busy 
christmas teenage mutant ninja turtles from playmates toys inc 
real ghostbusters and robocop from tonka corps kenner products 
division are some redhot figures as is the granddaddy of them 
all hasbros gi joe 
miniature cars have proven their popularity and should have 
another good year led by lewis galoob toys incs micro machines 
super fast cars were rolled out for this christmas amid much 
fanfare but toy watchers say sales could stall once the initial 
advertising roar dies down the batterypowered vehicles have been 
a smash in japan since debuting there in late 1987 sporting names 
like hyper drivers and record breakers these highperformance 
model racing cars zoom at around 30 miles an hour 
the electronic game craze has renewed interest in board games 
some of the soughtafter titles include encore and shark attack 
from hasbros milton bradley co 
but analysts doubt any of the abundant lineup of toys will be 
sensational enough to steal the limelight from video games 
there are not a lot of new products that are making noise

global wheat supplies are at their lowest 
level since the early 1970s but an agriculture department report 
predicts larger crops next year 
world wheat output in 198990 is forecast at a record 532 
million metric tons up 6 percent from last year although 
consumption is expected to rise only 1 percent demand will once 
again exceed supply 
many have expressed concerns that current low stocks will not 
be sufficient to buffer large production shortfalls the 
departments economic research service said in a preliminary report 
tuesday 
however it added relatively high world prices and the 
lower acreage reduction requirements in the us 1990 wheat program 
are expected to result in an increase in world production next 
year 
the 198990 us wheat marketing year began june 1 and includes 
this years harvest of 204 billion bushels about 556 million 
tons agency economists project that wheat prices at the farm might 
average 385 to 4 per bushel over the entire marketing year 
compared with 372 in 198889 
but the agency also cautioned that greaterthanexpected 
export demand or problems with next years crop would be the most 
likely causes of a sharp price runup in the second half of the 
marketing year 
in another report the governments joint agricultural weather 
facility operated by the commerce and agriculture departments 
said that winter wheat planted this fall for the 1990 harvest was 
in mostly fair to good condition in the week of nov 1319 
high winds and lack of soil moisture caused condition to 
decline in the great plains especially in nebraska the report 
said in kansas oklahoma and texas poor secondary root 
development forced producers to limit livestock grazing on fall 
wheat pasture 
the winter wheat crop was said to be good to fair in montana 
and colorado and fair to good in oregon good to fair in 
washington and good in idaho corn belt winter wheat was 
reported in good to fair condition

texas instruments inc could reap hundreds of 
millions of dollars in royalties a year from japanese computerchip 
manufacturers if a patent granted recently by japan for the basic 
computer chip is enforced analysts say 
texas instruments officials on tuesday confirmed japans 
decision to issue the patent late last month for the integrated 
circuit which texas instruents engineer jack kilby first 
demonstrated in september 1958 
it is tis belief that this basic patent covers virtually all 
integrated circuits manufactured in japan said stan victor a 
texas instruments spokesman 
texas instruments officials refused to speculate how much money 
the dallasbased company could make from the royalties over the 
11year life of the patent 
but richard j agnich a texas instruments senior vice 
president said we believe that a longterm trend supporting 
enforcement of intellectual property rights is now in place and 
that the opportunity exists for ti to earn a significant ongoing 
stream of royalty income 
analysts said the patent could also aid texas instruments as it 
renegotiates licensing agreements for its products with a japanese 
firms in 1990 
as were renegotiating our license agreements this becomes 
part of our intellectual portfolio victor said 
kiyo ota of nomura research institute said texas instruments 
with the patent could negotiate strong agreements in product areas 
in which the company is not currently involved such as 
highdefinition television 
the integrated circuit is found in every computer and most 
electronic devices and its discovery helped texas instruments 
become one of the worlds first hightechnology companies 
but japan has become the worlds largest chip producer making 
as many chips as all other nations combined 
us companies are battling to regain dominance in the 
semiconductor field in one such effort several companies 
including texas instruments and the government formed the 
austinbased sematech consortium to bolster semiconductor research 
texas instruments shares jumped 250 tuesday to close at 32 on 
the new york stock exchange after news of the patent reached the 
market the number of ti shares changing hands totaled more than 
216 million compared with average daily volume of about 371000 
shares 
the japanese journal nihon keizai shimbun reported that 
integrated circuit manufacturers in japan could pay patent fees of 
a minimum of 3 percent of the total value of their chip production 
to texas instruments 
two analysts said such royalties could exceed 100 million 
annually to the electronics and defense company the japanese 
journal reported an even higher figure saying texas instruments 
could be paid 600 million to 700 million a year based on the size 
of the japanese integrated circuit market which saw sales of 15 
billion to 17 billion this year 
if i were to make an operating guess on the front end and i 
would underline guess this could mean 100 million a year to ti 
that would be a reasonable first working guess said david 
garcia an analyst with howard weil labouisse friedrichs a new 
orleans brokerage 
ota said the figure could reach 500 million annually from a 3 
percent royalty but added that negotiations on joint ventures and 
cross licensing agreements could lower the percentage 
texas instruments earned 2558 million on sales of 466 
billion for the first nine months of this year its revenue for the 
period included 125 million in royalties 
the company originally asked for the japanese patent in 1960 
but the japan patent office did not make its award for a 
semiconductor device until oct 30 the patent will last until 
nov 27 2001 texas instruments said 
kilby and texas instruments were awarded a us patent for the 
integrated circuit in 1964

media tycoon christopher skase who 
just six weeks ago was on the verge of becoming a hollywood studio 
magnate has joined the growing ranks of fallen australian 
corporate giants 
a year ago the former fianance reporter was hailed as a 
whizkid after buying the channel 7 television network in australia 
and at age 41 becoming the nations youngest media baron 
but after weeklong crisis talks with his bankers skases qintex 
australia ltd went into receivership tuesday with debts of 16 
billion his undoing followed a failed 15 billion bid for the 
us movie company mgmua communications co 
skases swift fall was helped by media magnate rupert murdochs 
counterbidding for mgmua mgmua terminated its proposed deal with 
qintex after the australian company failed to produce a 50 million 
letter of credit 
skase made his fortune buying a rundown retail company in 
tasmania 15 years ago called qintex and turning it into a media 
conglomerate by buying and selling radio stations and upscale 
resorts in queensland and hawaii 
he is the latest victim of a series of corporate collapses that 
have claimed some of the big names in australian business such as 
george herscu whose hooker corp with 1 billion worth of 
holdings in the united states went into receivership earlier this 
year hooker said last week it will close six of its seven b 
altman department stores in the united states after failing to find 
a buyer its other us holdings include the bonwit teller fashion 
chain and several shopping malls 
alan bond whose media and brewing empire has debts of 7 
billion an official audit last week questioned the viability of it 
continuing as an ongoing concern his holdings include the g 
heileman brewing co of the united states 
robert holmes a court who reportedly was australias richest 
man until the october 1987 stock market crash wounded him 
ariadne australia ltd headed by new zealand highflyer bruce 
judge which was one of australias fastestgrowing companies until 
the stock market crash saw it report a major operating loss in 1988 
laurie connell whose rothwells ltd investment bank collapsed 
after the stock market crash 
skase fell from budding hollywood studio magnate to the ranks of 
australias corporate losers in just six weeks in september he 
was on the verge of wrapping up the biggest deal of his life by 
november he was locked in a fight for corporate survival 
unable to deliver the letter of credit after bidding for mgmua 
skase was forced to put his us affiliate los angelesbased 
qintex entertainment inc in chapter 11 bankruptcycourt 
protection from creditors the australian stock exchange then 
suspended trading in qintex shares when the company failed to 
respond to its queries about its finances 
the company applied to the supreme court in victoria state late 
monday to enter receivership to prevent the groups foreign and 
australian banks from trying to sell its assets 
the collapse raised the prospect that channel 7 one of three 
national networks could be taken over by foreign banks in 
violation of australias foreign ownership laws it coincided with 
an investigation by regulators into the finances of all three 
commercial television networks following ownership changes that 
have plunged the industry into financial crisis 
peter buchanan a lawyer representing qintex australia and a 
group of associated companies told the supreme court on tuesday 
that the company wants to keep operating in an attempt to pay its 
creditors 
buchanan said it was vital that seven network and other qintex 
television stations continue operating so they do not lose their 
broadcasting licences 
the supreme court said the qintex group had fallen into serious 
financial difficulty and that the groups affairs were complex 
and interrelated 
it said the significant advantage of a courtappointed receiver 
and manager was that the groups affairs would be managed as a 
whole 
qintexs problems have highlighted a growing concern about 
corporate debt in australia seventyfive percent of the nations 
18 billion foreign debt is from the private sector

striking telephone workers reached a tentative 
settlement with new york telephone and its parent nynex early 
wednesday to end a 16weekold sometimes violent walkout a union 
spokesman said nynex declined to confirm that 
the settlement was announced by bob master spokesman for the 
striking communications workers of america however a nynex 
spokesman john bonomo said he was not aware of any agreement 
we have a settlement with our signature ready which has not 
been signed by the cwa bonomo said 
if ratified the 40000 striking cwa members would begin 
returning to work on monday 
with this proposed accord we have saved our health care 
said jan pierce cwa vice president 
the enormous sacrifices that our members made their will 
their strength their bedrock commitment their unbreakable spirit 
will never be forgotten 
the report of the settlement came one day after 20000 members 
of the cwas allies the international brotherhood of electrical 
workers went back to work for new england telephone 
the ibew and cwa members went on strike aug 6 against nynex 
one of four regional telephone companies struck that week actions 
against the other three companies were settled by september 
the biggest issue in the nynex strike was a company attempt to 
shift the cost of health benefits 
the settlement does not include any healthcare costshifting or 
deductibles said master nor does it include a lumpsum bonus or 
profitsharing plan the company had previously offered 
it includes wage increases of 3 percent the first year and 15 
percent in each of the remaining two years of the contract plus a

financier charles h keating jr has nothing 
to say to congress about his failed lincoln savings and loan 
association or the estimated 2 billion the collapse will cost 
taxpayers 
keating refused to answer questions tuesday from the house 
banking committee citing his fifth amendment protection against 
selfincrimination 
the phoenix ariz millionaires brief appearance late in the 
afternoon came after lawmakers sharply criticized m danny wall 
the nations chief thrift regulator wall received little sympathy 
during 10 hours of testimony in which he denied responsibility for 
the cost to taxpayers of the lincoln bailout 
rep henry b gonzalez dtexas the committees chairman has 
called for walls resignation and said the regulators political 
future in part depended on his performance before the committee 
however both democrats and republicans said they were unimpressed 
by his response 
somehow it rings very hollow to say the huge regulatory 
bureaucracy could do nothing did nothing as the institution went 
down gonzalez said 
the thrust that i get out of the testimony is poor danny 
wall too busy to do the job that i have been assigned to do 
said rep jim bunning rky 
the committee has been focusing on why wall rejected a may 1987 
recommendation from field examiners in san francisco that the 
government seize lincoln based in irvine calif and stop its 
losses 
wall and his two top aides enforcement director rosemary 
stewart and supervision director darrel dochow maintain that the 
san francisco officials never gathered the legal proof needed to 
shut lincoln down 
the discrepancies between the testimony from wall and his aides 
and witnesses from earlier hearings was so great that rep chalmers 
wylie of ohio the panels senior republican declared the areas 
of disagreement are disparate enough that someone has perjured 
himself 
before and after his appearance keating rebuffed reporters 
shouted questions but he issued a written statement saying it is 
possible he will testify after his legal problems are resolved 
as chairman of lincolns parent company american continental 
corp keating faces a federal grand jury investigation in los 
angeles he is the target of a 11 billion fraud and racketeering 
suit brought by federal regulators 
committee aides were hoping that keating who has a reputation 
for outspokenness would be unable to resist responding to the 
previous torrent of criticism 
but keating said on the advice of counsel i respectfully 
exercise my constitutional prerogative and privilege and 
decline to answer questions here today 
late in the hearing gonzalez revealed that documents examined 
by the committee show that on the day before lincoln was seized by 
the government april 13 1989 wall received two telephone calls 
from a keating associate barbara thomas she is a former member of 
the securities and exchange commission under president carter 
wall said he could remember only that he received the calls and 
that thomas was urging approval of an application to sell lincoln 
which the agency turned down 
gonzalez pointed out that as the calls were made american 
continental was declaring bankruptcy regulators say that action 
complicates their efforts to reduce the estimated 2 billion cost 
of the failure to taxpayers 
according to committee aides american continental made a 
250000 unsecured threeyear loan to thomas in december 1987 
gonzalez said he will decide later whether further hearings are 
necessary to explore other aspects of the lincoln disaster 
in a separate development tuesday sen john mccain rariz 
wrote the senate ethics committee that he never acted improperly on 
behalf of lincoln although keating gave him 112000 in campaign 
money and use of an airplane 
i have every confidence that you and the committee will 
determine that there has been no improper conduct on my part and 
that you will clear my name mccain wrote ethics committee 
chairman howell heflin dala and vice chairman warren rudman 
rnh 
mccain is one of five senators who received campaign money from 
keating and in april 1987 met with regulators to discuss their 
supervision of lincoln all five lawmakers have denied wrongdoing 
but the ethics committee has hired an outside counsel to gather 
information in the case

charles h keating jr and his family 
accused of stealing millions of dollars from his failed savings and 
loan have large sums of money in bank accounts and companies 
abroad according to court papers and congressional testimony 
keating the head of american continental corp the phoenix 
holding company that owned the lincoln savings and loan 
association still holds accounts in london paris and at least 
three cities in switzerland geneva zurich and lausanne court 
papers say 
in one case keating channeled more than 10 million in lincoln 
funds to the panamabased southbrook holding co which federal 
examiners said was owned by american continental 
it doesnt surprise me that mr keating finally found gen 
manual antonio noriega because thats one reason noriega has been 
able to survive you have a tremendous volume of bank corporate 
monies there house banking committee chairman henry gonzalez 
dtexas said at a recent hearing 
the failure of lincoln is expected to cost taxpayers 2 billion 
making it the nations costliest savings and loan failure 
keatings dealings overseas were detailed in a class action 
lawsuit filed in los angeles this week on behalf of thousands of 
people who bought 250 million in worthless junk bonds issued by 
american continental 
keating who still earns 400000 annually as the chairman of 
the bankrupt american continental denies wrongdoing in the lincoln 
case he claims he is the victim of harassment by the federal 
government 
other information came out at a hearing on irvine califbased 
lincoln before the house banking committee 
joseph w cotchett an attorney in burlingame calif who 
represents bond holders alleged in court papers that keating and 
his immediate family received well over 34 million of lincoln 
money for their own personal use 
keating and his wife mary elaine also used the american 
continental jet to make frequent trips to switzerland france 
england and ireland cotchett said 
the lawsuit shows a host of complicated financial transactions 
some of which cotchett claims were designed to cover up phony deals 
for instance the papers said keatings son charles keating 
iii once visited switzerland ostensibly to set up a foreign 
currency trading company with others in zurich and in dusseldorf 
germany the senior keating eventually paid a firm called 
gesellschaft fur trend analysen some 20 million for unknown 
reasons the lawsuit said 
it is alleged that payments served as sham transactions to 
cover up keatings transfer of monies from the united states to 
switzerland the suit said 
the lawsuit contends that in a similar transaction keating used 
lincoln money to form a subsidiary called dungiven investments 
dungiven then diverted 175 million to a bahamian investment 
trading company called trendinvest ltd 
millions of dollars were channeled through this subsidiary in 
supposed losses before the stock was sold back to trendinvest 
the lawsuit said 
this was a sham to hide the transfer of money from the united 
states to offshore banks cotchett said 
keatings american continental also had ties to the londonbased 
kuwaiti investment office which makes real estate investments on 
behalf of the kuwait government 
specifically kuwaiti investment had a 45 percent interest in 
the phoenician resort a 605room luxury complex near scottsdale 
ariz the resort was owned by lincoln 
last week federal regulators dismissed keating and 23 family 
members and associates from positions at the phoenician

lockheed corp said texas billionaire 
harold c simmons has announced his intention to increase his 
ownership of lockheed stock to 15 percent from 106 percent 
the dallas investor has been buying stock since last year in the 
defense contractor which among other things builds the 
radarevading stealth fighter plane his average cost per share has 
been 48 according to analyst howard rubel with the cyrus j 
lawrence inc brokerage in new york 
lockheeds stock had fallen well below that level recently 
it was battered by the announcement last week that lockheed is 
300 million over budget on development of a subhunting plane for 
the navy and may show a loss for the year the stock also was hurt 
by defense secretary dick cheneys statements over the weekend that 
he plans to significantly cut defense spending 
the stock closed up 112 to 37 tuesday on the new york stock 
exchange 
that would mean simmons has shown a paper loss of more than 74 
million on the 674 million shares he had purchased before 
tuesdays announcement that he wanted to buy more 
mr simmons obviously is making an attempt to salvage some of 
his losses by hoping the stock price rises again rubel said 
simmons revealed his plan to buy additional stock in a letter 
received tuesday by daniel m tellep lockheeds chairman the 
company said 
in response to speculation he might try to take over the 
company lockheed created an employee stock ownership plan that 
holds 17 percent of the companys stock effectively blocking an 
unfriendly takeover 
lockheed also has a poison pill plan to discourage hostile 
suitors as amended last december when simmons announced he would 
increase his investment in lockheed to more than 15 million the 
plan allows shareholders to buy stock at a discount if a group or 
person acquires 20 percent of the companys common shares 
outstanding 
in a filing with the securities and exchange commission in 
october simmons said had not changed his plans for his stake in 
lockheed in his original statement he said his purchases were 
for purposes of investment and in order to acquire a significant 
equity interest in the company

a federal appeals court has taken up a 
challenge to a securities and exchange commission rule that the 
agency says eliminates unequal voting rights among corporate 
shareholders 
but the business roundtable an association representing chief 
executives of 200 major corporations claims the rule interferes 
with corporate governance which comes under the jurisdiction of 
individual states 
the sec claims it has a right to impose the rule as part of its 
mission under the 1934 law that created it to protect public 
shareholders 
both sides presented arguments to a threejudge panel of the 
us circuit court of appeals for the district of columbia on 
tuesday 
the panel consisting of circuit judges james l buckley 
stephen f williams and harry t edwards reserved decision 
sec rule 19c4 adopted in july 1988 prohibits publicly traded 
corporations from weakening the voting power of those who own 
existing stock by issuing new classes of stock with superior or 
supervoting rights 
the sec may bar an offending companys stock from being listed 
on any stock exchange regulated by the sec or with the national 
association of securities dealers stock quotation system 
the sec turns the statute on its head said robert d 
rosenbaum attorney for the business rountable which ranges from 
such corporate giants as american express co to xerox corp and 
quaker oats co to and citicorp 
although the sec is trying to protect the shareholder voting 
rights the rule would prevent company executives from issuing 
stock that could give insiders the power to thwart a hostile 
takeover said rosenbaum 
the business roundtable sought to have the appeals court find 
either that the sec exceeded its authority in imposing the rule or 
that the section of securities law that gives the sec such power 
should be declared unconstitutional 
in legal papers submitted to the appeals court the business 
roundtable contended the publicly traded companies affected by the 
rule 19c4 would be banished from trading in the nations public 
securities markets if they took any action or issued any security 
prohibited by the rule including actions they are otherwise 
permitted to take under state law 
rosenbaum told reporters outside the courtroom the group 
believed it was up to corporations and their shareholders to decide 
how to allocate voting power as required by federal law 
the sec claims the power not just to regulate but to approve 
certain capital structures he said 
but jacob h stillman associate general counsel for the sec 
countered were not attempting to do these broad things they 
claim 
without the supervoting rights rule shareholders could be 
stripped of their ability to participate in management and 
confidence in the securities markets could be impaired the sec 
said in its legal brief 
voting rights cant be taken away from existing shareholders 
thats all this case deals with said stillman 
the state of ohio filed a friendofthecourt brief contending 
the sec was usurping the states authority over corporate 
governance without a clear indication otherwise by congress the 
sec should not be given the authority that congress itself has 
not exercised said cordelia a glenn an ohio assistant attorney 
general 
the brief was joined by delaware kentucky michigan idaho 
pennsylvania wyoming nebraska north carolina missouri georgia 
and west virginia

the new navy blue uniforms for flight attendants 
at eastern airlines and continental airlines have some striking 
eastern employees seeing red 
attendants at the two airlines both subsidiaries of texas air 
corp are trading in their old uniforms a purplish color at 
continental and brown at eastern for new navy blue outfits 
the new uniforms due early next year have fueled speculation 
that texas air chairman frank lorenzos master plan is to combine 
the two airlines as the striking eastern unions have long charged 
it sounds like some kind of a move toward unification ted 
bybel a striking eastern pilot said tuesday the uniform is a 
very strong symbol 
eastern has been in chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization since 
early march when its pilots machinists and flight attendants 
struck the miamibased airline eastern has been replacing the 
union workers and rebuilding as a smaller carrier 
lorenzo put houstonbased continental through a chapter 11 
bankruptcy in 1983 also restructuring it as a nonunion carrier 
he said last august that he is considering selling all or part of 
continental 
the unions have charged that lorenzo has repeatedly siphoned off 
eastern assets to continental as part of a plan to eventually merge 
the two 
the airlines have refuted the charges texas air spokesman art 
kent in houston said tuesday that the timing of the new uniforms is 
only a coincidence since they have been in the planning stage for 
more than a year at continental and since shortly after easterns 
bankruptcy filing 
its a very professional color kent said in a telephone 
interview referring to the new navy blue 
he noted that the new continental uniforms are doublebreasted 
while easterns are singlebreasted and the stripes on the two 
sets differ 
navy blue has become the color of choice for airline uniforms 
kent said noting that carriers including united airlines and 
american airlines use it

philip morris cos is expected to offer credit 
card holders home delivery of its cartier vendome cigarettes early 
next year the wall street journal reported today 
marketing consultants say the new yorkbased tobacco giant is 
counting on the technique to give cartier vendome an added air of 
exclusivity the company introduced the pearltipped cigarettes in 
los angeles in october they were previously available only in 
europe 
though philip morris executives said two months ago they would 
try home subscriptions they refused to discuss any aspect of 
the plan the journal reported 
it strikes me as an innovative strategy said george 
widemann president of grey direct the directmarketing division 
of grey advertising but one with interesting precedents in other 
product categories 
packagedgoods companies are relying more and more on 
directmarketing tactics such as catalogues and newsletters to 
reach the small markets for their products 
experts say the directmarketing approach would provide tobacco 
companies with lists of dedicated smokers cigarette advertising on 
television has been prohibited since 1971 
the market for luxury tobacco comprises less than 1 percent of 
total cigarette sales in the united states 
cartier vendome cigarettes packed in oval boxes bearing the 
house of cartiers logo cost about twice as much as an average 
pack of cigarettes 
philip morris is distributing the brand through upscale hotels 
restaurants and tobacco shops 
because taxes account for a large percentage of cigarette 
prices some directmarketing experts say philip morris may find 
barriers to selling mailorder cigarettes across state lines 
several states are requiring direct mailers to charge their 
customers state sales tax 
its one of the top issues facing the directmarketing 
industry said robert l sherman general counsel for the direct 
marketing association

not been notified about it the newspaper said the memo said the 
cuts would be described to gms top managers nov 30 
gm spokeswoman patricia malloy declined to confirm or deny the 
memo or whether such a plan was under consideration 
are we looking at head count we continue to look at 
employment levels she said as we head into the 90s having 
the right number of people with the right skills who are adding 
value throughout the corporation is absolutely critical

gm chairman roger smith president robert stempel and others meets 
monthly but that nov 30 is not a regularly scheduled meeting

hourly workers in the united states according to the companys 
public interest report that total is down 17 percent from 126078

across the board at the end of the third quarter of this year the 
company said it had made 11 billion in cuts since the program 
began

on the eve of the years biggest travel 
weekend auto safety advocates are pushing everything from air bags 
to keeping people from catching zs at the wheel to prevent highway 
deaths 
groups ranging from the heavily funded insurance institute for 
highway safety to the volunteerrun motor voters issued statements 
or held news conferences tuesday designed to promote safety 
more than 400 people die on the nations highways each 
thanksgiving day weekend there were 438 fatalities last year 
down from a high of 764 in 1968 
at a washington seminar on sleep loss and driving safety 
experts said sleep plays a key role in up to 400000 traffic 
accidents a year 
more than 20 percent of all drivers have fallen asleep at the 
wheel at least once said william c dement director of a sleep 
disorders clinic at stanford university 
dement said adults can build up a sleep debt that grows 
larger if they avoid needed sleep over several days and that 
americans generally dont get enough sleep a lack of needed sleep 
can impair driving he said 
charles czeisler of bostons brigham and womens hospital said 
family gettogethers often keep thanksgiving weekend travelers from 
getting enough sleep before they head for the road he said some 
sleepdeprived drivers will become aware they are operating on 
automatic pilot but they just wont be able to respond to warning 
signals in time 
meanwhile a spokesman for the national highway transportation 
safety administration responded to three auto safety and consumer 
groups who accused the agency of failing to promote and enforce 
auto air bag rules 
public citizen the center for auto safety and motor voters 
criticized both the government and the auto industry at a news 
conference to promote air bags which are expected to be in 
onethird of the 10 million 1990 cars to be sold in the united 
states 
the agency has required air bags or automatic front seat belts 
in all 1990 cars 
nhtsa spokesman barry mccahill said the agency has made the 
promotion of all types of occupant protection its number one 
priority 
a virginia woman appearing at the news conference with the 
safety coalition said she survived a 110 mph headon collision 
because an air bag popped out of her steering wheel 
its truly good to be here literally said denise rusk of 
kilmarnock va who said she could not remember what happened 
after a ford station wagon crossed into her lane on sept 22 1988 
and smashed headon into her car both cars were going 55 mph 
putting the force of the impact at 110 mph 
showing no sign of her injuries mrs rusk said she had 36 
broken bones but the air bag prevented her from slamming into the 
steering wheel and ashboard of her new chrysler lebaron 
convertible the driver of the other car which did not have an air 
bag was killed 
its probably too late for anyone to change the family car for 
the weekend trip but the insurance institute for highway safety on 
tuesday released its first ranking of cars according to the 
likelihood of a rider dying in one of them 
the analysis based on traffic accidents involving 198587 
models over three years ending in 1988 covers the 103 most popular 
cars sold in america 
chevrolet corvette showed the highest death rate per 10000 
vehicles registered 
volvos 740760 had the lowest death rate 
the results show large cars generally were safer and small cars 
more dangerous but there were exceptions and results varied widely 
among car sizes and among different models of the same car 
the institute used a complex formula to predict what death rate 
might be expected according to size typical driver age and driver 
sex 
based on this nine cars performed far better than predicted 
nissan sentra twodoor volvo 740760 fourdoor volkswagen jetta 
fourdoor ford taurus station wagon honda prelude chevrolet 
cavalier station wagon ford escort station wagon toyota celica 
and toyota cressida fourdoor 
seven cars performed far worse than predicted chevrolet 
chevette fourdoor plymouth reliant fourdoor chevrolet celebrity 
twodoor dodge aries fourdoor chevrolet corvette chrysler 
lebaron fourdoor and chevrolet sprint twodoor

in a bid to upgrade rail services after 
1992 the european community commission wednesday proposed to open 
the ec railway sector to private enterprise 
it said the railways should remain state monopolies but that 
private firms must be able to use them to ship goods in competition 
with the rail companies 
currently only the ec railway companies can handle goods 
shipped by rail 
roads waterways and airspace are considered public and 
accessible to all but this principle of free access has not been 
applied to the railways ec transport commissioner karel van 
miert said in a statement 
he said the rail companies must remain responsible for 
maintaining and upgrading the rail networks 
but their service activities must become separate branches to 
compete with private enterprise he added 
over the last decade intraec traffic by road air and rail 
increased by 400 percent according to ec figures 
although ec road and airways are increasingly congested van 
miert said transport by rail remains underused despite its 
potential for growth 
to reverse that he said the ec states must improve rail 
infrastructure between member states and to ensure a smoother 
transit of goods from one ec state to another 
the open market of 1992 opens promising perspective for 
railroads in the trade bloc van miert said 
on tuesday transport ministers of six ec states which are 
considering a highspeed passenger train network asked for ec 
funds 
van miert said such networks were subject to special 
attention but did not indicate if any ec funds would be earmarked 
for that purpose

president bush vetoed legislation creating a 
special congressional panel to investigate the 8monthold strike 
against eastern airlines saying congress was improperly trying to 
interfere in contract and court disputes 
this would hinder saving eastern airlines and the jobs of its 
employees bush said in a statement accompanying his veto the 
white house announced the action less than 30 minutes before the 
midnight tuesday deadline for the president to act or allow the 
measure to become law without his signature 
bush in a decision that angered organized labor and 
particularly easterns unions said it was unrealistic to believe 
the commission could find a solution to the bitter strike within 
the 45 days called for in the measure 
he also said that any intervention by congress would interfere 
with easterns attempts to reorganize in bankruptcy court 
the bankruptcy court is charged with protecting the overall 
interests of the concerned parties in an evenhanded fashion bush 
said in his veto message this state of affairs should not be 
disturbed by new legislation 
congress did not attempt a veto override as both houses rushed 
through other business and adjourned for the year early today but 
sen edward m kennedy dmass said he would try to bring the 
measure up again when congress returns in january 
organized labor lobbied heavily for the measure and several 
union leaders said a bush veto would sour labors already strained 
relations with the white house 
by failing to sign the eastern bill the president embraced the 
meanest workerhating boss in the nation frank lorenzo george 
kourpias president of the striking machinists union said today 
lorenzo is chairman of texas air corp easterns parent company 
it is utterly disgraceful that the administration goes out of 
its way to support and identify with workers in poland china and 
eastern europe yet it isnt even willing to hear what a 
congressional factfinding commission might have to say about the 
8monthold strike at eastern said skip copeland head of the 
striking eastern pilots 
henry duffy president of the air line pilots association 
called bushs veto a deliberate slap at american workers 
eastern released a letter sent today to bush from lorenzo 
thanking the president for political courage and a clear vision 
of the need to keep the airline industry competitive 
it was the second time bush has acted to keep the government out 
of the strike 
he refused in march to use his power to block the strike by 
naming an emergency mediation board saying he believed the dispute 
should be settled by the company and its unions 
the measure would have created a commission consisting of two 
senators and two representatives one republican and one democrat 
from each chamber charged with studying the strike and proposing 
a contract solution 
the measure also would have required the commission to suggest 
ways to maintain competitiveness in the airline industry and to 
protect employees of airlines that file for bankruptcy protections 
the measure called on the commission to issue a report within 45 
days its findings would not have been binding on bush but could 
have led to additional legislation 
the eastern strike began march 4 when workers represented by the 
machinists union walked off the job at the end of a federally 
mandated cooling off period the airlines union pilots and flight 
attendants have for the most part honored machinists pickets 
miamibased eastern filed for court protection from creditors 
under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy laws days after the strike began 
and has told the us bankruptcy court in new york it plans to 
emerge as a smaller carrier eastern has continued to operate 
throughout the strike adding flights as it hires replacement 
pilots mechanics and flight attendants 
after bush refused to intervene labor lobbied congress to pass 
a measure demanding that the president name an emergency mediation 
board but the democratic sponsors could not muster enough support 
for that proposal settling instead for the measure creating a 
congressional investigation 
the strike came after the machinists union refused to accept 
concessions demanded by eastern the unions who have tried 
unsuccessfully to arrange the sale of the airline contend texas 
air has siphoned eastern cash and assets and wants to use 
bankruptcy to bust the unions 
texas air has said concessions by easterns union workers were 
necessary for the airline to remain competitive

circle k corp has announced a restructuring 
plan which includes selling unprofitable stores and possibly parts 
of the company to try to get rid of its mounting debt 
the restructuring plan was presented tuesday during the 
phoenixbased companys annual shareholders meeting here 
the plan calls for bringing in investment advisers to develop a 
financialrestructuring plan and naming william a franke board 
member and financial consultant to oversee the plan 
it also calls for the convenience store chain to open no new 
stores for several years to reduce capital spending and store 
inventories it also calls for the hiring of senior operating and 
merchandising executives who are trained to make the company more 
competitive 
there are 4685 circle k stores throughout the united states 
although the company now owns only about 12 percent of them 
the company said the restructuring was not an indication that it 
was preparing to seek protection from creditors under federal 
bankruptcy laws 
the restructuring just means were taking a look at our asset 
base company chairman karl eller said 
he said circle ks senior management must develop a more 
cohesive plan to make the company more competitive 
the company faces continued competition from other 
conveniencestore chains and also from supermarkets which often 
are staying open 24 hours eller added 
its going to be tough he said while we expect positive 
cash flow it will take several quarters to do it 
but the companys restructuring plan was met with skepticism by 
some shareholders who fear management may not be able to turn the 
company around 
i dont think anybody in this room is happy with the financial 
situation said don jackel a phoenix graphics consultant who 
owns 600 of the companys 436 million common shares i heard the 
words but i didnt sense any direction whatsoever i just saw some 
people going through the motions thats all 
after aggressive expansion left the company with a heavy debt 
load circle k reported an operating loss of 55 million for 
fiscal 1989 it has 11 billion in longterm debt 
circle k management put the company up for sale last summer but 
in september decided to stop looking for a buyer

economists sometimes call it the cows on the 
common problem 
when each town in new england had a common field where cows were 
free to graze more and more farmers would bring their animals 
until finally not enough grass was left for anyone 
todays commercial fishermen ply new england waters in 
milliondollar boats with fishfinding sonar devices but they are 
in essentially the same position as 18th century farmers squabbling 
over fodder 
with demand for fish rising and no restriction on the number of 
us fishing boats the new england fleet has grown so fast that it 
is quickly depleting the stocks of haddock cod and other staple 
species fishermen and scientists say 
im a skipper and a boat owner ive got a mortgage and a 
family to support and its getting real scary said john raymond 
of south berwick maine as he stood on a boston pier earlier this 
year with a spike in his hand unloading 22000 pounds of fish 
after eight days at sea 
raymond 38 said he and his three crewmen on the 86foot 
trawler olympia are staying at sea longer and fishing more 
aggressively often hauling nets through the night but their 
catch is declining 
seven or eight years ago i would get 60 70 maybe 80000 
pounds every trip he said now im lucky to get 20000 
he is not alone all along the coast from portland maine to 
providence ri fishermen are finding fewer haddock cod 
flounder and redfish the bottomfeeding groundfish that provide 
the flaky white mildflavored fillets that americans consumers 
prefer 
the stocks of these species are at alltime lows and its 
touchandgo whether theyll ever fully come back said stephen 
h clark a biologist with the national marine fisheries service in 
woods hole 
unless something is done to reduce the fish mortality rate 
the probability is that yields will continue to decline and the 
risk that these stocks will never recover is going to increase 
the declining number of fish is causing turmoil throughout the 
new england fishing industry which has deep historical roots in 
many communities generated 493 million in wholesale revenues last 
year and employs more than 15000 fulltime fishermen and 10000 
processors and wholesalers 
among the signs of frustration and dissension according to 
fisherman and regulators 
incursions by american trawlers into richer canadian waters 
leading to chases by canadian patrol boats and in one recent case 
to warning shots being fired over the bow of an american vessel 
a flourishing black market in undersized scallops illegal 
fishing in spawning areas and allegations that some trawlers carry 
nets with illegally tight mesh 
bitter rivalries between groups of fishermen using different 
types of gear and operating out of competing ports 
rising prices for consumers and concern among both fishermen 
and wholesale buyers over the fairness of fish auctions in major 
ports particularly boston 
ironically clark and many other experts date the problem to the 
extension of the us territorial limit from 12 to 200 miles in 
197778 
while the 200mile limit reduced competition from foreign 
vessels it also prompted a rapid buildup of the us fleet not 
only in the number of vessels but also in their size and 
sophistication said buell hollister an information officer for 
the massachusetts division of marine fisheries 
when the 200mile limit was created it was a highly 
publicized event and it really got a lot of people interested in 
the industry hollister said investment capital came pouring 
into the american fleet and it coincided with a tremendous 
revolution in electronic technology which really refined the 
fishcatching effectiveness of the trawlers 
among the new devices are sensitive sonar systems with color 
displays that can identify the location direction and species of 
schools of fish deep below the surface 
also satellite navigation systems now allow trawler captains to 
pinpoint their position with such accuracy that they can leave nets 
in the water then return and find them later 
the overfishing problem has been compounded by a 1984 world 
court decision that gave canada control over thousands of square 
miles of disputed territory in the fertile georges bank and gulf of 
maine fishing grounds that has forced the new england fleet into a 
smaller area making competition even more intense 
smaller less sophisticated fishing operations are quickly being 
edged out as the bigger ones grow new englands offshore fleet now 
includes about 1400 vessels weighing 5 tons or more more than 
double the number in the 1970s 
without question the new england groundfish industry is 
totally overcapitalized said david s crestin deputy director 
of the federal office of fishery conservation and management in 
washington 
the species that has been most devastated is haddock landings 
of haddock from new england waters are less than a tenth of the 
level that prevailed from 1935 to 1960 despite more intensive 
fishing 
even more significant than the size of the catch however is 
the spawning biomass the total weight of all the fish mature 
enough to reproduce because that determines the viability of the 
species 
until the 1960s the spawning biomass of haddock in new england 
waters was about 120000 metric tons now its less than 20000 
the national fisheries service says 
the decline has been nearly as dramatic for cod whose spawning 
stocks on georges bank have fallen by twothirds in less than a 
decade 
an attempt in the late 1970s to limit the fish harvest by 
imposing quotas on fishermen led to widespread cheating and has 
been abandoned by the new england fishery management council the 
board that regulates the industry 
in recent years the council has repeatedly discussed the 
possibility of limiting the size of the fleet as canada does but 
the discussions have foundered every time on dont gore my ox 
objections said the councils chairman james l warren of brewer 
maine 
you can get general agreement that there ought to be some sort 
of control on the amount of fishing effort warren said but 
when you get down to the specific details is where you run into 
problems because joe blow says well what if my son decides to 
follow me in the business or what if i want to buy another 
boat 
other proposals that have been discussed include shutting down 
the groundfish fleet for a year to allow the fish population to 
regenerate or aggressively marketing species that are still 
plentiful such as herring and mackerel 
some fishermen said they believe a shakeout is inevitable 
a lot of guys are going to go broke predicted jimmy 
bramante of boston as he prepared to take his 88foot captain sam 
ii out to georges bank the way its going how much more can the 
fish stocks take

new englands fishermen are a maverick 
breed happily isolated on the sea but on shore their independence 
has translated into an erratically regulated industry whose unions 
have lost power 
from the familyowned vessel 300 miles out on the ocean to the 
rubberbooted processors who make their way at dawn to this citys 
fishhouses the rules of the game are fairly loose 
fishing is near the top of most dangerous professions lists 
and the walls of the seamans bethel here are lined with the names 
of men lost at sea 
federal inspectors keep tabs on product standards and the coast 
guard observes sanitary conditions on boats but industry 
statistics such as how many fishermen are injured on the job 
annually are hard to come by 
cramped boats bearing seven to 10 fishermen head out for two 
weeks at a time often under stormy frigid conditions back on 
land the predominantly female fish processors stand in one spot 
sometimes eight hours or more at a stretch scaling cleaning and 
packing fillets 
the most frequent accident is the loss of fingers a finger 
goes zing and thats it said paul swaim a port agent and 
recordkeeper for the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration in new bedford 
accidents happen he said slippery floors knives and the 
machinery are pretty dangerous things 
perhaps as wearing as the fishing industrys inherent hazards is 
the incalculable wet and numbing monotony that is so much a part 
of the business 
despite the conditions new englands fishing unions have been 
on the wane in the 1980s broken in part by unsuccessful strikes in 
the early part of the decade said harvey mickelson an attorney 
for the new bedfords seafood dealers association 
fish cutters and processors weakened themselves when they went 
on strike in 1981 according to many in the fishing community 
joe testaverde a gloucesterbased fisherman said unions have 
never had much muscle in his north shore port he said at most six 
of the ports 100plus boats were unionized 
independence runs very strong in fishing said testaverde 
from my fathers days to his father before him fishermen have 
never been much for unions 
ethnic traditions also have a lot to do with the resistance to 
organized labor testaverde said italians a substantial 
population in gloucester have traditionally opted for 
kinshipbased agreements rather than contracts with workers 
in new bedford the unions established by oncedominant yankee 
fishermen have fallen away as the portuguese population whose 
focus is on family rather than worker solidarity has grown and 
taken over much of the industry 
family ties extend to onshore processing as well fishhouses 
employ hundreds of women many of them the daughters sisters or 
cousins of veteran fish cutters and packers 
the women make about 670 an hour and although theyd like more 
than the six or so holidays they get a year the work is generally 
steady they said 
henri francois who directs the 40boat seafarers union said 
seafarers and industry workers are becoming more unionoriented 
because the fishermen are starting to think of retirement and 
health care 
but jim costakes who represents the ports boat owners 
disagreed he said less onethird of the fleet was unionized and he 
doesnt expect the figure to change 
youve got a new generation in the industry who are more 
interested in what they can get now he said their concern 
isnt for the pension in the future 
thats right said jim jardin a champion scallop shucker and 
regular crew member based in new bedford he said fishermen are 
interested in immediate benefits of which he finds fewer these 
days 
boat owners generally take 45 percent of the catch while the 
crew splits the remaining 55 percent jardin said under union 
influence three or four years ago crews took an average 63 
percent he said 
sometimes boat owners cant make it on the catch alone so 
they have to make it up somewhere the 25yearold said the 
crews usually swallow it these days

vasco da gama and ferdinand magellan may 
seem unlikely rivals for donald duck and mickey mouse but under an 
ambitious plan by a group of us businessmen the 15thcentury 
portuguese explorers could vie with walt disney stars as major 
european theme park attractions 
a usowned company backed by the portuguese government is 
planning an 80 million to 100 million theme park near lisbon 
based on the pioneering portuguese sea voyages to africa asia and 
the new world some 500 years ago 
the lusolandia park is set for a 1993 opening one year after 
the scheduled launch of a euro disneyland park in france 
lusolandia holdings chairman edward kane a boston native said 
the project sprang from disneys rejection five years ago of an 
idea from then portuguese prime minister mario soares to locate a 
european disneyland in portugal 
as lisbon representative of the washingtonbased international 
trade and guarantee corp a company advising us businesses 
abroad kane had been asked by soares currently portuguese 
president to approach disney 
walt disney enterprises basically said no way portugal is too 
small potatoes for them said kane 
disney decided to locate closer to europes more affluent and 
densely populated golden triangle formed by london paris and 
brussels their french amusement park program foresees costs of up 
to 28 billion to 1997 
after disneys refusal kane turned to management resources an 
anaheim calif company specialized in creating and running theme 
parks and formed by exdisney employees 
i had the idea of instead of mickey mouse and donald duck 
lets make it a portuguese historical theme park lets replace 
donald duck with bartolomeu dias and mickey mouse with vasco da 
gama said kane a retired us foreign service officer 
portuguese authorities backed the plan and mangagement 
resources enthusiastically joined the project feasibility studies 
predicted 215 million firstyear customers from portugals 10 
million inhabitants and foreign visitors to portugal who last year 
topped 16 million 
the park is to be built near the town of azambuja some 28 miles 
northeast of lisbon along the main northsouth freeway to oporto 
portugals second city 
kane said the park will also have good road links to portugals 
main tourist destination the southern algarve region and to 
neighboring spain the site proposed for a new lisbon international 
airport is 7 miles to the east of the park location 
visitors will enter the 247acre park into a mockup of 
renaissance lisbon complete with castle and 15th century main 
street 
from a reconstructed quayside replicas of the explorers 
caravels will carry wouldbe magellans on a voyage of discovery 
across an artificial lake to theme areas representing brazilian 
jungles mysterious african kingdoms and the glittering 
civilizations of india china and japan 
kane said the latest technology will be used to create a 
funasyoulearn environment for adults and children the park 
publicity brochure promises ocean storms and amazonian canoe trips 
as well as cultural exhibitions highlighting lands along the 
portuguese sea routes 
portuguese historians will advise on the parks authenticity and 
experts from other countries will be contacted to set up japanese 
tea houses and african dance displays 
lusolandia holdings is registered in bermuda and owned 5050 by 
management resources and international trade and guarantee corp 
soon kane said they will be joined by a portuguese partner and 
create a portuguese company lusolandia empreedimentos turisticas 
private financing for the project is being sought mainly in 
europe kane also hopes to gain portuguese government funding and 
is discussing loan prospects with the luxembourgbased european 
investment bank 
the portuguese government has created a special task force of 
officials from four ministries to steer the project through 
lisbons bureaucratic maze 
inspired by the ideas of prince henry the navigator portuguese 
14th and 15th century mariners undertook a series of voyages that 
expanded europes perception of the world and opened contacts with 
the people of other continents 
dias became the first man to sail beyond the shores of north 
africa down the west african coast to the cape of good hope in 
1488 da gama discovered the sea route to india in 1499 and pedro 
alvares cabral first landed in brazil in 1500 sailing under 
spanish colors magellan began the first circumnavigation of the 
globe in 1519

whether its the holiday glitter of 
rhinestones on satin or the elegance of pearls on black velvet 
larger women can dress for the season as never before in fashions 
from an industry that realized 35 million women were tired of being 
ignored 
all the names that never wanted to be associated at one time 
with large sizes are now saying there is a viable market out 
there said sandi alpert a fashion coordinator for large sizes 
at bloomingdales main store in new york city 
in the early 1980s fashion designers began realizing the third 
of american women with figures more like mrs claus than snow white 
were an untapped market today sales of sizes 14 and larger are 
more than 10 billion annually as more designers join the movement 
and women feel better about adorning their lessthanperfect frames 
the trend is for women to be happy at whatever size they are 
at the moment not to worry about dieting and to put their life on 
hold until they lose weight said lisa e weingeroff president 
of sizzle marketing and promotions inc in warwick 
sizzle began manufacturing affordable costume jewelry for large 
women earlier this year it designs chokers long enough not to 
choke earrings with deep enough clips and long enough posts not to 
pinch and rings and bracelets larger than standard sizes 
almost every plussize woman couldnt go into a store and find 
a necklace that would hang properly that would lay on the chest 
properly said weingeroff in addition designs are larger in 
general so they stand out better 
the holiday fashion pages of decembers weight watchers magazine 
show a gold sizzle necklace and earrings highlighting a strapless 
sequined top by mondi 
but not so long ago large women could hardly find clothes let 
alone sequins baubles and accessories 
this woman has been the victim of a stereotype shes big 
shes not interested in fashion she just wants to hide her body 
she doesnt go out said christina gruber editor of plus sizes 
a trade publication for retailers and manufacturers 
i have an expression called polyester pullon and thats 
what most of us in our 50s remember as being available to large 
women alpert said if you wanted really high fashion you had to 
go to a tailor or couturier 
in 1979 pierre cardin and gloria vanderbilt ventured into 
larger clothing offering designer jeans in bigger sizes in 1983 
givenchy offered a largesize line and others steadily followed 
the first person who had the nerve to put out the designer 
jeans took a lot of guts said carole shaw editor of the 
magazine bbw big beautiful women then when they blew out the 
doors the fashion industry said to themselves do you think it 
could be possible that fat ladies really want pretty clothes 
but diane specht plus sizes publisher said its really only 
been in the past two years that the fashion industry firmly moved 
into the largesize market 
it wasnt a christmas wish that changed the industry rather a 
matter of economics 
consumer demand said helen laskow of givenchy en plus and 
president of the plus designer council a consortium of about a 
dozen manufacturers formed in april 
as women entered the workforce they needed something 
presentable to wear to work 
now youve got women in their 20s and 30s who are doctors and 
lawyers professionals and who need to dress it isnt they need 
clothes they need fashion theyre out there in the world in the 
public eye said bloomingdales alpert 
the market had to dress this woman because she was going crazy 
and they began to hear about it she said 
the trend shows no signs of waning the average american woman 
is growing older and her waistline is growing too the majority of 
largesize shoppers are in the 35 to 55 age range said specht she 
said they account for about 15 percent of the entire womens 
fashion industry spending upwards of 10 billion annually 
indeed bbw published bimonthly when it first appeared because 
when we started out in 1979 there wasnt enough fashion to put in 
every month said shaw in january the magazine began publishing 
monthly for its 200000 subscribers 
weight watchers magazine also revamped its 20yearold format a 
year ago to include more fashion and beauty advice for its million 
readers said kay parmenter vice president of advertising 
after all largesize women want what every other woman wants 
they want to look pretty feminine and fashionable said laskow 
and thats just what they can do this holiday season

not afraid to risk a few million on a hunch 
jim pickett asserts he did for the hotel industry in 5 years what 
took bill marriott 13 to accomplish 
he opened 12 hotels in that time and he says there are many 
more to come 
his pickett hotel co develops and manages hotels offering only 
suites it was selected as the no 1 allsuites hotel company last 
year by business travel news magazine marriott suites finished 
second and park suites third 
the magazine rated 10 allsuites hotels in 11 categories such 
as quality of food ease in arranging individual and group travel 
and facilities for resort travel it gave pickett the highest marks 
in price value helpfulness of the staff appearance and quality 
and variety of amenities 
pickett a native of dayton rolled all his pet peeves from many 
years as a business traveler into a checklist with a notion he 
could do better 
like hangers hooked onto the rod if you have two drinks you 
cant put it back on the pole air conditioners that are so loud 
you cant talk what i hated the most was telephones next to 
the bed i said put it on the desk i tried 100 shower heads and 
the one in my house is the one in the hotel he said in an 
interview 
and guests can watch television in the bathroom 
people who are very busy like being able to shave or spend 
time in the bathroom and watch the news they dont always have 
time to read the newspaper pickett said there is also a tv in 
the bedroom 
picketts strategy is to offer a suite for the price of a hotel 
room in the same market the challenge is breaking old habits 
you dont think maybe theres an allsuite hotel where im 
going but once we get them our guest cards are running about 96 
percent favorable theyre coming back 
hotel analysts say suite hotels enjoy growing popularity among 
business and leisure travelers 
the suite has been one of the hottest segments of the hotel 
business and a segment getting increasingly competitive said 
john rohs an analyst with wertheim schroder amp co inc in new york 
he said larger wellknown chains are playing a major role in 
the development of suite hotels 
marriot and hyatt are getting into the business theyre 
wellmanaged companies with a lot of marketing muscle name 
recognition and marketing clout are everything he said 
napoleon h overton an analyst with morgan keegan co in 
memphis said holiday corps embassy suites opened the market for 
suite hotels and now has about 60 percent of the market 
i think the allsuite segment of the lodging industry is the 
most promising over the next five to seven years embassy suites 
dominates right now he said pickett is not a household name 
as their system grows that problem will lessen and benefit the 
company 
only 3 percent of all hotel rooms are suites analysts said 
rohs said that figure probably would level off at about 10 percent 
pickett got his start in the columbus area as a developer of 
suburban office parks he began the hotel company with a 5 million 
investment in 1983 in one of his own office parks in dublin a 
columbus suburb 
he has since opened 12 pickett suite resorts hotels and inns in 
cities east of the mississippi river 
he hopes to add 30 more by 1992 mainly by acquiring old hotels 
not many places need a new hotel but a lot of them need better 
ones he said 
at pickett the overnight traveler wont find grand ballrooms or 
enormous conference rooms 
we focus on the single transient multiple transient and small 
groups two to 40 people pickett said 
the privately owned company had revenue of 50 million last 
year compared with 354000 after its first year in operation 
pickett 47 attributes his success to adapting quickly to the 
needs of baby boomers of traveling age 
one boon to the industry has been the female traveler whose 
rising prominence has not escaped picketts attention 
literature from the hotel boasts that rooms include a stocked 
refrigerator builtin hair dryer bathrobe and morning newspaper 
delivery 
security seems to be most important for women we have a 
stocked refrigerator you dont have to run down the hallway in 
your bathrobe to get a pop he said 
pickett has hotels in downtown columbus atlanta tampa fla 
and the raleighdurham research triangle in north carolina resorts 
in walt disney world village and vero beach fla and inns in 
indianapolis dayton ohio cincinnati nashville tenn detroit 
and orlando fla

the lite brigade is swelling thanksgiving 
gluttony aside american food companies are jumping on the trend of 
giving shoppers the same great taste but no fat or cholesterol 
or sugar or salt 
next to foods that can be microwaved light foods continue to 
be the fastestgrowing segment in the store said judy ball 
manager of customer relations for kroger co the nations largest 
supermarket chain 
if two comparable products are on the shelf next to each 
other the one that says light will probably sell better she 
said in a telephone interview from her cincinnati office 
one of the newest entries is the venerable hostess cupcake with 
the sevenloop squiggle signature on top and sugary white cream in 
the middle 
the new version called hostess lights is 97 percent fatfree 
contains no cholesterol and has fewer calories than its regular 
hostess counterpart 
this allows people who are watching their diet to have a sweet 
snack every once in a while without feeling guilty said pamela 
marsh a snack nutritionist at hostess 
this allows them to have their cake and eat it too 
hostess cupcakes were invented 70 years ago and helped build 
hostess parent company st louisbased continental baking co 
into the nations largest wholesale bakery 
hostess lights the cupcake for the 1990s will be available 
around the nation in a few months theyve been on sale since 
october in new york philadelphia boston and washington and have 
fared fairly well marsh said 
rolling out more and more products that tout healthful qualities 
has probably increased overall sales in the food industry but only 
slightly said roger spencer a stock analyst with dean witter 
reynolds in chicago 
any growth in a slowgrowth industry is always welcome but 
its certainly not anything that would bowl you over spencer 
said 
he said that overall the healthy products seem to be drawing 
consumers away from their less healthy counterparts rather than 
increasing consumption of products 
the skinny guys will keep buying what theyve always bought 
and the fat guys will use this new stuff spencer said and 
well all live to be about the same age 
the only problem with the food industrys urge to be healthy is 
that no one has agreed on what is healthy 
its kind of confusing for consumers ball said when they 
pick up something that says light it may not be at all what they 
expect 
the food and drug adminstration which oversees the majority of 
food products sold in the supermarket has no definitions for 
lowcalorie lowfat or lowcholesterol foods 
there are no clearcut definitions but we have proposed 
definitions that were in the process of putting into effect 
said chris lecos a spokesman for the fda 
meanwhile other regulatory agencies like the us department of 
agriculture and the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms also 
are involved with their own set of guidelines for lite beef and 
lite whiskey 
the lack of definitions is part of a broader controversy being 
debated in washington about the use of improper health claims on 
products and concerns that food labels are becoming meaningless 
what i always say is that the grocery aisles are becoming the 
mine fields of misleading information for consumers said bruce 
silverglade legal director of the center for science in the public 
interest 
silverglade said the explosion of health boasts and bravado may 
mean a boost in profits now but food companies will pay for that 
by alienating consumers in the long run 
if unabated consumers will disregard everything on the 
label he said well be in a position of throwing out the baby 
with the bathwater because people simply wont know what to 
believe 
hostess lights are a good example of products that may be 
walking the line between what is slick marketing and what is a 
genuinely healthful alternative 
the cupcakes come in three flavors plain filled with vanilla 
pudding and with a raspberry filling theyre made with a new 
angel food cake recipe that doesnt use egg yolks or animal fat 
according to the fdas proposed guideline for light or low 
fat products the reducedcalorie product should have at least 
onethird fewer calories than the regular version 
two of the three hostess light cupcakes miss that mark and the 
other light cupcake the one with plain cake passes only because 
its a halfounce lighter than cupcakes made with the original 
recipe 
our use of the word light does not fall into the 
reducedcalorie category some people may use the term to relate to 
calories but were not positioning this as a diet food said 
marsh a hostess spokeswoman 
she said the brand name light was selected because the cupcakes 
are 97 percent fatfree and they contain no cholesterol

thousands of boeing workers returned to the 
assembly line today after a 48day strike picking up a 500 bonus 
check won in their new contract and relieved to be earning money as 
the holiday season begins 
it feels like the first day of school said jerry clark a 
42yearold father of two as he showed up at boeings plant in 
renton where he builds plane models for the worlds no 1 
manufacturer of passenger jets 
its nice to go back if it were another time of year it would 
be different said tracy dorning an electrical inspector at 
renton we might have stayed out longer 
the secondlongest strike in boeing history had practically shut 
down production supervisors and nonstriking personnel delivered 
24 planes but many of the aircraft had been virtually completed 
before the walkout 
boeing spokesman jack gamble said most of today would be spent 
in meetings to organize the startup 
gearing up is going to be slow he said it will not 
happen overnight boeing had been turning out 29 planes a month 
before the machinists union representing 57800 employees in nine 
states went on strike 
the machinists on monday voted 814 percent in favor of a 
contract that provides wage increases of 10 percent over three 
years plus bonuses of 10 percent the first year 5 percent the 
second and 4 percent the third 
most workers were to receive a 500 advance on their bonus 
today with the rest coming in december 
many who on tuesday picked up their fifth and last 100 weekly 
strike check said they were relieved to see an end to the strike 
i think its fair but for the amount of days we were out we 
could have done better said carl olson who works at boeing 
advanced systems 
im glad to get back to work but i voted against the 
contract said richard duncalf he said the union had failed to 
get improvements in the wage offer that was rejected oct 3 the 
day before the strike began 
tom baker president of machinists district lodge 751 in 
seattle said it may take time for members to leave behind 
bitterness 
boeing spokesman harold carr said the company instructed 
managers to be sensitive to the people returning to work and to 
do everything they can to make sure that theyre welcomed back and 
that theres harmony in the workplace 
under the contract a costofliving adjustment will account for 
virtually all of inflation and workers will receive a 
60centperhour increase immediately 
it also includes a reduction in mandatory overtime to two 
consecutive weekends and 144 hours per quarter in the old 
contract workers could be required to work 200 hours a quarter and 
four weekends in a row 
the union includes 43300 workers in the seattle area 12000 in 
wichita kan 1700 in portland ore and smaller numbers at 
scattered sites in california hawaii montana utah and other 
states 
boeing had record profits in its most recent quarter and has a 
backlog of more than 1700 planes worth about 85 billion with 
deliveries for those jets stretching past the turn of the century 
the last boeing strike in 1977 ended after 45 days its 
longest walkout lasted 140 days in 1948

many people hestitate and consider the issues 
before crossing a unions picket line but would a doctors 
walkout stop a parent from rushing a sick child past strikers and 
into a hospital emergency room 
labor organizers say more and more doctors are joining the ranks 
of unions nationwide a trend that could change the rules by which 
medical professionals currently play 
before doctors take the lives of others into their hands they 
take a hippocratic oath binding them to act with purity and with 
holiness 
but does that oath deprive doctors and surgeons of the right to 
protect their own interests financial and otherwise 
union proponents and medical ethicists say doctors do have the 
right to protect their own interests up to a point 
but much like air traffic controllers those in the medical 
profession are bound to wrestle with overarching issues of public 
safety and welfare 
dr sanford a marcus president of the union of american 
physicians and dentists claims his oakland califbased 
consortium has 50000 members and is growing 
he said members affiliated through a number of offshoots around 
the country are working together to advocate the rights of both 
physicians and their patients it is not a conventional labor 
union which does collective bargaining and calls strikes 
the entire field of health care financing and distribution is 
being stood on its ear in these times marcus said the rules 
are going to change an awful lot 
since the mid1980s membership in health maintenance 
organizations has been on the rise around the nation the prepaid 
medical plans generally employ specific doctors and hospitals that 
provide reducedrate care to hmo members 
supporters say group health plans benefit both parties by 
bringing more patients to doctors and reduced costs to those who 
need health care 
but dr arthur caplan a bioethicist at the university of 
minnesota said the shift to group plans has put doctors under new 
strains that might best be addressed through unionization 
its a reaction by doctors feeling increasingly 
disenfranchised within the health care system and by cost 
containment measures that are basically shifting the structure of 
medicine away from a profession and more toward a business he 
said in a telephone call from minneapolis 
edward hanley who directs the 1000member doctors and surgeons 
association of massachusetts said doctors have ended up in many 
cases with the short end of the stick financially 
the medical profession has had no power hanley said from 
the 4yearold associations wellesley headquarters they arent 
in the business of negotiating the economics theyre trained to 
help people who are ill 
he said doctors need to unionize to negotiate more effectively 
on hmo contracts 
dr barry leibowitz president of the 16yearold new yorkbased 
doctors counil said doctors have also begun complaining that 
health care decisions have been usurped as hmo managers lay down 
guidelines 
anyone whos salaried and not protected by a union is 
subject to the vagaries of the marketplace and management he 
said the employers have very little understanding of what a 
physician needs to function 
aside from patients concerns union organizers conceded doctors 
were not entirely above materialism and the possible perks 
collective bargaining might provide 
doctors have always disdained money because we thought it 
would tarnish our godlike image but the fact is youve got to 
talk about money the uapds marcus said somebody has got to 
be there to help them get a good shake 
ethically speaking caplan said he saw no problem with unions 
and that in some cases they might be overdue 
the bioethicist did however draw the line where strikes were 
concerned failing to honor their patients needs before their own 
selfinterests would constitute a serious breach he said 
marcus said if push ever came to shove he was confident medical 
union members would never let a patients care suffer 
we would never withhold care he said thats not to say 
we wouldnt strike against the fiscal machine the bureaucracy or 
the industrial complex that has been built out of health care but 
the patient must be taken care of under all circumstances

bat industries plc the british conglomerate 
fighting off a takeover bid by hoylake investments ltd said 
wednesday its thirdquarter net profit jumped 18 percent from a 
year ago 
for the three months ended sept 30 bat earned 251 million 
pounds or about 394 million compared with 212 million pounds in 
the same period a year ago earnings per share came to 1627 pence 
the equivalent of about 26 cents compared with 1403 pence in the 
comparable 1988 period 
sales advanced 20 percent to 505 billion pounds from 42 
billion pounds 
this excellent performance provides us with a position of 
immense strength from which to build shareholder value now and in 
the future said bat chairman patrick sheehy 
a particularly strong showing by its financial services 
businesses helped the results the company said 
bat said its restructuring plan was on course for completion by 
the middle of next year 
under the shareenhancing plan which is designed to fend off 
the hoylake bid bat intends to focus on tobacco and financial 
services 
hoylake which has pursued bat for months recently announced it 
was considering revising its offer to include cash in place of some 
of the debt instruments in the original 133 billionpound 21 
billion offer but would keep the value of the offer at 850 pence 
or about 1335 a share 
hoylakes original bid technically lapsed while awaiting us 
regulatory approval 
bat has already announced plans to sell off its us retailing 
operations including its saks fifth avenue and marshall fields 
stores and other businesses as part of the restructuring the 
sales are expected to raise 4 billion pounds or about 63 billion 
bat also plans to buy back up to 10 percent of its stock 
for the first nine months of the year bats net profit rose 46 
percent to 828 million pounds from 568 million pounds in the same 
period a year ago earnings per share came to 4725 pence compared 
with 4077 pence 
bats pretax profits from january through september rose 17 
percent to 123 billion pounds from 105 billion pounds 
sales climbed 20 percent to 1482 billion from 1233 billion 
pounds 
bat now is free to continue buying back up to 153 million of its 
shares late last month the company bought 6 million bat shares 
but was barred from further purchases until the release of the 
thirdquarter results

seated in his workshop where he has 
meticulously transformed elephant tusks into intricate ivory 
artwork for four decades wong cheonglam knows the days of his 
craft are numbered 
im the only one left he sighs looking around the the 
workshop where six carvers once worked 
the artwork crafted by the 55yearold wong and the 1200 or so 
other ivory carvers in hong kong has long been popular 
wholesalers from the united states europe and japan have 
eagerly snapped up tons of ivory worked in hong kong shop windows 
in tourist districts display works ranging from panormaic 
landscapes carved from an entire tusk to delicate earrings 
but now the centuriesold craft may be doomed 
in october the convention on international trade in endangered 
species cites adopted a ban on world ivory trading to save 
africas dwindling elephant population which has dropped from 15 
million in the 1970s to an estimated 600000 now victims of 
poachers after their tusks 
the ban gives ivory traders until jan 18 to sell their stocks 
but hong kong companies say they will need much longer to sell 670 
tons of ivory the worlds largest known stockpile worth about 
128 million 
wong estimates the value of his own uncarved ivory at about 
25600 and said he has no idea what to do itll take at least 
five years to carve it all 
local traders are lobbying the government in this british colony 
to allow them to continue sales past the january deadline and are 
scrambling to figure out how to save their industry 
between the elephants and the carvers who do you think should 
be protected asked an angry dominic ng a leading ivory trader 
ng suggests the government forbid the import of more tusks but 
allow the carving and export of the existing stockpile until the 
ban is reviewed in 1991 by cites 
but since the united states japan and other major ivory import 
markets are upholding the ban it is not clear how much such a 
policy would help the industry in hong kong the only legal market 
for traders would be smaller countries that do not belong to cites 
or refuse to go along with the ban 
the hong kong government has indicated it will abide by the 
trade ban and officials are considering vocational training for 
carvers thrown out of work 
but wong is skeptical about retraining workers 
ivory carvers usually do not have much education he said 
it is too late for them to learn another skill and doing other 
odd jobs will barely make ends meet 
the government also has promised to seek support for the 
creation of an international fund to buy up the ivory stockpile in 
hong kong 
local traders are demanding compensation for their stockpile 
which they say consists of ivory that was purchased with approval 
by cites before it imposed the ban 
a government survey found 93 percent of the ivory in hong kong 
contains valid cites certification but conservationists argue much 
of the stockpile comes from the tusks of poached elephants that the 
convention has nonetheless allowed onto the market 
nicholas pirie chairman of the local branch of the royal 
society for the prevention of cruelty to animals says the hong 
kong ivory must be destroyed 
if ivory exports were permitted to continue it would be easy 
for more poached ivory to be smuggled into the colony and claimed 
as part of the original stockpile pirie argues 
i sympathize with the workers but i dont sympathize with the 
bosses he said 
at his workshop in an old residential building wong 
methodically works on a sixinchhigh elephant figure using a tiny 
drill to carve wrinkles in the animals feet the project will take 
up to three weeks 
such craftsmanship has been an integral part of chinese art for 
centuries but wong believes the long history of ivory carving in 
hong kong now the main center for such work is reaching an end 
with or without the ban 
who wants to learn how to carve ivory nowadays he said 
explaining it takes five years of apprenticeship and pays only 
about 500 a month

in another sign of tough times on wall street 
merrill lynch amp co on wednesday announced a restructuring expected 
to include layoffs and said changes in the industry had hurt 
profits and permanently altered the market landscape 
in a letter to employees merrill lynchs top two executives 
said the giant firm would realign or eliminate unprofitable areas 
cut operating costs and trim investment bankers bonuses 
merrill lynch the nations largest retail brokerage with 40500 
employees and 12600 brokers worldwide said layoffs are likely but 
it did not give an estimate 
wall street still is struggling to recover from the october 1987 
stock market crash and subsequent slowdown in the securities 
business a number of major firms this year have laid off thousands 
of employees and slashed divisions in an attempt to stay profitable 
here we are two years from the crash and business is still 
tough profits are still under tremendous pressure and 
unfortunately there is no reason to be tremendously optimistic 
looking into 1990 said analyst lawrence eckenfelder at 
prudential bache securities inc in san francisco 
there isnt a firm out there that isnt to some extent in a 
similar position to merrill he said 
merrill attributed its problems to increased competition from 
commercial banks and foreign securities firms continued 
overcapacity predating the crash and higher business risks 
these factors have permanently altered the market landscape 
and are likely to remain intense throughout the coming decade 
merrill chairman william a schreyer and president daniel p tully 
said in the letter dated monday 
indeed they have already reduced or even eliminated the 
profitability of some of our businesses and operating results have 
not been what we want them to be said the letter released 
publicly wednesday we must recognize that many of these changes 
are not shortterm or cyclical in nature they are fundamental and 
will not go away 
merrill reported thirdquarter earnings of 41 million down 38 
percent from 656 million in the yearearlier period while 
ninemonth profit fell 208 percent to 1484 million the firm 
blamed an industry slowdown in businesses including stock and 
municipal bond underwriting and bond trading 
schreyer and tully said that despite gains in market share in 
some areas and growth in client assets our profitability as 
measured by return on equity is still not adequate 
earlier this week shearson lehman hutton inc the nations no 
2 brokerage slashed broker commissions for the first time in 15 
years shortly after it began laying off 800 people and 
restructuring senior management 
drexel burnham lambert inc in a major retrenchment following 
its settlement of securities fraud charges sold its entire retail 
brokerage business and cut hundreds of employees in recent months 
merrill this year already has reduced its payroll by 550 jobs 
bringing the total number of cuts since the end of 1987 to 5500 
overall employment on wall street totaled 229000 at the end of 
june down 126 percent from a peak of 262200 in early 1987 
industry profits in secondquarter 1989 topped 1 billion 
thanks to lower interest rates higher stocktrading volume and 
more merger and stock underwriting activity 
all those areas have slumped since then volume on the new york 
stock exchange hit a 1989 low of 1518 million shares in september 
volume leaped to a high of 1824 million in october but much of 
that occurred during and shortly after the oct 13 market plunge 
the dollar amount of merger activity for the first nine months 
of the year was off 14 percent from 1988 and leveraged buyouts a 
major source of revenue for wall street firms were off 21 percent 
according to securities data co 
the volume of initial public stock offerings by companies was 
down 487 percent in the first nine months of 1989 securities data 
said just 151 companies have one public so far this year compared 
with 210 last year 502 in 1987 and 496 in 1986 junk bond issuance 
is down about 40 percent 
firms have taken an increasingly gloomy look and said if this 
continues at the rate it is were going to have continued 
overcapacity and were going to have to cut further said jeffrey 
schaefer senior vice president of the securities industry 
association

ashland oil inc continuing its financial 
mopup of one of the nations largest inland fuel spills has 
agreed to pay the state a record 46 million in costs and civil 
penalties officials said tuesday 
gov robert p casey said the money will finance a number of 
state environmental initiatives including an aquatic survey of the 
ohio river basin and scholarships and training in the study of 
natural resources 
the governor said it was the largest payment ever made in 
pennsylvania for an environmental violation 
we wanted to punish ashland we wanted them to pay substantial 
penalties for what they did and then we wanted to broaden the 
effect of this so that there would be longterm environmental 
benefit that would come from this incident casey said 
im serving notice that the protection of the environment 
of pennsylvania is a top priority that polluters will pay dearly 
when they harm the environment he said 
ashland agreed to the settlement to avoid protracted litigation 
company chairman john r hall said 
this essentially concludes all outstanding issues associated 
with the spill he said 
the accident occurred jan 2 1988 when a 38 milliongallon 
storage tank collapsed at ashlands floreffe terminal south of 
pittsburgh and sent 750000 gallons of fuel into the monongahela 
river which flows into the ohio river 
the spill killed thousands of birds and fish and forced public 
water systems in pennsylvania ohio and west virginia to stop 
drawing water from the rivers 
casey described negotiations with the kentuckybased oil giant 
as intensive and extensive 
i dont think something like this is easily forgotten he 
said i think our people were deeply affected by this i know i 
was and this agreement is a strong statement of how deeply we 
feel about this 
so far the spill has cost ashland at least 325 million said 
ashland spokesman roger schrum that figure consists of 14 million 
for damages expenses and civil penalties including the 46 
million pennsylvania agreement 11 million for cleanup 225 for 
a federal criminal fine and 525 million in attorneys fees 
the company has set aside an additional 10 million from a 
classaction settlement to handle any outstanding claims so far 
ashland has settled more than 5000 thirdparty claims schrum 
said but it isnt known how many potential claims remain 
schrum said the costs have not had a significant impact on the 
companys earnings ashland had to pay a 25 million deductible 
but insurance covered most of the balance of the penalties damage 
and cleanup costs he said 
part of the problem of assessing damage from the spill was that 
no biological studies of the ohio had been conducted before the 
accident casey said 
of the 46 million settlement 125 million is for civil 
penalties and 175 million will fund a comprehensive aquatic 
survey of the ohio river basin 
of the remaining funds 
300000 will fund environmental training programs in 
pittsburgh 
215000 will be used to develop a scholarship endowment fund 
to state residents pursuing careers in environmental protection 
250000 will be paid to the pennsylvania fish commission and 
200000 to the state game commission 
35000 will be given to the department of environmental 
resources to purchase water quality enforcement equipment and 
660000 reimburses der and other state agencies for their 
costs in the cleanup

bank of japan governor satoshi sumita who carried 
out monetary policy during a period of historic economic and trade 
events will step down when his term ends dec 16 the government 
announced wednesday 
minister of finance ryutaro hashimoto told a news conference 
wednesday that yasushi mieno senior deputy governor at the central 
bank would replace sumita 
it widely had been believed that sumita would step down at the 
end of his term to be replaced by mieno during the day sumita 
had conferred with prime minister toshiki kaifu and with hashimoto 
and expressed his readiness to resign 
at his own news conference sumita generally lauded the choice 
of mieno as his successor and said he did not expect any basic 
changes in japans monetary policy 
sumitas statement about japanese monetary policy referred to 
the bank of japans fundamental inflationfighting posture and 
suggested that he wasnt addressing the issue of another possible 
discount rate increase 
mieno 65 is a tokyo university graduate and has served as 
chief of the osaka branch of the bank of japan as well as head of 
the central banks business bureau 
while in office sumita carried out monetary policy that helped 
pave the way for japans present sustained economic growth and 
relative price stability 
the bank of japan cut its official discount rate five times to 
help spur economic growth following the september 1985 agreement 
among the socalled group of seven major industrial countries to 
guide the dollar down and help the us reduce its trade deficits 
at his press conference hashimoto praised sumita for helping 
japan through the difficult period he said sumitas contributions 
toward overcoming the nations economic slowdown and establishing 
steady growth were highly regarded 
more recently as the yen has been softening against the dollar 
and raising the danger of inflation the central bank rtaised its 
discount rate on may 31 ending its nineyearold easy monetary 
stance 
the bank of japan raised the discount rate for the second time 
this year to 375 percent on oct 11 in an attempt to prevent the 
yen from falling further 
sumita at his press conferences and speeches in recent weeks 
has been warning about the danger of inflation pointing to a 
tightening balance of supply and demand in both labor and products 
and to considerable money supply growth 
while he has tried to discourage speculation about still another 
hike in the discount rate this year such speculation has persisted 
in japans financial markets but sumita has said the central bank 
is studying the effects of the previous discount rate increases 
indicating that it was premature to boost rates again 
sumita served during a very difficult time hashimoto 
said characterizing him as a strong central bank governor 
recalling sumita took over the bank of japan four years 
agohashimoto lauded the governors appropriate efforts in 
helping to expand japans domestic economy and shifting currency 
rates in line with the september 1985 plaza accord and successor 
agreements such as the louvre currency accord of february 1987 
when sumita became governor the dollar was hovering at about 
24785 yen compared with its recent levels of about 14350 yen

soybean futures prices closed moderately higher 
wednesday on the chicago board of trade amid a bevy of mildly 
bullish developments wheat futures declined slightly while corn 
was little changed 
supportive factors in the soybean market included a dip in 
farmer sales of soybeans before the thanksgiving holiday talk of 
export interest from spain japan and indonesia and a census 
bureau report showing lowerthanexpected us stocks of soybean 
oil at the end of october 
the move may have been exaggerated by thin market conditions 
caused by the absence of traders who got an early start on the long 
weekend 
analyst dale gustafson of drexel burnham lambert inc in chicago 
said some traders may also have bought soybeans in anticipation of 
a rally when trading resumes friday 
in the past decade he said the soybean market has tended to 
climb on the day after thanksgiving 
i dont know why gustafson said maybe all the bears go 
on vacation 
wheat futures were pressured by forecasts for needed rain in 
us winter wheat areas in the coming week 
at the close wheat futures were 1 cent to 2 cents lower with 
the contract for delivery in december at 408 a bushel corn was 
cent lower to cent higher with december at 238 a bushel oats 
were 1 cent to 1 cents higher with december at 146 a bushel 
soybeans were 2 cents to 4 cents higher with january at 589 a 
bushel

steve wynn the hotelcasino builder who 
promised a wonderment the world will flock to see on wednesday 
opened the glitzy 630 million mirage hotel scented volcano and 
all on the las vegas strip 
the 3049room hotel is the strips first new resort in 15 years 
and already has sparked a 25 billion building boom in this gaming 
and entertainment capital 
weve been waiting four years going on 20 to say welcome to 
the mirage wynn told a crowd that included gov bob miller 
weve often said fantasy becomes reality but fantasy is a dream 
its not real at least not until today 
thousands of people began pouring into the resort when the doors 
opened to the public at noon many of the spectators were guests 
who lined up to register while others just milled through the 
resort to view the spectacle 
the first two guests to check into the resort were two white 
tigers belonging to illusionists siegfried and roy who have signed 
a 58 million contract to appear at the resort beginning dec 26 
wynn praised a number of people who played a major role in the 
mirage including indicted financier michael milken former head of 
the junk bond division of drexel burnham lambert that arranged the 
565 million financing for the project 
wynn is chairman and majority owner of golden nugget inc which 
owns the mirage and golden nugget hotel 
the hotels 6000 employees and about as many guests received a 
preview look at the mirage on monday and tuesday 
tuesday night saw a flurry of activity as workers stocked plush 
stores and put the finishing touches on the exotic habitat for the 
siegfried and roy tigers 
wynn had planned to open the mirage on dec 26 but moved the 
date up when he landed the sugar ray leonardroberto duran 
championship fight for dec 7 
tourists gawked and traffic stopped on the busy sixlane strip 
this week as workers conducted final tests on a flamespewing 
54foot volcano in front of the resort wynn who was upset by the 
gaseous odor emitted from the eruptions persuaded utility 
executives to come up with a mix that has the scent of pina colada 
guests arrive via a palmlined entry that features the volcano 
three lagoons and waterfalls valets whisk arriving cars through a 
maze of tunnels under the resort 
the top five floors contain 260 penthouse suites for coveted 
casino customers and for his highstakes stratosphere players 
wynn has six private bungalows at one side of the resort each with 
its own swimming pool 
the main hotel pool is a quartermile around nearby is planned 
a dolphin habitat approved by the national marine fisheries 
service including a 15 million gallon saltwater aquarium 
registering guests are greeted with a flashy glassfront 12 
million tank containing 20000 gallons of water and fourfoot 
sharks nearby is an atrium and dome nine stories high with palm 
trees 70 feet tall 
along the perimeter of the casino are restaurants that will 
serve 2500 people and 30000 square feet of retail space catering 
to an affluent clientele room rates run 89 to 129 a night 
the casino covers an area more than twice the size of a football 
field and has features ranging from nickel slots to a room for high 
rollers where 1000 chips are the minimum available 
the hotels 1500seat 30 million showroom will feature 
siegfried and roy who will perform three weeks a month the other 
week will be filled by stars such as dolly parton kenny rogers 
johnny mathis and cher 
siegfried and roys tigers will have their own habitat at the 
end of a moving walkway that brings people from the strip to one 
area of the resort 
planned nearby is the jackson attraction featuring 
memorabilia of wynns friend michael jackson a frequent visitor 
to las vegas 
the volcano and waterfalls are designed to block the neon of 
other resorts across the strip 
im burned out on neon said wynn whose companys golden 
nugget hotel downtown has no neon i think its cheap to me 
neon is yesterday las vegas 
wynn is confident the mirage will be profitable despite the 
high cost and said it could earn the 1 million a day needed to 
pay for it

the government wednesday reduced the price for 
shares in britains water industry in an attempt to attract 
investors during a period of high interest rates and slumping 
stocks 
the government said it would sell 2183 million shares at 240 
pence each or 377 or a total of 524 billion pounds 82 
billion that would make the sale britains thirdlargest 
privatization 
the government previously had indicated a price of 250 pence a 
share or 393 in the sale of the 10 water authorities of england 
and wales 
prime minister margaret thatchers conservative government has 
sold off billions of dollars worth of stateowned companies in the 
past decade to promote capitalism in britain 
the two biggest privatizations have been the sale of the 
governments remaining onethird stake in british petroleum co 
plc which fetched 113 billion and the 85 billion sale of 
british gas plc 
all the sales will be dwarfed however by the planned sale of 
britains electricity industry which could raise more than 31 
billion the government hopes to complete that sale before the next 
election which must be called by mid1992 
analysts said the government reduced the price of the water 
shares to lure investors in an unfavorable environment 
interest rates at an eightyear high of 15 percent coupled with 
chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawsons sudden resignation last 
month have fueled fears of a recession in britain and helped to 
undermine confidence in londons stock market 
investors also were shaken when london share prices took a big 
tumble on oct 16 after a severe drop on wall street the previous 
friday 
the water and electricity sales also have prompted sharp 
protests from critics who believe public utilities should remain 
under government control to protect consumers from price hikes in 
vital services 
government minister michael howard said the water sale has been 
fully underwritten and that there has been encouraging interest 
from financial institutions 
about 43 million people have already registered as potential 
shareholders to qualify for perks in the form of discounts or bonus 
shares the government said 
opposition labor lawmaker ann taylor said the government set a 
low price because it is obviously extremely worried that they 
will not be able to sell these shares 
with the exception of the bp sale which coincide with the 
october 1987 stock market crash the privatizations have been 
hugely successful swelling the ranks of british shareholders 
trading in the water shares is to begin on londons stock 
exchange on dec 12 although analysts expect active gray 
market of unofficial trading among institutional investors before 
then 
the government is selling half the shares to institutional 
investors in packages made up of all 10 water authorities it also 
has allotted 185 percent of the shares for overseas investors 
the remaining shares are being sold to british individuals who 
can choose to buy shares in any of the 10 authorities they will be 
required to buy a minimum of 100 shares each and will be able to 
pay for them in installments the initial payment will be 100 
pounds or 157 
the shares annualized yields will vary from 81 percent for 
thames water britains largest water authority to 97 percent for 
south west water

with the economy weakening and some retailers already offering 
deep discounts experts say bargainhunting consumers could do well 
this holiday season if they play their credit cards right 
faced with slower activity as a result of the weakening economy 
card issuers are offering promotions such as preapproved cards 
sweepstakes free rides to shopping areas and other premiums to 
spur card use during the critical buying season 
the consumers have gained a big new edge said robert k 
heady publisher of bank rate monitor which tracks interest rates 
among major banks and thrifts nationwide but youve got to do 
your homework before you dash into the malls screaming charge 
interest rates on credit cards and unsecured personal loans are 
up sharply from the holiday shopping season of a year ago 
according to north palm beach flabased bank rate monitor 
the average bank credit card for example carries of rate of 
1866 percent compared with 1815 percent a year ago personal 
loans average 1711 percent up from 1644 percent in 1988 it said 
the stakes are even steeper in california where some of the 
major banks charge as much as 20 percent interest on credit cards 
and 2175 percent on personal loans bank rate monitor said 
in some cases rates on retailers charge cards can run even 
higher 
but consumers can avoid any of these finance charges and take 
advantage of the relatively easy access to credit if they pay their 
monthly bills on time something consumer groups recommend and 
about 40 percent of cardusing americans do 
with card costs running high creditcard companies banks and 
retailers have been focusing on special services or promotions as 
they vie for consumer dollars 
as much as a quarter of their charge volume from the 130 million 
americans that buy on credit comes during the lucrative christmas 
holiday season 
the competition seems to be steeper this year as recent economic 
data reveal anemic growth prompting some retailers to already 
begin offering discounts something virtually unheard of in the 
early years of the nations sevenyearold economic expansion 
there seems to be more promotion said elgie holstein 
director of the nonprofit consumer group bankcard holders of 
america the real emphasis is not to sign up new cardholders but 
to get get you to use one card over another 
issues are using direct mail and broadcast ads to tout deals 
ranging from preapproved credit cards to free transportation to 
shopping districts 
mastercard and visa are offering special contests giving 
cardholders a chance at winning prizes every time they use their 
cards during the holidays visas grand prize is having bills up to 
1 million paid over a fiveyear period mastercard provides up to 
18000 a year over 10 years 
american express has been heavily promoting its buyerprotection 
plan which gives cardholders limited warranties on charged 
merchandise thats lost stolen or broken 
and for the first time its offering to bus cardholders in new 
york city and chicago to key shopping areas if it works out 
american express says it may expand the service to other cities 
next year 
but despite these promotions many economists predict that 
consumers arent likely to spend as much as they had in previous 
years when economic conditions were booming particularly for major 
purchase items like automobiles or appliances 
i dont mean to sound like scrooge but youre going to 
have a cautious consumer going into the holiday season said 
maury harris chief economist for painewebber inc theres not a 
lot of pentup demand 
economists note recent reports that show drops in retail and 
auto sales as well as overall durable goods harris also cited a 
sharp increase in applications for unemployment benefits in recent 
months

in a bid to bolster sagging revenues a number 
of major airlines plan to raise fares on most domestic routes and 
eliminate discount fares used mainly by business travelers 
united airlines the nations secondlargest carrier led the 
move tuesday and quickly was matched by several competitors 
united said that as of nov 30 its firstclass oneway fares 
will increase by 8 while fullfare and some discounted coach 
prices will go up by 5 the increases dont apply to the popular 
maxsavers the airlines most deeply discounted advancepurchase 
fares 
a fullfare unrestricted coach ticket on united from chicago to 
los angeles for example will be raised from 525 one way to 530 
a firstclass oneway ticket from boston to seattle will go from 
792 to 800 
chicagobased united said it also was eliminating on nov 29 its 
sameday purchase supercoach fares used mainly by business 
travelers that fare is 399 one way from chicago to los angeles 
spokesmen for trans world airlines continental airlines 
eastern airlines and midway airlines said they would match most of 
the increases delta air lines usair group inc and northwest 
airlines said wednesday they were studying the issue 
american airlines the biggest us carrier will match the fare 
increases but doesnt plan to eliminate its supercoach fares said 
american spokesman jim brown 
robert decker an analyst with duff amp phelps inc in chicago 
said that given a recent slowdown in passenger traffic id be 
surprised if uniteds action held up across the board 
passenger traffic normally begins increasing at this time of 
year a peak holiday travel season 
the fare hikes are needed because of higher operating costs 
mainly fuel prices that rose by 16 percent in the third quarter 
said united spokesman rob doughty 
analysts are predicting a disappointing performance by the 
industry for the fourth quarter and continued higher costs next 
year 
i think its a very positive move on the part of the 
airlines said louis marckesano who follows the industry for 
janney montgomery scott inc in philadelphia this would be a 
first step in checking that erosion 
the next step marckesano said might be for the airlines to 
raise their deepdiscount maxsaver fares he said they may wish to 
postpone that move until after the holiday season to avoid 
antagonizing vacationers the most frequent users of maxsavers 
the airlines made their last major fare increase in september 
when they boosted their cheapest fares by more than 15 percent and 
doubled cancellation penalties they also raised supercoach fares 
by around 20 for a oneway ticket 
the september increases followed a big discount move in 
midaugust when the airlines slashed some roundtrip fares by as 
much as 160 to lure passengers in the historically weak autumn 
season most fares to europe were reduced by 100 through next 
spring

chinese banks have decided to lend 27 billion to 
staterun enterprises strapped for cash although the governments 
overall tight credit policy remains in effect a central bank 
official said wednesday 
the loans are to be extended in this years last quarter said 
hong yuncheng spokesman for peoples bank of china 
the loans are still within the original plan set for this year 
and the fund shortages will be eased to a certain extent the 
official xinhua news agency quoted hong as saying the tight 
credit policy is still proceeding in accordance with the schedule 
and the total number of loans has been brought under control 
one asian economic expert in beijing speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the government actually appeared to be relaxing its 
credit restrictions because the economy is so bad 
the large injection of funds is not likely to be a heavy 
economic burden said a western diplomat familiar with chinas 
economy 
the government has been saving up pennies all year to have a 
big wad of cash in the fourth quarter when the harvest comes in 
when they really need cash said the diplomat also insisting on 
anonymity they dont need to issue ious and can stay within 
budget 
last year the government issued large amounts of ious to 
farmers for contracted grain causing widespread resentment and 
some protests 
this year there have been isolated reports of ious being issued 
in china its not unusual for a lot of money to move into the 
economy in the fourth quarter what is unusual is that the chinese 
have shown such restraint in the first three quarters the 
diplomat said but the government has been promising more money 
and it appears they have it it seems in line with credit growth 
projections 
xinhua quoted unidentified analysts as saying china must stick 
to its austerity program and tight monetary and credit policy for 
the next two or three years in the face of continuing high 
inflation and demand for funds 
the central bank is joining the industrial and commercial bank 
the bank of china agricultural bank and others to raise money for 
the loans to finance key state projects purchases of agricultural 
goods and exports hong said 
under the tightened credit policy the banks priority is to 
raise money for large enterprises he said 
this will enliven the domestic economy and ensure the normal 
development of industrial and agricultural production he said 
chinese banks already have offered 108 million in loans to 
hundreds of foreignfunded enterprises facing fund shortages 
because of chinas austerity program 
the peoples bank of china also has announced a 54 billion 
loan to avoid issuing ious to farmers who are selling autumn crops 
to the state it was not clear if this was included in the 27 
billion package 
the austerity measures which began a year ago cut government 
spending and credits extended to industry and canceled thousands 
of construction projects 
the measures have pushed many small private and collective firms 
into bankruptcy and forced some larger enterprises to the brink of 
financial collapse 
in october industrial output value declined for the first time 
in the past decade of reforms raising fears the economy was headed 
for recession

opec oil ministers began arriving in 
vienna wednesday for discussions on pricing and production strategy 
for 1990 
saudi arabias hisham nazer fended off questions about increases 
in the output ceiling of the 13nation organization of petroleum 
exporting countries 
we will see when we meet because i havent seen any of my 
colleagues yet he told reporters 
kuwaits ali khalifa alsabah ecuadors diego tamariz and 
venezuelas celestino armas also were early arrivals at the luxury 
hotel where opec does much of its behindthescenes bargaining 
tamariz said he thought there was room for a fresh increase in 
opecs production ceiling but offered no figure the cartels 
quota is 205 million barrels a day in the final quarter of 1989 
the ministers were to continue arriving through thursday when 
the cartels monitoring committee was to meet although only eight 
ministers are members of the panel all were expected to attend 
officials said 
opecs formal winter meeting will begin on saturday one of two 
conferences held annually 
the ministers discussions could lead to a new production 
agreement that will help determine opecs supply of crude to world 
markets next year 
analysts estimate the cartel produced more than 23 million 
barrels a day last month well over the current cap of 205 million 
barrels 
despite the flood of oil prices have remained fairly stable in 
recent months helped by unexpectedly higher demand for opec crude 
mainly from developing countries 
futures prices for west texas intermediate the benchmark 
american grade have fluctuated in the 19 to 20abarrel range 
middle eastern varieties run several dollars a barrel less 
the average price of seven crudes monitored by opec was 1776 a 
barrel last week just under the cartels price target of 18 a 
barrel only a year ago the basket of crudes was priced at 1234 
a barrel 
in their discussions the ministers will have to figure out how 
much they can produce next year and still keep prices firm or 
better yet slightly higher to meet the cartels target price 
the international energy agency made up of 24 western nations 
estimates demand in the first half of 1990 at slightly under 21 
million barrels a day more than 2 million barrels under what the 
cartel is now producing 
in the face of lower demand the producing nations would have to 
trim output to keep the market and prices steady and restore 
discipline among those members who have been openly violating their 
quotas 
kuwait and the united arab emirates have been producing more 
than 2 million barrels a day about double their individual 
allotments to press their demands for bigger shares of the 
cartels production pie according to analysts 
saudi arabia opecs biggest producer and the worlds largest 
crude exporter also recently began exceeding its allocation a 
move seen by analysts as a negotiating tactic before this weeks 
talks 
at a september meeting the ministers discussed a plan presented 
by iran that addressed the sensitive issue of redistributing 
production shares among the 13 nations 
the plan called for lifting the supply cap to 215 million 
barrels a day to meet the demands of kuwait and the united arab 
emirates for larger shares gabon and ecuador would also get more 
under the proposal 
algeria indonesia nigeria and venezuela would lose some of 
their percentage shares as would iran and iraq saudi arabia libya 
and qatar would maintain their current levels according to the 
plan

dozens of grounded continental airlines flight 
attendants furloughed after a fourday strike in march to protest 
low wages have been told by the airline that they can fly again in 
middecember 
most everyone is accepting the offer said carla winkler a 
spokeswoman for continentals union of flight attendants in denver 
ms winkler said the flight attendants were happy to fly again 
but were disappointed with wages at the airline where most of the 
employees do not belong to a union 
houstonbased continental a subsidiary of texas air corp was 
put under chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1983 by texas air 
chairman frank lorenzo and later emerged as a nonunion carrier 
lorenzo also put sister carrier eastern airlines under chapter 11 
protection and has been rebuilding eastern without its unions 
since they struck the airline in early march 
ms winkler said most of the continental attendants worked part 
time or collected unemployment during their time off 
its not all that different from the salary they were 
making she said 
starting flight attendants at continental make about 14000 a 
year with increases to 24000 after six years on the job other 
major airlines offer similar starting salaries but with higher 
salaries in the upper scales 
under federal law continental was obligated to rehire the 
striking workers before bringing any new flight attendants on board 
officials said some of the 220 striking workers have left for 
other jobs but about 160 will start retraining in houston next 
week 
the rehired workers all will be flying out of continentals hub 
in newark nj 
continental officials also said the rehired attendants can 
request transfers when they start work again 
art kent a spokesman in houston for continental said some of 
the striking attendants took early retirement or were fired for 
reasons not related to the strike shortly after the walkout he 
said the airline has identified 220 that took part in the strike 
a total of 162 are left of that 220 it appears all of them 
are accepting to be rehired he said

philip morris cos reportedly plans to 
offer credit card holders home delivery of its cartier vendome 
cigarettes early next year but officials of the tobacco giant 
declined to confirm the report wednesday 
we didnt contribute to the story in the wall street 
journal philip morris spokesman steven h weiss said we werent 
talking about it and that still holds true 
marketing consultants say the new yorkbased company is counting 
on the technique to give its cartier vendome brand of cigarettes an 
added air of exclusivity the newspaper reported wednesday 
the approach would also give the tobacco company a list of 
tobacco users marketing experts noted 
the company introduced the pearltipped cigarettes on oct 11 in 
los angeles weiss said prior to that the brand was available 
only in europe 
the market for luxury tobacco comprises less than 1 percent of 
total cigarette sales in the united states 
cartier vendome cigarettes packed in oval boxes bearing the 
house of cartiers logo cost about twice as much as an average 
pack of cigarettes weiss said 
we think there is a market out there he said there are 
discerning smokers who want a cigarette that has the appearance 
refined taste and distinction that says cartier 
the cigarette is manufactured by philip morris but is 
distributed by cartier through upscale hotels restaurants and 
tobacco shops 
some directmarketing experts say philip morris may find 
barriers to selling mailorder cigarettes across state lines 
several states are requiring directmailers to charge their 
customers state sales tax

general motors corp reportedly is considering 
slashing its whitecollar work force by up to 25 percent over the 
next five years cuts that would accelerate a fiveyearold job 
reduction effort 
like other major us automakers gm has been seeking to cut 
costs in an effort to meet intensifying competition while dealing 
with an industrywide downturn and slowing national economy 
the nations largest automaker had 103410 salaried workers at 
the end of last year 218 percent less than its 132279 
whitecollar workers five years earlier according to gm figures 
gms hourly employment dropped 161 percent to 327277 by the 
end of last year from 390133 at the end of 1983 
on wednesday the wall street journal reported it had obtained 
an internal gm document saying the company was looking into 
reducing its salaried work force by about 5000 people annually 
during the next four or five years 
gm spokeswoman patricia malloy declined to confirm or deny that 
such a study was going on or that such a memo existed 
however she said are we looking at a head count we continue 
to look at employment levels as we head into the 90s having the 
right number of people with the right skills who are adding value 
throughout the corporation is absolutely critical 
since 1987 general motors has been involved in what it calls 
its action plan to cut costs throughout the corporation in its 
thirdquarter earnings report gm said it had cut costs by 11 
billion and aimed to cut 125 billion to 13 billion by the end of 
1990 
the journal said gms top managers would meet nov 30 to review 
the memo on cutting salaried jobs malloy said the management 
committee meets monthly and that nov 30 is not a date for any 
regularly scheduled meeting 
she declined to say when the next meeting would take place 
gm ford motor co and chrysler corp each have costcutting 
programs under way including cutbacks in the number of 
whitecollar workers 
chryslers plan to slash 1 billion from its budget by the end 
of next year including an 8 percent reduction in its salaried work 
force of about 28000 employees has attracted the most recent 
attention 
in 1983 chrysler had about 26500 salaried employees worldwide 
by the end of last year after chrysler had acquired american 
motors corp the salaried work force had risen to just more than 
32000 
ford spokesman tom foote said the nations no 2 automaker has 
reduced its us salaried work force by about 30 percent during the 
last decade mainly during the early 1980s

texas instruments inc stock continued to climb in 
active trading wednesday after the announcement that the company 
was awarded an important patent in japan 
industry analysts say texas instruments could reap hundreds of 
millions of dollars in royalties per year from japanese 
computerchip manufacturers because of the patent on integrated 
circuits which took 29 years to be approved 
texas instruments officials declined to speculate on how much 
the dallasbased company might gain from the patent on integrated 
circuits it developed in 1958 but richard j agnich a senior vice 
president said the opportunity exists for texas instruments to 
earn a significant ongoing stream of royalty income 
the stock jumped 475 a share to 3650 on wednesday on the new 
york stock exchange after a gain of 225 a share tuesday giving 
it a twoday gain of almost 24 percent 
i have an aggressive buy recommendation of this stock 
said richard whittington semiconductor industry analyst for 
kidder peabody amp co in new york 
that wasnt the feeling throughout the industry 
it sounds good it feels good but we dont know how good 
said erik jensen a semiconductor analyst for robertson stephen amp 
co in san francisco i am not recommending the stock at this 
point 
jensen said he doesnt think earnings from the patent will 
appear immediately and that all the benefits wont be in dollar 
form 
analysts said the patent could aid texas instruments in 
renegotiating licensing agreements for its products with japanese 
firms in 1990 
as far as the news making texas instruments a takeover target 
whittington said it makes them a far more valuable investment 
and thats all im willing to say 
texas instruments spokeswoman terry west said the company has 
programs in place to prevent a takeover 
texas instruments knew about the patent oct 30 but didnt 
announce it until tuesday still rumors from japan arrived in time 
for texas instruments stock to jump in late trading tuesday on 
heavy volume 
according to securities and exchange commission rules a company 
does not have to disclose every important development as it happens 
texas instruments officials declined to say wednesday whether 
the sec had questioned the company or criticized it for keeping the 
information secret so long sec spokeswoman mary mccue said the 
agency had no comment 
the nyse requires listed companies to make full and timely 
disclosure of all material corporate developments nyse spokesman 
richard torrenzano would only say well be looking into it 
texas instruments general counsel richard agnich said the 
company has discussed the importance of patents in general in 
quarterly statements including its most recent one on oct 20 
we have said that we think we have opportunity because of 
our patent portfolio he said we dont go talking patent by 
patent or the status of individual applications 
ms west said the companys financial reports and statements had 
indicated the company was optimistic that we would get the 
patent 
texas instruments good fortune raised the possibility that 
national semiconductor corp of santa clara calif might also 
receive a japanese patent since it is the parent of another us 
company that once owned a basic us patent on the integrated 
circuit 
jack kilby and robert noyce are regarded as coinventors of the 
integrated circuit noyce then with fairchild semiconductor corp 
was awarded a us patent in 1961 kilby was awarded his patent in 
1964 both us patents have now expired 
fairchild has since been acquired by national semiconductor 
mary coady a national spokeswoman said the company was checking 
on whether it had a patent application pending in japan she said 
the company did not expect to know until next week 
the integrated circuit is found in every computer and most 
electronic devices and its invention helped texas instruments 
become one of the worlds first hightechnology companies but 
japan has become the worlds largest producer of chips 
the recently awarded texas instruments patent will last until 
nov 27 2001 
initially we watched the integrated circuit spread around the 
world with a great deal of pride and today theres some concern 
about the united states competitiveness in the industry 
said kilby 
thats a long story im not sure i fully understand kilby 
said many of the american semiconductor manufacturers feel that 
the japanese used some unfair tactic i dont know that thats 
really so 
but regarding the lagging patent from japan kilby said 
thats a little peculiar their process is a little slower 
than ours but 30 years is most unusual 
the delay actually makes the patent more valuable because 
licensing fees will be much higher than they would have been in the 
1960s when integrated circuit production in japan was much smaller

media and entertainment giant time warner inc 
said wednesday it has agreed to sell textbook publisher scott 
foresman and co for about 455 million and will take a 175 
million pretax loss on the sale 
it is time warners first major sale of assets following time 
incs agreement this past summer to buy warner communications inc 
for 14 billion 
the buyer is harper amp row publishers inc a subsidiary of 
rupert murdochs news corp and the deal puts harper among the top 
five educational publishers 
analysts said scott foresman has not performed as well as 
expected since time bought it for 520 million cash and 50 million 
in assumed debt in october 1986 time subsequently put the college 
textbook division of another of its publishing companies little 
brown amp co under scott foresman 
in the past two years the costs of competing in the textbook 
publishing business grew as publishers consolidated promotional 
costs climbed and school officials became more insistent on changes 
in books to suit their areas 
rumors that scott foresman was for sale have circulated for more 
than 18 months predating times deal with warner the agreed sale 
price includes 48 million in debt the companies said 
time warner refused to say how much scott foresman generated for 
the company last year but trade sources estimated revenue at about 
249 million 
scott foresman is a standalone business unrelated to what 
they do said peter appert media analyst for cj lawrence 
morgan grenfell 
he said time warner would have had to invest considerable 
amounts to keep scott foresman competitive and clearly did not want 
to do that 
mary kukowski who follows time warner for bear stearns amp co 
said the sale was very positive for time warner despite the 
pretax loss it will cause in the fourth quarter 
it is positive to get it behind them and move on she said 
she said the accounting complications of combining warners 
results with those of time already have caused stock market 
analysts to discount the companys financial results for the year 
and are focusing on 1990 prospects 
time warner said proceeds from the sale would help it reduce its 
debt but that its main reason for selling the glenview illbased 
textbook publisher was that scott foresman was outside its core 
businesses those businesses are magazines filmed entertainment 
records cable and pay television and books marketed directly to 
consumers through stores or book clubs 
the transaction is expected to be completed by the end of the 
year and is subject to regulatory filings 
in trading on the new york stock exchange time warner fell 37 
cents a share to 13137 
harper amp row already has a college textbook division but sold 
its elementary and high school textbook division five years ago 
in the meantime harper amp row was acquired by australiabased 
news corp 
george craig president of harper amp row said the acquisition 
rounds out the harper amp row educational publishing program with a 
premier name in that field 
according to the book industry newsletter bp report scott 
foresman had 249 million in revenue in 1988 including 181 
million from elementary and higher education and 68 million from 
college textbook publishing 
the acquisition will place harper amp row among the top five 
publishers in both the school and college categories according to 
bp report 
the leaders are harcourt brace jovanovich inc paramount 
communications incs simon amp schuster unit macmillanmcgraw hill 
school publishing co and houghton mifflin co 
harper amp row also publishes a range of generalinterest books in 
hardcover and paperback and has medical and religious book 
divisions it recently launched a new mass market paperback line of

an american airlines pilot asked passengers 
during a severe storm to vote on whether to divert the flight to a 
new york state airport or turn back to chicago two passengers said 
wednesday but federal aviation investigators said it was a simple 
misunderstanding 
american airlines denied the pilot of flight 492 to new yorks 
laguardia airport had let passengers make such a decision last 
thursday 
muriel and fred sider a suburban northbrook couple aboard the 
flight insist thats what happened but the federal aviation 
administration investigated wednesday and concluded otherwise 
nobody did anything wrong said faa spokeswoman kathleen 
bergen at regional headquarters in new york 
he was not asking passengers whether they wanted to fly into a 
storm thats a captains decision she said he was asking 
how many passengers needed ground transportation to laguardia 
the issue is closed bergen said nobody did anything 
wrong 
we just felt that it was an unbelievable situation that 
passengers would be polled as to where the flight was going to 
go said mrs sider who said she was among the minority who 
wanted to turn back 
the pilot went with the majority who voted to continue the 
trip she said because of the storm the plane landed 60 miles 
away at stewart international airport near newburgh ny 
thats carrying democracy a touch too far i dont want to be 
involved in safety decisions said sider a 64yearold 
advertising executive who wrote a letter complaining to american 
the plane had a safe but very bumpy landing in a heavy 
rainstorm mrs sider said the couple learned later that severe 
winds that same day collapsed a cafeteria wall at an elementary 
school three miles from stewart killing seven students and 
injuring 18 
we knew before we left that weather conditions were bad on the 
east coast said mrs sider a 61yearold travel agent they 
kept us at ohare on the ground for about an hour before they 
decided to go 
about an hour into the flight the pilot got on the loudspeaker 
and said that laguardia was definitely closed in but they could 
get into stewart airport and wanted a vote as to how the 
passengers felt mrs sider said 
the stewardesses took a show of hands she said 
the pilot told passengers landing at stewart would be safe 
other passengers laughed and said hey were getting to vote 
on it sider said 
but american spokesman tom stack said passengers were not asked 
to make any decisions about where the plane would go the decision 
to land at stewart was made by airline officials at headquarters in 
dallas he said 
there was never any question raised to the passengers about 
the diversion he said 
once the plane landed at stewart passengers were asked to 
decide whether they wanted to be bused into new york city or take a 
return flight back to chicago stack said they were given the 
option because the airline figured many of the businesspeople on 
board had missed meetings and would want to return stack said 
the pilot whom stack would not identify did what he was 
supposed to do and handled himself in a professional manner the 
spokesman said 
the plane carried a cockpit crew of three and 62 passengers 
stack said but he would not release a passenger list 
kathleen bergen a spokeswoman at the faas eastern region 
headquarters in new york said the agency is investigating she had 
no further comment 
the head of a washington dcbased group that lobbies for 
passengers rights said hed never heard of such a case before 
theyre paying the pilot to make those kinds of decisions 
said chris witkowski director of the aviation consumer action 
project i dont know if its advisable to place that 
responsibility on the passengers 
the siders say theyre certain other passengers would back up 
their version of events 
i understand instructions when i hear them and my wifes been 
a travel agent for 20 years sider said i dont think we both 
could have misunderstood it

after nine months of a bitter walkout striking 
eastern airlines pilots voted late wednesday to end their strike 
the participation of the pilots has been a crucial element of 
the walkout begun by the airlines machinist union members and 
later joined by the pilots and eastern flight attendants 
the eastern pilots union voted at a meeting in reston va to 
abandon their picket lines the day after president bush vetoed 
legislation that would set up a blueribbon commission to 
investigate the dispute 
in his veto message bush said congress which would have 
conducted the investigation had no business interfering in the 
contract and court disputes over the strike 
a statement released by the air line pilots association said the 
pilots voted to call off their strike in sympathy with the 
machinists and return to work but eastern officials have replaced 
many of the 2250 striking pilots with nonunion fliers and have 
said there would be few if any jobs for the strikers to return to 
its a very interesting development miamibased eastern 
said in a statement our only regret is that it didnt come 
earlier and we could have avoided all the trauma that has come to 
eastern airlines 
there currently are no openings for pilots at the airline which 
now has about 1800 fliers the company said but it indicated 
there could be slots in the future which would be filled in the 
order in which pilots returned to work except in cases where 
pilots with experience on specific types of aircraft are needed 
eastern said striking pilots will be recalled as jobs come 
open in the future and invited them to sign the recall list 
the strike continues for us john peterpaul vice president 
of the international association of machinists said in a telephone 
interview late wednesday what they the pilots do is their 
affair were not calling this thing off 
peterpaul said there is a fairly good chance that congress will 
be able to override the presidents veto that action which 
congressional sponsors of the measure have promised cant come 
until congress reconvenes in two months 
technically under the railway labor act which governs airlines 
contract disputes only the machinists are on strike the pilots 
and flight attendants have been honoring machinist picket lines in 
legal sympathy strikes 
there were only about 2250 eastern pilots on strike as of 
wednesday according to alpa down from 3600 when the strike began 
on march 4 
the pilots had been the linchpin of the strike surprising 
management when they joined easterns machinists in a sympathy 
walkout the pilots who are more difficult to replace wielded far 
more economic clout than the machinists and flight attendants they 
joined on the picket lines that made the strike far more 
threatening 
back in march the decision of the pilots the elite among 
union members to join the workingclass machinists strike dealt 
the crushing blow to eastern which already was suffering from 
financial losses and longtime labormanagement tensions 
frank lorenzo chairman of easterns parent texas air corp put 
eastern under chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on march 9 five 
days after the strike began since then lorenzo and his management 
team have been hiring replacement workers and rebuilding eastern as 
a smaller carrier 
theyve got all the pilots they need paul karos an airline 
analyst at first boston corp said wednesday the strike has 
been mainly symbolic 
pilot power was a key element in the early months of the 
walkout as the national pilots union threatened countrywide job 
actions in solidarity with the eastern fliers and the pilots 
attorneys argued forcefully against the company in federal 
bankruptcy court 
the strength of the pilots ranks eroded however as the 
grueling strike wore on 
the crucial turning point came in august when eastern pilots 
voted by a wide margin to continue the strike but several hundred 
fliers crossed picket lines and returned to work 
as the pilots still on strike increasingly were stripped to the 
radical core of the group their leadership was changed jack 
bavis chairman of the eastern pilots executive council was 
recalled by union leaders and replaced by skip copeland a 27year 
eastern veteran considered a hardliner on the strike and far less 
conciliatory than bavis 
the strike has for all intents and purposes been over 
said louis marckesano an analyst with janney montgomery scott inc 
in philadelphia it doesnt have much purpose anymore

manufacturing and supplying defective fasteners used on the rocket 
boosters of nasas space shuttles officials said wednesday 
lee aerospace products inc company president darrell lee and 
vice president jerry martin were convicted sept 22 in us 
district court on multiple counts of mail fraud and submitting 
false statements to nasa according to a statement from us 
attorney robert w genzman 
nasa used the defective fasteners on its manned space shuttle 
missions for more than four years from august 1983 to september 
1987 the statement said 
on jan 28 1986 the space shuttle challenger exploded shortly 
after liftoff killing all seven crew members later tests laid the 
blame for the tragedy on the orings in the joints between the 
booster segments not to any fasteners 
lee aerospace and lee were convicted on 14 counts of mail fraud 
and 20 counts of providing or causing to be provided false 
statements to an agency of the united states genzman said 
the company based in chatsworth calif was fined 10000 on 
each of the 34 counts 
lee 47 who was described as a california resident was 
sentenced to four years and 70 days in prison and fined 50000

bolts screws and other fasteners manufactured by lee aerospace 
have been distributed for use in commercial aircraft and military 
hardware as well as the space shuttle program 
the government alleged the company and its two officers 
defrauded and caused usbi booster production co to make false 
statements to nasa in the sale of substandard fasteners by falsely 
certifying that the fasteners had been manufactured and tested in 
accordance with all applicable specifications when in truth and 
in fact they had not 
nasa on wednesday expressed satisfaction with the sentences 
we cannot legislate ethics and integrity said william d 
hager nasas assistant inspector general but today we have 
succeeded in raising the stakes in the fight against whitecollar 
crime

boeing co production workers returned to their 
jobs wednesday after a 48day strike but opertions werent 
expected to be back to normal until after new years company 
officials said 
boeing spokesman paul binder said 50 percent to 55 percent of 
the work force returned on the first two shifts with a 60 percent 
to 65 percent return projected by the end of the day following the 
strike by the international association of machinists and aerospace 
workers 
no problems or incidents were reported and the number of 
workers on the job will be close to normal i would imagine by 
monday binder said 
wednesday was devoted almost exclusively to crew meetings and 
development of backtowork plans 
at the factory that makes 747 and 767 jetliners in everett 
where strikers tended to be a little more visible and vocal 
than elsewhere company officials who sat in on a few meetings 
found everybody was in a good mood pretty upbeat said jack 
gamble of boeing commercial airplanes 
workers entering the complex in renton where the smaller 737s 
and 757s are made expressed mixed feelings about the new contract 
but relief to be earning money again 
its nice to go back if it were another time of year it would 
be different we might have stayed out longer said tracy 
dorning 28 an electrical inspector at renton 
many said they would be willing to work overtime voluntarily as 
the company scrambles to catch up with an enormous backlog of 
orders but they were glad mandatory overtime had been reduced 
they can ask me and ill be here said carol whitson 36 a 
wire shop worker but you cant work people to death im glad 
the restrictions are there 
at boeing military airplanes in wichita kan machinist bart 
harris said he was ready for work but would have remained on the 
picket line had the contract vote gone the other way 
youve just got to put your feelings aside and do it he 
said it could have been much better but the majority rules 
the union represents 57800 workers including 43300 in the 
seattle area 12000 in wichita 1700 in portland ore and a few 
hundred at scattered sites in california hawaii montana utah 
wyoming north dakota and other states 
although boeing is the biggest employer in the puget sound area 
the strike was a relatively small economic event in the region 
said richard conway a seattle economic consultant 
major retailers and boeing subcontractors reported relatively 
small declines in business partly because many workers had been 
working so much overtime before the strike and many subcontractors 
were behind in deliveries conway said 
boeing the worlds largest commercial airplane maker was 
producing 29 airplanes a month before the walkout during the 
strike supervisors and nonstriking personnel delivered 24 planes 
all of which were virtually complete before the walkout 
getting production back on schedule will take until probably 
sometime after the first of the year if everything goes well 
gamble said 
boeing shuts down almost completely for the fourday 
thanksgiving holiday weekend and for the week between christmas and 
new years day 
gamble said it would take two weeks to get just the commercial 
airplane production force reorganized and reassigned tools 
recalibrated and work positions realigned 
most workers arriving wednesday were able to collect a 500 
advance on the annual bonus to be paid dec 8 under the new pact
