republican george bush on tuesday called for a federal law 
banning discrimination against aids sufferers to lay to rest some 
fears democrat michael dukakis endorsed spending 3 billion on 
new housing programs 
meanwhile gop sources said new jersey gov thomas kean had been 
tapped as the keynote speaker for the republican convention in new 
orleans in august word filtered out the day after the democrats 
announced that texas state treasurer ann richards would give the 
opening speech at their convention 
dukakis just three weeks away from the democratic national 
convention in atlanta suggested there was no point in paying 
attention to public speculation about who might be on his list for 
the vice presidential nomination 
theres only one guy who knows whats going on and thats the 
guy youre looking at the massachusetts governor told reporters 
in boston 
jesse jackson who is still contesting the democratic 
presidential nomination as well as saying he deserves consideration 
for the no 2 spot faced a snarled schedule as plane troubles 
forced cancellation of a texas speech 
vice president bush campaigning in californias silicon valley 
came out strongly in favor of the report of president reagans 
commission on aids calling it a landmark analysis 
bush the certain gop nominee praised the report for 
recognizing the need for patient notification and widespread 
testing as a means to limit the spread of aids such programs would 
be ineffective without being coupled with strict confidentiality 
and antidiscrimination provisions 
on air force two on the way to california from washington bush 
said that means he supports a federal law barring discrimination 
against aids sufferers a key provision of the report on which 
reagan has yet to take a position 
i think it is needed bush said i think it is important 
to do a lot to lay to rest some of the fears there is a lot of 
misunderstanding 
i would hate if a kid of mine got a blood transfusion if my 
grandson had aids and the community discriminated against that 
child innocent child particularly when the report concludes 
aids is not cant be transmitted in ways that some had feared 
bush said 
dukakis responded to the report last week saying in a statement 
issued friday we join the commission in its call for tougher 
antidiscrimination and confidentiality measures we support their 
call for expanded education and research programs and innovative 
approaches to providing care 
in his response dukakis urged reagan to act on the commissions 
recommendations before leaving office 
we must come together in this time of crisis and demonstrate 
the true american character of compassion and caring for our fellow 
human beings living with aids dukakis said in the statement 
dukakis tried to keep the focus on issues tuesday speaking to a 
housing forum in boston and then touring a site where more than a 
dozen homes have been sold to low and moderateincome people 
through a state program offering subsidized mortgages 
i dont see how we can talk about a bright economic future for 
america if it doesnt include decent and affordable housing for all 
our citizens dukakis said in a speech to the housing forum 
he promised if elected to provide 3 billion to carry out a 
program that would be established under legislation sponsored by 
sen alan cranston of california cranston joined dukakis for the 
event 
dukakis blamed what he said was a lack of affordable housing on 
a 90 percent cut in federal spending on housing by the reagan 
administration he brushed aside questions about bushs stand on 
housing saying i dont know that he has a policy 
reporters pressed dukakis on how the process of picking a 
running mate is going especially since he is flying to washington 
on wednesday to meet with many democratic senators 
some of them may be possibilities dukakis said 
the massachusetts governor answered with a flat no when 
asked if sen bob graham of florida had been ruled out he refused 
to answer directly about sen sam nunn of georgia saying only that 
he would talk with nunn on wednesday 
nunn has said he doesnt want to be considered 
republicans kept up their fire on dukakis with former united 
nations ambassador jeane kirkpatrick saying he doesnt have the 
experience that bush does 
i dont know michael dukakis personally but we all know that 
he has had no opportunity in his life to really devote himself to 
foreign affairs he has been concerned above all with local and 
state affairs and george bush has been concerned with the world 
she told reporters in washington 
meanwhile the bush campaign put out new materials on the 
massachusetts prison furlough program that dukakis has defended and 
bush has criticized the materials said there had been a 
dangerous increase in the furlough program in the last three 
years including a doubling of furloughs for prisoners convicted of 
drug offenses 
leslie dach dukakis communications director responded to the 
statement saying the bush campaign continues to try and erect a 
smoke screen around george bushs leadership of a failed war 
against drugs michael dukakis has run a criminal justice system 
thats increased convictions for drug offenses 500 percent in five 
years 
democrat jesse jackson speaking tuesday night to a convention 
of operation push the chicagobased civil rights group he founded 
said federal programs to help minority businesses should be 
expanded 
jackson told the group meeting in rosemont ill that minority 
businesses should receive 10 percent of all contracts with federal 
agencies 
minority business enterprise and womens business enterprise 
require a national focus and priority commitments in order that 
these key areas of our economy can reach their fullest potential 
jackson said the setaside program needs improvement and 
expansion not termination 
meanwhile richards the democrats choice for keynote speaker 
got some advice from the 1984 keynoter new york gov mario cuomo 
i said the speech must be yours cuomo said he told 
richards you should write it and then you should read it to the 
people in your office not the pros forget the pros do it 
with your secretary with your accountants with your elevator 
operators 
get the ordinary audience as much of an ordinary audience as 
you can and you will learn extraordinary things cuomo said he 
told richards

the soviet unions most prominent literary journal 
wants to publish cancer ward by alexander solzhenitsyn the 
dissident soviet author forcibly sent into exile 14 years ago as a 
renegade and traitor 
if the novel is printed here it would represent a stunning 
turnaround in official treatment of solzhenitsyn 69 and a further 
broadening in the kremlins campaign for glasnost or greater 
openness 
solzhenitsyn the 1970 nobel literature laureate earned world 
renown and his governments opprobrium in the 1970s for his 
chronology of soviet political repression the gulag 
archipelago 
the editor of the novy mir monthly sergei p zalygin said 
monday that negotiations for publishing cancer ward were under 
way but declined to say anything more 
things should become clear in about a week or 10 days 
zalygin said in an interview 
however solzhenitsyns wife natalya was quoted by the new 
york times as saying monday that soviet officials have not 
approached solzhenitsyn about publishing any of his works in the 
soviet union 
the newspaper said her as saying solzhenitsyn would not discuss 
the report but that she was speaking on his behalf and that any 
talk of possibly publishing cancer ward in the soviet union was 
premature to say the least 
as of today monday solzhenitsyn has not received any kind 
of proposal or other overture about publishing his books in the 
soviet union she said in a telephone interview from the couples 
vermont home according to the times 
twenty years ago novy mir had set cancer ward in type but 
abandoned its plans to print the book in 1968 following the arrest 
of several dissidents 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov said last year 
that solzhenitsyn owns the copyright to the novel and that it 
could not be published in a soviet edition without his consent 
solzhenitsyn a former political prisoner was forcibly exiled 
in 1974 and his works were ordered removed from public libraries 
before solzhenitsyns exile the communist party daily pravda 
called the writer a renegade and a profoundly immoral man 
and said he merited the fate of a traitor it said the gulag 
trilogy was another slanderous book from his pen 
since mikhail s gorbachev became soviet leader in march 1985 
many soviet authors whose works were once banned have been 
published in soviet editions including boris pasternaks dr 
zhivago and mikhail bulgakovs heart of a dog 
but solzhenitsyn has remained off limits 
many of the criticisms leveled by solzhenitsyn at the bloody 
political terror waged by dictator josef v stalin have become 
commonplace in soviet media under gorbachev 
in works like the gulag trilogy solzhenitsyn goes beyond 
official soviet thinking by saying that widescale baseless 
repression began under soviet founder vladimir i lenin and that 
rule by the officially atheist communist party leads to immorality 
during the moscow summit president reagan made a speech at the 
official writers union in which he appealed for publication of 
solzhenitsyns works in his native land 
zalygin told reporters then that publication of cancer ward 
was contingent on an agreement with solzhenitsyn and that he was 
conducting the negotiations himself 
in cancer ward solzhenitsyn depicts a hospital in soviet 
kazakhstan at the twilight of stalins 29year reign which ended 
with the dictators death in 1953 the hospital seems to stand for 
soviet society as a whole while the cancer the patients suffer 
from represents the ravages of stalins terror 
cultural bureaucrats reportedly ruled out the publication of 
cancer ward while solzhenitsyn was still living in the soviet 
union because they thought the book antihumanist 
but zalygin said he evaluated the novel in a positive way in 
my opinion this is an interesting and serious work 
in 1967 solzhenistyn engaged in acrimonimous and ultimately 
futile debate with the writers union to push for publication of 
cancer ward 
in a meeting at the writers union headquarters he said the task 
of literature was to tell people the real truth as they expect 
it and to lay bare the secrets of the human heart and 
conscience 
the head of the writers union vladimir v karpov spoke monday 
of the possibility of publishing solzhenitsyn and said the writer 
may even be allowed to return home 
karpov said he did not think an official invitation would be 
extended to solzhenitsyn to return 
karpov and other soviet cultural figures met with reporters to 
discuss the nationwide communist party conference that opens 
tuesday 
solzhenitsyn was arrested in 1945 on the grounds that he had 
criticized stalin and spent eight years in labor camps he was 
released in 1953 and won fame in 1962 when novy mir published his 
chronicle of stalinera prison camp life one day in the life of 
ivan denisovich

attorney general edwin meese iii said tuesday 
that congressional actions led to an attitude of weve got to get 
ours now on the part of defense contractors who are being 
investigated for alleged fraud and bribery 
meese told a news conference that congress has put so many 
layers of requirements on pentagon officials who have had to 
face up to the fact that budget planning cycles have been ignored 
in the congressional appropriations 
i think some of these actions have contributed to some of 
the contractors saying weve got to get ours now and resorting 
to some of these practices now under investigation the attorney 
general said 
the investigation being coordinated by henry hudson the us 
attorney for the eastern district of virginia is probing 
allegations that defense contractors and consultants many of them 
former military men bribed pentagon officials for contracting 
details that could be vital in winning contracts worth billions of 
dollars 
meese said the pentagon has been so beset by a lot of things 
there are problems in the procurement process that are not the 
fault of the pentagon 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the armed services committee 
said that while he agrees there are too many regulations many of 
them came from within the pentagon rather than from congress and he 
disputed that such regulations caused the problems under 
investigation 
this was caused from most of what ive heard by pure old 
fraud and corruption nunn said i dont know of any rule or 
law thats passed that would entice someone to sell a government 
secret for money 
meese said he met with defense secretary frank carlucci to 
discuss sharing information with the pentagon so that the military 
can determine whether it needs to take steps against defense 
contractors or consultants 
sen strom thurmond rsc recently urged more cooperation 
between carlucci and meese carlucci has said the pentagon would 
not necessarily wait for convictions in the current investigation 
before taking steps against contractors 
although meese answered reporters questions on the probe he 
did not mention that he had removed himself monday from all 
decisionmaking in the case because his own lawyers are 
representing clients involved in it justice department spokesman 
pat korten confirmed tuesday night in a telephone interview that 
meese had recused himself from the investigation 
the attorney generals law firm miller cassidy larroca amp 
lewin represents him in a lengthy investigation by independent 
counsel james mckay of whether meese used his public office to 
provide favored treatment for friends or companies which may have 
in turn rewarded him or his family 
elsewhere the defense departments top contracting official 
robert costello tried last month to limit searches of defense 
plants by investigators looking for corruption 
in a may 5 memo to carlucci a copy of which was obtained by the 
associated press the undersecretary of defense for acquisitions 
suggested that top pentagon officials including himself be given 
veto power over searches of contractor facilities 
costellos anger was triggered by a search feb 25 at the 
electronic amp space division of emerson electric co near st louis 
in a fraud investigation that apparently is not related to the 
nationwide probe 
meanwhile sources familiar with the probe said investigators 
regard as significant potential evidence videotapes of 
surreptitiously recorded meetings between defense department 
personnel and industry consultants 
more than one of the tapes picked up an audible sound track of 
the conversation said the sources who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the sources refused to say whether the tapes show money or 
confidential government documents changing hands but one said 
the participants are doing more than talking 
one source said there arent that many videotapes videotapes 
are not an extensive technique in the case largely because of 
the difficulty of making arrangements to tape a meeting that might 
be taking place without much advance notice 
but the sources said the government regards the videotapes as 
important evidence when combined with extensive wiretapping that 
has been the basic tool in the investigation to date 
sources said over the weekend that among those appearing on the 
videotapes are navy officialturnedconsultant melvyn paisley and 
current pentagon officials victor cohen and james gaines both of 
whom have been transferred from handling procurement issues while 
the investigation is under way 
the mere fact that the government videotapes or records a 
meeting or conversation doesnt make that meeting or conversation 
illegal said robert plotkin an attorney for paisley they 
used videotapes in the delorean case and he was acquitted 
automaker john z delorean was acquitted of cocainetrafficking 
charges in 1984 in a case in which fbi agents posing as drug 
dealers conducted videotaped discussions with him federal jurors 
said they felt delorean who was trying at the time to save his 
struggling sports car company had been entrapped 
gaines attorney michael schatzow deplored the leaking of 
information about the investigation and videotapes but otherwise 
declined to comment 
over the weekend sources said some videotapes show money being 
paid to pentagon personnel although they declined to specify who 
was involved those sources said gaines was videotaped at meetings 
in which highly confidential documents relating to pentagon 
contracts allegedly changed hands 
paisley was assistant secretary of the navy for research 
engineering and systems before leaving the government in 1987 to 
become a consultant to major defense contractors 
cohen is top aide to a deputy assistant air force secretary in 
charge of buying tactical command control communications and 
computer systems gaines is deputy assistant navy secretary for 
acquisition management 
in other developments

former navy secretary james h webb said investigators told him 
last fall that paisley and an unidentified member of webbs 
headquarters staff were under investigation in the defense probe 
webb said he did not tell carlucci about the matter because he 
figured the fbi would tell him if and when it wished 
at the white house president reagan got a third update tuesday 
on the status of the investigation spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
reviewed several matters that have been discussed publicly such as 
the reassignment of certain employees 
the president wants the matter cleaned up as rapidly as 
possible both from the standpoint of the investigation of 
individuals and the procurement system at the pentagon fitzwater 
said 
the new york times reported in wednesdays editions that fbi 
agents had searched the home of richard seelmeyer a former 
administrative assistant to the late rep joseph p addabbo 
dny who was chairman of the house subcommittee on defense 
appropriations before his death in april 1986 
the times said the fbi also searched the newark nj offices 
of the bryant ticket agency which books seats at entertainment 
events 
seelmeyer is the publisher of capitol hill defense digest a 
newsletter about military matters a telephone listing in berwin 
heights md for seelmeyer was busy tuesday night 
hudson has said that no current members of congress are under 
investigation in the probe 
defense department officials are reviewing formerly closed 
cases of alleged contract irregularities that involve people 
companies or contracts identified in connection with the justice 
departments probe and may reopen six of those cases pentagon 
inspector general june gibbs brown told the washington post for a 
story in wednesdays editions 
plotkin and e lawrence barcella jr who represent paisley and 
his wife vicki protested in a letter to prosecutor hudson the 
almost daily disclosure of secret investigative information that 
subject our clients to trial by innuendo and rumor before this 
situation has even been presented to or considered for final action 
by the grand jury 
they said that hudsons briefings last week for reagan and for 
members of congress may have violated rules against disclosures of 
matters before grand juries and in any event guarantee that 
additional disclosures are likely to occur 
they also complained that investigators removed all relevant 
documents from the paisleys home and office preventing them or 
their counsel from adequately reviewing the situation or 
substantively responding to the outlandish disclosures

the colossal tent of the roaring lions 
ponderous pachyderms cavorting clowns and doers of deathdefying 
deeds is 5000 miles from home about to dazzle the mysterious east 
ringling brothers and barnum and bailey circus known here as 
ringuringu burathazu ando bahnamu ando bairee sahkasu is 
making its first appearance abroad 15 weeks in japan beginning 
friday in the red and yellow big top 
hundreds of animals and people are assembled on the outskirts of 
this northern city getting ready to astound the japanese 
i think theyll get a kick out of it said kenneth feld who 
produces the wonders of the famous circus its so visual its 
not a language thing that they have to understand 
but ringling brothers is taking no chances about language 
singing ringmaster dinny mcguire besides riding a galumphing 
elephant in the opening number also must deliver his lines in 
japanese 
amazing elephants strange clowns he called out in japanese 
from his unsteady perch during a rehearsal beautiful showgirls 
gathered from all over the world to present to you the wonders of 
the circus 
ships planes and 100 tractortrailer trucks delivered mcguire 
25 clowns a 14piece band 16 elephants 14 lions and assorted 
horses ponies camels llamas humans and equipment for the 
threering assault on the the japanese imagination 
customs officials poked through scores of containers marked as 
containing costumes shoes nuts and bolts but an item labeled 
glue guns stopped them said mike fauls the general manager 
it was a big brouhaha he said it took several meetings 
and many days in the future well call them glue machines 
haphazard roads and numerous regulations mean the circus will do 
most of its moving by sea from the northern island of hokkaido to 
its second stop in tokyo later this summer and then on to osaka 
the 11day pacific crossing already has taken its toll on the 
elephants which range from babies to 14000pound adults feld 
said some had lost 800 pounds and were bleary when two shinto 
priests threw confetti on them at a welcoming ceremony june 13 
he said it cost about 10 million to create the overseas troupe 
as a supplement to ringlings two permanent american tours feld 
hopes to pack in the japanese even at ticket prices equivalent to 
about 40 a head and is planning a 25week tour for next year 
the japanese people have a lot of money and they work five 
days a week now instead of six he said theres no reason we 
cant have a circus in japan six months of the year 
what i hope is to build a tradition so i can come back every 
year every year japanese kids will look forward to the ringling 
bros and barnum and bailey circus 
feld doesnt seem bothered that the soviet unions bolshoi 
circus with a shorter name and decades of appearances here is 
more famous in japan and is playing at the same time 
hey he said with a shrug when youre the greatest show 
on earth

rainshowers over northern india in the 
past week have raised hopes of a good harvest after three years of 
devastating drought 
farmers have dispatched tractors and bullock teams to plow their 
dusty brown fields so they can begin sowing the summer crop 
if it keeps raining it will be fantastic said ram phal a 
farmer in narsinghpur 25 miles southwest of new delhi i can 
hear frogs croaking at night and that means a good monsoon 
while farmers in americas heartland hope for rain to save their 
crops weathermen in india predict this years monsoon will be 
normal this year for the first time since 1984 the last three 
summers brought increasing hardship and sometimes hunger to the 534 
million indians twothirds of the total 800 million population 
who depend on agriculture for their livelihood 
i just grew enough to eat at home said kanwar singh 
another farmer i havent been to the grain market for three 
years 
the annual monsoon is the main source of irrigation for most 
indian crops when the monsoon failed to materialize last year 
after two years of belownormal rainfall 16 of the countrys 25 
states suffered 
scientists estimate that the drought was the worst in the past 
125 years the government has spent 838 million in drought relief 
measures and imported 15 million metric tons of cereal to 
replenish buffer stocks 
the imports of grains were the first in five years and came more 
than a decade after india announced selfsufficiency in food 
production 
but in the hamlet of narsinghpur the macroeconomics of food 
imports and production of the past years are overshadowed by clouds 
in the skies and smiles on the faces of farmers 
it is time to sow millet and the short but timely drizzles 
portend a good harvest 
if god gave me clouds and sons every day wouldnt life be 
wonderful said ram phal who owns seven acres around the village 
of 500 people he said one more year of drought would have forced 
him to sell part of his holdings 
the hindu a madrasbased newspaper said saturday that this 
years monsoon should cover the country by midjuly auguring well 
for the summer crop 
the rains will change the color of the field said ram phal 
pointing toward his barren brown farmland now being plowed for 
sowing in two weeks it will all be green 
like other farmers in haryana state ram phal plants millet in 
march and june and wheat in november 
the agriculture ministry said friday the food output for the 
198788 growing season was 138 million tons compared with 1524 
million tons for 198384 the last time there was a good monsoon 
the shortages pushed prices up and they are unlikely to drop 
quickly stockpiles must be replenished and the government already 
is warning people especially grain dealers not to hoard 
in new delhi markets wheat sells for 10 cents a pound almost 
double the 1984 prices 
first there has to be a good monsoon and then a good crop 
said bhagwan das who owns a grain store in the capital then 
prices will fall maybe by the end of the year

the government has published a duty roster for july only four 
or five ministers of the 20member cabinet are in town 
all over the country signs are going up stangt for 
semester swedish for closed for vacation it is the national 
watchword for the month 
at least half the 343000 businesses in sweden are closing said 
jan krylborn director of the national swedish organization of 
small businesses among them are many of this countrys 48000 
industrial plants he said 
most companies that remain open are service organizations the 
distributors of ice cream and those kind of businesses he added 
sweden lives under snow and ice for much of the year so the 
arrival of summer is celebrated with almost pagan abandon 
midsommar the friday nearest the summer solstice or the 
first day of summer is a national holiday 
france and italy among other european countries virtually 
close down for the month of august in sweden it comes earlier and 
is embedded in legislation 
three consecutive vacation weeks during the three summer months 
are guaranteed by law to every swedish worker altogether swedes 
normally get five weeks annual vacation and the governing social 
democratic party has made a sixth week part of its campaign 
platform for next septembers election 
most people head for cottages in the countryside or take 
pleasure boats through the chain of 24000 islands stretching along 
the baltic coast such luxuries became available to average swedes 
through a longtime policy of cheap taxdeductible credit 
in addition swedes get days off during the year usually 
associated with religious holidays schoolchildren get one week in 
february called sport recess designed for skiing holidays 
vacations are sacrosanct and as the navy example shows not 
even national security can stand in their way 
last year the military came under fierce criticism for letting 
the entire antisubmarine unit go on vacation just after a massive 
hunt for a suspected intruder in the sensitive tore bay in the 
northern baltic 
this year not all the vessels are unstaffed marine 
commander bengt shuback told the svenska dagbladet newspaper but 
something like last year could still happen we are far from 
effective in looking for intruders 
the military says foreign submarines have regularly prowled the 
coastline of this neutral country for the last decade sweden has 
not identified the intruders since officially protesting to moscow 
over a 1982 incident 
shuback said the navy studied proposals to keep the unit 
operational during the summer such as sending the officers on 
expensespaid winter vacations to the mediterranean when the baltic 
is frozen 
the idea was rejected because the officers wives or girlfriends 
would be working and their children would be in school we must 
give the staff their legally required three weeks in summer 
shuback said

convicted murderer jean harris new book gives a 
firsthand look at how women were treated in prison recently 
the books title they always call us ladies stories from 
prison is derived from how the prison refers to its inmates 
as late as 1983 the official package room list issued to me 
aid i was allowed to have two jock straps and 200 cigars per month 
nowhere did it list a brassiere or lipstick the former 
headmistress of the exclusive madeira school for girls in mclean 
va writes 
inmates at bedford were referred to as girls or our 
girls and under one superintendent as those poor devils until 
1970 when someone ordered that we be called ladies harris 
writes today it is the one rule that seems to have been carved 
deep into the brain of every co commanding officer they always 
call us ladies no matter what were doing 
this is the second book by harris who is serving a 
15yeartolife sentence for murdering scarsdale diet author dr 
herman tarnower her first the autobiographical stranger in two 
worlds was a best seller in 1986 
they always call us ladies is a history of the bedford hills 
correctional facility since its founding as a womens reformatory 
in 1901 it also contains anecdotes about current inmates and 
prison life and is scheduled for publication aug 17 by charles 
scribners sons 
harris and tarnower were lovers she shot the 69yearold diet 
doctor to death in his home on march 10 1980 because he was 
supposedly leaving her for a younger woman while harris contends 
she shot tarnower four times by accident as he tried to stop her 
from committing suicide jurors concluded she deliberately killed 
him because he was ending their relationship 
the 65yearold harris who is not eligible for parole until 
1996 works in the prisons innovative childrens center bedford 
hills has a nursery where inmates can keep their babies for a full 
year after birth 
working writing and teaching has occupied much of harris time 
while imprisoned teaching she has maintained will cure 
anything short of the common cold and it is only through our 
children she has said that we can make a better world 
prisons should work to keep family ties taut and prisons should 
work to get prisoners to read and write and develop moral 
reasoning harris says 
inmates in new york generally arent eligible for clemency until 
they have served half their minimum sentence which is 1988 for 
harris last year her lawyer michael kennedy urged gov mario 
cuomo to issue a waiver for harris saying she was ill and had done 
good work on behalf of the children of bedford hills inmates 
harris has had two heart attacks while in prison 
cuomo turned down the request for early clemency review

president reagan expressed a willingness to 
broaden antidiscrimination protections for people suffering from 
aids saying the nation should confront the deadly disease in a 
thoughtful and bipartisan manner 
weve got to get moving to give people hope reagan said 
monday after getting the aids commissions final report he told an 
adviser to prepare a course of action for the administration 
within 30 days 
the president proposed one concrete step in a statement that for 
the most part complimented the 13member commission for its work in 
raising our level of understanding about aids 
reagan came close to embracing a principal recommendation of the 
study commission that office of personnel management guidelines 
spelling out protections for people with aids be mandatory for all 
government agencies 
he said at the suggestion of retired adm james d watkins the 
commissions chairman he had directed the aide dr ian macdonald 
to include among his priorities consideration of specific 
measures to strengthen implementation of the policy guidance from 
the opm guidelines 
the opm oversees the federal governments civilian work force 
numbering more than 23 million 
many people active in the battle against the spread of the 
deadly disease have said they believe it is vitally important to 
assure people infected by the virus that causes aids that they will 
be protected against discrimination at work and in medical 
insurance coverage 
the president should issue an executive order banning 
discrimination on the basis of handicap with hiv human 
immunodeficiency virus infection included as a handicapping 
condition the panel said in its report 
watkins told reporters he was elated with reagans willingness 
to consider signing just such an order 
watkins talking to reporters in the white house driveway said 
while he did not want to jump to conclusions reagans statement 
sends the first signal that were on the way toward protecting 
victims of the disease under the law 
the former chief of naval operations said the commission hopes 
the opm guidelines which other federal agencies may embrace 
voluntarily will be made mandatory by reagan in an executive order 
he said such a signal is needed because antidiscrimination 
policies in the various states differ and this has left a 
confusing mix of court decisions on discrimination suits 
weve pointed out that we think its time to bring the country 
together on that issue watkins said 
when pressed to say whether reagan had made a commitment to sign 
such an executive order he said well take it easy i think 
its coming 
besides urging reagan to sign an executive order the aids 
commission urged the broadening of section 504 of the 
rehabilitation act of 1973 to include protection for workers in 
private life 
watkins called reagan a compassionate humanitarian and said 
he believed the presidents thinking had changed somewhat on aids 
he said reagan related an anecdote about a woman who had written 
him telling him how two of her children became infected from the 
aids virus as a result of a blood transfusion she once had 
the president felt moved by the story and i told the 
president this was not atypical watkins said 
i want to express my sincere appreciation to admiral watkins 
and all of the commission participants for their perseverance and 
diligence in completing their work reagans statement said it 
is my hope that we can continue to approach this problem which is 
more than a medical crisis or a public health threat in a 
thoughtful and bipartisan manner 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a contagious 
disease that attacks the bodys immune system rendering it 
incapable of resisting other diseases and infections no one is 
known to have recovered from aids which most often is spread 
through close contact with blood blood products or semen from 
infected persons 
most victims have been male homosexuals or intravenous drug 
abusers 
as of june 13 aids had been diagnosed in 64896 americans of 
whom more than half or 36480 have died according to the federal 
centers for disease control

miles from othello to moses lake aboard the rail car stopping at 
warden to pick up relatives for part of the ride

50000 investment that cost another 50000 to refurbish a wife 
wouldnt like the competition 
but the groom added it may take me a little longer to

several families are reducing their garbage 
piles with help from a labor force that demands no wages takes no 
breaks requires no supervision and needs only a warm bed and a few 
food scraps 
theyre earthworms 
pierce county officials presented a bowl full of the slimy 
creatures last week to nine families volunteering for a recycling 
and composting project 
the families were told the worms convert food into soil in a 
process called composting if they are kept in a box with moist 
bedding and fed food scraps 
the county is teaching the families how to reduce waste dumped 
in the landfills which have polluted the groundwater and must be 
closed by 1991 unless the dumping volume is reduced significantly

as power sources go electric 
eels arent too practical but ham radio operators say in the event 
of a worldwide disaster the animals beat pushing a volkswagen van 
up a 3mile hill 
ham radio operators staged a 24hour demonstration saturday to 
test the resourcefulness of operators who provide emergency 
communications for the red cross in times of trouble 
at the vancouver aquarium in stanley park a red 40watt 
lightbulb flickered below a huge tank where two fat 5foot eels 
swam lazily back and forth 
electrodes in the water carry the amazonian eels bursts of 
power up to 600 volts to the bulb and a regulating circuit that 
helps charge a special radio battery 
its the first time to the best of our knowledge that anyone 
has stored eel power said operator steve buchan 
during the simulation operators must find ways to generate 
power for their radios when conventional power sources are out of 
commission wall sockets are off limits 
there are people in california right now who are pushing a 
volkswagen van 3 miles up a hill with the engine turned off and 
then letting it go down the hill generating enough power to 
communicate till it gets to the bottom of the hill buchan said 
but we think we have them beat biological power is something 
thats unique 
about 250000 ham radio operators in 140 countries including 
the soviet union where ham radios reportedly are tightly controlled 
participated in the simulation buchan said 
besides the eelpowered radios the communications vancouver 
team demonstrated a satellite linkup using a soviet satellite it 
made transmissions as clear as a crosstown telephone call instead 
of the compressed radio signals that often make voices sound like 
daffy duck

in this election year candidates for the 
republican and democratic presidential nominations are being 
flooded with advice 
advice on how best to run and win 
advice on what to do and say 
advice on what not to do and say 
advice on what to d if the previous advice proves effective and 
a prospective president becomes president in fact 
one advice giver sen richard lugar rind has put his 
advice in more formal form than usual enclosing it in the 269 
pages of a hardcover book 
the book letters to the next president published by simon 
and schuster deals with the foreign policy challenges and 
opportunities the next chief executive will face and is based in 
large part on lugars two years service as chairman of the senate 
foreign relations committee in 1985 and 1986 
in the book as in his chairmanship lugar pursues restoration 
of a bipartisan foreign policy based on a drive to extend democracy 
throughout the world 
he also thinks it important that in an often duplicitous world 
the president of the united states tell the truth 
because he wrote before george bush and michael dukakis clinched 
the republican and democratic presidential nominations lugars 
advice is general and not tailored to any particular candidate 
but he warns all candidates to resist the temptation to 
express extreme views on foreign policy that may capture 
temporary political allegiances but may also undermine longstanding 
policy objectives and cause general dismay 
lugar maintains that whoever wins the 1988 presidential 
sweepstakes must have as a primary goal ending the foreign policy 
war between the white house and congress 
in the past few years we have suffered through too many 
partisan impasses in foreign policy too much finger pointing and 
too little assumption of responsibility lugar said 
these letters are in part a signal from one senator that 
enough is enough 
lugar dismisses the notion that the 435 members of the house of 
representatives and the 100 members of the senate seek collective 
status as 535 secretaries of state endlessly interfering with the 
building of an effective foreign policy 
relatively few members spend the time and the energy required 
to articulate comments on the myriad of daily international 
events lugar said 
at the same time lugar believes congress has a constitutional 
duty to be involved in the formulation and execution of foreign 
policy he appealed to the next president to reach out to 
congressional leaders often 
you have to work with congress lugar advises the next 
president it will be exasperating but essential if you want to 
succeed 
pointing to the irancontra affair in the reagan administration 
lugar concludes that excessive secretiveness and refusal to consult 
closely with congress are a prescription for disaster 
the senator says he is prepared to argue that president reagan 
had the right to trade arms to iran in the hope that would lead to 
the release of americans held hostage in lebanon and to organize 
private support for the contra rebels in nicaragua 
but i will also argue that any president who undertakes such 
policies with the determination to keep them secret from the 
public the congress and from his own administration will 
jeopardize severely his credibility and his policies once his 
secret efforts leave the cocoon he said 
lugar has much specific advice 
he would have the next president retain the strategic defense 
initiative develop bipartisan support for it and convince the 
soviet union that an effective defense against nuclear attack is in 
their interests as well as in the interest of the united states 
he believes bipartisan consensus can be achieved on an effective 
policy to convince our adversaries that we will take the 
appropriate steps to prevent nicaragua from injuring the 
fundamental security of its neighbors or of the united states 
he believes an armed resistance will continue to be necessary if 
nicaraguas sandinista regime fails to embrace democratic reforms 
he advises the next president to respect the letter and spirit 
of the war powers act 
but some of his advice is as general as it is emphatic 
it is essential lugar says that the next president tell the 
truth no matter how often he is told the world is managed best 
by deception guile and cunning 
lugar maintains that the president of the united states must 
live by another higher standard 
even when his international colleagues are deep into intrigue 
and falsehood they need to know our president is telling the truth 
and that our foreign policy is based on telling the truth 
the american people need to have every reason to believe what 
their president is saying lugar says 
the president must maintain his veracity from the beginning to 
the end of his administration or make way for someone else who 
will do so

attorney general edwin meese iii has told 
employees that random drug testing will begin at justice department 
headquarters in two months to assure the public that those who 
enforce the laws are themselves upholding the law 
the notice to 6500 justice department employees said testing 
will be performed when there is reasonable suspicion of drug use 
for about 1800 employes who hold sensitive positions there will be 
random testing without such suspicion 
meeses announcement monday was met with a promise that suit 
would be filed in federal court today challenging the order on 
constitutional grounds 
the testing is the result of an executive order by president 
reagan two years ago directing the government to produce a 
drugfree workplace meese said a year of planning had gone into 
putting the program into practice 
in the foreword of a booklet meese explained that the 60day 
notice period provides any employee who may be using drugs the 
opportunity to stop using drugs well before the random testing 
actually begins 
the program has a safe harbor provision under which any 
employee who voluntarily admits illegal drug use enters a 
treatment program and stops using drugs will not be disciplined 
about 7 percent of the employees in certain categories 450 
people will be tested the booklet said all persons selected for 
hiring will also be subject to testing 
the categories were listed as presidential appointees those 
directly engaged in criminal law enforcement activities those 
entrusted with drugs those who require top secret or higher 
security clearances those suspected of drug use and volunteers 
stephen h sachs former attorney general of maryland and a 
former us attorney who is now in private practice said he would 
file suit on behalf of 40 justice department employees 
the heart of our objection is that the plans mandate acts of 
urination and then subject that urine to chemical analysis to see 
what secrets it reveals without any basis or showing that the 
individual in question is a drug abuser that that there is reason 
to believe he is a drug abuser sachs said 
the government couldnt do that to you or me as nonemployees 
and our contention is that when you become a government employee 
you dont check your constitutional rights at the door 
sachs said he plans next week to file for a preliminary 
injunction to stop testing while the suit is pending 
meese said the justice department having primary law 
enforcement responsibilities should lead the way for the rest of 
the federal government 
for any of our employees to use illegal drugs is to compromise 
the departments law enforcement mission meese said in order 
to have the publics cooperation in the war against drugs it is 
crucial that the public be assured that those who enforce the laws 
are themselves upholdng the law

the federal reserve will boost a key interest 
rate within the next month and then hope that credittightening 
move will be enough to keep inflation in check until the november 
election many analysts believe 
these economists said they expect the fed to increase its 
discount rate the interest the central bank charges on loans to 
member banks from 6 percent to 65 percent 
the fed has already executed a series of three tightening moves 
beginning in late march but it has held back from increasing its 
discount rate which is the most dramatic move the central bank can 
make to demonstrate its intention to push interest rates higher 
the last change in the discount rate occurred last september 
when it was increased from 55 percent to 6 percent that hike has 
been blamed in part for precipitating the october collapse of stock 
prices 
the central banks policymaking committee the federal open 
market committee meets wednesday and thursday behind closed doors 
to discuss the conduct of monetary policy fed chairman alan 
greenspan will report on the panels deliberations in an appearance 
before the senate banking committee on july 13 
many economists believe the fed is ready to tighten credit 
conditions even further because of inflationary pressures in the 
us economy 
lyle gramley a former member of the fed said he believed the 
central bank probably would raise the discount rate in july 
especially if the unemployment report for june indicates a surge in 
new jobs 
the feds main concern has to be that the economy may be 
growing too fast and that pressure on wages and prices will be 
building as the year goes on said gramley who is now chief 
economist for the mortgage bankers association 
gramley said he was looking for the increase in the discount 
rate to occur in july because he believes the central bank will 
want to get it over with well before the fall presidential election 
campaign 
the fed doesnt like to raise the discount rate if political 
criticism can be generated but they also dont want the rate to 
get so far out of touch with the market that they are open to 
criticism that they are subsidizing banks who are borrowing from 
them he said 
in late march and then again in early may and late may the fed 
acted to tighten interest rates by restricting the amount of money 
banks have for making loans the central banks goal was to 
restrain credit and thereby restrain overall demand in the economy 
the moves have been followed by a general rise in a variety of 
interest rates major banks boosted their prime lending rate 
onehalf percentage point in early may to 9 percent mortgage 
rates which had dropped to 984 percent in february began rising 
and now stand at 104 percent for fixedrate loans 
analysts said rates are likely to head higher for the rest of 
the year propelled by the tightermoney policy being pursued by 
the fed and by fasterthanexpected economic growth 
we think that sustained growth through 1989 will keep interest 
rates on a general uptrend said roger brinner senior economist 
at data resources inc of lexington mass 
analysts said while they expected further credit tightening on 
the part of the central bank it might not come at this weeks 
meeting they said there is no pressing need to reassure financial 
markets of the banks resolve to fight inflation 
bond markets in the united states have rallied after being 
buffeted by inflation fears a few weeks ago and the dollar has been 
surging in value in part because foreign investors have regained 
confidence in the us economy 
the overall economy as measured by the gross national product 
grew at a brisk 36 percent annual rate in the first three months 
of the year but many analysts believe that growth rate has slowed 
to a more sustainable 25 percent rate in the current apriljune 
quarter a pace less likely to raise concerns of overheating 
however the recent good news is balanced against other 
pressures such as the drought in the midwest which is expected to 
drive food prices higher 
the severe drought conditions can change the whole psychology 
of inflation with higher prices at food stores putting pressure on 
wages as americans find their purchasing power constrained said 
david jones senior economist at aubrey g lanston amp co a 
government securities dealer

the fledgling private american space launch 
industry has signed 20 customers already and may have 10 more by 
the end of the year the transportation department says 
the first of the private launches a communications satellite 
for the government of india is scheduled for launch next march by 
mcdonnell douglas according to a manifest or list released 
monday by the department 
the manifest illustrates the significant success american 
launch firms have had in capturing the major share of the world 
launch markets said transportation secretary jim burnley 
american firms won 13 launch contracts last year compared to just 
two by the european consortium ariane 
the commercial launchers will use federal facilities mostly at 
cape canaveral fla and will reimburse the government for all 
costs 
burnley said the launch contracts will provide 8000 jobs 
eleven of the manifested payloads will be launched for foreign 
customers and will offset the us balance of payments by as much 
as 660 million he said the commercial launch sector may very 
well be the most active part of americas nonmilitary space 
program for the next several years 
eight of the satellites on the list previously had been 
scheduled for launch from the space shuttle late in 1986 after 
the challenger accident grounded shuttle flights president reagan 
fostered a private launch industry by ordering the national 
aeronautics and space administration out of the business 
the schedule announced by burnley is subject to delays not the 
least of which may come because of a shortage of ammonium 
perchlorate a component of solid rocket fuel one of the two us 
plants that manufacture the fuel was destroyed in an explosion may 
4 
burnley said allocation of the scarce fuel is being worked out 
among nasa the defense department and his agency and that 
commercial launch companies are looking for supplies from 
manufacturers in europe and japan 
two of the 20 missions are suborbital flights for gravity 
research using light rockets seven flights are for the us 
government four are for international consortia three are for the 
british and one each is for indonesia japan india and a european 
consortium 
mcdonnell douglas is launching eight of the cargoes general 
dynamics six and martin marietta four a maryland company conatec 
is handling the light rocket launches

picketers who carry their protests into 
residential neighborhoods will have to cover more ground to assure 
compliance with laws condoned in a new supreme court ruling 
the court saying there simply is no right to force speech 
into the home of an unwilling listener ruled that communities 
may ban picketing aimed specifically at someones home 
but the justices unanimously rejected arguments in a case from 
wisconsin that public streets in residential neighborhoods are not 
the type of traditional public forum where freedom of expression is 
protected 
the ruling therefore did not free communities to ban pickets 
from marching through a residential neighborhood or even walking 
back and forth along a block on which the home they want to target 
is located 
sandra schultz head of an antiabortion group barred from 
picketing a doctors home in the milwaukee suburb of brookfield 
wis said the ruling makes a silly distinction between 
picketing in front of one home and marching past numerous homes 
im a little confused about how far we have to go down the 
street before its legal she said we will just change our 
tactics and go a little farther down the street it wont deter our 
movement 
harold furhman the lawyer who represented brookfield before the 
high court said im very delighted with the decision this is 
consistent with their past decisions and also with the position the 
town took in interpreting the ordinance 
steven shapiro of the american civil liberties union said the 
court went too far in seeking to protect the privacy of the home 
there were less intrusive ways to go about this he said 
the interest in privacy can be protected by regulating picketing 
without banning it the court rejected less drastic alternatives 
the decision also could hamper unions seeking to picket the 
homes of management officials during labor disputes the aflcio 
had urged the justices to invalidate the brookfield ordinance 
which outlaws picketing before or about the residence or dwelling 
of any individual 
justice sandra day oconnor writing for the court interpreted 
the ordinance narrowly stating that it is limited to picketing 
taking place solely in front of a particular residence 
the ordinance permits the more general dissemination of a 
message oconnor said general marching through residential 
neighborhoods or even walking a route in front of an entire block 
of houses is not prohibited by this ordinance 
the milwaukee coalition for life demonstrated in front of dr 
benjamin victorias home in brookfield on at least six occasions in 
1985 
victoria performs abortions as part of his medical practice in 
milwaukee and appleton wis 
the demonstrators in groups ranging in size from 11 to more 
than 40 people carried signs protesting abortion and shouted 
slogans such as dr victoria youre a killer 
in the month that the picketing occurred the brookfield town 
board enacted the disputed ordinance 
lower courts refused to let brookfield enforce the ordinance but 
those rulings were overturned monday 
in other decisions the court 
ruled 54 that defense contractors enjoy broad protection 
from lawsuits when defective equipment they sell to the military 
causes death or injury 
eased the potential consequences for law enforcement officials 
who conduct unlawful searches by ruling 43 in a boston case that 
evidence initially discovered during a warrantless search may be 
used at trial if the same evidence is rediscovered during a 
second lawful search 
said a los angelesbased antipoverty law firm is entitled to 
recover legal fees for successfully challenging the withholding of 
its clients federal housing subsidies but the court split 62 in 
saying the 322700 awarded by lower courts was excessive

new projections aimed at showing how much 
damage the drought has done to this years harvests will be issued 
in two weeks by the agriculture department 
the special forecast will be in usdas regular crop report on 
july 12 and will include new figures adjusted for damage done by 
this years heat and drought assistant secretary ewen m wilson 
who oversees the departments economic and statistical services 
said monday 
under normal conditions the july crop report would include 
updated production and yieldperacre estimates for winter wheat 
which is now being harvested across the nations midsection 
similar field estimates for corn spring wheat soybeans cotton 
and other fallharvested crops are not scheduled until august 
that has not changed the august crop report will still be the 
first bigscale estimate of us crops wilson said 
but the july 12 report will include freshly revised 
projections of corn and other fall crops based on the latest 
drought and acreage information he said the projections now being 
used began in may based on past trends and other assumptions that 
no longer apply 
wilson in an interview said that the 198889 projections based 
on the trend lines of past years would be wrong and that we would 
be way off the right numbers for this years harvests 
were going to move away from that trendyield estimate and 
make some adjustments based on what we know about crop 
conditions he said we wont be doing a field survey because 
its too early in the season but well do some analysis which will 
move us off that trendline yield in order to reflect the impact of 
the drought 
wilson said the special project to come up with better figures 
for harvest prospects and anticipated demand through the 198889 
marketing season was not unique and that usda had done it before 
isnt it risky for usda economists and statisticians to stick 
their necks out regarding drought losses even if the figures are 
acknowledged to be little better than educated guesses at this time 
i think were in a year where if they put out a trendline 
projection they would be sticking their necks out even more 
because clearly no one believes the trend yield is going to the 
the actual yield this year wilson said its reflecting 
reality 
earlier this month when the winter wheat harvest was updated 
the supplyanddemand analysis based on the trend lines described 
by wilson included projections showing that this falls corn 
harvest would be around 73 billion bushels an increase from 706 
billion bushels harvested in 1987 
soybean production using the trendline method was projected 
on june 9 at 188 billion bushels just slightly less than the 19 
billion bushels produced last year

the agriculture department says chinas grain 
production may increase by as much as 25 percent to around 500 
million metric tons by the year 2000 from an average of 394 million 
tons in the 1980s 
area sown to grain probably will decrease over the next 12 
years but improved yields could boost total output analysts 
said monday however per capita consumption probably will rise 
slowly as gains in output may be offset by increases in population 
and livestock feed use 
although small amounts of corn and other socalled coarse grains 
are likely to be exported by efficient producers in the northeast 
and rice producers in the south china is expected to remain a net 
grain importer 
coastal urban areas will import sizable quantities of wheat 
for human consumption and limited quantities of feed grains the 
departments economic research service said 
us agricultural exports to china in the fiscal year that began 
last oct 1 could exceed 400 million in value about double the 
211 million of 198687 the report said a number of subsized 
sales of us wheat have helped account for the increase

a study released today by two national farm 
organizations said government farm programs have provided only 
limited relief and its time to face reality about the american 
farmers capacity to overproduce 
excess capacity is back and it is back with a vengeance the 
report said predictions in the 70s that agriculture would never 
again be plagued with oversupplies were dead wrong 
the study by two former oklahoma state university professors of 
economics daryll e ray and james s plaxico was sponsored 
jointly by the national farmers organization and the national 
farmers union 
agricultural policies embodied in the 1985 farm law calling for 
reduced federal supports as a way to stimulate exports and the 
agricultural economy have generated expectations about how 
agricultural markets will react to oversupplies that cannot be 
fulfilled the report said while an agricultural world based on 
supply and demand has wide appeal it is a fantasy 
the erratic nature of agriculture depending on weather and 
markets requires a long view the report said 
neither aberrations of the 70s when exports soared or the 
rhetoric of the 80s has changed the fundamental characteristics of 
the grains markets that have long caused price and income problems 
for farmers it said if we want to continue to have a 
worldclass agriculture we must accept the fact that agriculture 
is inherently unstable from production period to production period 
and across decades

boys who spend part of their childhood in 
oneparent families tend to leave school earlier than those who 
live with both parents according to a new study 
there was much less impact on girls who may be motivated by the 
example of a working mother say researchers sheila fitzgerald 
krein and andrea h beller of the school of human resources and 
family studies at the university of illinoisurbana 
their study which also noted that the impact of oneparent 
living on children is greatest in the preschool years was 
published in demography the journal of the population association 
of america 
a working mother supporting herself and family seems to 
provide a good example for daughters beller said monday in a 
telephone interview 
for girls this model seems to balance out the loss of the time 
and involvement of one parent whereas the boy doesnt have this 
model he just has the loss of a parent 
about 60 percent of all children are now estimated to spend at 
least some of their childhood with only one parent around krein 
and beller reported 
this trend has aroused social concern in part because these 
families typically have fewer resources in particular time and 
moneythan twoparent families they pointed out 
educational advancement is one route out of poverty but the 
children in these families get significantly less of it the 
report says thus this lower level of education will have 
longterm consequences for the economic wellbeing of the future 
family of this young adult 
krein and beller said they studied effects on education because 
it has been shown to be a predictor of welfare recipiency and 
persistent poverty and lack of education is one determinent of 
chronic unemployment 
they used a pair of longterm surveys to study two generations 
of mothers and their offspring totaling 2500 boys and girls 
in general the longer time spent in a singleparent family 
the greater the reduction in educational attainment they found 
the largest impact was among white males they reported with 
each year spent in a oneparent family reducing eventual education 
by about onetenth of a year 
white men who spent an average number of years 51 in a 
singleparent family completed 05 fewer years of schooling than 
those who spent none white men who spent all 18 years in a 
singleparent family completed 17 fewer years of schooling they 
found 
the average number of years with just one parent around was 
found to be 80 years for black males and those in that situation 
finished 06 fewer years of school black males spending 18 years 
with just one parent finished 13 fewer years of school 
the impact was much less significant for women 
indeed for white women time spent in a singleparent family had 
no impact on eventual education there was only a slight impact for 
black women 
a followup study not yet published found that the effect of 
the missing parent is reduced although not eliminated when the 
father pays child support beller said 
in these cases though the father may not be present he still 
serves as a good example and that affects educational attainment 
in positive direction the study said 
the greatest impact on eventual education was among youngsters 
whose preschool years were spent in oneparent families the study 
said years spent in a singleparent family during the elementary 
school and highschool periods have no significant impact 
since the preschool years matter most affordable daycare 
with an educational component could replace some of the functions 
of the absent parent the study says 
living in a family with brothers and sisters thus reducing the 
time available for the parent to concentrate on any one child 
also reduced eventual educational attainment beller and krein 
found again the effect was most pronounced among boys 
factors the researchers found to boost educational attainment 
were higher family income amount of reading materials in the home 
and the mothers education the fathers education appeared to be a 
factor among whites but not blacks they added

congress should consider rewriting regulations 
to allow the environmental protection agency a greater role in 
safeguarding against oil spills says a congressional report 
the congressional research service based its conclusions on a 
study of the fuel spill that began on jan 2 at the ashland oil 
inc terminal near pittsburgh and affected drinking water supplies 
in ohio pennsylvania and west virginia 
crs said in a 21page analysis that ashland complied with 
federal standards in assuming responsibility for the cleanup of 
more than 700000 gallons of diesel fuel from the monongahela and 
ohio rivers 
the problem crs said appears to lie in looselywritten 
regulations that make it difficult for the epa to detect problems 
before they occur the research agency said it was only after the 
collapse of an ashland tank that epa found faults with the 
companys spill prevention plan 
the fuel tank collapse at ashlands floreffe terminal that 
caused the contamination stemmed from a dimesized flaw in the 
tanks nearly 50yearold steel wall 
ashland and other owners of aboveground oil tanks holding more 
than 660 gallons are required to file oil spill prevention plans 
which must be reviewed every three years ashlands plan was on 
file near pittsburgh as required 
but the government did not learn about alleged flaws in the plan 
until after the accident epa said in a memorandum on jan 15 that 
ashlands spill prevention control and countermeasures plan does 
not adequately address spill prevention and control specific to the 
facility 
instead the epa said it merely paraphrases the spcc 
regulations 
but mondays report requested by sen jay rockefeller dwva 
said the epa never saw the plan before the accident because 
regulations only require that the document be prepared not that it 
be inspected by epa 
under the regulations epa only gets involved after spills have 
occurred unless it has reason to suspect problems 
minor spills should not be the only reason for an spcc plan to 
come before federal and state officials crs said in the report 
more automatic review by epa and state officials might be 
desired and perhaps the regulations should state this 
the epa has been reviewing whether problems with ashlands spill 
prevention plan merit penalties 
ashland spokesman roger schrum said monday that company believes 
the plan met epa regulations 
we have not been fined and its been our contention that we 
had an adequate plan he said

an overwhelming majority of americans have a 
negative view of cubas marxist government but slightly more than 
half favor talks with cuba on improving relations according to a 
poll released today 
the survey showed that 81 percent of americans have an 
unfavorable attitude toward cuba compared with 52 percent in 1977 
only 1 percent see cuba in a very favorable light 
but 51 percent would support the united states entering into 
negotiations with cuba looking toward reestablishing normal 
diplomatic and economic relations thirtyone percent are opposed 
to that policy 
the survey was commissioned by potomac associates an 
independent policy research organization at johns hopkins school of 
advanced international studies in washington the polling was 
conducted by the gallup organization 
it was carried out in march and involved interviews with 1038 
adult americans the survey has a margin of error of 4 percentage 
points 
based on the survey if either of the major party candidates 
indicates a readiness to improve relations with cuba his standing 
with the voters would benefit slightly 
eighteen percent said they would be more likely to vote for a 
candidate with that policy while 14 percent said they would be 
less likely most said they would not be influenced either way by a 
candidates position on cuba 
the united states and cuba have not had full diplomatic 
relations since 1961 but agreed to establish small diplomatic 
missions in each others capital in 1977 a us trade embargo 
against cuba has been in effect since 1960 
us talks with cuba have been limited largely to immigration 
issues in recent years there have been no serious discussions on 
such subjects as the economic embargo cubas ties to the soviet 
union or its military presence in such areas as africa and central 
america 
a separate section of the survey examined attitudes of 
cubanamericans living in florida and new jersey ninetysix 
percent feel that president fidel castro is a bad thing for 
cuba but 41 percent said they would favor uscuban talks on 
normalizing relations fortyseven percent are opposed 
the margin of error among the cubanamericans was 8 percentage 
points to 9 percentage points 
william watts president of potomac associates said the 
willingness of many cubanamericans to support bilateral talks 
indicates that there is no basis for the widespread notion that the 
exile community is inflexibly opposed to negotiations with castro 
still the survey showed hostility toward the cuban government 
among exiles is strong 
eightysix percent believe the soviet union has very 
important influence over cuban government actions and 80 percent 
have a very unfavorable perception of the human rights 
situation in cuba only 6 percent would support an easing of the 
trade embargo against cuba 
the overwhelming majority also expressed support for radio 
marti the voice of america broadcast operation to cuba and tv 
marti the proposed us government television channel for cuba 
the survey also included a sampling of 94 american opinion 
leaders and policy makers of this group 90 percent favored the 
opening of negotiations with cuba but watts said the group 
interviewed was too small to be considered representative

links with the united states will become even 
more important for australia as its asian and pacific neighbors 
grow stronger and more prosperous says australias defense 
minister 
europe hasnt much part to play but the coming era of pacific 
growth assumes a very substantial american role which makes the 
alliance with the united states all the more important minister 
kim beazley said monday 
beazley covered some of the strategy issues to be aired at the 
annual ministerial meeting here tuesday and wednesday of anzus the 
military alliance created at the end of world war ii by australia 
new zealand and the united states new zealand was ousted two years 
ago over its ban on visits by nucleararmed or powered us 
warships 
beazley said the door should be kept open for new zealands 
return although he saw no immediate prospect for compromise in its 
dispute with the united states 
instead of being overshadowed by a single country the 
asiapacific area in the coming decades could become a region of 
many powers competing on an equal status some of them 
economic giants like we had in the europe of the 19th century 
beazley said he named japan china and india 
that vision of the future was not necessarily cause for any 
sense of alarm he said since the asiapacific countries not 
having land borders by and large are capable of civilized 
behavior with each other which was not possible for the european 
powers of the 19th century 
the soviet union had been increasing its military capability in 
the region but recently the united states has got its strategy 
together quite dramatically in maritime terms in the pacific 
and i think that has to a degree stabilized this issue he said 
while welcoming some of soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs 
policies the west should press moscow on such issues as the 
massive soviet presence at cam ranh bay vietnam the australian 
defense minister said 
ending the vietnamese occupation of cambodia is very much in the 
soviet unions own interest and should be pursued diplomatically

longforgotten courtroom testimony reveals 
that private defense consultants and contractors didnt need an 
underground operation to obtain classified information from 
pentagon employees they could get it simply by asking 
the opendoor system apparently operated alongside the 
clandestine arrangements between consultants and pentagon employees 
that are the subject of an intensive federal investigation 
investigators believe consultants using the secret system may 
have bribed defense department officials to obtain topsecret 
information including plans of one contractor that could be sold 
to another 
tucked away in a court reporters records in baltimore is a 1984 
description and a defense of the more open cooperation between 
some consultants contractors and pentagon officials 
the information obtained in the open was important to 
contractors seeking to bid on pentagon projects but private 
lawyers familiar with the system said the information usually was 
secret rather than top secret and only consisted of pentagon 
documents not those of contractors 
the upfront system came to light in january 1984 when lawyers 
for a private defense consultant summoned caroline a chewning to 
the witness stand in us district court in baltimore 
then and now involved with writing programs for the defense 
advanced research projects agency ms chewning testified that 
consultants and contractors with security clearances routinely 
asked for key documents at offices such as hers which writes 
wish lists for futuristic military technology 
bribes were not necessary she testified because the 
information was made available to them for free 
why because she testified contractors could not possibly 
submit a thorough bid for a major pentagon project within the 
required 45 days after an official notice was published 
so officials simply handed out the information to 
securitycleared consultants and contractors to give them a head 
start 
its in the governments best interest that contractors have 
this information if they had to go to official channels it may 
take them six months youre on a tight contract award basis 
and you dont have time for that she said in defense of the 
system 
the government and private industry must cooperate in order to 
get contracts awarded and material developed 
the defense department would not say monday whether the system 
has been changed but in a speech defense secretary frank c 
carlucci cautioned against any hasty reforms of the defense 
contracting system 
while carlucci said the government may terminate contracts found 
to be tainted he said the last thing we need now are hasty 
piecemeal changes that despite good intentions ultimately may make 
matters worse 
carlucci said no system can offer perfect protection against 
the human factor there is simply no way to devise a system that is 
greedproof 
the contracting system will undergo congressional scrutiny 
wednesday when the house armed services committee holds the first 
formal hearing on procurement practices since the fraud 
investigation became public june 124 
the first witness will be robert costello undersecretary of 
defense for acquisition policy 
also monday sources said 90 percent of the defense contractors 
checked in a pentagon study last year were sloppy in handling 
classified documents despite assurances given congress by former 
defense secretary caspar weinberger that the program had few 
problems 
the study was done by the defense investigative service but was 
withheld from congress by weinberger because he didnt like the 
conclusions according to the sources speaking on condition they 
not be named 
the open system of giving documents to consultants was 
apparently not widely discussed at the time mrs chewning 
testified the witness recalled that her mouth fell open when a 
contractor she had never met called to ask her for an 
interpretation of a document she had written 
in other developments the fbi said it investigated melvyn 
paisley prior to his 1981 confirmation by the senate as assistant 
navy secretary for research engineering and systems but it would 
not disclose the results of that check 
federal investigators found stacks of classified federal 
documents that paisley had no security clearance to possess when 
they searched his home and office the washington post reported in 
todays editions citing unidentified informed officials for the 
information 
and rep james florio dnj asked defense secretary frank 
carlucci to investigate whether favorable treatment for the sperry 
corp now part of unisys corp was arranged by paisley for work 
on the navys aegis shipdefense system the multibilliondollar 
system had been developed and had been almost exclusively outfitted 
by the rca corp at its facility in moorestown nj until work 
was redistributed in 1986 to include sperry 
ms chewning testified at the trial of william v miller a 
private defense consultant who was charged with two counts of 
conversion and unauthorized sale of government property 
miller was acquitted and his attorney selig solomon said in 
an interview that ms chewnings testimony likely won the case for 
the defense it showed that miller was accused of taking material 
that was given to consultants all the time he said 
ms chewning said 95 to 99 percent of the information that 
consultants and contractors sought from her section was willingly 
handed out 
she said the documents went through a classification process 
first in her agency and then at the pentagon where the documents 
were reviewed 
discussing the sensitivity of the documents she said you 
just cant hand it to someone who doesnt have a security 
clearance just because they want to bid on it 
i have not seen them handled in an unsecure manner within 
her office she said

a congressman is asking the pentagon to 
investigate whether a key figure in the defensepurchasing probe 
orchestrated a bewildering plan to share the work on a 
lucrative weapons system 
rep james florio dnj asked for an investigation of the 
role played by former assistant navy secretary melvyn paisley in a 
1986 decision to redistribute work on the navys 
multibilliondollar aegis shipdefense system 
florio in a letter to secretary frank carlucci said paisley 
a target of the ongoing defense procurement probe may have 
orchestrated the plan to redistribute work on the highly technical 
and massively expensive system 
it is distressing to see that a decision that should have been 
made in the best interests of national defense might have been made 
for totally different reasons having to do more with greed 
florio said in a statement 
he questioned a plan overseen by paisley to designate the sperry 
corp of great neck ny as a second source for aegis work 
the system one of the navys most advanced was developed and had 
been almost exclusively outfitted by the rca corp at its facility 
in moorestown nj 
before the proposal florio said rca had successfully built and 
delivered 15 aegis systems at below contracted prices aegis 
named for the shield of the greek god zeus combines radar 
computers and weapons in sophisticated umbrellalike protection 
for navy warships 
florio said he was puzzled by the plan to shift some aegis work 
to sperry given rcas good performance the rationale was at 
best bewildering florio said in a letter to carlucci 
many of us felt from the beginning that the decision to 
secondsource aegis was questionable recent developments make it 
appear even more so florio said 
florio said his concern was heightened by published reports 
linking paisley now a private defense consultant with the giant 
unisys corp formed by the 1986 merger of sperry and burroughs 
corp 
a report in defense news published monday quotes sources as 
linking paisley to unisys via his close associate william galvin 
a unisys adviser also said to be under investigation 
paisley left government in march 1987 to form a consulting 
business at a watergate complex office near galvins

boeing co had urged aloha airlines to make a 
complete structural inspection of four aging jets just a few 
months before the roof of one of the planes peeled off in flight 
federal investigators have been told 
boeing says that aloha after first agreeing to begin the 
inspections in early 1988 postponed them until the end of the year 
or possibly later 
only after a meeting in midapril between boeing and aloha 
officials did the airline agree to reinstate the steppedup 
maintenance program for its four oldest boeing 737s including the 
one that broke apart during flight on april 28 according to boeing 
the manufacturers assertions were outlined in documents made 
public monday by the national transportation safety board which is 
investigating the accident in which a flight attendant was swept to 
her death after a 20foot section of the planes roof tore away 
the plane then landed safely on the hawaiian island of maui 
aloha in separate documents filed with the ntsb denied that it 
had delayed the steppedup inspection and maintenance program 
boeings continued reference to delaying the repair and 
maintenance of the highcycle airplanes is simply incorrect the 
airline declared 
earlier aloha had asked the ntsb not to make the boeing 
documents public 
the claims and counterclaims are likely to be a major focus of 
formal ntsb hearings next month in seattle on the aloha accident 
the washington post had disclosed the existence of some of the 
boeing documents last sunday 
in a summary of its dealings with aloha since october boeing 
maintained that it repeatedly warned the airline in letters and 
informal discussions that its older aircraft especially the four 
aging boeing 737s had extensive corrosion that if not corrected 
could make them unsafe 
after inspecting two aloha planes a boeing consultant called 
them among the most corroded in the 737 fleet 
boeing said its manager of maintenance robert oldani told 
aloha officials that the four oldest 737s might become unsafe if 
the corrosion problem were not corrected as a result aloha 
promised to speed its maintenance program and begin a series of 
structural inspections of the four oldest aircraft boeing said 
but boeing said it learned on march 3 that aloha had changed its 
mind and would postpone the heavy maintenance checks from the 
spring to the last quarter of 1988 after a meeting between boeing 
and aloha representatives on april 14 the airline agreed to 
reinstate its earlier maintenance schedule boeing said 
maurice myers president of aloha has denied that boeing ever 
suggested that any of the aloha jets was unsafe he complained that 
boeing did not formally provide him with an evaluation of its 
findings from last falls inspections until april 
but boeing cited letters from its representatives on oct 15 and 
nov 13 of last year as well as handwritten notes available to 
aloha that summarized its critical survey results 
in the oct 15 letter to alohas vice president for quality 
assurance and maintenance everette webb a boeing consultant 
wrote that the importance of eliminating the corrosion from the 
older aloha jets cannot be overemphasized in light of the high 
number of takeoffs and landings and the tropical environment in 
which the airline operates 
at the time webb asked that the boeing team be allowed to 
examine two additional aging aloha aircraft including the one that 
five months later would break up during flight the planes were 
scheduled to undergo heavy maintenance in late october and early 
november according to webb 
the boeing team however never examined the plane involved in 
the april accident although the other plane cited in the oct 15 
letter was examined in late october according to boeing 
on nov 13 after the second aloha plane had been examined by the 
boeing team webb reminded myers the aloha president that aloha 
had three of the oldest boeing 737s still flying and added as 
the fleet leader the thoroughness and frequency of structural 
inspections as well as the effectiveness of preventative 
maintenance is important

the white house and the weather cooperated to 
entertain turkish president kenan evren in regal style at a starlit 
state dinner where president reagan lauded ties with the nato ally 
as a solid structure for building peace and prosperity 
evren the first turkish president to make a state visit to the 
united states in 21 years responded with a toast at mondays rose 
garden event that praised reagan for his efforts to lessen 
superpower tensions and slash the threatening arsenal of nuclear 
weapons 
we support the efforts of your administration to seek better 
relationships with the soviet union said the turkish president 
whose strategic nation borders on that country as well as iran and 
iraq 
in his brief toast reagan hailed recent improvements in the 
usturkish relationship he said the 40year history of bilateral 
ties was built upon a solid structure and predicted it would 
continue decades into the future 
our aspirations for our partnership remain large peace 
security and freedom for our peoples close cooperation in securing 
these objectives and success in defending them reagan said 
turkey is the third largest recipient of us aid after israel 
and egypt primarily due to its strategic location and usefulness 
as a listening post on the soviet union the middle east and the 
persian gulf 
although strains have appeared in the relationship in recent 
years over the level of us aid to the strategic nato ally no 
such problems were apparent at the elaborate state dinner 
usually the blacktie events that are part of a formal state 
visit occur inside the executive mansion but tempted by the balmy 
breezes that ended a heat spell and the clear moonlit skies the 
dinner featuring shrimp parfait filet of lamb and coconut ice 
cream was served in the torchlit rose garden later guests were 
entertained under the stars by classical guitarist christopher 
parkening 
earlier in the day the two men met for 45 minutes after a 
colorful fife and drum welcome was accorded the turkish leader 
a senior administration official said the two men engaged in a 
general review of the bilateral relations and touched on 
eastwest relations and the iraniraq war 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said reagan 
took the opportunity to assure president evren that we would 
continue to work with congress to give priority to our overall 
security assistance program with turkey 
the official said the turkish president made no specific 
economic requests and that his remarks carried the theme of 
trade not aid 
congress approved 520 million in aid for turkey last year 
almost all of it military assistance down from the 570 million 
which the administration sought and the 12 billion that turkey is 
seeking to help modernize its defense forces 
for fiscal 1989 starting next oct 1 the administration has 
asked congress to approve 620 million 
the president said americans have admired the way turkey 
pulled itself back to democracy when challenged by the violent 
forces of terrorism and anarchy a year ago 
evren a retired army general led a 1980 coup in turkey that 
helped restore public order after years of mounting violence by the 
extreme right and left democratic civilian rule was restored in 
1983 and voters overwhelmingly approved a new constitution making 
evren president for a 7year term 
reagan also praised growing usturkish trade calling it the 
surest way that turkey can find to ensure the prosperity its people 
seek 
and in a symbolic move reagan presented evren with the legion 
of merit in gratitude for the contribution of the turkish military 
during the korean war the medal represents one of the highest 
military honors america can bestow

the former personnel director of the white 
house says he recalls nothing unusual turning up in an fbi 
background check of melvyn paisley a key figure in the pentagon 
bribery probe 
mildred mcgetrick one of paisleys three exwives said she 
told the fbi in mid1981 that paisley then a boeing corp 
executives was dishonest with money and also told federal 
agents that paisley took gratuities including cash and gifts 
at the time paisley was under consideration by the white house 
for the post of assistant secretary of the navy for research 
engineering and systems 
ms mcgetrick who was on a backpacking trip monday and 
unavailable for comment was interviewed by the los angeles times 
which published the story in its sunday editions 
in response the fbi issued a statement saying the results of 
its background investigation of paisley were furnished to the white 
house on sept 29 1981 paisley was nominated by president reagan 
less than a month later on oct 27 and confirmed by the senate nov 
23 of that year 
fbi spokeswoman sue schnitzer said that in conducting background 
checks the bureau talks to as many people as we can to learn as 
fully about the person as we can if we know some enemies we talk 
to them too 
she said the information derogatory or favorable is 
forwarded to the requesting agency without comment or 
recommendation 
schnitzer refused to discuss the paisley case noting that 
federal law prohibits the agency from disclosing details of its 
background investigations 
former white house personnel director e pendleton james who 
approved paisley for nomination said the paisley nomination came 
in the crush of appointees during the first year of the reagan 
administration 
he said he had no recollection of allegations of financial 
dishonesty being made against paisley 
james said that fbi files were very closely held by the 
office of white house counsel and that if derogatory information 
that was found to be credible was raised in the background check 
then we would have a meeting on it i would be briefed 
if there was such a meeting on paisley then the derogatory 
information was not heavy enough because he was appointed said 
james 
james also said that thendefense secretary caspar weinbergers 
office generally did a pretty good job of wading in and 
saying we want x for this job 
weinberger has said he had only a very indirect recollection 
of paisley pointing out that paisley was a close friend of navy 
secretary john lehman who had been a consultant at boeing where 
paisley worked

charles jude the other self who dances calmly reaching to him 
trying to lead him to peace 
nureyev his birthday was three months ago looked in splendid 
shape and his dancing was effective 
he acted through his dancing as he always has done and the

famous as two other great dancers of this century vaslav nijinsky 
and anna pavlova 
in the opening dance harald landers etudes which moves 
from ballet practice to all classical ballet technique the company 
looked beautifully schooled male stars laurent hilare and manuel

hour to music which sounded like a concretecrushing machine 
sylvie guillem managed to look sexy during her solo at the end 
there were many boos covered by more cheers when the very fine 
dancers bowed 
legris scheduled for etudes and in the middle somewhat 
elevated also danced with florence clerc and monique loudieres

sen sam nunn of georgia who has been saying 
he doesnt want to be on the democratic ticket hardened that 
stance by declining to provide financial and other background 
information michael dukakis campaign is seeking from prospective 
running mates 
nunn said monday in a telephone interview he has told dukakis 
hes not interested in the vice presidency so it would be 
inconsistent for him to make such background information available 
he knows my position on the vice presidency nunn said 
ive told him ive told dukakis aide paul brountas and others 
that that was not on my agenda 
brountas has been heading up the running mate search for dukakis 
sources have identified nunn as one of several prospective 
running mates who have been asked to provide background information 
to the dukakis campaign 
nunn refused to confirm that he has been asked for such 
information citing confidentiality in his talks with the 
nomineeapparent but he said he has no plans to provide it 
im not furnishing any he said i have not furnished 
any 
he said however that he has a meeting set with dukakis who is 
coming to washington on wednesday to meet with democratic senators 
including some potential running mates 
i plan to have a discussion with the governor on national 
security or whatever else he wants to talk about but i have no 
plans to get into the financial information business or the medical 
records or any of that stuff nunn said 
the georgia senator is chairman of the senate armed services 
committee 
dukakis said last week that if any of the prospective vice 
presidential running mates ruled themselves out clearly and 
unequivocally to me then obviously im not going to press the 
point

the administration of gov michael dukakis in a 
change of position is asking the state attorney generals office 
whether it may keep secret the appraised price of land for a state 
prison 
the selection of a prison site in the town of new braintree is 
under investigation by the fbi and jail opponents and others have 
sought to make the controversy an issue in dukakis presidential 
campaign 
the state division of capital planning and operations said 
monday it is awaiting an opinion from attorney general james 
shannon on whether it can keep two appraisals of the prison site 
confidential and divulge publicly only its offering price 
the value of the property is a key issue to those accusing 
dukakis of favoring the two owners of the proposed prison site 
meanwhile the coowners of the property in question have hired 
a prominent political consultant who has worked for dukakis the 
likely democratic nominee 
and in another development a democratcontrolled legislative 
committee refused monday to investigate on its own of the site 
selection 
last thursday the capital planning divisions top official 
john carlson said of the appraisals as soon as we can share 
them with the owners which is the way the law reads we will of 
course share them with the public 
now the administration is seeking shannons opinion on reversing 
that stance 
kathy robertson a spokeswoman for the division said releasing 
the appraised value of the property could harm the state if the 
land deal winds up in court a court case could result if the state 
has to purchase the property using the eminent domain process 
were trying to make public everything we can and were going 
beyond what we would normally do in making everything public 
robertson said 
new braintree selectman dorothea thomasvitrac attacked the 
administration for its change of position 
they have in fact by backpedaling created a new 
controversy she said 
the roughly 800 residents of new braintree have been opposed to 
the prison since the proposal first surfaced three years ago 
questions surrounding the prison intensified when the owners of the 
780acre site offered to sell it to the state in 1986 for 95 
million a 65 million profit over what they paid a year earlier 
a norwood development firm headed by daniel striar and gary 
jacobson owns the land jacobson grew up in the same neighborhood 
as dukakis and has been a contributor to dukakis political 
campaigns 
the state legislatures human services committee in a close 
vote rejected a bipartisan proposal to probe the prison issue and 
passed the entire matter to the senate ways and means committee for 
a decision 
i see no evidence that theres any collusion any conflict of 
interest said state rep paul kollios cochairman of the 
committee 
striar and jacobson have hired political consultant michael 
goldman to help them respond to the barrage of national publicity 
surrounding the land deal goldman worked in the dukakis 
administration during the governors first term and has since 
represented numerous prominent massachusetts democrats in political 
campaigns including opponents of dukakis 
the people who are going to want to see conspiracy are going 
to see conspiracy everywhere goldman said 
he said striar and jacobson were referred to him by a top aide 
to state auditor joseph denucci a close ally of dukakis denucci 
is the former cochairman of the legislatures human services 
committee which deals with prison issues 
thomasvitrac said the hiring of a political consultant 
indicates to me that they on their own would have problems 
justifying their position and they would have to have people come 
in and put a spin on things

transportation secretary jim burnley is 
holding out the threat of a presidential veto if congress tries to 
tamper with the 1980 law that deregulated the railroad industry 
but sen jay rockefeller dwva continued to push a bill 
doing just that in anticipation of a meeting today by the senate 
commerce committee to act on the measure 
congressional and administration aides said rockefeller was 
negotiating with several railroads monday to try to win their 
support 
the legislation would amend the staggers rail act of 1980 to aid 
shippers of coal grain and other commodities who contend they are 
being gouged by railroad monopolies 
burnleys message was in the form of a letter written to key 
members of the senate panel on monday 
he said in the letter that rockefellers measure would erode 
the substantial gains achieved under the staggers act the 
presidents senior advisers would recommend a veto of the 
legislation or a bill resembling this bill if it were presented to 
the president for his signature 
many railroads have opposed altering the staggers act which 
they say gave them needed pricing and service flexibility to better 
compete with trucks congress enacted the 1980 law to give conrail 
and other railroads incentives to rebuild failing and antiquated 
systems 
but a coalition of shippers has said the interstate commerce 
commission in its interpretation of staggers has failed to 
protect shippers especially those dependent on a single railroad 
to transport their wares 
a key provision of the bill would force the icc to periodically 
adjust its cost index to reflect productivity gains by railroads 
the icc uses the index to determine how much freight railroads can 
increase their rates each quarter to keep up with inflation 
shippers contend the formula does not account for gains railroads 
have made to make them more efficient 
burnley sent his letter to senate commerce committee chairman 
ernest hollings dsc and to sen john danforth rmo the 
panels ranking republican

defense secretary frank c carlucci is urging 
against too hasty reform of military procurement saying there is 
no way to devise a system that is greedproof 
the last thing we need now are hasty piecemeal changes that 
despite good intentions ultimately may make matters worse 
carlucci said in a speech monday at the national press club 
i urge those who are ready now to condemn and abandon our 
entire procurement system to withhold judgment until the facts are 
in and to keep in mind that no system can offer perfect protection 
against the human factor he said there is simply no way to 
devise a system that is greedproof 
carlucci also said that former defense secretary donald rumsfeld 
and deputy defense secretary david packard will help him determine 
whether additional changes in the procurement system are in 
order after the facts are in 
as many as 100 military contracts may be been tainted because 
pentagon officials and private consultants allegedly provided 
classified information to defense contractors to help them bid for 
lucrative contracts according the us attorney coordinating the 
case henry hudson 
carlucci did urge changes in the way congress allocates money 
for weapons procurement 
in testimony on capitol hill carlucci said he had advocated 
further reforms i have said i would sign up for large savings in 
the billions of dollars if we could put the budgeting and

attorney anthony smith was delivering 
closing arguments in court when a strong earthquake shook a 
160mile stretch of coastal northern california swaying 
skyscapers shattering glass and dumping store shelves 
as you can see my argument is reaching the powers that be 
smith deadpanned monday according to his associate reid dworkin 
who said spectators ran out of the courtroom and the judge briefly 
recessed the trial 
the temblor the second to rock the state in two days 
registered about 57 on the richter scale according to university 
of california seismologists 
no injuries or serious damage was reported 
pat jorgenson a spokeswoman with the us geological survey in 
menlo park said the epicenter of the 1143 am quake was 16 miles 
south of san jose near loma prieta mountain on the san andreas 
fault 
the quake was one of the strongest in the san francisco bay area 
on the san andreas fault since the great earthquake of 1906 
said robert uhrhammer at the university of california seismographic 
stations at berkeley that quake which started fires that 
destroyed much of the city had an estimated magnitude of 83 on 
the richter scale which had not yet been devised 
the 650milelong san andreas fault annually produces dozens of 
quakes 
a quake measuring 5 can cause considerable damage while a 
magnitude 6 quake can cause severe damage 
most people in quakeprone northern california took the shaking 
in stride but others found it unnerving 
on the 17th floor of the federal building oakland hells angels 
member james fuzzy neal said there was a little bit of 
panic in a courtroom where a drug trial was under way 
its bad enough being in a twostory house when one goes off 
i knew i couldnt run down the steps and get out neal said 
but ginger johnson a receptionist for montgomery securities on 
the 21st floor of the landmark transamerica building said workers 
were so unconcerned that our traders immediately started betting 
on how big it was the 48floor pyramidshaped tower was built to 
withstand far more powerful temblors 
in sunnyvale 40 miles to the south chunks of cement fell from 
the ceiling of a parking garage 
at the holy city art glass shop near the epicenter and just 100 
yards from the san andreas fault sheets of glass flew off racks 
and stained glass windows leaning against a wall toppled and broke 
causing about 400 in damage said artist tom stanton 
groceries at a 7eleven at scotts valley fell off shelves and 
customers were thrown up against the outside wall said clerk 
judy young damage also was reported at a nearby supermarket 
on sunday an earthquake measuring 45 to 47 on the richter 
scale shook a wide area of southern california including downtown 
los angeles but no serious damage was reported at least four 
people were treated for minor injuries 
mondays quake was felt as far north as santa rosa about 60 
miles north of san francisco and to the south about 100 miles away 
on the monterey peninsula although berkeley scientists upgraded 
their magnitude from an earlier reading of about 50 other 
agencies stuck to a lower estimate 
the us geological surveys national earthquake information 
center in golden colo estimated the magnitude at 50 as did the 
surveys menlo park office 
estimates differ because the earthquake information center based 
its estimate on body waves generated by the quake while the 
seismographic stations figure is based on measurement of surface 
waves jacobs said 
the richter scale gauges the energy released by an earthquake 
as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph each 
increase of one number means the ground motion was 10 times greater

members of the womans national democratic 
club will vote wednesday on allowing its 85 male members to vote or 
hold office and the clubs president says the governing board has 
recommended approval 
the 66yearold club was the target monday of a discrimination 
complaint filed by george washington university law professor john 
f banzhaf iii 
his complaint was filed with the district of columbias office 
of human rights to encourage the vote to give the clubs male 
members the same status in the organization as its 1815 women 
members banzhaf said 
jean jenson the clubs president said she was surprised to 
learn about banzhafs complaint because we have had absolutely no 
contact with him at all 
if banzhaf had contacted the group he would have learned the 
clubs governing board has already recommended approval of the 
proposed change in the bylaws jenson said 
we were kind of amazed he didnt do his homework on this 
she said 
the complaint follows separate decisions this month by the 
capitals last allmale clubs the cosmos club and the 
metropolitan club to admit women 
banzhaf had also filed a complaint against the cosmos club and 
said he will ask city authorities to make sure the groups decision 
to admit women goes beyond mere tokenism 
jenson said men have been club members since the 1930s men 
have never indicated an interest in holding office here because 
this is a volunteer organization she said 
under dc law a discrimination complaint is investigated by 
the office of human rights to determine if there is probable cause 
to submit it to the dc human rights commission the law calls for 
attempts at conciliation between the parties before a complaint is 
sent to the commission 
as a party to the cosmos club complaint banzhaf said he will 
push for either an affirmative action program for admitting women 
or the longterm monitoring of the clubs membership policies

a national institutes of health employee was 
infected with the deadly aids virus at work despite taking 
recommended precautions according to a published report today 
the washington post reported that the nih employee became 
infected despite wearing gloves and following recommended 
procedures 
nih officials said the employee was infected when a vial filled 
with aidsinfected blood broke in the workers hand 
officials said the accident occurred a few weeks ago and one 
nih scientist said the accident involved a safety device that is 
supposed to reduce the risk of just the kind of accident that 
occurred 
its there so this type of thing wont happen the scientist 
told the post 
there have been two similar incidents involving workers at 
laboratories associated with nih but officials said this is the 
first accident involving an nih employee 
officials said the employee who still works at nih was 
diagnosed as being infected with the virus by the clinical center 
at nih on monday afternoon and is receiving medical treatment the 
newspaper said officials declined to discuss specifics of the 
accident and requested the employees gender and job title be 
withheld 
other nih employees were informed about the accident monday 
recent figures from the federal centers for disease control 
indicate the rate of accidental infection with the aids virus among 
health care workers is only a fraction of 1 percent with only 15 
documented cases following accidents involving contamination from 
needles or broken glass 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome attacks the bodys 
immune system no one is known to have recovered from the illness

the nations roman catholic bishops 
decided to revamp their stand on fighting aids to quell a division 
within the church but stopped short of condemning a paper that 
tolerates teaching about condoms 
the national conference of catholic bishops concluded monday by 
unanimously approving a decision to appoint a committee to draft a 
new aids paper the updated document would be drawn in closer 
consultation with the vatican and acceptable to the entire 
conference church leaders said after a closed session at st 
johns university 
the division among ourselves the teachers is reflected among 
the people said a statement released by cardinal joseph 
bernardin of chicago who made the motion for the new paper we 
cannot allow it to continue festering our unity must be restored 
so we can get on with our business 
the many faces of aids a gospel approach was approved by 
the conferences administrative board and released last december 
but stirred controversy with the portion about condoms 
while stressing abstinence from sex outside marriage and 
fidelity within marriage the statement noted that many in society 
reject church teachings on sexuality and said education programs 
could include accurate information about prophylactic devices 
as a means of preventing transmission of the deadly disease 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome is spread mainly by the 
exchange of blood or semen during sexual contact or by intravenous 
drug use 
a vatican official charged the authors with causing confusion in 
the church which objects to birth control 
cardinal joseph ratzinger head of the vatican congregation for 
the doctrine of the faith also chastised the administrative board 
that approved the paper for not consulting with the vatican 
bernardin told the news conference that when the administrative 
board approved the many faces paper we sincerely felt it was 
based on sound theology 
now some questions have risen whether the document does have 
some ambiguities those points have to be discussed he said 
bernardin said the new policy paper can put to rest any doubts 
which might exist regarding the churchs teaching on sexuality and 
how that teaching applies to the current crisis 
but conference leaders did not retract the paper as some critics 
urged rather they said it should be a foundation for the 
stilltobe appointed authors of the new paper 
were not replacing it the first document stands said 
archbishop john may of st louis this new document will be a 
document of the whole conference all the bishops together 
an outright scrapping of the paper bernardin said also would 
have sowed dissension among bishops 
withdrawal could give the impression that the entire document 
is flawed and that the entire administrative board was in serious 
error he said such action could reopen the debate with 
greater intensity 
may apologized for the administrative boards mistake in 
releasing the aids document before the full conference of roughly 
300 bishops could review it 
on the other hand he said many bishops were clamoring for 
something to use in their general communities 
may said he hoped a new policy could be drafted for 
consideration at the next conference to be held in november in 
washington dc he said some of the authors of the first paper 
might be appointed to work on the second 
in previous business at the fourday conference the bishops 
approved a a report about the morality of us nuclear policy 
opposing arms buildups but stopping short of taking a strong stand 
on disarmament the bishops also said they didnt think it was 
morally wrong to pursue research on the star wars defense 
initiative but said they couldnt endorse deploying such a system 
the bishops also approved a campaign to raise 20 million to 
help orders support their retired members

seemingly safe ceramic ware commonly used at 
dinner tables particularly plates and pots from abroad may 
threaten owners with deadly lead poisoning and authorities can do 
little to check the hazard federal officials told congress 
frank e young head of the food and drug administration told a 
congressional hearing on monday that despite steppedup efforts 
the agency can never check each shipment of ceramics and is not 
authorized to inspect foreign products 
the thousands of trucks and automobiles crossing the border 
simply cannot be effectively inspected or their cargos tested for 
lead said young 
rep ron wyden dore who chaired the hearing of the oversight 
and investigations panel of the house energy and commerce 
committee said there are serious deficiencies in the fdas 
efforts to control ceramic ware 
however wyden said a major part of the hearing was educational 
without adequate education about this problem many individuals 
will continue to purchase dangerous items for food service he

a commuter train whose brakes apparently failed 
slammed into another train at an underground platform of a busy 
paris station killing at least 37 people and injuring 32 
officials said 
it was the worst train accident ever in the capital authorities 
said the death toll was expected to mount to 40 once all the 
bodies were removed from the twisted wreckage 
officials said the eightcar commuter train coming from the 
southeastern suburb of melun rammed into the front of a fourcar 
train that was preparing to leave an underground terminus at the 
gare de lyon station in eastern paris 
philippe rouvillois president of the railroad authority known 
as the sncf said the moving train had a braking problem and 
its driver alerted passengers to move to the rear 
when the driver noticed a problem with the brakes he asked 
travelers in the train to move toward the back rouvillois said 
he said the train went about 500600 yards past a red light as 
it was approaching the gare de lyon one of the busiest train 
stations in paris the gare de lyon is a stop for the citys 
subways and handles commuter traffic as well as intercity trains 
an unknown number of bodies remained inside the wreckage fire 
officials said they thought all survivers had been removed it was 
not immediately known if any americans were among the victims 
at least 15 people were seriously injured officials said 
passengers in shock wandered through the station or sat on the 
platform beside the twisted wreckage 
about 250 rescue workers struggled through the night sawing 
through the tangle of metal looking for more survivors forty fire 
engines 15 ambulances and a helicopter were at the station 
police said it would be several hours before the last bodies 
were freed they said both trains were crowded with commuters when 
the accident occurred at 710 pm 110 pm edt but the total 
number of passengers was not known 
rescuers pulled the first body from one of the cars about two 
hours after the accident witnesses said the impact of the speeding 
train hitting the one parked on the tracks forced the cars of the 
first train into and on top of one another 
the french news agency agence francepresse quoted railway 
authority officials as saying the inbound train was moving at 45 to 
50 mph when it entered the station 
in addition train authority officials said the train leaving 
paris was several minutes behind schedule 
the state prosecutor for paris michel raynaud opened an 
investigation into the cause of the accident 
police cordoned off the area but from an adjacent platform it 
was possible to see the twisted wreckage and the emergency medical 
center set up to treat the injured 
authorities said the cause of the accident had not been 
determined officials of the stateowned railroad societe nationale 
chemin de fer said the moving train might have entered the 
underground track too fast and been unable to stop 
patrick michelin director of the gare de lyon said the 
arriving eightcar train may have had brake trouble 
it looks like we have a problem with brakes and we have to 
find out the origin of it he said 
transport minister louis mermaz mayor jacques chirac of paris 
and police chief jean paolini went to the station to oversee the 
rescue and preliminary investigation 
on the platform beside the tangled steel medical workers cared 
for a dozen injured passengers some lay on stretchers bleeding 
badly a sheet covered a childs body 
the conducter of the stationary train who was not injured 
said all at once i saw the train coming toward me at high speed 
and i had just enough time to jump onto the platform 
a person who saw the accident from the platform said the 
shock was extremely violent and the noise was enormous and 
resounding i was on the platform when i saw the train arrive 
running at what seemed to be an extremely high speed 
i told myself it isnt possible it will stop but it 
smashed into the other that was parked two cars were completely 
flattened on the platform people began to panic and then run in 
all directions 
raoul viger commanding the fire brigades said the rescue task 
was difficult because to get to the living trapped in the cars 
we have to crawl over dead bodies 
as news of the accident spread hundreds of people arrived at 
the station looking for family members and friends police said

the dollar dropped below the 131yen level in 
foreign exchange trading in tokyo on tuesday while stock prices 
fell marginally 
the dollar opened at 13048 yen down from mondays close of 
13170 it mainly fluctuated between a low of 13038 and a high of 
13125 before finishing the day at 13095 
on the tokyo stock exchange the nikkei stock average of 225 
selected issues a 12120point loser monday shed another 3692 
points or 013 percent to close at 2739809 points 
shunsuke kato a dealer at the bank of tokyo said local 
investors sold the dollar in early morning trading following an 
overnight decline in new york which he said was triggered by 
intervention on the part of the us federal reserve board 
the move gave us the impression that there would be a limit on 
the dollars rise kato said 
one analyst at a major local securities firm speaking on 
condition of anonymity said tuesdays early drop in the dollar was 
only a slight correction he said the currencys rise above the 
13100yen level in the past week was too fast adding that 
dealers are more likely to buy the currency in the mid130 yen 
point 
the analyst predicted the dollar would continue to gain ground 
against the yen this week and said dealers will probably test 
even the 13500yen level because the bank of japan has said it 
will not intervene 
however finance minister kiichi miyazawa on tuesday told a 
regular news conference that the recent dollar rise was ordinary 
fluctuation and said the central bank will step into the market if 
necessary 
the monday dollar closing capped a sixday winning streak during 
which the currency rose by a total of 482 yen it was the highest 
finish for the dollar since dec 10 when it closed at 13218 yen

the united states has formally protested 
qatars refusal to hand over usmade stinger missiles the arab 
nation bought on the black market 
a state department official said monday that assistant secretary 
richard w murphy raised the issue with the defense minister of 
qatar last weekend at a meeting in the persian gulf sheikdoms 
capital of doha 
murphy the assistant secretary of state for near eastern and 
south asian affairs demanded the stingers be returned to the 
united states said the official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
they have them they got them from some place and we want them 
back the official said 
murphy also reiterated the united states demand for access to 
the missiles to determine through their serial numbers who had sold 
them to qatar the department official said 
the united states prohibits other governments in its stinger 
contracts from transferring the weapons to a third party 
the new york times reported today that the defense minister 
crown prince hamad bin khalifa althani rejected murphys demands 
on the grounds that qatar needed the missiles to defend itself 
against threats to its security 
the united states learned qatar had stinger missiles in march 
when us embassy officials in bahrain noticed one in a military 
parade in qatar when confronted officials in doha admitted they 
had secretly bought 12 missiles but refused to identify the 
source according to the times 
in may murphy said the highly accurate shoulderfired rockets 
may have been passed to qatar by iran which in turn obtained them 
from the ussupplied afghan rebels 
last week the senate appropriations committee approved language 
to prohibit any military dealings with qatar until the stingers 
were returned state department officials told the times the united 
states has no plans to recall its ambassador over the disagreement 
qatar does not buy any weapons nor does it receive any military 
or economic aid from washington but it has traditionally sought 
good relations with the united states

members of mikhail s gorbachevs ruling politburo 
engage in arguments during their closeddoor meetings that 
sometimes render the body deadlocked the editorinchief of the 
party daily pravda says 
the editor viktor g afanasyev was one of two communist party 
insiders to shine the light of glasnost on the politburo offering 
a rare glimpse of the privileges and rigors that come with 
membership in the inner circle 
also discussing the partys pinnacle with foreign reporters 
monday was igor shvets an official on its policymaking central 
committee 
he acknowledged that politburo members earn more than four times 
the average factory workers pay saying they dont stand in line 
for potatoes because they are always on duty 
despite gorbachevs policy of glasnost which has opened 
many facets of soviet society to scrutiny little is known about 
how the countrys supreme political institution functions 
the politburo customarily issues a laconic statement following 
its regular thursday meetings but it never provides a detailed 
account 
afanasyev said he has attended politburo meetings under both 
gorbachev and the late president leonid i brezhnev he said 
gorbachevs politburo bears little relationship to brezhnevs 
whose members would talk for an hour and theyd rubber stamp the 
decision and that was that 
the editor disclosed that after the chernobyl nuclear power 
plant explosion in april 1986 the politburo met in emergency 
session for 1 days to discuss the crisis 
there arent any basic controversies or contradictions up 
there afanasyev said of the politburo the need for 
perestroika is not being questioned but there is argument 
there is discussion there is sometimes heated discussion theres 
been a lot of protracted argument sometimes 
shvets suggested crisis management is not unusual for the 
kremlins top leadership there is no day or night for them he 
said they are always on duty 
dissenting views among members of the politburo and of the 
partys secondmost powerful institution the secretariat have 
sometimes left the groups deadlocked afanasyev said 
sometimes a session of the politburo or secretariat cannot 
resolve the issue in its entirety because there are different 
opinions he said then the question is looked into in greater 
depth and only after its analyzed in all its aspects is the final 
decision taken 
alluding to reports that politburo members enjoy access to 
special stores that carry commodities not generally available in 
this country and that they have hardtofind foodstuffs delivered 
to their homes shvets added it wouldnt make sense to have them 
stand in line for potatoes 
however he insisted they have no special privileges the 
only privileges they have are related to their protection he 
said citing secluded country retreats known as dachas as an 
example 
shvets said the perquisites of politburo members did not change 
when gorbachevs came to power in march 1985 
he also said they earn about the same as a government minister 
1350 to 1700 a month a typical soviet factory worker makes 
about 340 a month 
afanasyev said there is a formal 10 to 15minute limit on how 
long each politburo member can have the floor but that members 
often get around the rule by seeking the floor several times 
he denied the politburo is split into camps with some members 
following gorbachev and others siding with yegor k ligachev the 
kremlins no 2 who is seen as a conservative force in the ruling 
body 
he did say however that members display different outlooks 
depending on whether they are career communist party officials like 
gorbachev or technocrats people who rose from the ranks of 
administration or plant management 
some people he said reached the politburo or the secretariat 
which runs the party and nation from day to day from what you 
might call the technocracy others have been party functionaries 
all their lives and of course the way various questions are 
discussed the inflections if you will will be different 
this is the only area where i see a divergence of opinion but 
not on political issues 
afanasyev did not say which party leaders he was referring to 
when he mentioned technocrats but under gorbachev many men with a 
strong background in economic management including premier nikolai 
i ryzhkov a former factory director have assumed top 
responsibilities in the party and government

the us military attache to greece was 
killed tuesday by a car bomb that blew his armorplated automobile 
off the small side street where he lives officials said 
a police spokesman who requested anonymity identified the 
victim as navy capt william nordine neighbors said he apparently 
was driving to work 
a pentagon spokesman in washington maj alan frietag did not 
release an identity but said the senior military officer assigned 
to the us embassy in athens a navy captain was killed in a bomb 
blast near his home 
the explosion occurred at 806 am 106 am edt in the 
kefalari district of the northern athens suburb of kifissia where 
many american and foreign diplomats live 
there was no immediate claim of responsibility 
the bomb had been placed in the trunk of a parked car and the 
force of the explosion decapitated nordine and sent him through a 
side window of his car police said 
they said the explosion lodged the officers car in a steel 
fence across the street 
us embassy officials on the scene refused to comment but 
people living in the neighborhood said nordine was apparently 
driving to work 
he lived up the street with his wife and children he drove to

middlemen who profit from surrogate births 
risk up to five years in prison and 50000 in fines under a law 
that makes michigan the first state to attach criminal sanctions to 
pregnancyforpay deals 
gov james blanchard on monday signed into law a bill that makes 
arranging such deals a felony beginning sept 1 advertising or 
otherwise inducing a woman to become a surrogate also will be a 
felony 
its a major victory jeremy rifkin cochair of the 
national coalition against surrogacy said in washington 
michigan will be leading the way with this legislation said 
state sen connie binsfeld leader of a fiveyear drive to outlaw 
surrogacy 
i believe the legislature and the governor have carried out a 
very strong moral obligation to protect children from becoming 
commodities under commercial contracts said the republican 
senator 
the executive director of the american civil liberties unions 
michigan chapter said he was contemplating a legal challenge 
against the law 
its hard to understand how a governor whos prochoice would 
criminalize the process when a surrogate mother and a couple wish 
to bring life into this world said howard simon 
in announcing his decision the democratic governor said he 
signed the law despite reservations because he believed it was 
better than none at all 
by taking the profit out of childbirth it stands firm against 
the buying and selling of human life he said 
also under the law those who contract for a birth and women who 
agree to bear a child for money will risk misdemeanor penalties of 
up to 90 days in jail and a 10000 fine 
typically infertile couples pay 10000 to be matched with a 
wouldbe mother they pay another 10000 to the woman who agrees 
to be artifically inseminated carry the child then give up 
custody they also pay for the hospital bills and pregnancyrelated 
expenses 
the law would still allow a woman who wants to bear a child and 
then give up the baby to another couple to do so while having 
pregnancyrelated bills paid but the mother could get no fee and 
any middleman would have to work for free 
the law doesnt address the legality for a michigan couple to 
sign a contract in another state and carry out the agreement in 
michigan said noel keane a dearborn attorney who has arranged 
228 surrogate births including new jerseys baby m 
maybe the arrangement of a contract could be anywhere outside 
michigan and the insemination the birth the payment everything 
else take place inside michigan said keane 
keane said a constitutional challenge probably would be based on 
a 1972 us supreme court decision establishing as part of the 
right to privacy the right to beget children without unwarranted 
governmental intrusion 
the mother of baby m mary beth whiteheadgould sued keane 
when she decided to keep her child she won an outofcourt 
settlement for an amount reported at between 30000 and 40000 
but in a landmark custody battle over the girl she bore under a 
10000 contract mrs whiteheadgould won only visitation rights 
on feb 3 the new jersey supreme court granted custody of the 
2yearold girl now legally known as melissa to the childs 
father william stern 
the court in overturning part of a lower court ruling also 
outlawed surrogacy for pay and restored mrs whiteheadgoulds 
parental rights to the child 
michigan is the first state to attach criminal penalties to 
surrogateparent contracts but not the first to address the issue 
kentucky and louisiana have enacted laws declaring such 
contracts illegal but dont impose criminal penalties nebraska 
doesnt recognize the legal validity of surrogateparenting 
contracts indiana has put enforcement of such arrangements on hold 
while the issue is researched and proposed regulations were vetoed 
in arkansas 
harold cassidy mrs whiteheadgoulds attorney said states 
generally have not have not enforced those statutes out of 
apparent confusion as to whether such enforcement would represent 
the will of the people he said 
he said many states will follow michigans lead and 
prosecutors will no longer have a choice in bringing charges 
against surrogacy brokers

the dollar today dropped from a sixmonth record 
high posted the previous day while stock prices on the tokyo 
exchange closed slightly lower after rebounding from heavy 
earlymorning losses 
the dollar opened the days trading at 13048 yen down a strong 
122 yen from mondays close of 13170 it moved mainly between a 
low of 13038 and a high of 13125 before finishing the day at 
13095 yen 
king ogino a dealer at goldman sachs said the dollars loss 
against the yen was driven by a comment from finance minister 
kiichi miyazawa who during a regular press conference dismissed 
recent currency changes as ordinary fluctuations the minister said 
the central bank would step into the market if necessary 
ogino said the statement led to depressed dollarselling at 
the 1308013090yen level and further profittaking sent the 
currency to about 13085 yen before it rebounded slightly 
todays loss snapped the dollars sixday winning streak during 
which the currency rose by a total of 482 yen mondays close of 
13170 yen was the highest finish for the dollar since dec 10 
when it closed at 13218 yen the next day the currency tumbled to 
12875 yen 
ogino said the mood on the foreign exchange market for the rest 
of the week would be dictated by movements of the central bank 
on the tokyo stock exchange meanwhile the nikkei stock average 
of 225 selected issues a 12120point loser monday regained lost 
ground following heavy morning losses but it still ended the day 
at 2739809 down 3692 points or 013 percent

an announcement by carnation of a new infant 
formula was met by criticism from the american academy of 
pediatrics which said it would fight any effort by the company to 
advertise the formula directly to consumers 
richard narkewicz president of the 34000member academy said 
he has written a letter to carnations president timm f crull 
which reads in part any attempt to dissuade mothers from breast 
feeding by advertising infant formula directly to the public would 
be strongly condemned by the academy 
on monday carnation announced the introduction of an infant 
formula that the company says will help some infants who are 
allergic to existing formulas 
richard curd spokesman for carnation nutritional products in 
los angeles said that the company plans an information campaign 
that will alert the public to the problem of infant formula 
allergies he said the advertising will not mention the new 
product but will mention carnation 
existing makers of infant formula have voluntarily complied with 
the pediatrics academys longstanding ban on advertising formula 
narkewicz said 
adele haley a securities analyst for smith barney harris upham 
amp co who specializes on the pharmaceutical business said she 
didnt think the product would be a big seller 
she said carnation made a less than convincing argument that 
it has a significantly different product the new formula appears 
to be a small niche product similar to bristolmyers infant 
formula product called nutramigan she said 
the formula called good start ha is a wheybased 
predigested formula that carnation says will not cause allergies in 
some children who are allergic to conventional cows milk formulas 
or formulas from soybeans 
dr richard hamburger a professor of pediatrics at the 
university of california san diego who spoke at press conference 
here on the companys behalf said that perhaps 8 percent of 
american children are allergic to milkbased and soybased 
formulas which he said are the most commonly used in the united 
states 
some of those children may not be allergic to good start ha 
which contains predigested or brokendown proteins said 
hamburger precisely how many children might be helped by the 
formula is unknown he said because the studies to find that out 
have not been completed 
dr william weil professor of pediatrics at michigan state 
university and former member of the pediatrics academys nutrition 
committee said in a telephone interview that many children have 
food disorders of some type but in my opinion its rare that 
its really due to allergy 
of the carnation product he said it does not sound to me 
like theyve come up with anything in the way of a breakthrough for 
feeding problems in infancy 
in a statement released at the carnation press conference ernie 
strapazon assistant general manager of the nutritional products 
division said the company has developed an information campaign 
for good start ha targeted at consumers and focusing on formula 
intolerance symptoms the message will direct consumers to their 
pediatrician for the solution to problems of infant formula 
intolerance caused by cows milkbased or soybased formulas 
narkewicz expressed concern that the academys nutrition 
committee was not given the opportunity to determine whether the 
product meets standards for infant nutrition 
when we learn what this formula is we will have our committee 
look at it and see does it satisfy the standards narkewicz 
said in a telephone interview from chicago where he was attending 
a meeting of the american medical association 
but ill tell you one thing narkewicz said we are going 
to strongly fight them if they are advertising infant formula 
directly to the public 
the academys opposition to public advertising stems from its 
concern that such advertising may encourage women to use formula 
rather than to breast feed their infants narkewicz said 
quite frankly narkewicz said if breast feeding is the 
best and youve got a multimillion dollar promotion for formula 
whos going to put up the dough to advertise that breast feeding is 
best nobody

a former bronx borough president denied taking 
even one cent from anyone at wedtech corp and the judge ruled 
that attorney general edwin meese iii cant be called as a defense 
witness 
the former bronx leader stanley simon who is on trial with 
rep mario biaggi and five others for alleged corruption involving 
the defense contractor took the witness stand in his own defense 
monday 
also monday us district judge constance baker motley said 
testimony from meese or a former top aide whom the defense also 
wanted to call was irrelevant to this case 
the defense maintains that it was meese and others with ties to 
the reagan administration not the defendants who acted 
corruptly in helping wedtech obtain nobid government contracts 
the defense says wedtech officials had links to meese through 
san francisco attorney e robert wallach a longtime meese friend 
under indictment for allegedly taking money from wedtech to 
influence the attorney general meese has not been charged with any 
wrongdoing 
but prosecutors in the 17weekold trial asserted the request 
was a very obvious effort to confuse and divert the jurors 
simon biaggi biaggis eldest son richard and four others are 
charged with turning the nowbankrupt bronx company into a 
racketeering enterprise that paid millions of dollars in bribes to 
obtain the minority setaside contracts 
in addition to meese the defense wanted to call former meese 
aide and wedtech employee james jenkins 
it is imperative now to show the actual extent of meeses and 
jenkins corrupt involvement in this matter dominic amorosa 
attorney for richard biaggi wrote the judge last week only by 
doing this will richard biaggi be able to present a full picture of 
the scheme to frame him and his father 
in a letter opposing the defense request assistant us 
attorney howard wilson said it was in reality an attempt to 
cause a minitrial on the issue of the guilt of the attorney 
general 
wilson asked motley not to allow amorosa to turn this 
proceeding into a circus from a trial of his client and mario 
biaggi into a trial of ed meese and others 
earlier simon the first defendant to testify said he never 
took bribes or kickbacks 
absolutely not said simon who is accused of demanding 
50000 in cash campaign and charitable contributions from wedtech 
in return for his help in obtaining a city lease for the company 
simon denied ever making the request of wedtech chairman fred 
neuberger who testified for the government in exchange for 
leniency 
did you ever get a cent one cent in cash from any wedtech 
person asked defense attorney maurice nessen 
no simon replied 
he said his 1985 reelection campaign received two checks 
totaling 15000 from neuberger and his partner john mariotta who 
is also a defendant in the trial

the key to winning the war on drugs is in 
reducing demand for illicit narcotics by treating users not in 
spending billions to catch smugglers and pushers a report to 
nations largest doctors organization says 
a report by the american medical associations board of trustees 
calls for revamping the nations efforts to combat the drug problem 
by focusing more energy and money on rehabilitating drug users 
many doctors endorsed the proposal during a committee hearing 
monday at the amas annual policymaking convention the committee 
is expected to issue a recommendation today on whether the 
420member house of delegates a legislative body representing the 
amas 295000 members should approve the proposed drug policy 
before the convention ends thursday 
we think this lays out a blueprint for the american people to 
effectively do something about the drug problem said dr lonnie 
bristow an ama trustee and internist from berkeley calif 
we frankly hate to see money just going down the tubes while 
our nation talks about whether we should have the army and the navy 
patrolling the borders to interdict drug sellers 
he said the ama boards report shows the nations 
muchpublicized war on drugs has been a failure because its had 
the wrong focus 
with annual revenues estimated at 30 billion to 100 billion 
drug traffickers have the money to counteract government 
crackdowns the report contends 
they can acquire sophisticated technology bribe public 
officials and recruit new members with such a strong financial 
base these organizations have demonstrated the ability to counter 
each new interdiction strategy 
bristow said as long as we concentrate on the supply end of 
the problem were just pouring money into a sieve 
the ama boards report recommends that the federal government 
expand drug abuse treatment programs ease regulations to permit 
private doctors to treat addicts with methadone and improve drug 
education programs aimed at adolescents 
it doesnt say how much extra money should be spent for these 
efforts 
the report notes that one federal rule makes it difficult for 
addicts to get treatment by generally only admitting to methadone 
programs people who have been addicted to heroin for at least a 
year it recommends modifying the rule to let doctors running such 
programs admit any patient physically dependent on opiates 
the need for new treatment centers is acute the report 
said only about 150000 of the estimated 14 million iv drug 
abusers currently are in treatment 
the proposal also calls on the president to appoint a 
highranking official of the executive branch to coordinate federal 
drug policy to reduce rivalry among different agencies and keep 
them from working at dual purposes 
the ama board reiterated its opposition to widespread random 
drug testing of employees working in private industry 
but it said limited workplace drug testing should be carefully 
evaluated when its done in conjunction with a treatment program 
as part of preemployment screening for jobs affecting the publics 
health and safety or when an employer suspects a workers 
performance is impaired 
the ama board also said it opposes legalization of illicit 
drugs contending such a move would lead to increased drug use the 
report calls the nations renewed efforts to combat the drug 
problem laudable but says they have yet to lead to 
substantial reductions in the use of illegal drugs

a legislative committee rejected a proposal to 
distribute clean hypodermic needles to drug addicts in boston to 
curb the spread of aids 
im disappointed mayor raymond l flynn said after mondays 
vote but i cant afford to be disappointed and upset very long 
not when you look at babies and people dying of aids 
the measure received an unfavorable report after an emotional 
debate during a joint committee on health care hearing after the 
103 vote against the bill it proceeds to the house floor where 
supporters said they had no hope of reversing the committees 
negative recommendation 
the band is playing on and on larry kessler director of 
the aids action committee said after the vote 
the needle exchange was supported by flynn and several medical 
experts but was opposed by gov michael s dukakis his public 
health commissioner and the massachusetts medical society 
the bill would authorize a sixmonth pilot program to distribute 
sterile needles to about 200 of the estimated 14000 intravenous 
drug abusers in boston supporters said they hoped to find evidence 
of reduced aids transmission 
kessler faulted legislators for their lack of courage and 
said it was hypocritical for lawmakers to argue that a needle 
exchange would undermine the war on drugs when the state has 
refused to provide adequate funding for drug treatment centers 
what we saw here today was a classic example of despicable 
doublespeak kessler fumed hinting that the next step might 
involve civil disobedience in the form of unauthorized needle 
distributions 
flynn said he shared kesslers frustration but would not condone 
lawbreaking instead he said he would fight to educate the public 
and the legislature about the risk of aids to expand drug 
treatment centers and to reach out to addicts to encourage them to 
sterilize their needles with bleach 
after the fall election maybe therell be a better 
environment flynn said referring to the legislators 
reelection campaigns and the governors presidential effort 
they didnt vote for it today but they will vote for it 
in committee opponents argued that for the state to distribute 
hypodermic needles to addicts would send a message that the 
government condones illegal drug abuse 
unless were prepared to talk about the legalization of drugs 
which were not the passage of the petition would be grossly 
inconsistent said rep marjorie clapprood a democrat 
rep john mcdonough a democrat and the bills chief proponent 
urged his colleagues to at least test the effectiveness of a needle 
exchange program in slowing the spread of aids which can be 
transmitted through sharing of contaminated syringes 
the question that will come before us is did we do everything 
we could to stop this tragedy he argued 
supporters noted that massachusetts is one of the few states 
where it is against the law to sell or distribute hypodermic 
needles and a state with one of the highest rates of aids increase 
the sharing of dirty needles among drug addicts is a major cause of 
the spread of the disease 
the first us needle exchange program is scheduled to begin 
soon in portland ore 
earlier this month dutch researchers reported an an 
international aids symposium in stockholm that four years of 
providing clean syringes to addicts in amsterdam produced a 
significant drop in needle sharing and may have helped curb the 
spread of aids but did not lead to increased drug use

pope john paul ii today ordered the creation 
of a watchdog panel for the scandallinked vatican bank as part of 
a series of administrative reforms 
announcement of the reforms long under study was timed for 
todays elevation by the pope of 24 cardinals at the vatican 
an overhaul of vatican administration known as the curia was 
carried out in 1967 under john pauls predecessor paul vi who 
called for many streamlining reforms in the spirit of the 
modernizing second vatican council of 196265 
in his written introduction to the 111page document outlining 
the reforms john paul ii describes them as approaching in 
inspiration and intent those generated by the work of the 
second council 
the vatican administration from time to time has grown to ever 
vaster dimensions the pope wrote in the introduction to the new 
constitution as the document was called 
vatican observers described many of the changes as contained in 
the 193article constitution as minor 
but among the more significant changes was an article dealing 
with the vatican bank formally known as the institute for 
religious works 
the bank headed by american archbishop paul marcinkus was 
involved in italys most sensational banking scandal the collapse 
of banco ambrosiano 
the scandal centers on the disappearance of 13 billion lent by 
the milanbased bank to 10 dummy overseas companies investigators 
allege marcinkus wrote letters to financial officials assuring them 
the vatican controlled the dummy companies 
last year italian judicial authorities issued arrest warrants 
for marcinkus and two top lay employees of the vatican bank 
accusing them of being accessories to fraudulent bankruptcy 
but italys constitutional court ruled that italianvatican 
treaties forbid the three from being prosecuted 
traditionally the vatican bank has been answerable only to the 
pope 
under the new reforms the institution while not technically 
part of the vatican administration would have to inform a council 
of 15 cardinals about its transactions 
a vatican official speaking on condition of anonymity said an 
ad hoc group of cardinals who have been working on the vaticans 
budget problems has actually been performing a kind of oversight 
of the bank for some time 
the official said the council does not actually control the bank 
under the new restructuring 
in another reform the vaticans council for public affairs its 
foreign ministry will be put under one of two sections of the 
secretariat 
under the old system it exercised much autonomy 
a vatican official familiar with the changes in the curia said 
that in the past the foreign ministry played a key role in 
deciding candidates for bishops now that role will be almost 
exclusively carried out by the congregation for bishops with the 
foreign ministry involved only at the diplomatic level 
among the 1967 reforms of paul vi was one allowing use of modern 
languages instead of latin in official documents john paul iis 
reforms reflected that change with the constitution written in 
italian 
another thrust of the second vatican council was greater use of 
lay people in church affairs 
in his introduction to the reforms john paul calls for creation 
of a vatican work commission to deal with lay employees who have 
protested in past months for better pay 
part of the reason for streamlining the vatican bureaucracy 
stems from the vaticans deficit which was projected at 618 
million for 1988 
however it was not immediately revealed if and how the changes 
could save the church money

jurors hearing andrea cowans case even though the words dont 
necessarily have negative connotations judge michael mcdonald 
ruled monday 
a sixmember jury was chosen after mcdonalds ruling and 
prosecutors and defense attorney john calmes were to present their 
opening arguments today 
cowan 26 is charged with cruelty to a juvenile which carries 
a maximum penalty of 10 years in jail and a 1000 fine 
detectives who arrested her in march 1987 said she quoted the 
bible to justify her action and if thy right eye offend thee 
pluck it out and cast it from thee for it is profitable for thee 
that one of thy members should perish and not that thy whole body 
should be cast to hell 
the boy darnell washington had a history of fasting to rid his 
body of what he believed to be a demonic possession authorities 
said he had convulsions at school on march 23 1987 and was taken 
to baton rouge general hospital by ambulance 
after he was released that afternoon his family began an 
exorcism authorities said when the family decided they could not 
expel the demons from the boy they called cowan her husband 
kevin and their pastor david cowan kevin cowans brother 
andrea cowan told detectives she has performed at least six 
exorcisms in which she prayed demons away 
god was acting through andrea said david cowan pastor of 
rock zion baptist church it was a very stubborn demon because 
there were more than one in him 
andrea cowan told arresting officers that at the time of the 
ritual she was not of this world jesus had taken over her 
body 
she told detectives that after prayer failed she took the boy 
upstairs to beat the demons from him when that didnt work she 
stuck a finger into his left eye socket plucked out his eyeball 
and released the demons she told detectives 
she said the boy spoke in the devils voice and vomited a 
mucus matter that she recognized as the devil 
we cleaned the eye and he went on to bed david cowan said 
in an interview a few days after the incident we covered the 
eye and we prayed god would heal it and whatever prevailed that 
was gods will 
two days after the ritual a nurse from baton rouge general 
telephoned the boys home to check on his condition and was told of 
the eye injury the nurse urged the family to take the boy back to 
the hospital 
detective erika damico said that when she interviewed the boy 
and asked him what happened to his eye he started shaking and 
said god did it 
the youth then began gurgling and talking incoherently she said 
authorities took custody of the boy and he was taken to a new 
orleans hospital for treatment

been too swift for central banks and the reported intervention 
should be seen as a signal to the market to calm down 
todays joint effort by central banks was designed to deflate 
the dollar slightly but the market still remains bullish on the 
dollar he said 
but the west german dealer said the markets sentiment on the 
dollar already has cooled a bit with most dealers seeing the 
currency as overbought

the interior minister said today that two 
turks had been arrested for claiming they wanted to kill pope john 
paul ii and accused the two of perpetrating a hoax to gain 
publicity 
during the papal visit there was no attempted 
assassination interior minister karl blecha told reporters 
following a cabinet meeting today on monday the pontiff ended a 
fiveday austrian pilgrimage 
a us television network reported monday that a plot to 
assassinate john paul during the recent visit was uncovered and 
foiled in vienna 
but blecha whose ministry oversees many police and security 
functions said the plot was nothing more than a hoax to to grab 
the attention of the world news media 
abc news quoted unidentified sources as saying two turks were 
the prime suspects in the alleged assassination attempt that was to 
have taken place last thursday the first day of the visit 
the network reported that the assassination attempt was to take 
place as the pope arrived at st stephens cathedral in vienna it 
said it had learned that police believed shots were to be fired 
from a construction site across from the cathedral 
abc news said the austrian government had confirmed that 
following a tip its antiterrorist police found photographs that 
show several sniper positions in the building plus firing angles to 
the square 
the network said police apparently foiled the alleged plot when 
they raided an islamic prayer building used primarily by turkish 
immigrants 
speaking of the pairs arrest two days before the pope arrived 
in vienna blech said no weapons were found only a warning 
pistol unable to shoot bullets 
they were arrested and charged with faking a criminal act but 
were not kept in jail he said 
the interior minister did not identify them or say where they 
were 
according to blecha one of the suspects told police on june 13 
that an attempt on the popes life was planned after further 
investigation police discovered the second man who turned out to 
be the first suspects accomplice blecha said 
it was not immediately clear why they sought the publicity or 
how they may have intended to escape responsibility themselves 
in ankara yahya kucuk head of the political division of 
turkeys general directorate of security said officials had no 
information or query from vienna in connection with turks involved 
in a foiled plot against the pope 
in 1981 a turkish terrorist shot and wounded the pope in st

criticizing the government said steven bates chairman of south 
carolinas chapter of the american civil liberties union

williamsburg county weekly with a circulation of 2300

mcgill who is white brought the charges in response to a may 17 
column in which fitts urged voters to reject the politicians in the 
june primary and accused them of stealing 
representatives of reporters groups called the indictment a 
step backwards 
im really appalled said jane kirtley executive director 
of the reporters committee for freedom of the press in washington 
you dont throw people in jail in this country for stating an 
opinion

was sent to prison for libel

representatives in the legislature won the election 
fitts 62 wrote in part i will say to you without fear of 
contradiction if every black in williamsburg county would start 
stealing today and steal every day for the rest of their lives 
they could not steal as much as those two have stolen during their 
time in power 
the column gave no specifics when asked later what he thought 
they had stolen fitts said only that they had taken the pride of 
people of williamsburg county 
fitts said monday he expected the indictment and would ask to 
have the trial moved out of the county 
the power structure has long roots in williamsburg county 
he said 
wallace connor the attorney for mcgill and gordon said fitts 
was only seeking publicity for his newspaper 
fitts showed no emotion as the indictment was read afterward 
he told reporters im not surprised im not disappointed and i 
welcome the opportunity to be heard in court i got what i wanted 
we need some relief in order that the county can grow

john f kennedy is the most overrated public 
figure in american history while his predecessor dwight d 
eisenhower is among the most underrated according to a sampling of 
historians and journalists 
kennedy topped the voting among 75 prominent historians and 
journalists surveyed by american heritage magazine with president 
reagan taking second place among the most overrated americans 
neither was a consensus choice however kennedy was picked by 
eight of the experts reagan by four 
the results appear in the julyaugust issue of american heritage 
four public figures all presidents tied for first place in the 
most underrated category but only got two votes each eisenhower 
john quincy adams ulysses s grant and james k polk 
of kennedy historian and novelist thomas fleming wrote i 
write this with a lump in my throat but the record shows that his 
public relations approach to the presidency was an almost total 
disaster for the nation from the bay of pigs to the berlin wall to 
the missile crisis to the halfhearted intervention in vietnam 
fleming was among those who chose polk the seldomremembered 
11th president as the most underrated public figure he called 
polk a hardworking and decisive president who brought a 
program to the office and realized almost all of it we could 
use a large dose of his example today 
eisenhower was the choice of historians walter lord and arthur 
ekirch when eisenhower stepped down in 1961 lord wrote he had 
left the country strong and prosperous the civil rights battle 
was off to an important start at little rock and joe mccarthy had 
been defused 
presidents dominated both ends of the survey with woodrow 
wilson and harry s truman tying for third place among the most 
overrated figures however numerous nonpresidents including 
several women received votes 
among the women named as the most underrated american were 
eleanor roosevelt abigail adams the radical theorist elizabeth 
cady stanton transcendentalist margaret fuller and journalist 
sarah josepha buell hale betsy ross picked up a mostoverrated 
vote 
finally these were the choices of university of chicago 
professor martin e marty who probably deserves a vote for most

here are key quotations from soviet leader mikhail 
s gorbachevs opening address tuesday to the 19th communist party 
conference 
on farming 
we must restore the economic balance between town and 
countryside and release to the utmost the potential of collective 
and state farms by promoting diverse contractual and lease 
arrangements 
we must make the farmer sovereign master protect him against 
command methods and cardinally change the conditions of life in 
villages that is the only way to rapidly heighten the efficiency 
of the agroindustrial sectors and to secure a radical improvement 
in food supplies across the country 
on economic reforms and price increases 
the pricing reform cannot fail to affect retail prices as 
well because they are closely connected with the system of prices 
as a whole today the retail price of many food products notably 
that of meat and milk is considerably lower than the actual cost 
of producing them lower than the states procurement price 
the state is compelled to cover this difference in the form of 
a subsidy to the consumer that is not a normal situation it 
undermines the incentives for producing these products and gives 
rise to a wasteful attitude especially towards bread 
we know all this perfectly well comrades it is absolutely 
necessary therefore to resolve this problem no matter how 
difficult it may be and no matter what doubts and fears it may 
create at first glance 
on human rights 
now about the personal rights of citizens here too there is 
a need for more precise legislative regulation 
our entire legal system is designed to guarantee strict 
observance of the rights of citizens to the inviolability of their 
private life home the secrecy of telephone communication postal 
and telegraph correspondence the law must reliably protect a 
persons dignity 
on the establishment of the post of president of the supreme 
soviet or parliament 
in the opinion of the cpsu central committe establishing the 
post of president of the ussr supreme soviet would be in line 
with enhancing the role played by the supreme bodies and by the 
entire system of the soviets of peoples deputies strengthening 
the ruleoflaw basis of government and improving the 
representation of the soviet union in world affairs 
it should be ruled that the president shall be elected and 
recalled by secret ballot by and be fully answerable and 
accountable to the congress of the ussr peoples deputies

an international human rights group today demanded 
the british government set up a judicial inquiry on northern 
ireland claiming existing rules are inadequate to prevent killings 
by security forces 
citing 25 deaths of unarmed people at the hands of security 
forces in disputed circumstances since 1982 amnesty international 
said an inquiry was vital to ensure that effective procedures and 
safeguards are instituted to prevent unlawful killings 
the group released a report focusing on six deaths in late 1982 
that prompted accusations that police were then operating a 
shoottokill policy against suspected guerrillas in the 
britishruled province and that they subsequently covered it up and 
obstructed an independent official investigation 
spokeswoman fae junaid said amnesty believed the need for an 
inquiry had become more urgent because it said the government 
failed to deliver on promises made this year to hold inquests and 
disciplinary proceedings against officers allegedly involved in the 
1982 incidents 
the 94page report said existing rules were inadequate in 
enforcing exacting standards for the behavior of security forces to 
prevent the excessive use of lethal force 
it said few such cases have been prosecuted and in these 
cases most defendants have been acquitted 
a judicial inquiry was needed because government investigations 
were an inadequate means for bringing out the full facts it 
said 
amnesty pointed to an account by john stalker a detective sent 
from britain to investigate the 1982 killings stalker claims he 
was blocked when he got close to proving the existence of a 
shoottokill conspiracy 
the londonbased organization noted that the government admitted 
in january that northern ireland police officers tried to pervert 
the course of justice but that for national security reasons 
no one would be prosecuted 
the report said most unarmed victims of police and army 
shootings since 1982 were roman catholics and some belonged to the 
mainly catholic irish republican army and irish national liberation 
army fighting to rid northern ireland of british rule 
it recognized that the police and army were prime targets of ira 
and inla attack but insisted that the rule of law does not 
permit the exclusion of any citizen from the criminal justice 
system 
the government has refused to set up a judicial inquiry saying 
the police and army are best equipped to investigate disputed 
incidents 
the report also complained that the main procedure used in 
northern ireland for making facts public the coroners inquest is 
so severely restricted that it cannot serve as a mechanism for 
investigating the full circumstances surrounding any incident of 
killing 
amnesty said that since prosecutions were so rare in shootings 
by security forces inquests were bereaved families only means of 
discovering the truth 
but it said inquests were sometimes delayed for years

a basic benefits package a blueprint for 
health insurance has been unveiled by a coalition of businesses 
labor unions medical organizations and insurance companies 
it was devised by the health policy agenda for the american 
people and is designed to become the standard by which private and 
public health insurance plans are measured officials said 
consumers can use it as a checklist to use when comparison 
shopping for a comphrehensive health insurance policy they said 
the group unveiled its plan at the american medical 
associations annual policymaking convention the coalition was 
launched at the amas initiative and began work last year 
what it says is there are certain health insurance benefits 
that should be included in a basic package it is a blueprint for 
health benefit plans said diane mccarthy a member of the 
committee that developed the package 
it defines the specific types of coverage and services that 
should be in a basic benefits plan but it is not a mandatory 
formula americans should consider this a core set of benefits to 
use as a guide to tailor specific benefits plans and to help them 
comparisonshop for insurance ms mccarthy said 
according to the coalition of 172 public and private 
organizations a basic health insurance package should cover such 
items as 
maternity and child care including pre and postbirth 
examinations along with some benefits for wellchild care 
immunizations and periodic medical examinations for early 
detection of illness 
semiprivate room and board in a hospital 
treatment by doctors and surgeons inside and outside the 
hospital 
mental health treatment including for drug and alcohol abuse 
home healthcare nursing home care and hospice care at home 
for people with a terminal illness 
prior to this time no one has been able to define the level 
of health care to which every american ought to be entitled said 
dr james todd speaking for the ama which helped develop the plan 
gene kimmelman legislative director for the consumer federation 
of america another coalition member said 37 million us 
residents now have no health insurance and an additional 30 million 
to 40 million have inadequate insurance 
the health coalition estimated that such a health insurance 
package would cost 270 a month for a family or 110 for an 
individual 
such a plan would have a 200 deductible for the first hospital 
admission in any calendar year a 100 individual deductible for 
all other covered services or a maximum 250 family deductible 
it also would require consumers to pay 20 percent of the costs 
for covered services up to a maximum of 1500 for an individual or 
2500 for a family

federal health researchers say giving free fans 
to the poor and elderly during heat waves may not be such a great 
idea because fans could actually increase heat stress instead of 
relieving it 
the national centers for disease control has sent state health 
officers an advisory on precautions to take during heat waves 
particularly to safeguard the health of the poor and elderly 
a review of occupational comfort and occupational health studies 
dating back to the 1920s shows that fans may only blow hot air on 
the person whos trying to cool off said dr ed kilbourne of the 
cdc 
as the temperature gets around 100 we find that above that 
increasing air velocity tends to increase heat stress kilbourne 
said in an interview monday 
he stressed that other factors including humidity come into 
play in discussing heat stress 
but under some circumstances where areas are diverting 
resources to hand out fans the money may be better spent in 
getting people to shelters 
the cdc in its weekly report last thursday recommended that in 
times of severe heat special care should be taken to protect 
elderly and poor people particularly innercity residents against 
heatstroke and other illnesses 
for example elderly persons may be taken to an 
airconditioned shopping mall for 23 hours per day the cdc 
suggested 
kilbourne said the cdcs research has cast doubt on one widely 
held notion the idea that air conditioning may make some people 
more susceptible to heatrelated illnesses when they leave the cool 
indoors that appears not to be the case he said 
the cdc studied heatrelated deaths in 1980 when more than 
1700 such fatalities were reported nationwide 
in july 1980 st louis and kansas city mo were among cities 
noticing a sharp increase in deaths during a time of severe heat 
deaths from all causes in st louis were up 57 percent from july 
1979 in kansas city it was 64 percent kilbourne said 
you can double or triple the daily number of people dying 
during a heat wave he said

a weak dollar a productive workforce 
and american hardwood combined to convince japanese electronics 
giant matsushita to make panasonic tvs here and start shipping them 
back home for sale 
japan is a different market and these sets today represent an 
honest attempt to market and sell a product based on conditions 
there not just send over whatever we build richard kraft 
president of matsushita industrial co said monday as the first of 
5000 sets were loaded for shipment 
kraft said the two most important factors in the decision to 
build the sets in this chicago suburb were savings of about 10 
percent and the design of the cabinet which makes extensive use of 
us hardwoods and craftsmen 
he said he could not estimate what the 27inch sets would cost 
in japan but a comparable product for the us market would range 
between 1500 and 2000 
while usmade materials account for about 70 percent of each 
set kraft noted the televisions are unusuable in this country 
because the settings power supply and frequencies are adapted for 
foreign use 
the plant manufactures more than one million sets annually for 
the north american market by designing the product specifically 
for sale in japan kraft predicted americans can make genuine 
inroads into the japanese market 
hopefully this is just a small beginning to what ultimately 
will lead to a more balanced trading situation between all 
countries of the world but especially the united states and 
japan he added 
gov james r thompson joined the plants executives and 800 
workers for a brief ceremony then lauded the company for paying 
attention to the new realities of global business 
americans are always being eternal optimists believing whats 
good enough for us is good enough for the rest of the world said 
thompson 
but there are cultural differences consumer differences and 
technology and all play a role in the success of marketing a 
product this is what the smartest business have always done the 
governor said

with a schism in the church looming only two 
days away pope john paul ii elevated 24 churchmen from 17 
countries to cardinal today and pleaded anew for unity in the roman 
catholic church 
the 24 included two americans archbishops james hickey of 
washington and edmund szoka of detroit 
the pope used the occasion to appeal to followers of rebel 
french archbishop marcel lefebvre who appears set to provoke the 
first break in the church in more than 100 years 
addressing members of the college of cardinals during a 
closeddoor ceremony to approve the new cardinals the pope said 
the rupture with lefebvre now seems inevitable 
lefebvre an ultratraditionalist who rejects many of the 
reforms of the 19621965 second vatican council has threatened to 
consecrate four bishops on thursday without the popes permission 
a move which would mean excommunication for the 82yearold prelate 
without referring to the french prelate by name the pope told 
the cardinals gathered in the frescoed consistory hall of the 
apostolic palace 
we are very saddened by the news of which we are all aware 
that one of our brothers in the episcopate wants to ordain 
bishops and thus to break the principle of unity of the church 
taking with him a large number of his followers into schism 
addressing lefebvres followers the pope added we pray and 
exhort them that they remain in the paternal home and that they see 
that it is there where the real truth of faith and correct behavior 
is found 
the remarks made in latin were released by the vatican 
the consistory as the session is known began with the pope and 
58 veteran cardinals formally approving the papal nominees during 
the closeddoor ceremony 
then vatican secretary state cardinal agostino casaroli read out 
the names of the new cardinals in front of an audience of about 
10000 people in paul vi auditorium 
large delegations of american pilgrims from washington and 
detroit vigorously applauded when hickey and szoka were named 
each of the new princes of the church wearing crimson 
vestments and a golden cross then went up to the stage to receive 
their certificate from casaroli 
next the pope arrived and the new cardinals then again climbed 
the stairs to receive their threecornered cardinal hats 
each knelt in front of john paul who handed each of the 
prelates a scroll and embraced them 
the new cardinals bring to 160 the membership in the college of 
cardinals the churchs most important governing body those under

soviets should be free of interference in their 
private lives and able to speak their minds provided they do not 
oppose the political structure or the communist partys monopoly on 
power mikhail s gorbachev said today 
in his speech opening the 19th communist party conference at the 
kremlin the soviet leader touched on political and judicial 
reforms the rights of religious believers and the demands of 
political and ethnic dissidents 
the entire lawandorder structure of ours is called upon to 
guarantee strict observance of the citizens rights to the 
inviolability of private life and the home privacy of 
correspondence postal and telegraph messages he said 
the soviet legal system must ensure that a person is innocent 
until proven guilty and that all people get equal treatment before 
the law the soviet leader said 
those rights and the right to speak out on the issues before 
soviet society have been violated since the time of dictator josef 
stalin and must be restored he said 
but the reformminded soviet leader drew a line at challenges by 
ethnic minorities to the existing boundaries of the soviet union 
and by political dissidents to the communist partys monopoly on 
power which is proclaimed in the soviet constitution 
some think that any questions from the redrawing of borders 
to the establishment of opposition parties can be resolved 
through glasnost his policy of greater openness gorbachev said 
the central committee believes such abuses of democratization run 
counter to the tasks of perestroika contradict the peoples 
interests he said 
he expressed confidence that soviet people could tell the 
difference between genuine champions of perestroika and glasnost 
from those who are guided by goals alien to the goals of socialism 
and the oneparty sytem 
even though they have a different world view than communists 
all believers irrespective of their faith are equal citizens of 
the soviet union gorbachev said 
a new law on freedom of conscience now being written will ensure 
equal treatment for believers he said

four people including three onetime followers 
of a polygamist leader have been slain here and in suburban 
dallas and authorities say the shootings may stem from a religious 
dispute 
no arrests have been made in the monday shootings but police 
said they were seeking three sons of the late polygamist patriarch 
ervil lebaron lebaron died in a utah prison in 1981 
lebarons church of the lamb of god split into several groups 
after his death polygamist sects broke off from the mormon church 
when it outlawed multiple marriages in 1890 
duane chynoweth 31 and his daughter jennifer were found shot 
to death monday in a pickup truck parked outside a vacant house in 
houston police spokesman dan turner said 
chynoweth was apparently delivering an appliance to the vacant 
house and police were trying to determine who arranged for the 
delivery the shootings occurred shortly after 4 pm 
at around the same time duanes brother mark chynoweth 36 was 
found shot to death at a business about 10 miles away turner said 
lebaron was mark chynoweths fatherinlaw 
in irving outside dallas eddie marston 32 one of lebarons 
stepsons was also shot to death shortly after 4 pm irving police 
officer richard gilmette said marston was found shot in the head 
and upper body 
turner said duane chynoweth was a polygamist but he did not 
have any information about mark chynoweth 
we are trying to put it all together but it looks like its 
going to be a religious cult deal turner said were trying to 
figure it all out now 
a neighbor of the chynoweth family who did not want his name 
used said mark chynoweths wife talked to his wife after the 
killings 
apparently lillian told my wife they tried to break away from 
a cult and there was a death list the man told the houston 
chronicle 
lebaron died while serving a sentence for the 1977 murder of a 
rival polygamist leader rulin allred

slaying in sanpete county utah last october of polygamist leader 
daniel ben jordan

mingus the seminal jazz bassist and composer died at age 56 in 
mexico where he was being treated for lou gehrigs disease 
during that time mingus innovative compositions and 
arrangements have been perpetuated in performances by the mingus 
dynasty band an ensemble of varying personnel led by trombonist 
jimmy knepper who played with mingus in the late 50s and 60s 
an expanded version of the mingus dynasty band celebrated the 
late jazz bassist with a joyous jvc jazz festival concert monday 
night at the kaufmann concert hall at the 92nd street y 
although fewer than half the seats in the 926seat hall were 
filled those in attendance got a pleasurable lesson in what made 
mingus such an influential force as jazz moved from bebop into the 
more eclectic styles of the 1960s 
monday nights band combined elements of the old former mingus 
bandsmen jaki byard on piano jack walrath on trumpet john handy 
on alto saxophone and knepper with the young jon faddis on 
trumpet and craig handy no relation to john on tenor saxophone 
mingus lush arrangements in which the horns and saxophones 
weave dense patterns of sound as a backdrop for the soloists were 
as fresh as when he did them more than two decades ago 
the set opened with jump monk mingus uptempo appreciation 
of the late pianist theolonius monk 
another object of mingus affection duke ellington provided 
the inspiration for duke ellingtons sound of love a lovely 
ballad launched with a moving solo by byard 
mingus genius as a composer and arranger came through most 
strongly in stop look and listen an ambitious collection of 
rhythms moods and styles from his acclaimed album on the impulse 
label the black saint and the sinner lady 
rounding out the band was sam burtis on trombone and tuba david 
murray on tenor saxophone nick brignola on baritone sax george 
mraz on bass and billy hart on drums 
mondays concert opened with a courageous set by pianist geri 
allen and her trio the program of original compositions started 
slowly but gradually picked up excitement as the trio warmed to 
the occasion 
although largely in the avantgarde style of polytones and 
polyrhythms ms allens music retained sufficient melodic content 
to hold the audiences interest and she received a warm ovation

ann richards tapped as the keynote speaker 
for the democratic national convention said today she will consult 
with advisers to apparent nominee michael dukakis and rival jesse 
jackson before preparing her speech 
she also suggested on a light note that she might be a 
goodluck charm for the party 
noting that fellow texan barbara jordan was the only previous 
female keynoter at a democratic convention in 1976 she said 
that year the democrats went to the white house so maybe they saw 
my selection having another female as a good omen 
before the convention she said in an interview on cbstv i 
wanted to be sure to look at the democratic platform i wanted to 
consult with both the dukakis campaign and the jackson campaign 
and of course i welcome any help and any advice that i get 
ms richards is known for using blunt rhetoric tempered with 
wicked humor to get her point across 
at a recent democratic party fundraiser in houston one man 
after another none of them minorities came to the podium to 
speak finally it was the turn of ms richards the texas state 
treasurer and potential 1990 gubernatorial candidate 
now are there any other white men who havent spoken yet 
she said sweetly god knows we dont want to leave any of you 
out 
the audience roared with laughter as ms richards audiences 
usually do and as usual her audience got the message 
on monday her stump style was praised by democratic party chief 
paul g kirk as he announced her selection as the speaker whose 
address will open the partys convention next month in atlanta 
the 54yearold ms richards kirk said at a washington news 
conference has the ability to tell it like it is 
kirk said dukakis had urged the selection of a woman keynote 
speaker the first since rep jordan shared that honor with john 
glenn 
he was very hopeful that we might make a selection of a 
woman the party chief said not only because of the importance 
of the family concerns the issues of stress and struggle that 
women are going through in the daily work lives and family lives 
but i think it is symbolic of the importance of women to the 
american family and the realities of all of that 
ms richards the first woman in 50 years to hold statewide 
office in texas is the divorced mother of four grown children 
in 1976 her first attempt at elected office ms richards 
defeated an incumbent travis county commissioner in 1982 the 
states incumbent treasurer under indictment for official 
misconduct withdrew from a democratic runoff against her she won 
the general election and was reelected without opposition in 1986 
after the 1982 election ms richards moved quickly to change 
operations in the state treasury she also made staff changes 
boosting the number of women and minorities on the job in the 
170employee agency she now claims the agency payroll has an 
ethnic and sex balance reflecting the states general population 
ms richards said monday that womens issues are the same 
issues that affect all other human beings but with a twist 
the difference is the role sociologically that women have 
played that is we are the caretakers the nurturers she says 
it usually falls to us when any time hard times and bad times 
hit 
its a message often repeated by ms richards if you can make a 
household work she says you can succeed in government 
most homemakers dont know what enormous skills they have 
putting three meals on the table each day is a pretty big job in 
itself much less doing the laundry and car pooling she once 
told a reporter 
her professional success has come despite personal challenges 
in 1980 after being confronted by family members she sought 
treatment for alcoholism she says she has not had a drink since 
then and she has been active in helping others battle alcoholism 
shortly after her treatment she and husband david richards 
separated and in 1984 the two obtained what they both said was an 
amicable divorce 
richards a lawyer was on hand monday when his exwife talked 
to reporters about being selected to give the keynote speech she 
acknowledged him as someone who played a very large role in my 
life politically and personally 
beyond the convention and helping to put a democrat in the white 
house ms richards most immediate goal is the 1990 texas 
gubernatorial race she has not formally declared her intentions 
but sent out her first exploratory fundraising letter monday 
ms richards said she is not certain what effect her halfhour 
in the political spotlight in atlanta will have on her 
gubernatorial race 
i suppose if im good it will help she said monday and 
if im bad it wont

record on housing issues today before heading to washington on 
wednesday to meet with the senators 
on the capitol hill itinerary is a meeting with georgia sen sam 
nunn who said monday he was not providing the dukakis campaign 
with background and financial information it has requested of 
prospective running mates 
he knows my position on the vice presidency nunn said in a 
telephone interview 
nunn said he had told the massachusetts governor and dukakis 
campaign chairman paul brountas that a spot on the democratic 
ticket is not on my agenda brountas is heading the search for 
a running mate 
another prominent senator new jerseys bill bradley last week 
said he had informed dukakis that he did not want to be considered 
house majority leader tom foley of washington also declined to 
provide personal background and finances to the dukakis campaign 
the seattle postintelligencer reported today 
requests for background and financial information from 
prospective running mates have gone out in the past two weeks 
those under consideration according to sources included jesse 
jackson sens bob graham of florida nunn john glenn of ohio and 
lloyd bentsen of texas and rep lee hamilton of indiana 
sen dale bumpers of arkansas as well as missouri rep richard 
gephardt also reportedly have been asked to provide information to

democratic national convention to hold similar sessions with house 
members his campaign said 
aides meanwhile said there was no timetable for making or 
announcing the choice for the second spot on the ticket 
the massachusetts governor has said he hoped to select a running 
mate prior to the atlanta convention scheduled for july 1821 but 
aides were quick to deny a report in the boston herald that the 
decision might be made as early as monday 
thats wrong brountas said in a telephone interview its 
going to take more time than that to get the work all done he 
did say however that it would make a lot of sense to complete 
the search in advance of the convention 
private campaign polling on the strengths and weaknesses of 
potential running mates has not been completed while early 
campaign polls had general questions about the no 2 spot on the 
ticket current polling is more detailed 
the polling wont be finished this week said one campaign 
source 
although dukakis himself says he dislikes polling and contends 
it will have little impact on his decision a position shared by

an american medical association committee 
recommended today that the ama adopt new proposals for battling 
aids including a call for aids testing of all prison inmates and 
for tracing the sexual partners of aids victims 
many doctors had opposed the proposal for mandatory testing of 
prison inmates during a hearing monday before the committee 
the house of delegates is scheduled to vote thursday on the aids 
proposals which were drafted by the amas board of trustees 
the trustees report debated monday recommended that states 
give serious consideration to contact tracing of all aids 
victims and it called on federal and state governments to expand 
treatment programs for intravenous drug abusers 
the report also recommended that us women infected with the 
aids virus avoid breast feeding to reduce the chance of giving the 
disease to their children and called for vigorous enforcement 
of existing antidiscrimination laws to protect aids victims 
in addition the board called on president reagan to create a 
new national aids commission identical to the one that just 
finished its work to provide the essential coordination between 
public and private institutions that are addressing aids 
the amas board also issued four background reports on related 
aids issues and individual state delegations have proposed five 
additional aids policies 
this is a disease we cant become casual about said dr 
john dawson an ama trustee and surgeon from seattle were still 
waiting for the explosion of cases that will arouse the country 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome destroys the bodys ability 
to fight disease and is spread primarily through sexual 
intercourse shared hypodermic needles and from mothers to their 
infants it is fatal and incurable 
by 1991 the nation likely will have 270000 cases of aids the 
report said 
dr robert bernstein the texas health commissioner opposed 
testing prisoners for aids because most state correctional systems 
cant segregate aids victims from other inmates 
why test if youre not going to do anything about it he 
said he also estimated that it would cost at least 120000 to 
conduct just one round of testing on texas 40000 prison inmates 
but dr john watson of columbus ga said he favored testing 
prisoners as a way of protecting inmates who dont have aids 
because of the prevalence of homosexual rape in prisons 
the ama trustees also recommended that states seriously consider 
launching a program of contacting the sexual partners of aids 
victims in an effort to slow the diseases spread among 
heterosexuals 
you have the potential for a frightening expansion of aids 
into the heterosexual community dawson said thats where 
contact tracing would be important 
a separate ama trustees report focusing on intravenous drug 
users recommends that federal and state governments increase 
spending for free drug treatment programs 
experts in the field agree that this is the most important 
step that can be taken to reduce the spread of aids infection 
among intravenous drug abusers the report says 
it also calls on authorities to clean up shooting galleries 
where addicts gather to inject drugs because they pose a potential 
for spreading the disease 
the hearing committee also recommended that the ama delegates 
adopt the following aids proposals calling for 
the federal government to continue to quickly investigate 
new experimental aids treatments so that they can be made 
available as soon as possible to victims of the disease 
the ama to study the issues surrounding whether doctors 
infected by the aids virus should be allowed to continue to 
practice medicine 
the government to begin a second nationwide study to determine 
the rate of the diseases spread 
the government to prevent discrimination against aids victims 
in employment housing and other areas 
the more discrimination that goes on with aids dawson said 
the more youre going to drive it underground and have difficulty 
dealing with it

at least 50000 hungarians many 
carrying torches and candles marched quietly past the romanian 
embassy to protest a plan to demolish thousands of romanian 
villages 
monday nights rally was the largest unofficial demonstration in 
hungary since an antisoviet uprising was crushed in 1956 police 
protected the embassy compound but did not interfere 
the protest was organized by a dozen opposition and other 
unofficial groups but it was officially authorized by police in 
this communist country 
observers watching the crowd and listening to the slogans 
chanted felt the demonstration was pervaded not only by 
discipline the knowledge of representing a just cause but an 
awareness of central european consciousness the government 
newspaper magyar hirlap said today 
before the march to the embassy about 30000 people gathered on 
downtown heroes square to hear speeches denouncing the forcible 
resettlement plan according to the official hungarian news agency 
mti 
the proposed plan to raze about 7000 of romanias 13000 
villages which would affect hundreds of communities of people of 
hungarian and german heritage has strained hungarianromanian 
relations 
the demonstration reflected the anxiety hungarian society 
feels about the fate of the villages in romania and the fact that 
it is not accepting that bulldozer policy as a government policy 
in these concluding years of the 20th century 
unofficial demonstrations of up to 15000 people have been held 
before but they were never sanctioned and sometimes dispersed by 
force 
smaller unofficial demonstrations have been staged in hungary 
before but they were never sanctioned and sometimes dispersed by 
force 
the crowd moved slowly past shouting protests then marched 
back to the square laying flowers at monuments to hungarian kings 
they also heard a message of solidarity from lech walesa the 
leader of the banned polish free trade union movement solidarity 
banners denounced the resettlement and scores of demonstrators 
held up signs of place names in hungarian german and romanian that 
they fear will vanish from the map 
in march president nicolae ceausescu of romania announced plans 
for demolishing 7000 villages which would be replaced by big 
agriculturalindustrial centers 
romanian staterun media have said the program aims to gain more 
farmland for use by the countrys collectivized agriculture which 
is plagued by lack of incentives for farmers and livestock fodder 
shortages 
the forced resettlement program would affect hundreds of 
villages of romanias 17 million ethnic hungarians who complain 
of official discrimination and say they are denied ethnic and 
cultural rights 
a manifesto read to mondays crowd said after 50 years there 
is another criminal committing genocide 
hungarian intellectuals have denounced as genocide both the 
project for demolishing villages and romanias alleged policy of 
discrimination against ethnic hungarians 
mondays manifesto also referred to the mass murder of jews and 
other civilians committed by the nazis before and during world war 
ii 
the document was written by istvan csurka a prominent hungarian 
opposition writer and read by actor istvan bubik it combined 
appeals for restraint and for solidarity with ethnic hungarians in 
romania 
csurka appealed to hungarians to show solidarity and 
determination in trying to prevent what the magyar nemzet newspaper 
earlier monday called romanias bulldozer revolution 
relations between neighboring warsaw pact nations have 
deteriorated rapidly over the issue of ethnic hungarians

into the air today two days after a a320 crash cast doubt on the 
worlds first fully computerized civilian aircraft 
british airways joining air france in confidence that the plane 
is safe put its two a320s back on the schedule today after a 
precautionary suspension 
air frances first a320 flight since sundays suspension took 
off from paris bound for duesseldorf and berlin with 102 passengers 
aboard seven people who had reservations failed to claim their 
seats a normal noshow rate for a european route the company 
said 
an inquiry commission was set up to determine why the plane 
flying 30 feet above the ground at an air show in eastern france on 
sunday failed to climb and crashed into a wooded area killing 
three people and injuring 50 others 
the transport ministry defended the new jet at a news conference 
monday saying there was no reason to doubt the planes 
performance airbus industrie the european consortium that makes 
the plane said there were indications of human error 
daniel tennenbaum head of the civil aviation authority and 
state prosecutor jean volff said preliminary investigations showed 
the airbus was flying too low tennenbaum said the computerized 
plane required eight seconds to respond to the command of the 
pilot who only had five seconds to maneuver because of the 
altitude 
pilot michel hasseline was quoted by the french press as saying 
the aircraft did not respond to his efforts to increase power 
christian roger president of the air france pilots union said 
the engines may have failed to restart at hasselines command

a judge rejected pleas for a noprison 
sentence and ordered a former assistant judge to serve 45 days in 
jail for lying at an inquest into whether she had falsified court 
files to claim pay when she hadnt worked 
district court judge francis mccaffrey on monday sentenced jane 
wheel to between one year and three years on each of three counts 
then suspended all but 45 days wheel must also perform 1500 hours 
of community service over three years 
it is my belief after searching my soul that not to impose 
some time would diminish the seriousness of this offense said 
mccaffrey 
wheels case attracted wide attention because of her ties to 
three state supreme court justices who along with wheel were 
charged with judicial misconduct in 1987 in separate noncriminal 
proceedings the justices were accused of misusing their power in 
order to protect wheel 
wheel was found guilty feb 22 of lying during a 1986 inquest 
into whether she falsified court files to show she heard cases on 
days for which she had claimed pay 
attorneys for wheel say the conviction will be appealed 
wheel 55 faced up to 45 years for her conviction on three 
charges of false swearing 
defense lawyer richard davis urged leniency before the 
sentencing 
i hope your honor in the long run jane wheel will be 
vindicated davis said she doesnt deserve what she has been 
put through she doesnt deserve one more minute of pain and 
suffering 
but david suntag the assistant attorney general who prosecuted 
the case urged a jail sentence because he said wheel abused her 
public trust 
there is no one better to know how important affirming 
maintaining and promoting the judicial system is than jane wheel 
said suntag 
wheel held the elected post of assistant judge in chittenden 
county the states most populous county the assistant judges who 
need not be lawyers sit on superior courts with the presiding 
judge who is a lawyer she lost a reelection bid two years ago 
after the allegations surfaced 
during the nearly monthlong jury trial wheels lawyers 
portrayed her as the victim of a court employees vendetta and a 
drive by members of the legal community to weaken the office of 
assistant judge 
charges against two of the state supreme court justices were not 
pursued the third justice retired justice william hill was found 
guilty on several counts by the judicial conduct board the state 
supreme court will ultimately decide whether hill was guilty of

five republican senators running for 
reelection today introduced a bill to elevate the environmental 
protection agency to cabinetlevel status 
conceding that the bill has little chance of passage this year 
one of the five sen david durenberger of minnesota said the 
measure was meant as a signal we want environmental protection 
to receive a higher priority than it has in the past 
cabinet status would give epa more clout in dealing with other 
government agencies including cabinetlevel departments enhance 
its status in international negotiations and put environmental 
issues closer to the oval office the senators said 
we want the next president of the united states directly 
involved in making environmental policy said durenberger 
another sponsor sen john heinz of pennsylvania refused to take 
the opportunity to criticize president reagans environmental 
record 
given where the united states was in 1980 and 1981 and his 
experience i think the president would agree concern over the 
environment has sharply increased in the past six or eight years 
thats true for him and its true for us heinz said 
in addition to durenberger and heinz the initial sponsors were 
sens john chafee of rhode island robert stafford of vermont and 
lowell weicker of connecticut 
durenberger said he believed vice president george bush certain 
to be the republican nominee for president had an open mind on the 
issue and he did not know how environmentalists or industry would 
react 
some democrats might join his group as cosponsors he said 
the national wildlife federation the nations largest 
environmental group with close to 5 million members in affiliated 
organizations endorsed the bill as long overdue 
epa administrator lee m thomas told reporters in a recent 
conversation he believed that as a general proposition epa should 
be a cabinet department but saw no need to act in the current 
administration because the agency in fact had equal status with 
others participating in the subcabinet domestic policy council 
epa was formed out of pieces of the interior agriculture and 
health education and welfare departments under an executive order 
of president nixon in 1970

the bankrupty trustee for ptl has written 
to the ministrys lifetime partners asking them whether they 
think founder jim bakker should return to the ministry 
bakker is objecting to the letter which also warns the partners 
that their claims in bankruptcy court could endanger the survival 
of the church 
us bankruptcy judge rufus reynolds is scheduled to consider 
modifications to the ministrys reorganization plan at a hearing in 
columbia on wednesday ptl filed for bankruptcy reorganization a 
year ago 
the plan calls for sale of much of the assets of the ministry 
including the 2300acre heritage park usa complex in fort mill 
ptl has been in financial straits since bakker left amid a 
sexandmoney scandal in march 1987 
in his letter trustee mc red benton jr asked the 
contributors whether they felt bakker should be allowed to return 
and in what capacity he also asked whether they would support ptl 
if bakker were allowed to return 
bakker who has returned to the fort mill area and is seeking to 
regain control of ptl responded to the questionnaire monday 
through his attorney 
now as ptl is facing liquidation we request first an 
opportunity to speak to the people and explain our side of the 
story on the ptl club program bakker said in a statement we 
also ask that we be permitted to lease time on the satellite 
network for a separate television program to minister to the people 
fundamental fairness requires that those who founded the 
ministry have an opportunity to give account to the people before a 
decision is made bakker said 
there are about 114000 ptl lifetime partners who contribute 
1000 a year they are entitled to free lodging at the heritage 
usa theme park hotel 
benton told contributors that they could endanger the survival 
of the ministry if they dont give up their claims to lodging 
if all ptl lifetime partners assert their claims individually 
against ptl and seek to collect payment it could seriously 
handicap the survival chances of the new ptl ministry which is 
being referred to as heritage ministries inc benton wrote 
benton said the modified reorganization plan would allow 
lifetime partners to assign or donate their claim to heritage 
ministries the survey asks if the partners would be willing to 
give up their claims in return for becoming a member of heritage 
ministries with full voting rights and privileges 
last december former ptl trustee david clark said 60 percent of 
the current and former ptl donors who responded to another mail 
questionnaire said they would stop contributing if bakker returned 
as ptl leader only 14 percent said they would increase their 
giving clark said

a joint committee of the navy and 
environmental groups today unveiled recommendations on how the navy 
can stop dumping plastic trash at sea 
the navy has begun carrying out some of the recommendations for 
instance a contract to buy 11 million small plastic bags for use 
by ships stores has been canceled said the report of the group 
led by the keystone center an organization based in keystone 
colo that mediates environmental disputes 
under legislation passed late last year to carry out an 
international treaty the navy is supposed to stop dumping plastic 
trash at sea in five years 
environmentalists see plastics as a growing killer of birds and 
other marine life nondegradable bags sixpack loops and other 
plastics can entangle birds or be eaten by them and other organisms 
the committee of navy personnel environmentalists and members 
of congressional staffs was convened last october and immediately 
started visiting ships including an aircraft carrier in the 
mediterranean 
the recommendations call for among other things studies to 
identify food for which packaging other than plastic is available 
surveying waste of ships at sea and ordering test packages of other 
materials changing to those materials where possible installing 
trash compactors separation and storage of plastics while at sea 
unloading as much trash as possible before leaving port and support 
for development of degradable packages 
navy ships bring trash back to port if operating less than 25 
miles from shore but throw it overboard when further out to sea 
the navy is supposed to report to congress in three years on 
what problems it has in eliminating plastic trash

we have witnessed many respectable and able leaders exhaust 
their potential after serving in the same office for decades and 
become a dead weight a liability while still occupying a 
highlevel position 
direct representation of the civic organizations incorporated 
into our political system should be added to the currently existing 
territorial representation of the entire population on the soviet 
of the union and the representation of our nations and 
nationalities on the soviet of nationalities 
thus 1500 deputies would be elected as they are now from the 
territorial and national districts and approximately another 750 
deputies would be elected at the congresses or at plenary sessions 
of the governing bodies of party trade union cooperative youth 
womens veterans academic and artistic organizations 
all these deputies elected for a fiveyear term would comprise 
a new representative supreme government body the congress of the 
ussr peoples deputies it would be convened annually to decide 
on the countrys more important constitutional political and 
socioeconomic issues 
the congress of peoples deputies would elect from among its 
members a relatively small say 400 to 450 strong bicameral 
ussr supreme soviet which would consider and decide all 
legislative administrative and monitoring questions and direct the 
activities of the bodies accountable to it and of the lowerlevel 
soviets it would be a standing supreme government body reporting 
to the congress of peoples deputies 
in the opinion of the cpsu central committee establishing the 
post of president of the ussr supreme soviet would be in line 
with enhancing the role played by the supreme representative bodies 
and by the entire system of the soviets of peoples deputies 
strengthing the ruleoflaw basis of government and improving the 
representation of the soviet union in world affairs 
it should be ruled that the president shall be elected and 
recalled by secret ballot by and be fully answerable and 
accountable to the congress of the ussr peoples deputies 
given the overall strengthening of the role played by 
representative bodies the president of the ussr supreme soviet 
should be granted sufficiently broad state authority powers 
specifically the president could excercise overall guidance in 
the drafting of legislation and of major socioeconomic programs 
decide on the key issues of foreign policy defense and national 
security chair the defense council submit proposals on nominating 
the chairman of the ussr council of ministers and discharge 
several other duties traditionally connected with the presidency 
 
we may of course fail to achieve full unanimity in 
decisionmaking on this or that issue but that is perfectly normal 
under a democratic process generally it is high time we learned 
to listen closely to what an opponent is saying and not to regard 
him with invariable prejudice 
we should resort much more often to a public vote at the 
village district or city level particularly in deciding those 
issues which are of direct concern to the people and on which there 
is not unanimity if that is the case let some of the problems be 
decided by a majority 
on the legal system 
not a single government body official collective party 
organization civic association or individual can be exempt from 
abiding by the law just as all citizens have obligations to our 
state of the whole people the state has obligations to its 
citizens their rights must be firmly protected against any abuse 
by the authorities 
on the communist party 
why did the cpsu which had been formed as a truly democratic 
organization one bone and one flesh with the working people fail 
to block the deformation of socialism the processes associated 
with the cult of stalins personality why then having exposed and 
denounced the departures from the principles of leninism did it 
confine itself to superficial changes which made possible the grave 
phenomena of stagnation in the countrys development 
the answer is above all in the fact that definite deformations 
had occurred in the party itself in its activities and its ties 
with the working people which brought about the loss of many 
demoractic bolshevist traditions traditions founded through the 
efforts exerted by lenin and his associates for many years 
the majority strongly favor the proposal that communists be 
entitled in elections to all party committees including the cpsu 
central commmittee to nominate more candidates than there are 
seats and to be guided in doing so not by the office a person 
holds but by his stance in perestroika 
on socialisms new image 
there can be no fullblooded and diverse life of the spirit 
there can be no truly effective and militant ideological work 
without the truth of life without scientific truths and artistic 
discoveries 
it is exceedingly undemocratic to deny people who had been 
subjected to criticism a chance to reply to that criticism in 
substance that is not glasnost and it is totally impermissible to 
use discussions meetings the press and the television screen for 
squabbles or insults and for namecalling 
our aims are more democracy more socialism a better life for 
the workingman and greatness and wellbeing for the country

republican officials said today one day after the democrats 
named texan ann richards as their convention keynote speaker that 
jeane j kirkpatrick would be one of the featured speakers at 
the gop convention in august 
meanwhile george bush the likely republican presidential 
nominee was traveling to california today to visit a nasa research 
center and a neighborhood safety program democrat michael dukakis 
was touting his massachusetts record on housing issues before 
focusing again on the search for a running mate 
the republicans announced the convention role for ms 
kirkpatrick a favorite of conservatives after the democrats said 
they had chosen texas state treasurer richards a fiery populist 
orator to deliver the keynote speech and set the tone for the 
democratic national convention in atlanta next month 
ms kirkpatrick a former democrat gave a widely publicized 
speech attacking the democrats at the 1984 republican convention 
republican party chief frank j fahrenkopf jr said the 
announcement of the keynote speaker for the new orleans meeting 
would probably come in the next ten days 
ms richards 54 will be the second woman in party history to 
deliver the conventionopening address 
today in an interview on cbstv she mentioned fellow texan 
barbara jordans keynote speech in 1976 and added that year the 
democrats went to the white house so maybe they saw my selection 
having another female as a good omen 
ms richards said she would consult with advisers to jesse 
jackson as well as dukakis before preparing her speech i welcome 
any help and any advice that i get she said 
jackson meanwhile says he is weighing which of a dozen issues 
left out of the party platform to bring up at convention his 
comments came after democrats meeting in denver and washington 
over the weekend agreed to a platform draft and an overhaul of 
party rules in a rare atmosphere of unity 
jackson was part of the sellout crowd of 21785 in atlantic 
city nj who watched mike tyson knock out michael spinks in the 
first round and retain the undisputed heavyweight crown 
dukakis will travel on wednesday to washington to meet with 
several dozen senators including some who have been mentioned as 
possible running mates 
among them is georgia sen sam nunn although he said monday he 
was not providing the dukakis campaign with background and 
financial information it has requested of prospective running mates 
nunn said he had told dukakis and campaign chairman paul 
brountas that a spot on the democratic ticket is not on my 
agenda brountas is heading the search for a running mate 
another prominent senator new jerseys bill bradley last week 
said he had informed dukakis that he did not want to be considered 
and the seattle postintelligencer reported today citing 
unidentified sources that house majority leader tom foley who has 
said frequently that he doesnt want to be vice president had 
chosen not to have dukakis aides examine his personal background 
and finances 
those under consideration according to sources include 
jackson sens bob graham of florida nunn john glenn of ohio and 
lloyd bentsen of texas and reps foley of washington and lee 
hamilton of indiana 
sen dale bumpers of arkansas and missouri rep richard gephardt 
also reportedly have been asked to provide information to brountas 
aides said there was no timetable for making or announcing the 
choice for he second spot on the ticket 
jackson has continued to talk about his own qualifications as a 
running mate for dukakis and although he says hes happy with 
parts of the platform he is indicating that some points of 
disagreement will be brought up at the convention 
by and large we got many of our campaign priorities in the 
platform jackson said monday but he noted that his forces had 
protected our right to protest or raise other issues in 
atlanta 
one of those issues might be a call for the creation of a 
palestinian homeland rejected by the dukakis forces for inclusion 
in the platform 
reasonable discussion on this matter should not alienate 
anyone jackson said in rosemont ill 
in announcing the selection of ms richards as the keynote 
speaker for the democrats party chief paul g kirk said she would 
set the tone for democrats in atlanta and draw the 
distinctions between the party of the working american people and 
the party of the establishment 
in texas ms richards the divorced mother of four grown 
children said i probably will be talking very much about 
american families i think thats what i know the most about other 
than my professional job 
kirk also announced the appointment of four cochairmen for the 
convention vermont gov madeleine kunin rep norman mineta of 
california former new mexico gov toney anaya and little rock 
ark mayor lottie shackelford 
bush met monday with israeli defense minister yitzhak rabin in 
washington amid more bad news in the polls

the democratic national convention committee 
hopes it can peacefully resolve the problem of fitting 35000 
credentialbearing people into a coliseum that will seat only 
11000 for the partys fourday nominating session 
logistically the solution is simple the overflow from the 
omni coliseum will go into the adjacent world congress center but 
it may not be so simple to soothe the hurt feelings of party 
hotshots who find themselves relegated to watching the proceedings 
on giant television screens next door 
well have fewer spectator seats in the omni and there are 
going to be people who are disappointed they arent going to be in 
the omni said ruth berry press secretary for the dncc which is 
in charge of organizing the july 1821 extravaganza 
the omni which seats more than 16000 for the nba atlanta hawks 
games is being redesigned for the convention cutting down the 
seating to about 11000 the architectural changes include a podium 
and news media facilitiies 
among the horde of 35000 will be about 15000 representatives 
of the news media and 5000plus delegates and alternates the 
remainder will be made up of invited guests pages messengers 
security 
credentials the colorcoded badges that spell entree to the 
gathering will be issued to the media delegates and alternates 
invited guests pages messengers security state governors and 
lieutenant governors members of congress democratic staff 
officers of the convention and service workers 
mayor andrew young admitted there may be problems accommodating 
all 35000 people but with minor adjustments they can be resolved 
we didnt design the city for the democratic national 
convention we did design the city for most conventions young 
said but when you come with as many press people as delegates 
youve got to make some adjustments 
democratic national chairman paul kirk said we knew there 
would be limited space but it is adequate to accommodate all the 
delegates and additional guests it will be a little difficult for 
the media this is not a sprawling complex the omni but its not 
a theater in the round 
ms berry said there are seven levels of credentials 
colorcoded to indicate access some credentials will get the 
bearer into everything others are severely limited she would not 
divulge the color breakdown 
each credential will have an access level that is appropriate 
to the function of the credential holder she said

state rep thomas reed the head of the 
state naacp pleaded innocent to federal bribery and extortion 
charges today denying he accepted cash and restaurant equipment to 
help a convicted murderer get out of prison 
reed had no comment after his arraignment before us district 
judge myron thompson but attorney george beck said reed is going 
to prove hes not guilty 
thompson set trial for aug 8 before us district judge joel 
dubina he gave the legislators attorneys 10 days to file papers 
challenging the governments case 
reed is accused of accepting at least 15000 in cash and 
restaurant equipment to try to secure the early release of a 
convicted murderer from the state parole board he also has been 
indicted on related state felony charges with arraignment pending 
reed broke the color barrier in the alabama legislature in 1970 
later helped win state trooper jobs for blacks and recently made a 
highprofile bid to remove the confederate flag from atop the 
capitol 
one of reeds lawyers is bill baxley a former alabama attorney 
general who unsuccessfully prosecuted reed on bribery charges more 
than 10 years ago baxley said he had no qualms about representing 
reed in the pending case 
reed a tuskegee businessman who operates two fried chicken 
restaurants is one of the first two blacks elected to the 
legislature since reconstruction hes a pioneer in that 
progressive political process made by blacks in the early 1970s 
says tuskegee mayor johnny ford he was a role model and a great 
inspiration to many 
as head of the national association for the advancement of 
colored people chapter reed has moved to the center of controversy 
in the confederate battleflag dispute 
the naacp says the flag represents racism and oppression it 
mounted a campaign last year to remove the banner from state 
capitols here and in south carolina and from state flags in georgia 
and mississippi 
reed vowed to try to remove the flag himself from atop the 
building in which jefferson davis was sworn in as president of the 
confederacy in 1861 if republican gov guy hunt would not 
in february reed was among 14 black legislators arrested when 
they made a symbolic attempt to scale a fence that surrounds the 
capitol 
the demonstration led many to criticize reed for his tactics 
i was out speaking to different groups about the pressing 
problems of the state and all anybody wanted to talk about was the 
flag said house speaker jimmy clark im not much on issues 
that attract public attention but are really not that serious 
attorneys for the 14 legislators maintain that the misdemeanor 
trespass charges they face should be dropped meanwhile the flag 
still flies atop the capitol 
a few weeks before the aborted climb reed told a rally that god 
allowed former gov george c wallace to survive an assassination 
attempt so wallace could suffer as a message to whites 
the comment prompted some local naacp leaders to say reed should 
be removed as state president reed later apologized to wallace 
when reed was indicted some blacks suggested the charges were 
related to the flag dispute 
reed has not alleged a direct link but said monday that it is 
difficult for me to believe that there is no connection there 
in 1977 reed was convicted of offering a bribe to a white 
lawmaker who opposed reeds efforts to gain approval for a dog 
track in rural mostly black macon county the misdemeanor 
conviction was overturned by the state supreme court and reed was 
able to maintain his legislative seat the track later was approved 
in 1970 reed and fred gray became the first two blacks elected 
to the legislature this century after a courtordered 
reapportionment created two mostly black house districts 
two years later reed sued the state because it had never hired 
a black state trooper blacks now make up about a fourth of the 
trooper ranks 
the state and federal charges allege that reed a member of the 
legislatures joint prison committee accepted at least 10000 in 
cash and 5000 in restaurant equipment from an uncle of convicted 
murderer anthony dennis chesser 
in return reed allegedly attempted to use his position to 
persuade the parole board to give chesser an earlier date for 
parole consideration and a workrelease assignment 
chesser serving a 40year sentence initially was given an 
earlier date for parole consideration at reeds request but the 
parole board later revoked that change and refused reeds request 
to give chesser a workrelease assignment 
on june 16 a federal grand jury in montgomery indicted reed on 
two counts of violating the hobbs act through extortion and three 
counts of violating the interstate travel act to obtain the 10000 
in cash reed faces up to 55 years in prison and up to 125 
million in fines if convicted 
a montgomery county grand jury indicted reed on two related 
felony bribery counts june 20 each carrying a penalty of 1to10 
years in prison and a 5000 fine his arraignment on these charges 
is pending 
reed has remained free on bond

yugoslavia has decided to close down 
the only railway line linking albania with the outside world the 
tanjug news agency reported tuesday 
the line between titograd in yugoslavia and shkoder in albania 
was opened in 1986 and was the first to link that isolated balkan 
country with european rail networks 
tanjug quoted rail officials as saying the line used mainly by 
albanians for imports and exports of goods proved unprofitable for 
yugoslavia 
last year only 139000 tons of goods were transported on the 
line even though its full capacity could be 1 million tons 
annually the yugoslav officials said 
the startup of the rail link was considered as a sign of 
warming political relations between yugoslavia and albania and 
also of albanias gradual opening to the world

the launch of discovery on the first 
space shuttle mission since the challenger disaster has been 
officially delayed several days until sept 4 nasa said tuesday 
an announcement from space agency headquarters in washington 
confirmed what many launch site officials have been saying for some 
time that an august launch was impossible because it is taking 
longer than expected to prepare discovery for flight 
the announcement said the new goal is a launch in early 
september astronaut jon mcbride nasas liaison with congress 
told a meeting in washington the target is sept 4 
the delay was the third announced this year with earlier launch 
dates set in february june and august but one by one they have 
fallen by the wayside as technical problems held up the nations 
recovery from the loss of space shuttle challenger and its seven 
crew members in a fiery explosion 73 seconds after liftoff on jan 
28 1986 
for several weeks the space agency has carried aug 22 as a 
public target for launch but that was wiped out unofficially some 
time ago 
more than a week ago the assessment date was sept 3 and over 
last weekend it was changed to sept 4 both were reported by the 
news media as working dates 
the announcement tuesday officially eliminated an august date a 
goal that some officials said was still possible as recently as 
last week 
engineers this week have encountered minor problems in joining 
discovery with its two 149foot solid fuel booster rockets and 
external fuel tank and the vehicles rollout to the launch pad has 
been put off from friday until sunday 
in making the announcement rear adm richard h truly nasas 
associate administrator for space flight said that despite the new 
delay he is pleased with the progress of preparations for the 
flight 
hard work by a lot of people is paying off and the shuttle 
program is coming along nicely truly said 
mcbride who flew on a shuttle mission in 1984 said discoverys 
three main engines will undergo a testfiring on the launch pad

the selfproclaimed surveillance expert who 
claimed to have recorded conversations between tawana brawleys 
advisers but turned over blank tapes to federal authorities was 
ordered held without bail today 
meanwhile a poll released today shows a majority of new yorkers 
say the teenagers advisers have acted irresponsibly 
samuel mcclease 26 of jersey city nj said last week he had 
taped conversations between the rev al sharpton and two legal 
advisers concerning the brawley family in which they cast doubt on 
the black teenagers accusation that she was raped by six whites 
last november 
but mcclease was charged saturday with one count each of 
obstruction of justice and perjury after it was revealed the tapes 
he submitted were blank 
us district judge shirley wohl kram said she had heard nothing 
during arguments that would assure his reappearance in court 
therefore i am going to direct that mr mcclease be detained 
mccleases father dennis mcclease sr told reporters he would 
retain lawyer barry slotnick on his sons behalf and would file an 
appeal of the bail ruling 
at a hearing monday assistant us attorney federico e virella 
claimed that the maximum fiveyear sentence and 250000 fine 
mcclease faces if convicted of perjury and obstructing justice 
coupled with his checkered military and employment records made 
him a poor candidate for release on bail 
but magistrate james francis iv disagreed and ordered mcclease 
released on 100000 unsecured bond prosecutors appealed the 
ruling to kram 
mcclease said during an interview broadcast june 20 on wcbstv 
that sharpton hired him to plant voiceactivated listening devices 
in the home and office of brawley attorney c vernon mason and in 
sharptons own home 
in the televised interview mcclease said the tapes revealed 
that there was no evidence to support the teenagers allegations 
and that the advisers knew this 
he continues playing a game with the grand jury virella 
told the magistrate adding that mcclease had evaded appearing 
before the grand jury until he was granted immunity concerning the 
tapes 
virella did not say if the tapes existed only that the tapes 
turned over last week were blank 
mccleases attorney leonard joy said the move to detain 
mcclease was an example of the annoyance and vindictiveness of 
the government 
the poll meanwhile shows a majority of new yorkers say miss 
brawleys advisers have acted irresponsibly in their handling of 
the case 
in new york city 55 percent of black respondents and 84 percent 
of whites surveyed also said that sharpton along with attorneys 
mason and alton maddox jr are using her case for their personal 
advantages according to the new york timeswcbstv news poll 
among city blacks surveyed 62 percent said miss brawleys 
advisers had acted irresponsibly while 17 percent said they had 
not the remainder said they didnt know or declined to answer 
among whites surveyed in the city 83 percent said the advisers 
had been irresponsible 5 percent disagreed 
the telephone poll of 1131 adults 676 in new york city and 
455 in the wappingers falls poughkeepsie and newburgh area was 
conducted between tuesday and saturday the margin of error was 
plus or minus 4 percentage points for new york city plus or minus 
5 percentage points in the wappingers falls area and plus or minus 
6 percentage points for whites or blacks in the city

a former cia official pleaded innocent tuesday 
to charges he conspired illegally to arm the contra rebels and then 
asserted through his lawyer that he was only following president 
reagans policies 
after joseph f fernandez 51 the agencys former station chief 
in costa rica entered his plea in us district court his 
attorney said he had committed no crime and that his indictment 
sends a chilling message to the nations intelligence agents 
the message tells agents that should you become enmeshed in 
activities involving policies where there may be an absence of 
political harmony at home you may find yourselves upon your return 
to the united states the targets of criminal prosecutions 
defense attorney thomas e wilson said in a statement to reporters 
throughout the time mr fernandez served in costa rica his 
actions were entirely consistent with united states law and with 
the declared policies of the president of the united states 
wilson said 
fernandez who left the cia last year stood in us district 
court when us district judge aubrey e robinson jr asked for his 
plea 
your honor i plead not guilty the bespectacled defendant 
said in a loud firm voice 
fernandez was released on his own recognizance outside the 
courthouse a dozen demonstrators carried signs one of which 
called fernandez an american hero 
law enforcement officials have said fernandez is the first 
former cia station chief to be indicted in connection with his 
duties 
wilson said the charges relate exclusively to his conduct in 
his official capacity as cias chief of station in san jose costa 
rica between 1984 and 1986 as such the indictment is a first in 
the history of the united states 
the attorney called the indictment a tragedy for joe 
fernandez for his wife dale and for their seven children it is 
a tragedy for cia and in the largest sense it is a tragedy for 
this nation 
fernandez is accused of participating in an illegal conspiracy 
to arm the nicaraguan rebels he is named in a fivecount 
indictment charging that he and unidentified coconspirators 
deceitfully and without legal authorization organized a private 
arms supply network for the contras when congress banned such aid 
he also is charged with lying to his superiors to conceal the 
operation 
fernandez also is accused of obstructing an investigation of the 
sale of us weapons to iran and the diversion of profits to the 
contras that was conducted by the presidential commission headed by 
former sen john tower rtexas 
the indictment says fernandez lied to the tower commission last 
year by stating that he did not know for a fact that fired national 
security council aide oliver l north was involved in aiding the 
contras 
each of the charges carries a maximum sentence of five years in 
prison and a 250000 fine 
the charges are the latest stemming from the irancontra affair 
lawrence e walsh the independent counsel investigating the case 
already has charged north former national security adviser john m 
poindexter and arms dealers albert hakim and richard v secord with 
conspiring to divert profits from the arms sales illegally to the 
contras 
president reagan has said he knew nothing about the diversion 
but testimony before congressional panels last year suggested that 
william j casey the cia director at the time was aware of the 
scheme 
laurence shtasel associate independent counsel told reporters 
outside court he could not comment on caseys role in the affair or 
whether other cia officials face indictment 
fernandez who operated in the field under the cover name tomas 
castillo is accused of overseeing the construction of an airstrip 
in northern costa rica that the conspiracy built to help deliver 
arms to the rebels 
the indictment charges that fernandez lied to his superiors 
about the purpose of the airstrip and sent incomplete and 
unresponsive cables to the agency designed to conceal the operation 
after a c123k cargo plane carrying weapons for the contras was 
shot down over nicaragua on oct 5 1986 the indictment says 
fernandez told the congressional irancontra committees that the 
operations were authorized by cia officials but he admitted he 
misled both the tower commission and the cias inspector general 
actions he said he thought were within the guidelines set by 
clair george then the agencys deputy director for operations 
fernandez was one of several cia officers disciplined by cia 
director william webster last year

soviet citizens were alerted by their leader 
tuesday that price increases may be in store along with a change 
in the way farmland is managed as part of his efforts to solve 
chronic food shortages 
in a speech to a national communist party conference at the 
kremlin mikhail s gorbachev said it is necessary to revamp the 
statecontrolled pricing system to bring about the swiftest 
possible saturation of the market with food products 
without price reform we will not be able to achieve concrete 
results in the economy he said 
gorbachev who said last year that bread was so cheap in the 
soviet union that children used loaves to play soocer said it was 
not a normal situation to continue paying out the massive 
government subsidies that keep down the price of food 
it is absolutely necessary to solve this problem no matter how 
difficult this may be gorbachev said without suggesting a date 
for the implementation of price changes 
soviet economists have been talking since at least last year 
about possible price reform as part of gorbachevs program for 
perestroika or economic and social restructuring and many 
soviets feel price increases on such heavily subsidized staples as 
milk bread and meat are in the offing 
gorbachev also said proposals on reform now under deep study 
will be put up for nationwide discussion and that any government 
gains as a result of price reform will be handed back in full to 
the populace he did not say how that would be done 
gorbachev the son of a russian peasant who once was the partys 
chief for agriculture said it was also necessary to change the way 
work is conducted on the vast network of state and collective 
farms which are a perennial sore spot in the soviet economy 
everything depends on how quickly we will make people 
interested and organize the work of collectives on the basis of 
lease and contract on how extensively we will draw the workers in 
agriculture into this process and make the farmer a genuine 
master he said 
gorbachev did not propose an end to state farms where farmers 
have traditionally received a salary similar to those who work in 
factories or offices but he called for a nationwide program to 
permit families to lease farmland from their collectives and till 
the soil themselves which he said experiments had shown resulted 
in dramatically bigger crops

a plant worker mixing chemicals apparently 
released a poisonous gas that killed four people and left 20 others 
injured today at a northeast indiana plating company officials 
said 
it appears like somebody a worker was mixing a couple of 
chemicals and cyanide gas resulted and he or she dropped and then 
somebody came in to help and he dropped it was like a domino 
effect lt ken hollingsworth of the indiana state police said 
bastian plating co vice president dennis fry said four workers 
died and others were taken to dekalb county memorial hospital he 
said the accident occurred at about 5 am 
there was no explosion it was an industrial accident said 
a shaken fry 
he added that he did not know what chemical was involved or how 
many workers were in the plant at the time about 75 workers are 
employed at the factory which produces electroplated chrome auto 
parts 
hollingsworth said the accident involved cyanide poisoning and 
dekalb hospital spokeswoman maryellen schimmoller said about 20 
people were being treated for what she believed was cyanide 
poisoning 
were putting people in quarantine theyre having to be very 
careful with what theyre handling ms schimmoller said 
at least one person was transferred to parkview memorial 
hospital in fort wayne which is about 15 miles south of auburn 
sheryl swingley a spokeswoman for parkview said bastian 
employee craig fogel of auburn whose age was not available was 
unconscious and in very critical condition she said fogel was 
undergoing hyperbaric oxygen therapy to try to pump more oxygen 
into the tissues of his body to offset exposure to poisonous gas 
hollingsworth said an auburn police officer also was 
hospitalized for observation 
trooper bob corkwell a member of the state police hazardous 
materials team said the plant had been evacuated during the 
accident but that the area around the plant had not been evacuated 
we dont believe theres a threat of any other contamination 
in the area corkwell said 
auburn is a community of about 9000 residents about 135 miles 
east of chicago

a salesman at moscows central department store 
took the tv set out of its box tuesday plugged it in and flicked a 
switch the familiar face of mikhail s gorbachev appeared on the 
screen live and in color 
the inaugural images were a test not only of the 1280 
sovietmade set but also symbolically of perestroika the 
restructuring of soviet society gorbachev was promoting in the 
broadcast from the kremlins glassandmarble palace of congresses 
a few blocks away 
the televisions for sale at the downtown store are among the 
consumer products gorbachev complained the soviet union doesnt 
produce enough of or make good enough 
when gorbachev began his address at 1015 am about 50 soviets 
crowded around a dozen sets on display most however quickly lost 
interest and their number dwindled to six one who stayed was 
gennady n sasnovsky a 26yearold construction engineer who was 
passing the time while his wife shopped elsewhere 
we have problems up to here said sasnovsky drawing his 
hand across his throat 
the chief concerns he said involve economics a topic to 
which gorbachev devoted much of the first two hours of his address 
to the 5000 delegates to the nationwide communist party conference 
the tragedy is that the working man lives worse than he who 
sits behind a desk said sasnovsky 
in his speech gorbachev attacked the party and government for 
what he said was its reluctance to reward good workers with higher 
pay and punish bad workers with wage reductions 
some changes are already being made sasnovsky said the 
construction enterprise where he works recently began operating 
under the selffinancing system gorbachev has implemented and that 
he now is eligible for bonuses of up to 40 percent of his monthly 
salary if he does a good job sasnovsky said his regular pay is the 
equivalent of 305 a month 
he said gorbachevs main task is to awaken the people they 
arent used to being active 
asked whether he thought the proposals before this weeks party 
conference would improve things he said i think they are not 
sufficient they should be more radical sharper 
as the conference opened red banners hung from lampposts 
throughout downtown and the stern visage of vladimir i lenin 
founder of the soviet state stared down from buildingtall 
portraits erected for the occasion

mikhail s gorbachev called today for sweeping 
change in the soviet union including creation of a fulltime 
legislature with real power and election of a president with duties 
akin to those of some western heads of state 
he also proposed that farmers be made masters of the land in a 
program that would allow them to lease the soil they till to 
quickly increase production and end chronic food shortages 
it was not immediately clear how the legislative proposals would 
affect the post of communist party general secretary the job that 
makes gorbachev the most powerful man in the country 
gorbachev spoke of an elected president of the supreme soviet 
who would appoint the head of government and oversee foreign and 
defense policy 
addressing the partys first general conference in nearly a 
halfcentury gorbachev also 
called for guaranteeing peoples right to privacy ostensibly 
granted by the 1977 constitution 
served notice the party would not brook organized challenges to 
its authority 
said overhauling the staterun pricing system is absolutely 
necessary to encourage swift saturation of the market with 
highquality foodstuffs many soviets already worry that price 
reform will mean drastically increased food prices 
hours after gorbachev spoke promising freer expression and more 
attention to the soviet unions more than 100 nationalities about 
200 crimean tatars tried to stage a demonstration in downtown 
moscow 
police dragged protesters onto buses and took them away after 
they unfurled banners demanding a return to the homeland taken away 
from them in the 1940s 
a few blocks away police dragged away members of a citizens 
group called the democratic union which advocates a multiparty 
political system of a sort gorbachev said communists could not 
tolerate 
in a 3hour televised speech opening the conference gorbachev 
told the 5000 delegates that farm policy had to be changed 
stopping short of a call for dismantling the soviet unions 
system of collective farms the reformminded gorbachev urged the 
extensive countrywide introduction of a program to permit 
families to lease farmland from their collective and state farms 
and till the soil themselves rather than as part of salaried farm 
brigades 
gorbachev also told the 5000 delegates that reform of stateset 
wholesale and retail prices is absolutely necessary despite 
widespread concern that the cost of food and consumer goods will 
increase drastically 
in a speech occasionally interrupted by brief applause 
gorbachev told the delegates gathered in the kremlins glass and 
marble palace of congresses that his policy of glasnost or 
greater openness does not mean he will tolerate formation of new 
political parties that challenge the rule of the communist party 
nor he said should glasnost be abused by those trying to 
redraw political boundaries an obvious reference to soviet 
armenias efforts to annex a region belonging to the neighboring 
republic of azerbaijan 
rejecting recent calls for more autonomy from delegates 
representing the baltic republics gorbachev said any obsession 
with national isolation can only lead to economic and cultural 
impoverishment 
gorbachev called for an overhaul of the nations legislative 
system to give the supreme soviet and the legislatures of the 15 
soviet republics real power now they generally act as bodies 
approving decisions of the communist party 
the supreme soviet the nominal parliament would become a 
fulltime standing body with fewer than a third of its present 
1500 deputies and members would be elected as early as next 
spring by a new congress of deputies 
the congress would be a new policymaking body similar to the 
existing supreme soviet but expanded to include representatives of 
various workers and special interest groups 
gorbachevs address broadcast live by soviet television and 
radio is expected to be the basis for discussion by the party 
delegates who will meet behind closed doors to consider various 
resolutions setting party policy 
delegates have cautioned against expecting great policy changes 
or shifts in the top party elite at the conference the partys 
first since 1941 but theyve said the forum would seek to redefine 
the role in society of the 20 millionmember ruling party 
gorbachev also told delegates that price reform interpreted as 
meaning substantial price increases is absolutely necessary 
despite widespread concern prices for food and other goods will 
increase drastically 
the soviet leader endorsed experiments that let families farm 
their own land to increase production 
we must overcome the estrangement between the farmer and the 
soil said gorbachev himself the son of a russian peasant and a 
former director of soviet agricultural policy 
soviet analysts have said a dramatic improvement in farm 
production which has resisted traditional communist management 
techniques offers the best chance for quick and noticeable 
improvement in the standard of living 
in the political sphere gorbachev said strict demarcation of 
functions between the party and government organizations are needed 
to ensure the success of his social and economic reforms known as 
perestroika 
one central item on the conferences agenda would limit 
communist officials to two fiveyear terms in one office

the death of a nicaraguan defector who 
publicly accused the sandinista government of murder and drug 
trafficking was the result of natural causes police said today 
dismissing suggestions the man may have been murdered 
an autopsy on jose alvaro baldizon 29 concluded he was killed 
by a burst artery in the brain said sgt william talbott 
detective bureau supervisor in bell the suburb where baldizon 
lived 
a state department official in washington had suggested 
baldizon who told congress in 1986 that the leftist sandinistas 
trafficked in drugs and murdered 2000 political opponents might 
have been poisoned while dining at a nicaraguan restaurant june 18 
he died in his sleep june 18 or early june 19 talbott said the 
detective said many hours passed between baldizons meal at the 
restaurant in huntington beach and his death and that he ate 
dinner with his family the evening of june 18 
state department officials in washington who spoke on condition 
they not be named had said baldizon became ill after eating at a 
nicaraguan restaurant he frequented and said his death had the 
appearances of poisoning the death appeared to have occurred 
under mysterious circumstances the officials said 
nicaraguas government press reported baldizons death and 
blamed the cia state department officials said 
but the los angeles county coroner found the cause of death was 
congenital cerebral aneurysm talbott said 
with everything that hes been involved in people were 
looking at it kind of funny talbott said of the death but 
as far as the criminal end of its concerned theres nothing going 
on 
baldizons sister rosanna declined monday to speculate 
publicly on the cause 
all we know is that he died during the night i cannot comment 
on the cause of his death miss baldizon said we have no proof 
of anything 
in 1986 baldizon testified before congress in an attempt to 
convince lawmakers that additional funding was needed for the 
contras fighting the nicaraguan government 
he claimed among other things that the sandinistas murdered 
2000 political opponents through a systematic policy of special 
measures or assassinations ordered by interior minister tomas 
borge or his chief deputy 
baldizon crossed the border from nicaragua to honduras in july 
1985 and began making allegations of sandinista atrocities and drug 
trafficking 
he claimed sandinista army units dressed like the contras and 
killed sandinista supporters so that the rebels would be blamed he 
presented no specific evidence as to when or where such actions

espionage

force in march 1986 that borge had issued in 1982 an order that 
all cocaine dollars and gold had to be turned in to his office

dollars were being sent to places not provided for by law and those 
involved were being set free he told the task force 
baldizons allegations were disputed by americas watch a us 
human rights group that said he had repeatedly changed his stories

two governors on tuesday urged congress to 
pass a major child care expansion bill this year even if a tight 
budget means lawmakers cannot fund the entire 25 billion plan 
anything you give ill be grateful for arkanas gov bill 
clinton a democrat said dont pass nothing just because you 
cant get as much money as you want 
whatever way you can help us we need that help added new 
jersey gov thomas kean a republican whatever money you give us 
will be put to extraordinarily good use 
clinton and kean testified before the senate labor and human 
resources subcommittee on children family drugs and alcoholism as 
the panel considered the 25 billion act for better child care or 
abc bill the measure is sponsored by subcommittee chairman 
christopher dodd dconn and supported by womens labor medical 
and childrens groups 
threefourths of the abc money would help pay day care expenses 
for families making less than 115 percent of a states median 
income the remaining money would be for training and salaries of 
child care workers renovation of facilities and referral programs 
for parents 
money would only be available to day care homes and centers that 
met minimum federal standards developed by an advisory panel 
supporters of the bill have been pursuing an allornothing 
strategy saying no child care bill would be better than a weak 
one dodd has said he would rather hold the bill for the next 
administration than pass a plan he considers inadequate 
however dodd on tuesday referred to a national crescendo of 
support for federal action on child care and indicated 
congressional action may be imminent we dont have a lot of time 
here dodd said theres a moment for these kinds of things and 
then other things will take over 
sen tom harkin diowa a member of the senate appropriations 
committee said lawmakers would not be able to get 25 billion for 
the child care bill clinton said a good framework and a little 
money would suffice for this year 
clinton and kean asked dodd to reexamine a number of 
controversial sections of his bill echoing criticism by 
conservative groups and lawmakers they said the bill makes 
daycare aid available to too many families at the higher end of 
the income scale and asked dodd to reconsider eligibility standards 
the governors also said the private sector in day care should be 
stressed more strongly that there should be more flexibility in 
using the money possibly through a broad child care block grant 
and asked dodd to delete the provision imposing national daycare 
standards on states 
congress should resist the temptation to tell the states what 
should be done and how they should do it kean said uniform 
regulations would not account for differing regional needs 
but dodd said the governors would be shocked to find the 
tremendous disparity in standards from state to state and cited a 
review by deborah phillips a university of virginia researcher 
in her testimony phillips said 28 states have no group size 
requirements for child care centers 28 states have no training or 
experience requirements for family day care providers and 
stafftoinfant ratios vary from 7to1 in georgia and north 
carolina to 3to1 in kansas massachusetts and maryland 
we would never want you to give us a lot of money to pour it 
into dangerous unhealthy unsound day care clinton told dodd 
he said a compromise might be to require the development of model 
child care standards with state and local officials included in 
the process 
some 100 child care bills are pending in congress ranging from 
tax credits to businesses that establish child care centers to tax 
credits to all families with preschool children one bill would 
increase the existing social services block grant and another would 
limit provider liability through risk pools others propose to give 
vouchers to poor families andor money to day care providers for 
capital improvements

the reagan administration announced today it 
is recalling the us ambassador to mexico for consultations in the 
wake of mexicos decision to release a jailed puerto rican 
nationalist wanted by the united states for terrorist activities 
the recall of ambassador charles j pilliod was announced by 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater the state department had 
expressed outrage monday at news that william morales 37 was 
released from prison friday and allowed to flee to cuba 
the release and deportation to cuba of morales even before 
completing his sentence for murdering a mexican police officer is 
outrageous fitzwater said this decision is an inexplicable 
affront to otherwise excellent usmexican relations and a great 
blow to us and mexican efforts to combat the scourge of 
international terrorism 
fitzwater said the state department had summoned the mexican 
ambassador to the united states jorge espinosa de los rayes on 
monday night and expressed our anger over the release of this 
convicted terrorist 
morales had served five years of an eightyear sentence for the 
murder of a mexican policeman 
mexicos action is inexplicable said state department 
spokesman charles redman mr morales violent history is well 
known he is an escaped american prioner 
he was convicted in the united states of serious weapons 
possession charges and was implicated in over 50 bombings by a 
puerto rican separatist group which from 1976 to 1978 resulted in 
the death and injury of many individuals 
redman described as outrageous mexicos decision not to 
extradite morales to the united states because he is a political 
fighter that action undercuts the fight against terrorism by 
legal means he said 
he added that mexicos decision could only have been made for 
political reasons because the mexican foreign ministry had reversed 
a finding by a mexican court that morales should be extradited

the reagan administration on tuesday urged 
speedy senate ratification of two treaties negotiated in the 
aftermath of the explosion at the chernobyl nuclear power plant in 
the soviet union which spread nuclear contamination across western 
europe 
one treaty requires prompt notification of a nuclear disaster 
which has the potential of affecting other nations the second sets 
up a system for providing assistance after a nuclear accident 
frederick m bernthal assistant secretary of state for 
scientific affairs told the senate foreign relations committee the 
objective of the pacts is to minimize the radiological 
consequences of a nuclear accident should one occur 
he said the treaties stem from the international concern over 
the failure of the soviet union to notify the rest of the world 
in a timely manner after the accident at chernobyl 
the treaties were drafted in a fourweek period in the summer of 
1986 by a conference of 62 nations meeting in vienna 
the notification treaty covers accidents at nuclear reactors 
nuclear fuel cycle facilities and radioactive waste management 
facilities 
it also covers accidents involving the transport and storage of 
nuclear fuels or radioactive waste as well as radioisotopes used to 
generate power in space objects of any kind 
accidents involving nuclear weapons are not covered by the 
treaty but a provision does encourage nations to volunteer 
information on nuclear weapons accidents 
the united states has pledged to voluntarily provide 
notification on any nuclear accident including accidents 
involving nuclear weapons 
the second treaty provides guidelines on the provision of 
technical assistance to minimize the effects of nuclear accidents 
while it does not require any country to provide such 
assistance it does require a prompt response to requests for such 
help 
the administration also asked ratification of a third treaty 
intended to protect a western seat on the board of governors of the 
international atomic energy agency 
bernthal said the change became necessary when the peoples 
republic of china became a member of the international atomic 
energy agency and claimed a seat on the board of directors 
bernthal said chinas inclusion on the board of governors could 
have put a western seat at risk 
it is important to us national security not to dilute 
western influence on the iaea board bernthal said 
the treaty would expand the number of seats on the board by one 
and would put all countries back in their starting position 
bernthal said in short ratification of this amendment will 
protect a western seat

former un ambassador jeane j kirkpatrick 
picked tuesday as a featured speaker for the republican national 
convention praised george bush although she had campaigned against 
him earlier and faulted democrat michael dukakis for lacking 
foreign policy experience 
dukakis shortcoming she suggested was partly due to the fact 
that massachusetts is a lot further from any foreign borders 
than california where ronald reagan was governor before running 
for president 
kirkpatrick who endorsed senate republican leader bob dole for 
president during the primaries spoke highly of bush on tuesday 
especially in comparison with dukakis 
i believe he understands a very great deal more about foreign 
policy than michael dukakis does she told reporters in a news 
conference at the republican national committee i dont know 
michael dukakis personally but we all know that he has had no 
opportunity in his life to really devote himself to foreign 
affairs he has been concerned above all with local and state 
affairs and george bush has been concerned with the world 
kirpatrick who was once active in the democratic party gave a 
wellreceived speech at the 1984 republican convention 
rnc chairman frank j fahrenkopf jr said there was no link 
between the kirkpatrick announcement and the democrats choice on 
monday of texas treasurer ann richards as their convention keynote 
speaker fahrenkopf said the gop keynoter would be announced in the 
next few days 
kirkpatrick was asked why she thinks ronald reagan had more 
foreign policy experience when he took office in 1981 after two 
terms as governor of california than dukakis 
i believe he did in several ways she said first of 
all ronald regan had a very active interest in foreign policy 
through decades of his life that interest is a matter of record 
it was supplemented by quite a lot of traveling and speaking for 
the united states in foreign countries the first time i ever saw 
ronald reagan was in tokyo in the mid70s 
as governor of california he had developed a very lively 
interest in relations with mexico and central america the first 
conversations i ever had with ronald reagan were about usmexican 
and central american relations 
then she went on 
you know massachusetts is a lot further from any foreign 
borders from troublesome foreign borders than california i 
dont think dukakis background shows the same kind of persistent 
concern either with foreign travel or foreign experience that 
ronald reagan did 
kirkpatricks news conference opened with her being asked about 
comments attributed to her in a party press release 
may i just say nobody writes for me i mean that quite 
seriously i write my own things she said 
then a reporter read aloud the release which said dukakis 
statements on foreign policy have been irresponsible and naive 
asked if those were in line with here own thoughts she replied 
im afraid so i regret thats what i think i believe that 
dukakis lacks the experience in foreign affairs and foreign policy 
and national security that a president of united states badly needs 
at this time 
she said bushs experience is great enough to give his vision 
of a strong america content he knows what will make us 
strong

just as farm equipment manufacturers 
were beginning to enjoy a rebound from an eightyear slump the 
drought is turning customers cautious and cooling off the recovery 
farmers who had been sizing up tractors and harvesting equipment 
have put off purchases while they wait to see if their crop will be 
saved by rain said bill hassenfritz an owner of hassenfritz inc 
a farm equipment dealer in the the southeastern iowa town of 
mediapolis 
the attitude of farmers was really quite high he said i 
cant say the drought has completely blown that but it has put 
it on hold 
so far hassenfritz said no orders have been canceled although 
hes heard that some dealers have lost sales to drought worries 
duane hawbaker parts manager at rampm equipment co at indianola 
south of des moines said farmers not only have held off new 
investments but some also are putting off repairs on equipment for 
fall harvests 
its a very critical year to have that uncertainty show up 
said doug patterson market information manager for massey ferguson 
inc a manufacturer in des moines 
at deere amp co in moline ill spokesman bob combs said the 
manufacturer is watching the situation closely but its premature 
to gauge the droughts impact on the industry a little bit of 
rain soon could change things combs said 
before the drought the farm equipment industry was showing 
significant gains from a severe slump 
the farm debt crisis of the early 1980s and the ailing 
agricultural economy had dealt a hard blow to manufacturers of farm 
equipment resulting in layoffs retrenchments and consolidations 
throughout the industry 
but a recovery in farm fortunes in the past two years has 
allowed farmers to reduce debts and make longpostponed purchases 
of equipment 
the federal reserve bank of chicago reported conditions for farm 
equipment sales were brightening in the first quarter of 1988 
extending gains made in the second half of 1987 
there were sharp gains in retail sales of farm equipment and 
even indications that tight supplies may have hindered some sales 
sales in the first quarter of farm tractors with 40 horsepower 
or more jumped more than 60 percent from a year earlier with sales 
more than doubling of fourwheel drive tractors according to the 
report by chicago fed economist peter heffernan 
patterson said that even with the gains sales of big tractors 
still are 75 percent to 80 percent below peak levels 
then the drought hit 
in the near term it will mean a significant slide backwards 
with respect to farm equipment sales said george dahlman an 
analyst who follows the farm equipment industry for the minneapolis 
securities firm of piper jaffrey amp hopwood inc 
farmers remembered they are only two years into the recovery 
and not over liquid he said those expenditures that dont 
have to be made wont be made 
dahlman said he expects the cautious attitude to remain for 
another six to eight months but while the drought comes at a bad 
time for the industry he said he does not believe it will push 
manufacturers into bankruptcy 
farmers are keeping a stiff upper lip and we are too said 
rick james a spokesman for manufacturer j i case co at racine 
wis some dealers say customers have delayed delivery on units 
they have purchased but this is spotty were not seeing it 
everywhere 
james said there could be a silver lining for manufacturers 
he said farmers who remain in good financial condition after the 
farm downturn of the 1980s are survivors 
as they look toward next year and look to recoup their losses 
from this year they will put more acres under the plow and that 
could potentially create a demand for equipment james said 
spokesman glen christians at massey ferguson said the 
manufacturer that reaps the rewards this fall will be the one who 
targets those farmers who come out of the drought the best

a top official of angolas marxist government 
on tuesday ruled out talks with usbacked rebels and said 
oneparty rule for his homeland is the best assurance for national 
development 
minister of state pedro de castro vandunem told reporters that 
multiparty democracy has failed elsewhere in africa and would not 
enable angola to fulfill the goal of achieving a national identity 
he said the solution for angola is for the unita rebels who 
have waged war against the countrys leftist government for 13 
years to lay down their arms and participate in national 
reconstruction 
vandunem who was accompanied by two other senior angolan 
officials met with reporters as unita leader jonas savimbi was on 
the second day of a washington visit aimed at rallying support for 
national reconciliation talks between the warring parties savimbi 
was to meet late tuesday with secretary of state george p shultz 
last week officials from the united states angola cuba and 
south africa met for a second time in six weeks to discuss the 
possibility of a peaceful settlement in angola 
south africa along with the united states supports savimbis 
movement with military equipment and other items south africa sent 
several thousand troops to angola last year some have been 
withdrawn and an undetermined number remain 
vandunem said angolan authorities are willing to talk to south 
africa but not to savimbis envoys because they are not the 
masters of their own interests 
angolan justice minister fernando franca vandunem said he views 
the unita insurgents as ancilliary forces of south africa at 
another point he said that from the beginning savimbi has 
always appeared as a man sent by somebody else 
the reagan administration has been supporting savimbi since 
1985 seeing him as an ally in its quest to encourage the removal 
of more than 40000 cuban troops based in angola 
the administration also supports the concept of bringing an end 
to the fighting in angola through national reconciliation talks 
but the angolan representatives expressed strong opposition to 
achieving a peaceful settlement through an electoral process 
vandunem the justice minister acknowledged that the angolan 
president is not the product of an electoral process but said the 
country does elect representatives at the provincial and municipal 
levels some candidates he added are not members of the ruling 
mpla party 
his colleague the minister of state said it is not the policy 
of the angolan government to smash unita once peace is achieved 
we do not identify with the objectives of unita which are to 
liquidate the people of angola he said

swiss roman catholics began three days of fasting 
and prayer for unity of faith tuesday before a scheduled 
consecration of rebel bishops that would formalize the first major 
split in the church since 1870 
archbishop marcel lefebvre who began campaigning against the 
satanic influence of liberalism in the church after the second 
vatican council reforms of the 1960s plans to consecrate the four 
bishops thursday at his seminary in econe switzerland 
only the pope can name bishops and the vatican has told 
lefebvre 82 that consecrating the traditionalist bishops without 
approval will mean automatic excommunication ejection from the 
church for all involved 
lefebvres traditionalist movement argues that canon law allows 
disobedience to papal authority in a situation of emergency 
the archbishop himself has dismissed the threat of excommunication 
as without value 
excommunication would create the first schism in the roman 
catholic church since old catholics broke with rome over the 
doctrine of papal infallibility proclaimed by the first vatican 
council in 1870 
the call to pray for unity of faith among catholics was 
issued by bishop henri schwery of sion president of the swiss 
conference of bishops his diocese includes lefebvres first 
traditionalist seminary at econe where the consecrations are to 
be conducted in a huge tent already erected in front of the 
buidling 
switzerlands bishops urged prayers for unity at this very 
difficult moment hanspeter roethlin spokesman for the bishops 
conference said special services were being held in nearly all 
parts of switzerland which counts about 3 milloin roman catholics 
among its 63 million people 
although we must not give up hope that lefebvre will abandon 
his plans the prayers are chiefly meant to increase awareness of 
the importance of church unity roethlin said in an interview 
a west german newspaper quoted a leading member of the 
traditionalist movement tuesday as expressing certainty more talks 
will be held with the vatican after the consecrations 
it is only a matter of time until we sit down together 
again the rev franz schmidberger was quoted as saying in an 
interview with the newspaper die welt 
until then our position will not change he added in an 
apparent reference to automatic excommunication 
in the sion diocese the faithful were urged to pray and fast 
until noon thursday about the time the econe ceremonies are 
expected to end 
lefebvre says consecrations are necessary to ensure continuity 
of the traditionalist movement after his death he has said it 
would be orphaned without bishops to ordain traditionalist 
priests 
assisting him at the ceremony will be an 84yearold former 
brazilian bishop antonio de castro mayer of campos the only one 
of more than 2000 bishops of the church to lend public support to 
lefebvres 18yearold campaign against church reforms 
lefebvre says the reforms of the second vatican council which 
met from 1962 to 1965 put the church on a course of 
autodestruction by introducing modern rites in the vernacular 
and intruducing other modernist elements 
his campaign caused pope paul vi to order his suspension from 
priestly and episcopal functions in 1976 which barred him from 
celebrating mass or giving the sacraments 
he ignores the ban as illegal continuing to ordain new 
priests and open new seminaries and other traditionalist centers 
throughout the world his followers use the tridentine mass a 
traditional latin rite for which permission is required 
on wednesday the day before the consecrations lefebvre plans 
to ordain 16 new traditionalist priests bringing the total to more 
than 220 
his movement claims millions of followers but vatican spokesman 
joaquin navarro extimates the number at 6000080000 a petition 
circulated two years ago urging the vatican to lift sanctions 
against lefebvre obtained 135000 signatures 
the four bishops to be consecrated are richard williamson 48 
who was born in britain and heads the traditionalist seminary in 
ridgefield conn bernard tissier de mallerais 43 executive 
director of lefebvres movement alfonso de galarreta 31 
spanishborn head of the seminary in argentina and bernard fellay 
30 a swiss who is the movements chief administrator

endorsed the recommendation of a federal advisory commission on 
aids for a law barring discrimination against people suffering from 
the deadly virus 
i think it is needed bush said less than 24 hours after

i think it is important to do a lot to lay to rest some of the 
fears there is a lot of misunderstanding bush said

out ahead of reagan who did not comment on the recommendations 
instead reagan directed his drug policy adviser dr ian 
macdonald to come up within 30 days with a course of action that 
takes us forward 
bush said reagan did the right thing how can the white 
house be asked to take an instant position 
when it was pointed out that bush was doing just that the vice 
president said reagan just saw this thing yesterday hes not 
running for president maybe he wasnt asked the question either 
bush certain to be the republican presidential nominee said

california

two omaha indians their eyes filled 
with tears became the first members of their tribe in 100 years to 
touch the sacred pole of the omaha tribe 
this occasion is very significant to me because my 
greatgreatgrandfather yellow smoke was the keeper of the sacred 
pole doran morris chairman of the omaha tribal council said at 
the ceremony at harvard university 
he and edward cline tribal planner for the omahas came from 
nebraska to harvards peabody museum to touch the pole monday and 
negotiate for its return 
morris said the pole is about 200 years old and was entrusted to 
the peabody by yellow smoke because he did not believe the younger 
generation of omahas would cherish it 
the pole more than five feet long is made of cottonwood and 
ash a human scalp is at one end 
i have been talking to my people and they feel we need to 
bring the sacred pole home to unite us as a tribe morris said 
it is the consensus of our people both the young and the old 
he said there are about 5000 people in the tribe 2400 of them 
on the reservation 
this pole is a living tree a living person as far as we are 
concerned cline said it was there for the people to see to 
be part of to touch and to keep the tribe together 
the object embodies so much of the soul of the omaha said 
ian w brown the peabodys associate curator of north american 
collections it represents the authority of their leaders the 
unity between man and woman and the binding element that has held 
the omaha people together for centuries

luxury automaker rollsroyce may like to carry 
its passengers in style over the highways of life but it doesnt 
want people to mistakenly think it takes family pets into the 
hereafter 
the british company is challenging a logo used by a company that 
makes caskets and burial kits for pets 
rollsroyce has filed documents with the us patent office in 
washington alleging that pet rest inc owned by mike and sandy 
mccormack has adopted a logo confusingly close to its own 
pet rests logo includes a capital p and an interlocking capital 
r rollsroyce said it has used two interlocking capital rs to 
identify its company since 1925 
literally i sat down with a tablet and drew variations of the 
letters p and r sidebyside up and down and interlocking 
mccormack said we tried to find any way that the letters could 
work well together in a logo it was by chance that we selected the 
one we use today 
the mccormacks founded their business three years ago in lima 
about 75 south of toledo mrs mccormack said the burial kits 
include satinlined burial capsules suggestions for a memorial 
service and even grief counseling prices range from 80 to 1499 
and kits can accommodate pets as large as a doberman pinscher 
the company could gross up to 1 million this year the 
mccormacks said 
mrs mccormack learned of the challenge from rollsroyce this 
month by registered letter 
it was very surprising she said we were just astounded 
that anyone could confuse a rollsroyce product with a pet rest 
product 
she said the pr logo is not stamped on the burial kits but is 
used on boxes and in advertising 
attorneys for rollsroyce declined to comment but in documents 
filed with the appeals board the attorneys argue that the 
similarity of the trademarks might give rise to a mistaken belief 
that pet rests products originate from or are sponsored by 
rollsroyce 
the mccormacks plan to fight at least for now 
rather than come on with a lawsuit against a small company 
like ours theyll just fight the trademark year after year with 
the hope that after five years and perhaps 25000 if we can even 
afford to drag it on that long we will give up mrs mccormack 
said

secretary of state george shultzs trip to 
central america this week will have the primary purpose of 
shoring up the four democracies in the region by demonstrating 
longterm us support according to congressional leaders who met 
with shultz on tuesday 
during a 1hour breakfast with house speaker jim wright house 
minority leader robert michel and other leaders shultz made no 
mention of renewing military aid to the contra rebels fighting 
nicaraguas leftist sandinista government participants said 
he says what he really wants to do is to shore up and 
reinforce our commitment to the success of the four democratic 
countries in the region said wright dtexas the speaker called 
the discussion a sign of a shift in emphasis by the 
administration 
theres a presumption that he wouldnt be doing this unless 
there were a reason some change in policy some thought as to 
where theyre going said one democratic leadership aide 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
shultz leaves wednesday for a threeday trip to guatemala el 
salvador honduras and costa rica he does not plan to visit 
nicaragua where talks between the sandinista government and the 
usbacked rebels remain stalled 
one participant speaking on condition of anonymity said shultz 
told the leaders this is not a contra aid trip this is a peace 
and democracy trip 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater conceded that the 
us push to democratize nicaragua has stalled and said further 
decisions on strategy must await completion of shultzs trip to 
central america 
amid increasing reports that contra troops are returning to 
their base camps inside nicaragua and with no new peace talks 
scheduled fitzwater was asked whether reagan had decided to submit 
a new aid package to congress 
we will not have any judgment on the package until sometime 
after shultz returns from the region on friday he replied and 
we dont have a specific schedule even on that 
wright who has been the chief opponent of administration 
efforts to send weapons to the antisandinista rebels said shultz 
appeared to recognize that congress is in no mood to vote further 
military aid 
maybe rather than trying to send more weapons it might be 
mroe useful to make a convincing demonstration of our longterm 
support of democracy in those countries that practice it wright 
said 
michel rill acknowledged there was no current sentiment in 
congress for a renewal of military aid but he said there was a 
need to do something to put the talks back on track and to put 
the contras in a better position thats a congressional 
responsibility 
he said during the meeting shultz showed an interest in 
multilateral talks that would include all central american 
countries including nicaragua and could lead to regional 
nonaggression treaties and the expulsion of foreign military 
advisers from nicaragua 
there was also some discussion about the possibility of a 
regional economc aid package that could serve as an added 
enticement for the sandinistas to conclude a peace accord and make 
democratic reforms participants said 
rep david bonior dmich said shultz told the bipartisan 
leadership group that the rebels are interested in resuming the 
peace talks that broke off earlier this month but do not want to 
hold the talks in the nicaraguan capital of managua

here are excerpts from soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachevs address tuesday to the communist party conference as 
translated by the soviet government 
on farming 
some advances are on hand but they cannot satisfy us in 
substance the increase we have achieved in food output has largely 
been used to cover the demand connected with the growth of the 
population and that comrades means that we need other still 
higher rates of building up food resources we have neither the 
moral nor the political right to tolerate the delay in resolving 
the food problem 
we must restore the economic balance between town and 
countryside and release to the utmost the potential of collective 
and state farms by promoting diverse contractual and lease 
arrangements we must overcome the estrangement between farmer and 
soil we must make the farmer sovereign master protect him against 
command methods and cardinally change the conditions of life in 
villages that is the only way to rapidly heighten the efficiency 
of the agroindustrial sector and to secure a radical improvement 
in food supplies across the country 
on price increases 
the pricing reform cannot fail to affect retail prices as 
well because they are closely connected with the system of prices 
as a whole today the retail price of many food products notably 
that of meat and milk is considerably lower than the actual cost 
of producing them lower than the states procurement price 
the state is compelled to cover this difference in the form of a 
subsidy to the consumer that is not a normal situation it 
undermines the incentives for producing these products and gives 
rise to a wasteful attitude especially towards bread 
on human rights 
i would like to dwell particularly on the political freedoms 
that enable a person to express his opinion on any matter the 
implementation of these freedoms is a real guarantee that any 
problem of public interest will be discussed from every angle and 
all the pros and cons will be weighed and that this will help to 
find optimal solutions with due consideration for all the diverse 
opinions and actually possibilities 
in short comrades what we are talking about is a new role of 
public opinion in the country and there is no need to fear the 
novel unconventional character of some opinions there is no need 
to overreact and lapse into extremes at every turn of the debates 
i also want to touch upon such a fundamental matter as freedom 
of conscience which is very much in the public eye just now in 
connection with the millennium of the introduction of christianity 
in russia we do not conceal our attitude to the religious outlook 
as being nonmaterialistic and unscientific but this is no reason 
for a disrespectful attitude to the spiritualmindedness of the 
believer still less for applying any administrative pressure to 
assert materialistic views 
lenins decree on the separation of the church from the state 
and schools from the church adopted 70 years ago provided a new 
basis for the relations between them it is known that these 
relations have not always developed normally 
all believers irrespective of the religion they profess are 
fullfledged citizens of the ussr 
our entire legal system is designed to guarantee strict 
observance of the rights of citizens to the inviolability of their 
private life home the secrecy of telephone communication postal 
and telegraph correspondence the law must reliably protect a 
persons dignity 
as you know we have lately more than once encountered attempts 
to use democratic rights for undemocratic purposes there are some 
who think that in this way any problems can be solved from 
redrawing boundaries to setting up opposition parties the cpsu 
central committee considers that such absues of democratization are 
fundamentally at variance with the aims of perestroika and run 
counter to the peoples interests 
on government organization 
we should organize state power and government so that the 
people would always have the final say and the processes of 
selfregulation and selfgovernment would be given the widest 
possible scope of fundamental importance here is the proper 
distribution of authority of powers between the principal elements 
of our political system first and foremost between the party and 
the state 
it is also time we introduced a number of democratic 
restrictions on the duration of service in elective offices our 
past record shows that the absence of these restrictions was a 
prime cause of abuses of power both centrally and locally

a teamster organizer accused of accepting a 
bribe from an fbi agent posing as a hollywood producer who wanted 
to make a nonunion movie has pleaded guilty to misdemeanor 
conspiracy 
russell j masetta of teamsters local 848 in el monte who was 
originally indicted on a felony charge entered his plea monday 
the government said it would recommend a maximum sixmonth 
sentence but us district judge william d keller said masetta 
can withdraw the plea if he is sentenced to serve any time in jail 
in addition to a period of probation 
masettas attorney richard beck said he expects keller to look 
at his client as a family man with no prior convictions 
masetta admitted he conspired with a reputed mafia captain to 
accept about 1000 from the undercover fbi agent he believed to be 
a film producer 
in exchange for the money masetta allegedly promised the 
producer initially that the union would not try to organize workers 
on the production said richard a stavin a special attorney for 
the justice departments organized crime strike force in los 
angeles 
masetta accepted about 200 before backing out of the deal 
stavin said 
he was charged in the conspiracy case with luigi gelfuso jr 
who has been described by prosecutors as a reputed mafia captain 
gelfuso has denied any connection with organized crime as has 
masetta 
masetta was originally indicted on a felony extortion conspiracy 
charge alleging that he and gelfuso planned to take 25000 from 
the film producer 
the governments key witness died of cancer though and the 
charge was reduced to a misdemeanor through a plea bargain 
masettas plea was entered one day before the federal government 
charged that the international brotherhood of teamsters is 
dominated by organized crime and filed a civil suit in new york to 
force free elections and other reforms in the nations largest 
union

the us military attache in greece was 
killed today on the street where he lived by a bomb in a parked car 
that blew his armorplated car off the road as he drove to work 
the pentagon confirmed the attack and identified him as navy 
capt william e nordeen 
the officer was 100 yards from his home when the blast hurled 
his car across the small treelined street and lodged it in a steel 
fence a police spokesman said on condition of anonymity 
the victims decapitated body was found a few yards away in the 
front yard of an abandoned house 
there was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast 
but senior police officials said they believed it to be the work of 
november 17 a leftwing urban terrorist group 
in washington chief pentagon spokesman dan howard confirmed 
nordeens identity and condemned his murder as a cowardly act 
the united states condemns this terrorist outrage in the 
strongest possible terms howard said it was a senseless and 
cowardly murder of a highly regarded us military officer 
the spokesman said the us government had received no claims of 
responsibility for the assassination and at this point we dont 
know who is responsible 
howard said nordeen was serving as the us defense attache as 
well as the naval attache to greece the 51yearold officer was 
born in amery wis but listed his us home in centuria wis the 
us navy said he is survived by a wife and daughter howard said 
according to a service biography released by howard nordeen 
moved to athens for the job in august 1985 trained originally as a 
navy helicopter pilot nordeen most recently worked on the staff of 
the naval inspector general from june 1983 to april 1984 then 
transferred as a student to the defense intelligence agency for 
training to become an attache 
the explosion occurred at 806 am 106 am edt in the 
northern athens suburb of kifissia where many american and foreign 
diplomats live 
trees fences gates and walls in the area around the explosion 
were blackened by smoke after fire engulfed both cars 
we heard a tremendous bang and my house rocked back and 
forth i have never seen such destruction in my life panorghia 
kapodistria told the associated press 
the windows exploded inward and even pieces of the car were 
thrown into my house my husband was hit in the face by the 
glass she said standing in her front yard with the 
boobytrapped cars mangled rear axle 
her husband yiannis kapodistria 84 was taken to a nearby 
hospital and treated for facial cuts the boobytrapped car which 
exploded in front their home was destroyed in the blast 
large body panels from both automobiles were strewn in a 50yard 
radius 
police bomb experts said the device was detonated by some kind 
of remotecontrol radio device they said the bomb was apparently 
planted in the trunk of a japanese subcompact 
an witness who spoke on condition of anonymity told police he 
saw two men on a motorcycle drive away shortly after the explosion 
the november 17 terrorist group carried out a similar attack 
against the us drug enforcement agencys local chief in january 
but george carros survived after the radiocontrolled bomb n a 
trash can outside his home failed to go off 
although november 17 has used a 45caliber pistol in most of 
its slayings it said at the time that it had planted the bomb 
outside carros home because his car was armorplated and difficult 
to attack with a pistol 
the group has claimed responsibility for 11 assassinations since 
1975 including the 1983 shooting of us navy capt george tsantes 
and the 1975 assassination of richard welch cia station chief in 
athens 
november 17 is named for the day in 1973 when troops crushed a

negotiators ended a seventh round of talks on a new us bases 
agreement to replace an accord that expires dec 31 1988 
the talks ended without reports of significant progress 
greek government spokesman sotiris kostopoulos condemned the 
killing saying that the government expresses its disgust for the 
murder here of the american military and naval attache william 
nordeen

unreservedly condemn the wouldbe underminers of the countrys 
institutions and democratic normality kostopoulos told reporters

the most important step the navy can take to 
reduce plastic pollution of the ocean is to reduce the amount of 
plastic going aboard its ships in food and other packaging a panel 
of navy environmentalist and animal welfare representatives said 
tuesday 
the navy already has begun to carry out some recommendations and 
has canceled orders for 11 million small plastic bags for use in 
carrying purchases away from ships stores the committee said 
the committee was organized last year by the keystone center a 
group of environmental mediators based in keystone colo in 
anticipation of legisation passed later to implement an 
international agreement to end disposal of plastic trash at sea 
environmentalists increasingly are concerned over the killing of 
birds fish and marine mammals by longlasting plastics such as 
sixpack rings that are eaten by or entangle sea creatures 
we are trying to reverse a tradition of millennia of trash 
disposal at sea said rep gerry studds dmass at the news 
conference where the recommendations were presented 
the navys initial position was that it couldnt possibly 
comply that it would take at least 20 years said studds who is 
chairman of the fisheries wildlife conservation and environment 
subcommittee of the house merchant marine and fisheries committee 
the keystone committee said such skepticism was quickly turned 
into enthusiastic cooperation largely as a result of the work of 
nancy stehle deputy director for the environment in the office of 
the assistant secretary of the navy for shipbuilding and logistics 
she set the example and established the tone we all needed for 
frankness and openness she focused our attention on helping the 
navy solve the problem the committee said 
warships pose a particular problem because space aboard them is 
very limited 
the recommendations call for reducing the plastics carried 
because that would greatly reduce the need for expensive 
technologies intended to facilitate storage and disposal 
the committee said the navy should review specifications for 
food and other items to buy them in degradable nonplastic 
packaging whereever possible support development of compactors and 
degradable plastics unload unnecessary plastics before leaving 
port and separate plastics for carriage home before disposing of 
other trash at sea 
in addition to representatives of the navy congressional staffs 
and the keystone center the committee had members from the 
american cetacean society the animal protection institute of 
america the oceanic society defenders of wildlife the center for 
environmental education the texas environmental coalition the 
national fish and wildlife foundation the monitor consoritum and 
greenpeace 
the navy must report to congress in three years on its progress 
in complying with the international agreement on plastic disposal 
after five years

pope john paul ii installed 24 cardinals 
tuesday offered them as symbols of church unity and urged 
followers of rebel french archbishop marcel lefebvre not to break 
with the papacy 
lefebvre plans to consecrate four traditionalist bishops 
thursday without papal permission which the vatican has said will 
result in automatic excommunication of those involved john paul 
says a schism in the roman catholic church the first since 1870 
appears inevitable 
the church crisis cast a shadow over the otherwise joyous 
ceremony of conferring red hats on the new princes of the 
church who include two us archbishops james hickey of 
washington dc and edmund szoka of detroit 
prelates from lithuania and hong kong also were in the group 
indicating the pontiffs desire to expand church influence in the 
soviet union and china 
without mentioning lefebvre by name john paul said we are 
very saddened by the news that one of our brothers in the 
episcopate who for several years has withheld the required 
obedience to the holy see will soon proceed with the ordination 
of bishops without the apostolic mandate and will thus break the 
unity of the church drawing with him large numbers of his 
followers into a dangerous situation of schism 
he said lefebvre who plans to consecrate the biships at his 
seminary in econe switzerland had appeared ready for a 
settlement but now it seems that the decision of our brother can 
no longer be reversed 
referring to followers of the 82yearold traditionalist john 
paul said we pray and exhort them with all our heart to remain 
in the house of the father and to understand that every truth of 
faith and every correct way of living finds its place in the 
church 
lefebvre who rejects many reforms of the 196265 second vatican 
council was suspended from priestly duties in 1976 by pope paul vi 
but has ordained more than 200 priests since then in defiance of 
the vatican 
a compromise reached by the two sides last month fell through 
and lefebvre said he would go ahead with the consecration he says 
traditionalist bishops are necessary to ensure the continuity of 
his movement after he dies 
the last schism in the church occurred in 1870 when the old 
catholics broke with rome after the first vatican council 
proclaimed papal infallibility 
john paul made his comments tuesday to 58 cardinals who held a 
closed meeting in the frescoed consistory hall of the apostolic 
palace to give formal approval to the new cardinals the remarks 
in latin were released by the vatican 
after the private ceremony cardinal agostino casaroli the 
vatican secretary of state read the 24 names to an audience of 
about 10000 in the paul vi auditorium each new cardinal wore a 
crimson cassock and gold cross 
the pope wearing a goldembroidered red cape over white robes 
entered and sat in a highbacked beige chair at the center of the 
stage one by one the new cardinals climbed the steps and knelt 
before john paul who placed on their heads the threecornered hat 
known as a biretta 
speaking in italian the pontiff said the hat signifies that 
you should be ready to comport yourselves with strength up to the 
point of spilling blood for the growth of the christian faith for 
peace and tranquility of the people of god and for the freedom and 
the spread of the holy roman church 
he frequently stressed christian unity both in the remarks to 
the meeting of cardinals and his public address at the elevation 
noting the diversity of the 24 prelates who represent 17 
countries and five continents he stressed the common roots of 
the college of cardinals constituted by the unity of the seat of 
the roman church 
john paul also announced longawaited reforms in the curia the 
vatican administration changes include a special oversight panel 
for the vatican bank which was linked to italys worst postwar 
banking scandal 
four new cardinals are from italy and two each from the united 
states brazil spain and india the others are from canada 
mozambique colombia australia hungary cameroon austria 
france west germany mauritius hong kong and lithuania 
the college of cardinals the most important governing body of 
the church now has 160 members 121 of whom under age 80 and thus 
eligible to elect a pope john paul had named 25 new cardinals but 
hans urs von balthasar of switzerland died sunday at age 82

two harvard professors richard e 
neustadt and ernest r may were named tuesday as the first 
recipients of a 150000 award for ideas that foster world order 
neustadt and may won the 1988 grawemeyer award for ideas 
improving world order for their proposal of how contemporary 
political leaders should draw on past experience in tackling the 
worlds problems 
the two said they would use the prize to follow up on their 
winning entry 
neustadt said the award should bring attention to their winning 
idea which is set forth in thinking in time the uses of history 
for decisionmakers a 329page book published by the free press 
in 1986 
neustadt 69 is a professor of government may 59 is a 
history professor 
in the book the two proposed that lessons from the past can be 
useful in shaping modern public policy if they are used carefully 
and early enough 
they explain for example how the kennedy administrations 
analysis of soviet history and nikita khrushchevs personal 
background helped resolve the cuban missile crisis in the early 
1960s 
may said their followup work will involve developing a more 
efficient means of communication in times of crises between a 
decisionmaker such as the president and experts 
when the president has to make a decision on a foreign 
government he needs to communicate with an expert on that 
country may said in a telephone interview from sunriver ore 
jurors chosen by the university of louisville reviewed 60 
nominations before deciding on neustadt and mays entry 
when policies fail because of mistaken decisions in major 
issues affecting international relations progress toward world 
order is set back and confident expectations turn sour the 
jurors said 
the authors show plainly when where how and why this happens 
and develop prescriptions for avoiding it they said 
the jurors said statesmen legislators scholars and the public 
could find useful lessons for the future in the work 
the international relations prize is one of four 150000 awards 
established by charles grawemeyer a 1934 graduate of the 
university of louisville to stimulate the worldwide development of 
new ideas 
a grawemeyer award in the field of music composition has been

l stanley chauvin jr preparing to 
become presidentelect of the american bar association doesnt 
forget the worn country paths that led him to the job 
a new computer terminal sits in one corner of chauvins 
louisville office electronically linking bar associations lawyers 
and others in the profession 
if the fixture can be considered a symbol of the new issues 
facing lawyers as chauvin takes office the picture above it of the 
class of 53 at castle heights military academy in lebanon tenn 
could represent the past chauvin cherishes 
when chauvin 53 assumes his elected office at the abas house 
of delegates meeting aug 10 in toronto he will bring to it the 
experience of a lawyer who learned the ropes by watching his peers 
when i came to the bar if you heard someone was going to try 
a case on a unique question of law it was not unusual to go 
over sit down listen to part of their case look at the 
instructions talk to the lawyers about it lawyers are willing to 
do it now but its a matter of time he said in an interview 
monday 
nostalgic as chauvin may be about days when time wasnt such a 
luxury he is eager to begin a more hectic pace traveling and 
speaking on behalf of the 350000member association in addition to 
his practice with the firm of barnett amp alagia where he handles 
both corporate and civil cases 
he has been pursuing the aba presidency for seven or eight 
years i pretty much decided then that it was a possibility or 
something that if it were possible i would like to do it 
chauvin succeeds robert d raven of san francisco as 
presidentelect and raven moves up to the post of president 
chauvin will become president a year from now 
chauvin was chairman of the house of delegates from 1982 to 
1984 a post he believes prepared him for the chief job 
you know thats not one of your easier jobs being locked in 
a room with 400 lawyers i thought well if i can handle this 
job then it might become a reality the delegates decide policy 
stands for the aba 
with chauvin as chairman the delegates took up such issues as 
the code of professional conduct gay rights the insanity defense 
and malpractice insurance topics that allowed him to use his 
folksy style to defuse controversy 
the president of the aba concerns himself primarily with current 
matters while the presidentelect plans for the coming year 
chauvin said 
his agenda covers everything from lawyer advertising to 
childrens rights to toxic waste to alternative ways of resolving 
disputes but they all fall under the two obligations chauvin 
believes lawyers have to protect citizens rights and to make 
society better 
chauvin is delighted with his upcoming position 
i would not be any happier doing anything else that i know 
of

edmund szoka whispered his thanks to the 
pope in polish and james a hickey felt filled with grace when 
the archbishops of detroit and washington dc became cardinals 
on tuesday 
more than 500 americans were among about 10000 people who 
watched szoka hickey and 22 other churchmen kneel one by one 
before pope john paul ii to have the threecornered red had placed 
on their heads and become princes of the church 
cardinals who elect the pope make up the highest governing 
body of the roman catholic church 
it was a very emotional experience szoka said after the 
ceremony i was much more moved than i expected his parents 
were born in poland john pauls native land 
the cardinals first received certificates of their new office 
from the vatican secretary of state cardinal agostino casaroli 
as the tall ruddyfaced hickey mounted the platform in the paul 
vi auditorium friends and relatives jumped up and cheered 
applause filled the hall when szoka a slight man with glasses 
received his certificate 
in a later part of the ceremony john paul gave the churchmen 
their red hats called birettas and made them titular heads of 
different churches in rome each wore a red cassock and gold cross 
hickey 67 walked briskly up the 10 steps and knelt solemnly 
before the pope 
john paul placed the biretta gently on his head blessed him and 
made him titular head of the church of st maria mother of the 
redemptor cardinals are appointed heads of rome churches because 
of a church tradition that only pastors of rome can elect the pope 
hickey kissed the pope on both cheeks and walked over to embrace 
other cardinals 
it was an awesome moment he said at a reception in the 
pontifical north american college where he was rector in 196974 
i felt very much filled with grace 
szoka 60 listened attentively as john paul blessed him and 
made him titular head of the church of saints andrea and gregorio 
as he rose szoka whispered i thank you most sincerely for 
everything in polish and the pontiff smiled 
he said something in response szoka told reporters later 
but i cant remember now what he said 
both new american cardinals are considered conservatives on 
doctrinal matters but have increased the efforts of their dioceses 
in helping the poor minorities and victims of aids acquired 
immunity deficiency syndrome 
tuesdays ceremony known as a consistory brought the number of 
active roman catholic cardinals in the united states to five four 
others are retired and three us citizens who are cardinals work 
outside the united states 
hickey who previously served as bishop of cleveland said he 
hoped as cardinal to focus more attention on catholic education 
because so many people know only snitches and snatches of their 
faith 
dozens of members of detroits large polishamerican community 
came to rome for the ceremony 
a polish bishop was becoming cardinal and weve got a polish 
pope said raymond gientke 65 of northville mich the time 
was right 
ethel crawford of detroit 61 said it was indescribable 
szoka a native of grand rapids mich was ordained in 1954 and 
became bishop of gaylord mich in 1971 he was made leader of the 
detroit archdioceses 12 million roman catholics in 1981 
hickey was born in midland mich in 1920 he became archbishop 
of washington in 1980

an ira bomb exploded tuesday in 
a school bus carrying 12 protestant and roman catholic students 
seriously injuring one of them and the driver a parttime soldier 
the outlawed irish republican army said in a message to the 
media it planted the bomb but would hold an investigation because a 
civilian had been regrettably injured a tacit acknowledgement 
the attack went awry 
the seriously injured girl gillian latimer 14 underwent 
emergency surgery in enniskillen 10 miles from the blast and was 
then transferred to royal victoria hospital in belfast 70 miles 
away police said 
she was in the intensive care unit with chest injuries and a 
broken arm the hospital said 
four other children the youngest being 12 years old were 
treated for minor cuts and bruises and shock the driver a member 
of the ulster defense regiment militia who was not immediately 
identified was cut in the face and eyes by flying glass 
the girls were members of both the provinces protestant 
majority and roman catholic minority 
the bus was coming up to a stop but it hadnt slowed down 
when there was a big bang said madonna murphy 18 a catholic 
pupil on the bus 
glass was everywhere and some of the girls didnt know what 
had happened i went down to the back to comfort the wee ones who 
were frightened and crying the i saw a girl behind me her arm was 
just hanging there and i could see blood coming through her 
blouse 
miss murphy added i hope this doesnt drive the protestants 
and catholics apart in enniskillen that is the only aim this bomb 
would have but we wont let it work 
an ira bomb in enniskillen killed 12 protestants attending a war 
memorial service in november 
dr brian mawhinney education minister of the province said 
there can be no excuse no attempt to justify no cynical apology 
from the men of violence northern ireland is a godfearing 
province and its quite clear what the ira means by suffer little 
children 
police said the bomb apparently was put in the front of the bus 
while parked overnight outside a school in maguiresbridge in county 
fermanagh near the border with the irish republic they said it 
was probably meant to explode before the driver began collecting 
children to drive them to school in enniskillen 
the bomb with 23 pounds of explosives went off after the bus 
had been en route for half an hour 
police said the driver despite his injuries carried the badly 
injured girl to the rear of the bus and gave her mouthtomouth 
resuscitation before ambulances arrived 
the ulster defense regiment is recruited in northern ireland to 
assist the british army and 175 of its members have been killed 
since the ira launched its violent campaign in 1969 to force a 
british withdrawal from the province more than 2650 civilians 
police and soldiers have been killed in the conflict 
police said the ira unit that planted the enniskillen bomb in 
november was likely to have been the same which bombed the school 
bus and it might be based across the border in the irish republic

a group of property owners filed a 
damage lawsuit tuesday on behalf of the thousands forced to 
evacuate their homes after a train derailment and phosphorus fire 
named as defendants in the christian county circuit court 
lawsuit were csx corp and a subsidiary csx transportation inc 
the complaint alleges negligence on the part of both companies 
said tim futrell attorney for the nine plaintiffs residents of 
the crofton and nortonville areas 
we are talking in terms of hundreds of millons of dollars in 
damages futrell said under the rules of civil procedure you 
are not permitted to specify a specific amount in the complaint 
futrell said he believed at least 15000 people could be 
affected by the case noting that the accident on june 22 drove 
about that many people from their homes in seven western kentucky 
counties 
lloyd lewis spokesman for csx transportation said tuesday he 
had no comment 
a cxs transportation tanker carrying phosphorus was among 34 
that left the tracks in a ravine near crofton the phosphorus 
spilled from the ruptured tanker and burned more than 12 hours 
after the crash 
there was no fatalities 
futrell said one of the reasons we are filing so quickly is 
because csx has dispatched representatives to the area to get 
people to sign releases for a pittance of what they are due 
futrell said some people complained about scratching and itching 
and difficulty in breathing and he said there was damage to 
tobacco and hay crops and perhaps to the soil itself 
virtually all of the plaintiffs were displaced for at least 
three days they lost wages and will be seeking compensation for 
that

a car bomb believed planted by a leftwing 
terrorist group exploded tuesday and killed the us military 
attache in greece hurling his armorplated car off the road 
authorities said 
us navy capt william nordeen was driving to work when the 
blast threw his sedan across the small treelined street and lodged 
it in a steel fence police said 
the victims body was found several yards away in the front yard 
of an abandoned house 
there was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast 
but senior police officials said they believed it to be the work of 
november 17 a leftwing urban terrorist group blamed for 11 
political assassinations in the past 13 years 
the united states and greece both condemned the bombing which 
came a a crucial time in relations between the two countries 
the united states condemns this terrorist outrage in the 
strongest possible terms said chief pentagon spokesman dan 
howard it was a senseless and cowardly murder of a highly 
regarded us military officer 
sotiris kostopoulos a spokesman for foreign minister carolos 
papoulias said the greek government voiced disgust at the 
murder 
all greeks irrespective of their political leanings 
unreservedly condemn the wouldbe underminers of the countrys 
institutions and democratic normality kostopoulos told reporters 
at a news briefing 
police said the toyota packed with explosives was parked 100 
yards from nordeens twostory home in the northern suburb of 
kifissia where many american and foreign diplomats live 
the blast shattered windows and blew out doors in surrounding 
houses trees fences and walls were blacked by smoke after fire 
engulfed both cars 
we heard a tremendous bang and the house rocked back and 
forth pieces of the car were thrown into our house panagia 
kapodistria said the cars twisted rear axle lay in her front yard 
nordeen 51 of centuria wis was due to retire in august 
after 30 years in the navy said his sister carla anderson he had 
been stationed in greece for three years 
he previously served as assistant naval inspector in washington 
with the us fleet in the pacific and at the jacksonville fla 
naval air base he is survived by his wife and 12yearold daughter 
at the white house presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
the us government would work with greek authorities to bring 
the murderers to justice 
a senior police officer speaking on condition of anonymity 
said he believed it was staged by november 17 named for the day in 
1973 when troops crushed a student rebellion at athens polytechnic 
university against the rightwing dictatorship 
i dont think anybody except november 17 had the expertise to 
pull off something like this the officer said 
a police explosives expert who refused to be identified said 
tuesdays killing was perfectly planned and very well executed 
they thought of every detail 
the expert said bags of cement were piled against one side of 
the boobytrapped vehicle so the explosions full force would be 
directed toward nordeens car he said the blast probably was 
detonated by remotecontrolled device 
november 17 carried out a similar attack against the us drug 
enforcement agencys local chief in january but george carros 
survived after the radiocontrolled bomb in a trash can outside his 
home failed to go off 
the group has claimed responsibility for 11 assassinations since 
1975 including the 1983 shooting of us navy capt george tsantes 
and the 1975 assassination of richard welch cia station chief in 
athens 
november 17 is named for the day in 1973 when troops crushed a 
student uprising against the 196774 greek military dictatorship 
nordeens killing came four days after greek and american 
negotiators ended a seventh round of talks on a new us bases 
agreement to replace an accord that expires dec 31 1988 the 
talks ended without reports of significant progress 
the united states has operated four military bases in greece 
since the 1950s two near athens and two on the island of crete 
the fiveyear accord expires in december 1988

the tiny persian gulf sheikdom of qatar 
illegally obtained stinger missiles from unnamed third parties 
and the united states is demanding an explanation and return of the 
weapons the state department said tuesday 
the incident could upset traditionally good relations between 
washington and the oilrich arab country it is believed the 
shoulderfired stingers often called a terrorists dream because 
they are easy to handle were intended for afghan rebels a us 
official said 
the official who spoke only on condition on anomymity said 
that might mean the usmade missiles were turned over to iran 
which then gave them to qatar 
many of the guerrillas fighting the sovietbacked kabul 
government with us support are moslem fundamentalists with at 
least a theological and philosopohical kinship to the iranians 
the middle east and persian gulf already were awash in a rising 
tide of missiles when reports of stingers in qatar sent assistant 
secretary of state richard w murphy to doha last week for an 
explanation 
the soviet union ignoring us appeals has sold a variety of 
missiles to syria and libya while china has provided saudi arabia 
with new rockets this has alarmed both the united states and 
israel which is seeking a new surfacetoair missile as a 
counterbalance 
under us law stingers can be transferred to a third party 
only with american consent the missiles have been used effectively 
by afghan rebels against soviet helicopters and other targets and 
are credited with hastening a decision by moscow to withdraw the 
red army after more than eight years of occupation 
charles e redman the state department spokesman said qatar 
had refused to supply details of its acquisition of the stingers 
we have been intensively involved in discussions with the qataris 
on their acquisition of stingers through unauthorized sources 
the us official said 
these stingers were not procured from the us government and 
must have been obtained illegally from third parties redman 
said that they were procured improperly and are in qatar 
without authorization are matters of great concern to us we are 
seeking the return of these missiles 
he said he did not know how many missiles were involved were 
trying to determine how and from where qatar obtained the 
stingers he said we still dont have any conclusions as to 
where the stingers came from we still need answers from the 
qataris and thats the reason were having these discussions to 
see if we can get those answers

the reagan administration in its zeal to 
deregulate financial institutions laid out the welcome mat for 
high fliers and must share the blame for troubles facing the 
savings and loan industry an industry official said tuesday 
theo pitt jr chairman of the us league of savings 
institutions the industrys largest lobbying group said that the 
administration bungled the deregulation of savings and loans by 
failing to provide for beefedup auditing supervision 
in a speech to the leagues annual regulatory conference pitt 
said the administration had turned down repeated requests for more 
examiners from the the federal home loan bank board the agency 
which regulates the sampl industry 
it was obvious to all but those in a position to do something 
about it that a deregulated marketplace would require a larger 
federal police force pitt said 
by refusing requests for more federal examiners pitt said the 
administration in effect laid out the welcome mat for the high 
fliers they said come on in no ones watching and come they 
did and they ran amok in the absence of government supervision 
the savings and loan industry suffered losses totaling 38 
billion in the first three months of this year more than half of 
the record 68 billin the industry lost for all of 1987 
pitt said that poor management and depressed economic conditions 
in the southwest had contributed to the industrys woes 
but he said those that got in trouble because of fraud and 
mismanagement were invited to do so largely as the result of a 
poorly planned poorly executed deregulation process at both the 
state and federal levels 
the administration plunged headlong into deregulation in the 
early years of this decade they went at it with a vengeance and 
they went at it in a lopsided fashion he said 
for many years the amounts that savings and loans could pay 
depositors was capped and in the 1980s those caps were gradually 
removed 
pitt said that it wasnt until three years after the start of 
interest rate deregulation that federal officials got around to 
granting institutions the power to offer variablerate mortgage 
loans pitt said this created an imbalance between the cost sampls 
were having to pay for funds and the amount they were allowed to 
earn on their loans which translated into an estimated loss of 12 
billion for the industry 
pitt said that the legislatures in some states were at fault as 
well by expanding the investment authority of their statechartered 
institutions far beyond the traditional housingfinance mission of 
the sampl industry 
the largest number of financially troubled institutions are in 
texas and california two states where lawmakers granted sampls broad 
authority to venture into risky investments outside of the 
traditional home mortgages the industry was created to handle 
pitt said there was a limit to how much the nations healthy 
sampls could continue to pay toward making up the shortfall in the 
federal savings and loan insurance corp the agency which insures 
deposits up to 100000 because of the sampl troubles the insurance 
fund ended 1987 with a negative net worth of 137 billion more 
than double the deficit at the end of 1986 
congress approved a measure to raise 108 billion for the 
ailing insurance fund through the sale of bonds with the bonds to 
be paid off by increased assessments on healthy sampls 
but pitt said healthy sampls are now being asked to pay 2 times 
what competing banks must pay for deposit insurance 
what looms before us is the prospect of vampire economics 
a prescription for fslics problems that would drain away our 
capital the very life blood of our system of depository 
institutions pitt said

democrat michael dukakis blasted reagan 
administration housing cuts on tuesday and promised to spend 3 
billion on housing if elected to help people achieve one piece of 
the american dream 
dukakis spoke to reporters at the site of a former boston public 
school that was razed to make way for more than a dozen homes sold 
through a state program offering subsidized mortgages to low and 
moderateincome families buying their first home 
he endorsed a senate housing bill sponsored by california sen 
alan cranston who accompanied dukakis to the event dukakis said 
the bill provided for a a federal commitment a recommitment to 
affordable housing and promised to provide 3 billion in funding 
for the legislation within three years of taking office 
he touted provisions of the bill calling for lowinterest 
mortgages for new homes and renovation of existing housing stock 
and said similar programs he began in massachusetts had proven 
highly successful 
i dont see how we can talk about a bright economic future for 
america if it doesnt include decent and affordable housing for all 
our citizens dukakis said in a speech at a housing forum before 
visiting the neighborhood 
dukakis the certain democratic presidential nominee dismissed 
speculation about his search for a running mate by saying theres 
only one guy who knows whats going on and thats the guy youre 
looking at 
but he refused to rule out georgia sen sam nunn for the no 2 
spot on the ticket despite nunns insistence that he is not 
interested he also said florida sen bob graham remained in 
contention 
the massachusetts governor planned to meet wednesday in 
washington with about 30 democratic senators including nunn and 
graham before a midwest campaign swing some of them may be 
possibilities for the vice presidential nomination dukakis 
said 
i dont know he answered when asked when he would make a 
decision im enjoying the process and i hope you are too 
cranston said the betting on capitol hill seems to be john 
glenn and llyod bentsen as the frontrunners to share the ticket 
with dukakis with nunn running third in the speculation glenn and 
bentsen are senators from ohio and texas respectively 
dukakis laughed when told of cranstons assessment im not a 
betting man he said 
dukakis blamed the lack of affordable housing on a 90 percent 
cut in federal spending on housing by reagan and said there were 
25 million homeless people in the united states largely because 
of the cuts in federal commitment to affordable housing 
i dont know that he has a policy dukakis said when asked 
about the housing policies of vice president george bush the 
certain republican nominee 
at the housing forum dukakis said a national housing program 
should include some goverment support either through loans and 
grants or through other incentives such as donating land or 
granting zoning variances 
it takes partnership it takes commitment it takes an 
understanding that we are one nation dukakis 
one piece of the american dream is an affordable home or 
apartment dukakis said and anything less than that just wont 
do 
dukakis cited efforts by some unions to invest their pension 
funds in housing developments that guarantee a percentage of the 
units to low and moderateincome families 
it creates good jobs at union scale and does it in a way that 
creates good housing he said

the house killed a residency requirement for 
district of columbia police officers on tuesday reflecting 
congressional concern that the rule was hurting recruiting while 
the crime rate went up 
in a rare instance in which congress intervened in an issue 
normally handled at the local level an amendment that scuttled the 
citys eightyearold residency requirement was approved by a 
246163 vote 
the measure offered by rep stan parris rva came as the 
house considered the citys 32 billion budget for fiscal 1989 
parris had intended to replace the residency rule with a system 
giving hiring preference to city residents but democrats moved 
that the vote be contested only on the residency issue parris 
amendment passed after the preferential hiring language was dropped 
the message trying to be conveyed is that there are problems 
in public safety parris said after the vote 
dc mayor marion barry a steadfast supporter of the residency 
rule was not immediately available for comment 
we look forward to seeing an improvement in the numbers and 
quality of the people joining the police department said gary 
hankins spokesman for the local chapter of the fraternal order of 
police we remain convinced this will substantially improve 
public safety in the district of columbia 
parris amendment will apply to all city positions including 
police and firefighters 
supporters of the residency requirement accused parris of 
meddling in city affairs but he and other opponents of the 
residency rule claimed that a combination of increasing crime and 
decreasing police applications equaled a looming public safety 
problem in the nations capital 
police statistics indicate crime has increased by 17 percent for 
the first four months of 1988 compared with the same period a year 
ago and police blame an upsurge in drugrelated violence for much 
of the citys 146 homicides so far this year there were 98 
killings at this time last year and 228 for all of 1987 
applications to the police department also are down according 
to police records there were 3100 applications in 1985 but just 
591 last year the city has 3880 officers but some members of 
congress long have favored expanding the police force to 5100 
members 
opponents of the residency rule argued that it severely 
restricted the citys job applicant pool particularly in crucial 
public safety positions 
rep ron dellums dcalif who chairs the house district of 
columbia committee said the house would become a super city 
council if it voted to repeal the act and rep julian dixon 
dcalif suggested that the house wait for the district of 
columbia council to act on the matter 
the bill now moves to the senate where parris said he expects 
no opposition to the repeal of the residency requirement

an angry reagan administration recalled its 
ambassador from mexico on tuesday after mexico released a puerto 
rican separatist wanted by us authorities for terrorist 
activities 
mexican authorities freed william morales 37 from prison last 
friday and put him on a plane to cuba effectively erasing any 
possibility of his extradition to the united states 
the recall of ambassador charles pilliod from mexico city for 
consultations was a sign of us displeasure over the mexican 
action state department spokesman charles e redman did not say 
whether any retaliatory measures are planned he described the 
release as politically motivated 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said it was an outrage 
for mexico to release and deport to cuba a man who had not yet 
completed a prison sentence for the murder of a mexican police 
officer morales had been serving an eightyear prison term for the 
1983 slaying 
this decision is an inexplicable affront to otherwise 
excellent usmexican relations and a great blow to us and 
mexican efforts to combat the scourge of international terrorism 
fitzwater said 
he said the state department had summoned the mexican ambassador 
to the united states jorge espinosa de los reyes on monday night 
and expressed our anger over the release of this convicted 
terrorist 
redman said morales is an escaped us prisoner who has been 
sentenced to jail terms totaling more than 100 years he was 
implicated in over 50 bombings by a puerto rican separatist group 
that from 1976 to 1978 resulted in the death and injury of many 
individuals the spokesman said 
a us embassy official in mexico city insisting on anonymity 
said mexico waited five days before informing the united states of 
morales release 
mexico has described morales as a political fighter who could 
not be legally extradited to the united states because of a 
bilateral treaty clause protecting political activists from 
extradition 
redman said application of the provision to morales was 
outrageous and undercuts the fight against terrorism by legal 
means 
it is inconceivable that an important friend such as mexico 
could find such violent acts to be a legitimate exercise of 
political activity he said 
the decision is particularly offensive to us because in 
reversing the finding by the pertentent mexican court that morales 
should be extradited the action of the mexican foreign ministry 
could only have been taken for political reasons

police tuesday dragged off members of a 
disgruntled ethnic group at one demonstration and herded away 
political protesters at another hours after mikhail s gorbachev 
called for greater freedom of expression 
they took my husband said a sobbing woman minutes after 
police carried away about 200 fellow crimean tatars who demand the 
return of their historic homeland 
the woman in her 20s said she came to moscow from the city of 
krasnodar to demonstrate during the nationwide communist party 
conference she was arrested a few minutes later 
a few blocks away in the kremlin gorbachev had just endorsed 
openness 
i would like to dwell particularly on the political freedoms 
that enable a person to express his opinion on any matter the 
soviet leader told the conference in a keynote speech the 
implementation of these freedoms is a real guarantee that any 
problem of public interest will be discussed from every angle 
but he also condemned attempts to use democratic rights for 
undemocratic purposes such as attempts to redraw borders and 
establish political parties that would challenge the rule of the 
communists 
josef v stalin ordered the crimean tatars deported in may 1944 
from their homes on the crimean peninsula in the ukrainian 
republic they were accused of betraying their country while the 
crimea was occupied by nazi germany 
the government dropped the collective war crimes charges in 1967 
but the tatars were not allowed to return permanently to the crimea 
the crimean tatars who number 250000350000 are demanding 
permission to resettle in their homeland 
police had put up steel barricades to prevent the tatars from 
demonstrating on a square on gorky street in moscows main shopping 
district the group gathered anyway outside the barricades during 
an evening rushhour rainstorm and unfurled banners demanding 
return to the crimea 
within seconds plainclothes and uniformed police emerged from 
nearby buses grabbed the crimean tatars and dragged them onto the 
vehicles some appeared to be injured 
as the demonstrators were herded onto the crowded buses they 
shouted homeland women screamed and clutched their children 
then they too were taken away 
a second group of crimean tatars arrived but they also were 
grabbed and hustled onto buses 
two officers told a reporter the protesters were not being 
arrested or taken to a jail but moved out of the area because they 
were violating public order 
some of the dozens of bystanders who watched the incident 
shouted gestapo and fascist idiots at the police others 
called the tatars traitors 
take them all away shouted one woman as police hunted down 
and grabbed one of the demonstrators 
about 15 minutes later a few blocks away on pushkin square 
police rounded up seven members of the group called the democratic 
union witnesses said several remaining members of the group 
addressed separate crowds of several dozen people to promote its 
platform which calls for a multiparty system 
bystanders argued about the merits of socialism and capitalism 
in his speech gorbachev said the civil rights of soviets need 
to be preserved 
the entire lawandorder structure of ours is called upon to 
guarantee strict observance of the citizens rights to the 
inviolability of private life and the home privacy of 
correspondence postal and telegraph messages he said 
the soviet legal system must ensure that a person is innocent 
until proven guilty and that all people get equal treatment before 
the law gorbachev said 
those rights and the right to speak out on the issues before 
soviet society have been violated since the time of stalin and must 
be restored he said 
and in a reference to religious freedom gorbachev said all 
believers irrespective of their faith are equal citizens of the 
soviet union despite their differences with communism which is 
officially atheistic

the owner of a ferret authorities want to 
test for rabies has been given until july 14 to find the missing

county jail on contempt of court charges after she claimed she did 
not know where the ferret was the teenager was given the weekend 
to find the animal but faced another jail term when she returned 
to the courthouse monday without it

miss au has argued that she does not know where to find the 
ferret which may have bitten a boy on june 3 in a pet shop where 
she worked aj simpson 5 will receive the last of six 
precautionary rabies shots on july 9

it when she was in jail or when she had the threat of jail hanging 
over her said wenda travers assistant commonwealths attorney 
miss au showed thornton logs of the telephone calls she had made 
in efforts to find the ferret since friday when she was freed 
after five days in the manassasprince william adult detention 
center on orders to bring the animal to court monday 
miss au has said the female ferret named fuji was not the one 
that bit the boy at manassas mall pet center two other ferrets 
that were in the cage tested negative for rabies in a process that 
requires the decapitation of the animals 
miss au a virginia tech student took the animal from the pet 
store and refused to give it up for testing she said she left it 
to be picked up by an unidentified animal rights activist before 
thornton ordered its surrender 
the court became involved in the case after prince william 
health director dr jared florance filed a lawsuit to get the third

air france put its airbus 320 jetliners back in the 
air tuesday as investigators studied burned wreckage of the 
sophisticated aircraft to determine whether human or technical 
error caused a crash at an air show 
british airways also expressed confidence in its two a320s and 
put them back on the schedule tuesday after a twoday suspension 
three people died and 50 were injured sunday when an a320 with 
133 people aboard buzzed the airfield at 30 feet and failed the 
climb the plane crashed into a wooded area near mulhouse in 
eastern france 
an inquiry commission was set up to study the circumstances 
research the causes and gather information about the crash the 
government publication journal officiel said tuesday the panel is 
headed by claude bechet a pilot and member of the transport 
ministrys office of accident inquests 
the pilots union protested because it was not represented on 
the panel 
at a news conference monday the transport ministry defended the 
fully computerized jet and said there was no reason to doubt the 
planes performance airbus industrie the fournation european 
consortium that makes the airbus 320 said there were indications 
of human error 
pilot michel hasseline was quoted by the french press after the 
accident as saying the aircraft did not respond to his efforts to 
increase power 
preliminary investigations showed the airbus was flying too low 
civil aviation authority chief daniel tennenbaum said he said the 
plane required eight seconds to respond to the command of the 
pilot who only had five seconds to maneuver because of the 
altitude 
christian roger president of the air france pilots union said 
the engines may have failed to restart at hasselines command 
state prosecutor jean volff said the minimum altitude for such 
condition was 100 feet and that the pilot had disconnected the 
automatic controls at the moment of the accident and was in manual 
control he did not elaborate 
the pilots and mechanics unions contend that safety requires a 
third officer in the cockpit of a320s in addition to pilot and 
copilot in case of a failure of the stateoftheart computers 
in a joint statement tuesday they said the inquiry panel was 
composed of supporters of the twocrew system 
air frances first a320 flight since sundays suspension took 
off from paris bound for duesseldorf and berlin with 102 passengers 
aboard seven people who had reservations did not claim their 
seats a normal noshow rate for a european route of this type

britain and france have a big stake in the 17yearold airbus 
industrie which has broken into the usdominated aircraft market 
and employs about 150000 people throughout europe airbus whose 
other members are west germany and spain says it has more than 500 
orders or letters of intent to purchase the narrowbodied

a national consumer group said tuesday it will 
ask federal regulators to create a new standard for lowerfat 
lite ice cream sold by the dip or by the carton 
ellen haas executive director of public voice for food and 
health policy said the food and drug administration will be asked 
to set up three standards regular ice cream having at least 10 
percent milkfat lite ice cream 4 percent to 6 percent and ice 
milk 2 percent to 4 percent 
currently an icecream type dessert with less than 7 percent 
fat must be labeled as ice milk and the term ice cream is 
reserved for those having a fat content of at least 10 percent she 
said 
historically ice milk has been the stepchild of the ice cream 
industry haas said few are aware of its comparative 
nutritional benefits yet fda regulations do not permit marketing 
of a product called lite ice cream which could be used to 
stimulate sales of all lowerfat ice cream products 
also the public voice petition to fda asks that manufacturers 
who use the new standard would have to provide nutrition 
information on the package and the label would have to state as a 
percentage how much less fat the lite product is compared with 
regular ice cream 
in other words lite ice cream would contain 40 percent to 60 
percent less fat than ice cream and ice milks margin would be 
even greater 
haas said nearly a dozen health and medical groups have endorsed 
the proposal for lite ice cream 
support also came from two trade associations the milk industry 
foundation and the international ice cream association a 
spokeswoman becky davenport said the associations planned to file 
their own petition with fda but would call for a slightly greater 
range of fat in lite ice cream 5 percent to about 7 percent 
the national milk producers federation which represents dairy 
farmers and their cooperatives has not had an opportunity to study 
the proposal by public voice and would reserve comment until later 
said spokeswoman doni dondero 
public voice is tackling ice cream after recently succeeding in 
getting the agriculture department to change the name of leaner 
us good beef to us select as a way of attracting more 
favorable consumer attention 
creation of a lowerfat ice cream standard would be good for 
everyone haas said consumers would be better informed about a 
healthier dessert choice the industry would benefit from the 
increased marketability of a product with clear nutritional 
advantages 
how about the taste of lite ice cream 
ive tasted it and its just as good haas said in a 
telephone interview its a lighterfeeling taste its not as 
rich but i think the american palate has become light and the 
health concerns are more important than the gooey concerns 
lite ice cream would be most distinctive eaten in a cone or 
otherwise unadorned that way she said moving down from ice cream 
with 10 percent to 15 percent fat to 5 percent or 6 percent would 
produce a noticeable difference to the eater 
but if used in a sundae or banana split with plenty of 
toppings lite ice cream becomes one of those gooey concerns 
and probably wouldnt be noticed

several republican senators filed a bill 
tuesday to elevate the environmental protection agency to cabinet 
status saying the legislation was meant as a signal to the next 
administration that the environment should get more attention 
we want environmental protection to receive a higher priority 
than it has in the past said the author of the bill sen david 
durenberger rminn 
the bill would not change the duties or offices of the 
governments largest regulatory agency but would upgrade it to the 
department of environmental protection headed by a secretary 
the senators conceded that they had little hope of quick 
passage but said the bill was intended to prod presidential 
candidates into dealing with environmental issues 
i very much want george bush and michael dukakis to address 
environmental issues in their campaigns putting this issue before 
them will very much encourage that debate said sen john heinz 
rpa another sponsor 
heinz declined to criticize president reagans environmental 
record something dukakis the likely democratic presidential 
nominee has done on occasion and many environmental groups do 
frequently 
given where the united states was in 1980 and 1981 and 
reagans experience i think the president would agree concern 
over the environment has sharply increased in the past six or eight 
years thats true for him and its true for us heinz said 
but durenberger said we want the next president of the united 
states directly involved in making environmental policy 
something reagan has not generally been involved in 
the agency needs the clout that cabinet status can bring both 
against other departments of the government in international 
negotiations in seeking larger budgets and in pressing its views 
on congress the senators said 
though epa led the development of the administrations position 
to seek large worldwide cuts in emissions of chemicals that destroy 
the earths protective ozone layer and won a treaty last year 
calling for a 50 percent reduction by 1998 it was more difficult 
from the position of an agency than it would have been at the 
cabinet level said sen john chafee rri 
in addition to chafee heinz and durenberger the other initial 
sponsors included sen lowell weicker rconn and sen robert 
stafford rvt all but stafford are seeking reelection in 
november 
epa administrator lee m thomas in a comment relayed by 
spokesman david cohen said he had no complaints about his agencys 
clout in the current administration but added the role of this 
agency has grown significantly and we should sit at the same table 
with the rest of the major players this proposal strikes me as an 
excellent idea 
epa has about 14000 employees and spends 31 billion a year 
roughly half of that on the superfund toxic waste cleanup 
program it distributes more than 2 billion a year more in grants 
for sewage plants 
the agency administers 13 major laws and through them is the 
chief overseer of massive pollution control and abatement spending 
by states cities businesses and consumers that by some estimates 
totals as much as 70 billion per year 
epa was formed by president nixons executive order in 1970 out 
of pieces of the agriculture interior and health education and 
welfare departments and the atomic energy commission

mikhail s gorbachev on tuesday proposed a broad 
but vague separation of powers between the communist party and 
government legislatures that would be made stronger but remain 
subordinate to the party 
gorbachev called for a new fulltime national legislature to be 
headed by a president with power to oversee foreign and defense 
policy and appoint the head of government 
but the communist party chief said legislative bodies or 
soviets still would be expected to implement party policies and 
he appeared to limit their independent development by recommending 
that the positions of local party head and government leader be 
held by the same person 
the partys economic social and ethnic policy should be 
carried out above all via the soviets of peoples deputies as the 
organs of popular government gorbachev told the opening session 
of 5000 delegates to the first communist party conference in 47 
years 
neither gorbachev nor politburo member alexander n yakovlev a 
leading theorist of gorbachevs reforms who spoke later at a news 
conference made clear whether the party general secretary also 
would be president 
currently the head of the party is the most powerful person in 
the soviet unionl 
as described by gorbachev the new presidency would be more 
powerful than that currently held by andrei a gromyko at times 
the communist party leader also has been president but the head of 
state is traditionally a ceremonial post 
specifically the president could exercise overall guidance in 
the drafting of legislation and of major socioeconomic programs 
decide on the key issues of foreign policy chair the defense 
council and nominate the premier gorbachev said 
outlining plans to strengthen the legislatures gorbachev 
proposed election of a new 2250member congress of deputies that 
would meet annually to review constitutional economic and social 
questions 
its members elected from the same constituencies that now make 
up the two house of parliament plus new representatives of trade 
unions artistic scientific party and other special interest 
organizations would serve fiveyear terms 
that could give intellectuals the strongest supporters of 
gorbachevs reforms a stronger voice in the chamber 
yakovlev said not all members of the new chamber need be party 
members 
the congress of deputies would choose a permanent legislature of 
400450 members to be headed by a president chosen in a secret 
ballot by the entire congress of deputies 
selection of the president is the prerogative of the peoples 
deputies and they can elect anyone they choose yakovlev said 
the new parliament would be known by the same name as the 
current nominal parliament the supreme soviet however it would 
consider and decide all legislative administrative and monitoring 
questions gorbachev said 
the communist party leader said legislation implementing the new 
arrangement could be submitted to the existing parliament as early 
as fall and elections held as soon as next spring 
yakovlev said it inevitably would lead to a redistribution of 
power in the soviet system 
all legislative authority will be invested in the soviets the 
executive power would go to the government and its executive organs 
locally the party will reserve the right and the function as the 
political vanguard he said 
the new smaller supreme soviet would have the right to review 
appointment of government ministers he said 
the new president and the members of the new congress of 
deputies could be recalled after election gorbachev said without 
making clear how this might happen 
gorbachev recommended that the local party leader also head the 
local governing council in order to enhance the councils prestige 
and increase accountability but that apparently contradicted 
passages in his speech advocating that the party get out of 
daytoday administration 
councils could decide against electing the party leader but in 
most cases the proposal presumably would ensure party control of 
the government councils 
gorbachev advocated a more open style of debate for the new 
permanent legislature and also suggested its decisions need not be 
unanimous as those of the current 1500member supreme soviet 
traditionally have been 
apparently mindful of recent ethnic strife in the soviet union 
gorbachev urged the council of nationalities to become a watchdog 
on ethnic issues monitoring legislation and policies in the 
nations 15 republics

michael dukakis campaign has asked for an 
exhaustive amount of information from potential democratic vice 
presidential contenders including driving records and academic 
transcripts in addition to financial material sources said tuesday 
in the case of john glenn officials said dukakis close friend 
paul brountas is delving into the senators 1984 presidential 
campaign seeking information about a lingering 24 million debt 
and a staff upheaval that came just before the iowa caucuses 
dukakis sought to dampen speculation about his search for a 
running mate during the day telling reporters theres only one 
guy who knows whats going on 
he wasnt saying much more about the subject 
but other officials said dukakis campaign has requested 
detailed financial and health information on several possible 
running mates in addition to income tax returns the candidates 
have been asked for academic records driving records military 
records and health records among other material 
presumably dukakis aides have asked for the wealth of 
information to minimize the prospects for an embarrassing 
disclosure once the choice has been made and announced past 
campaigns have been damaged by controversy over a running mate 
most recently in 1984 when questions were raised about the 
finances of geraldine ferraros husband john zacarro 
dukakis reluctance to discuss the search didnt stop the 
ceaseless speculation in advance of the governors trip to 
washington on wednesday in which he is expected to meet with 
several potential running mates as well as 30 or so other members 
of the senate 
dukakis aides have solicited information from several 
prospective candidates including jesse jackson and glenn as well 
as sens bob graham of florida sam nunn of georgia and lloyd 
bentsen of texas and reps thomas foley of washington richard 
gephardt of washington and lee hamilton of indiana the names of 
sen dale bumpers of arkansas and sen albert gore jr of tennessee 
also have cropped up 
members of congress have urged dukakis to look beyond jackson in 
picking a running mate sources have said and campaign aides say 
they doubt the spot will be offered to him foley has reportedly 
declined to provide the requested information 
the remainder of the list under consideration is comprised of 
moderate to conservative lawmakers from the south or midwest 
precisely the type of running mate that many members of congress 
have urged dukakis to pick 
sen bill bradley of new jersey has taken himself out of the 
running and dukakis said earlier in the week i respect that 
but dukakis declined during the day to rule out nunn even though 
the senator has relayed word that he does not intend to return the 
questionnaire sent out by the campaign nunn is one of several 
senators expected to meet with dukakis on wednesday 
dukakis also told reporters that graham remains under 
consideration although other sources have indicated in recent days 
that the senator might have fallen slightly out of favor when he 
publicly confirmed last week that he had been asked to provide 
information about himself 
dukakis and his aides have tried to conduct their search in as 
much privacy as possible and aides have been ordered not to talk 
to reporters about the subject 
thus bob farmer dukakis fundraiser responded no comment 
when asked whether he had been asked about his role in glenns 
abortive 1984 campaign 
but sources speaking on condition of anonymity said other 
associates of glenn had been asked detailed questions about the 
1984 presidential campaign and the senators involvement in a 
campaign staff shakeup several weeks before the primary season 
began 
in addition sources said dukakis aides want to know what they 
can about the circumstances surrounding the 24 million debt 
remaining from the campaign 
the federal election commission last year settled a lawsuit in 
which it originally charged that 2 million in bank loans during 
the glenn campaign were illegal because there was no assurance they 
would be repaid 
under the settlement the fec dismissed all claims against the 
senator while the campaign committee agreed to make a 4000 
paymenmt to the federal agency after the loans are repaid

the chief us negotiator at talks with the 
soviet union on nuclear testing said tuesday that a fourmonth 
negotiating round was ending with high hopes on both sides and with 
a substantial exchange of testing data 
the negotiator ambassador c paul robinson told the house 
foreign affairs committee that both us and soviet negotiators 
believe treaties limiting the size of underground nuclear weapons 
tests and of nuclear tests for peaceful purposes can be ready for 
ratification by the end of this year 
there is a sense of history among those involved in the 
geneva negotiations the second round of which ended tuesday said 
robinson none of them believed this could be possible 
on their final day of talks the two sides exchanged historical 
data on yields of past nuclear tests seismic recordings and 
associated geological information he said 
the two sides negotiated the threshold test ban treaty in 1974 
and the peaceful nuclear explosions treaty in 1976 but neither has 
been ratified the geneva talks have been aimed at reaching new 
verification agreements on the two pacts so they can finally be 
ratified 
the treaties prohibit nuclear tests of greater than 150 kilotons 
robinson also said plans are far along for a historic joint 
verification experiment to be conducted by the two sides in august 
and september the experiment agreed to during the washington 
summit last december calls for each side to measure a test 
explosion of the other using onsite monitoring equipment 
the us test at the nevada test site will take place in august 
and the soviet test at semipalatinsk about a month later he said 
during the hearing committee members sparred with 
administration officials over whether the administration has 
abandoned a longstanding us policy of seeking an eventual ban on 
all nuclear testing 
for 43 years we have experienced a need to test said maj 
gen william f burns director of the arms control and disarmament 
agency i see nothing to change this need at the present 
burns said the us policy is that testing must continue so long 
as the united states relies on nuclear weapons as a deterrent a 
position which drew fire from rep jim leach riowa 
administrations from eisenhower through carter have held that 
the united states would agree to a comprehensive test ban if the 
soviet union would accept onsite inspection leach said something 
the soviets have now done 
for the first time in the history of arms control the united 
states is ceding the high ground to the soviet union he said 
i am appalled that we are not pursuing the big apple this 
administration has backed off 
burns responded i am not particularly persuaded by the fact 
that the comprehensive test ban has been part of the rhetoric of 
the past six administrations simply because times change my 
primary concern is the security of the united states

mikhail s gorbachev on tuesday proposed a 
redistribution of power in the soviet union to give new authority 
to the president and legislature but he ruled out a multiparty 
system and indicated the communist party would retain control of 
local government 
in a 3hour speech opening the first communist party conference 
in 47 years gorbachev sketched a vision of a nation strikingly 
different from the authoritarian state built by josef stalin he 
called for a country that would be ruled by law and guarantee 
individual rights 
the soviet people want a clear perspective gorbachev 
concluded they want fullblooded and unconditional democracy 
they want a rule of law without reservations 
within hours of gorbachevs speech police in downtown moscow 
arrested two groups of demonstrators trying to demonstrate for 
ethnic rights and the need for a multiparty system 
although gorbachev made his most specific proposals in the 
political and legal field he also pressed for economic reform 
particularly in agriculture to feed the nations 284 million 
people 
the extraordinary conference will provide an arena for gorbachev 
and his opponents to debate his plans for perestroika the 
restructuring of the vast countrys economic system and the reform 
of the political system 
saying it is impossible today to describe in detail the 
concrete image of the future gorbachev proposed 
to create a new 2250member congress of deputies that would 
elect a president and a 400 to 450member fulltime legislature 
to empower the president to oversee foreign and defense policy 
and appoint the head of government 
to hand executive power to the government and local councils 
known as soviets and have local communist party chiefs elected to 
head their soviets 
the soviet president now acts as a figurehead and the soviet 
parliament merely approves decisions of the party 
gorbachev did not make clear what relationship the new president 
would have to his own position that of party general secretary 
which currently is the most powerful post in the nation 
while seeking to curb communist party power by law and promote a 
division of authority gorbachev made clear he had no intention of 
permitting rival parties to challenge communist rule 
he also condemned efforts to redraw the boundaries of the 
nations 15 republics signaling he wont give in to armenias 
demand to annex a mountain enclave belonging to a neighboring 
republic 
on agriculture gorbachev suggested expanding an experimental 
system permitting farmers to lease their land from state and 
collective farms into a nationwide program designed to give a quick 
boost to food production 
he said farmers should become the true masters of their land 
addressing the more sensitive point of price reform which 
necessarily would mean higher prices the soviet leader insisted 
it is absolutely necessary to resolve this problem no matter how 
difficult it may be 
gorbachev said overhauling the state price structure could ease 
food shortages and improve the availability of highquality 
consumer goods 
meat and milk are rationed in several regions of the soviet 
union while state subsidies keep prices low 
politburo member alexander n yakovlev asked at a news 
conference when ration cards would be abolished refused to set a 
date but said food supplies must be increased as soon as possible 
it is a political issue a moral issue a social issue said 
the propaganda chief who is regarded as one of gorbachevs key 
advisers 
yakovlev declined to fix a date for price reform saying that 
five models are being studied but the subject is so vast it 
resists embracing 
yakovlev was closely questioned about gorbachevs plans for 
political and legal reform and the extent to which they could take 
power from the communist party but he offered few details 
in his speech gorbachev said party and state functions will be 
more clearly defined later he suggested they would not be 
separated from the party when he proposed that local soviets be 
headed by local communist party chiefs 
economist leonid abalkin a leading proponent of reform won 
applause when he criticized the proposal during debate at the 
conference abalkin said it was undemocratic since it appeared the 
party chief would be the sole nominee to head the soviet 
neither gorbachev nor yakovlev made clear whether the principle 
of electing the communist party chief as head of the soviet would 
apply to the national political scene where gorbachev as party 
general secretary now holds supreme power 
of the 5000 delegates elected to the conference 4991 
registered to take part in the kremlin proceedings gorbachev said 
they listened in silence through most of his speech applauding 
only occasionally 
after gorbachevs address which was broadcast live on tv and 
radio the delegates broke for lunch then gathered behind closed 
doors to discuss gorbachevs proposals which yakovlev said were 
approved by the ruling party politburo eight days ago 
staterun radio and tv later broadcast excerpts of the debate 
radio moscow said more than 100 delegates had asked for the floor 
at the conference due to last at least through friday 
in the economic section of his speech gorbachev attacked 
conservative bureaucrats he said had blocked reforms and even 
blamed the central committee apparatus for failing to head off 
maneuvers to slow his changes 
on human rights gorbachev called for an end to administrative 
pressure on religious believers to espouse the official creed of 
atheism and for much stronger legal guarantees of privacy in the 
home in the postal system and telephone calls 
the law must reliably protect a humans dignity he said 
gorbachev condemned however any attempt to set up an 
alternative political party or to exploit the new openness of 
soviet society for what he called noncreative goals 
hours after gorbachev spoke promising freer expression and more 
attention to nationality problems about 200 crimean tartars tried 
to stage a demonstration in moscow police took them away in buses 
seconds after they unfurled banners demanding a return to the 
homeland from which they were deported by stalin in the 1940s 
nearby police also detained members of a citizens group called 
the democratic union which advocates a multiparty political system

gov michael dukakis who has had testy relations 
with his republican counterpart in neighboring new hampshire john 
sununu took a lighthearted jab at sununu while addressing a 
housing conference tuesday 
dukakis whose opposition to the seabrook nuclear power plant 
just north of the massachusetts border has prevented the new 
hampshire plant from going on line told the gathering that if 
elected president he would adopt a housing policy that involved the 
nations 50 governors including the guy from new hampshire 
he then joked that the troubled seabrook plant which sununu 
fervently supports could be converted into housing 
i figured wed hang balconies off it and make it 
condominiums the likely democratic presidential nominee said 
but even if elected president dukakis wont get an opportunity 
to work with sununu on national housing policy 
sununu a top figure in the presidential campaign of vice 
president george bush and one of the bush campaigns top critics of 
dukakis has announced he will not seek another term as governor

if theres a good side to the drought it could 
be that americans are being given a quick hard lesson about the 
importance of maintaining adequate food supplies a national farm 
leader said tuesday 
devon woodland president of the national farmers organization 
said that the surpluses once referred to as an albatross over 
agriculture are now looked at as being extremely vital 
i think we must always maintain a strategic food reserve in 
this country and treat it as such woodland said i think that 
message is probably coming through loud and clear in the last few 
months 
he added the consumer i think is understanding today as 
never before how vital this agricultural industry is 
woodland and leland h swenson president of the national 
farmers union briefed reporters about a new study of us 
agricultures economic structure by two oklahoma state university 
economists daryll e ray and james s plaxico 
the study was commissioned by the nfo and the nfu although not 
making specific recommendations the study said the 1985 farm laws 
basic philosophy of lowering federal price supports and payments to 
farmers has not worked as proponents have contended the law will 
expire in 1990 
it was argued that the 1985 law would result in us recapture 
of large shares of the farm export market thus draining away 
surpluses and eventually resulting in higher commodity prices and 
improved farm income 
however our competitors have matched our price reductions and 
have reduced their total acreage from zero to inconsequential 
the economists reported 
moreover they said there is little future in using us farm 
policy to bludgeon our competitors into surrendering their export 
business as a means of shoring up our export volume 
woodland said foreign countries simply are not going to allow 
themselves to become dependent on other countries for their 
stability in the food supply and we must take a similar posture 
for protecting our industry agriculture and treat it as a vital 
industry 
the two farm leaders whose organizations in the past have 
strongly urged some type of supply management of farm 
production as opposed to the socalled marketoriented policies 
favored by the reagan administration said the report would be 
widely distributed to members of congress and candidates running 
for office this fall 
asked which of the two apparent presidential nominees michael 
dukakis and george bush fit the policy ideals sought by nfu and 
nfo the farm leaders declined to be pinned down 
i think we will make that decision through debate and through 
discussion and hopefully members will be involved in the 
political process swenson said our organization the national 
farmers union does not endorse political candidates and any 
reference of that type would be an indication and i do not 
choose to get into that

two turks seeking notoriety faked a plot 
to kill pope john paul ii on the first day of his visit to austria 
authorities said tuesday 
they said the 68yearold pontiff was not in danger during his 
fiveday tour of this alpine nation which ended monday john paul 
has survived two assassination attempts in his decade as leader of 
the worlds roman catholics 
interior minister karl blecha said the escape of 29 terrorist 
inmates from a turkish prison in march put austria on alert because 
of the possibility some might head for this country he said 
interpol the international police agency advised austrian 
officials of the escape 
mehmet ali agca now serving life in prison shot and seriously 
wounded the pope in may 1981 in st peters square in rome agca 
belonged to a rightwing turkish terrorist group called the gray 
wolves 
one year after agcas attempt a man lunged at the pope with a 
knife during a visit to portugal but john paul was not hurt 
the austrian incident gained attention after an american 
television network reported monday that a plot to assassinate john 
paul had been discovered and foiled international news media 
carried the report for more than 10 hours before austria responded 
officially 
blecha told reporters at midday tuesday after a cabinet 
meeting the two men staged the socalled assassination plot as a 
means of gaining attention no weapons were found only a warning 
pistol unable to shoot bullets they were arrested and charged with 
faking a criminal act but were not kept in jail 
austrian television said of the turks at first they were 
prime suspects in a possible plot 
officials said the men whose names were not released were 
arrested two days before john pauls arrival and had been freed by 
the time the pontiff arrived last thursday the men face maximum 
punishment of six months in jail or a fine 
they are now free in austria blecha said this 
investigation is closed we investigated and we determined that 
these two men were not members of the gray wolves during the papal 
visit there was no attempted assassination 
he said the hoax resulted from the men craving attention but 
offered no further explanation of their motives 
the interior minister who oversees many police and security 
functions said the plot was intended to grab the attention of 
the world news media 
interior ministry spokesman karl newole said tuesday afternoon 
it was an attempt to become worldfamous the risk was small 
because even the potential maximum penalty for faking such a plot 
is small 
authorities said one of the men told police on june 13 that the 
other planned to assassinate john paul outside st stephens 
cathedral where the pope said mass the man showed pictures of a 
building under construction from which he said the shots would be 
fired 
investigation showed the men to be accomplices in a hoax the 
officials said

mikhail s gorbachev made a rare public criticism 
of soviet foreign policy tuesday saying a narrow circle of 
kremlin leaders once made decisions without weighing the outcome 
for the people or consulting with allies 
gorbachev made the remarks during a televised kremlin speech 
attended by among others president andrei a gromyko who served 
as foreign minister for nearly three decades under gorbachevs 
predecessors staterun television did not show gromykos reaction 
to the remarks 
gorbachev opening a nationwide communist party conference 
appeared to target the reign of president leonid i brezhnev in his 
criticism of past soviet diplomatic moves although he offered no 
specifics 
one cannot but admit that the command and administrative 
methods did not bypass the foreign policy sphere gorbachev said 
referring to the bureaucracy one of his favorite targets 
under brezhnev sovietled warsaw pact forces entered 
czechoslovakia in 1968 to put down that countrys reformminded 
leadership and the kremlin sent troops and tanks into afghanistan 
in 1979 only to see them bog down in a protracted war with moslem 
guerrillas 
it happened that even the most important decisions were 
adopted by a narrow circle of persons without a collective and 
allaround study and analysis and sometimes also without a proper 
consultation with friends gorbachev said this resulted in an 
inadequate reaction to international events and the policy of other 
states and sometimes in mistaken decisions 
unfortunately he added the price for the people or the 
possible outcome of some variant of action was not always weighed

awaiting a verdict on charges they sold toxic rapeseed oil that 
killed 621 people 
the threejudge panel that presided over the 15month trial 
dubbed spains trial of the century by the press was expected

fraud 
about 25000 people told health authorities they fell ill after

nazi hunters on tuesday handed the british 
government a list of 13 alleged war criminals who fled to britain 
saying it was new evidence the country harbored nazi collaborators 
to assist with antisoviet intelligence 
rabbi marvin hier of the nazihunting simon wiesenthal center 
submitted the list of white russians now aged 63 to 89 to a 
twoman legal panel appointed by the government the list showed 
all but three were policemen 
the home office said it will try to trace the men on the list 
which brings to 31 the number of suspects submitted to the panel by 
the los angelesbased wiesenthal center 
the panel also has received from other sources the names of 84 
other suspected nazi collaborators of which 18 have been traced to 
british addresses 
hier said researchers stumbled on the new list last week while 
sifting through british government records for traces of members of 
adolf hitlers notorious ss who escaped to canada via britain after 
world war ii 
hier said some of the suspects addresses in british prisoner of 
war camps were first submitted by the soviet ambassador in november 
1947 
the soviet sheet of charges showed most of the 13 were accused 
of taking part in mass murders and deportations in nazioccupied 
soviet territory in 1941 and 1942 
but the researchers found a december 1947 reply from ernest 
bevin the foreign secretary in britains first postwar 
government telling the soviet ambassador that none of the men 
could be traced despite an exhaustive search 
this is incredible said hier in london to hand over the 
evidence 
the soviet embassy provided specific details of what each and 
every one of these men had done and where they were down to post 
box and street numbers and the british in their own country 
couldnt find them hier said in an interview 
hier gave a photocopy of the list to the associated press with 
the names blanked out the centers usual policy is to release 
names only to government investigators 
the wiesenthal center which has long accused britain of 
footdragging over fugitive nazis and their collaborators also 
produced a 1983 letter from prime minister margaret thatchers 
government saying britain has not felt obliged to deport suspected 
war criminals since 1950 
now we know why inquiries made about nazi war criminals from 
the beginning were left hanging said hier it was the cold war 
and they were interested in countering communism they wanted to 
play ball with the nazi criminals 
a foreign office spokesman said he could not comment on the 
letter dated dec 21 1983 from a foreign office minister 
baroness young to a rankandfile lawmaker patrick ground 
ground had inquired about a native estonian whose extradition 
the soviets sought in 1960 saying he perpetrated atrocities 
against jews and antigerman partisans as head of the nazirun 
secret police in estonia which now is now part of the soviet union 
baroness young acknowledged the estonian had lived in britain 
since 1947 and that britain had refused to extradite him he was 
sentenced to death in his absence by a soviet court in march 1961 
baroness young added that in december 1950 britain told the 
united nations war crimes commission we considered we had 
discharged our obligations with regard to the surrender of alleged 
war criminals we no longer regarded ourselves under an 
obligation to deport such persons 
a foreign office spokesman said he could not comment on the 1947 
exchanges 
i think its a case that whatever mr bevin said at the time 
speaks for itself said the spokesman who in accordance with 
british practice declined to be identified 
the twomember british panel appointed by the british government 
in february consists of sir thomas heatherington a former british 
director of prosecutions and william chambers a former crown 
agent a senior government official in scotland 
the inquiry expected to last about a year will recommend 
whether britain should pass laws to allow prosecutions in britain 
for crimes committed in another country 
the most publicized british case submitted to the panel is that 
of lithuanianborn antanas gecas whom the wisenthal center and the 
soviet authorities say was involved in the murders of thousands of 
jews gecas who lives in edinburgh denies the allegations but 
acknowledges he witnessed killings 
the wiesenthal center has identified 400 suspected war criminals 
in eight western countries including the united states canada 
australia and west germany

an incident at an illinois nuclear plant that 
could have jeopardized safety has prompted a nationwide alert 
affecting 37 reactors the nuclear regulatory commission said 
tuesday 
in the event march 9 at the lasalle plant owned by commonwealth 
edison co at ottawa ill two pumps that circulate water through 
a reactor were shut off when the plant was operating at about 85 
percent of full power the nrc said 
the incident produced an uncontrolled power fluctuation in which 
power increased to 118 pecent of the reactors rated capacity 
before the system automatically shut down the commission said 
since this kind of event had not occurred previously in a 
licensed power reactor in this country though it had been 
calculated that it could occur the generic safety implications 
were not readily apparent the nrc said 
although commonwealth edison was not at fault and handled the 
situation properly the problem could have been serious nrc 
spokesman frank ingram said 
he originally speculated that unchecked the incident could 
have resulted in a meltdown however an engineer on the commission 
staff said the risk was not so great 
we didnt know how much worse the situation could get and 
there was the potential not likely but the potential of fuel 
damage said ashok thadani the nrcs assistant director of 
engineering and systems technology but a whole lot of other 
things have to go wrong before you worry about a radiation 
release 
edison spokeswoman deborah vestal dismissed either scenario as 
speculation 
obviously you want to look at all your possibilities she 
said but theres always the possibility that nothing would have 
happened it could have subsided by itself 
she said both pumps inadvertently were shut down at the same 
time during routine calibration of instruments and the mixture of 
cold and hot water in the reactor system when the pumps started 
again caused the power fluctuation 
at the instant we knew what was occurring and we knew what to 
do to cease it thats what was done ms vestal said there 
was no damage to the fuel there was no release of radiation there 
was no suffering at the plant 
ingram called the incident a fluke occurrence that could happen 
without warning at any of the 37 us reactors using boiling water 
some use pressurized water to turn their turbines 
he said the nrc has notified other plants using boilingwater 
reactors about the lasalle incident and asked them to make sure 
their operators are briefed so they can recognize the conditions 
leading up to uncontrolled power changes and know how to handle 
them

frightened relatives of four people slain in what 
authorities say may be a polygamist sect dispute were being guarded 
by police tuesday to thwart the possibility of further bloodshed 
police were hunting for the killers of an 8yearold girl and 
three onetime followers of the late polygamist patriarch ervil 
lebaron three people were shot at pointblank range monday in 
houston and one was ambushed in the dallas suburb of irving 
were looking at the strong possibility that someone of that 
cult may have done the killing houston police spokesman al baker 
said tuesday 
duane chynoweth 31 and his daughter jennifer were slain 
about 4 pm monday in a pickup truck parked outside a vacant house 
in houston chynoweth was shot several times in the head while the 
girl was shot once in the face said police spokesman dan turner 
chynoweth apparently was delivering an appliance to the house 
police were trying to determine who arranged for the delivery 
about the same time chynoweths brother mark 36 was found 
shot to death at an appliance business a few miles away turner 
said mark chynoweth was lebarons soninlaw 
in irving eddie marston 32 one of lebarons stepsons also 
was found shot to death shortly after 4 pm 
family members in houston under heavy police guard were 
brought to police headquarters late monday for questioning 
were making some arrangements with family members to ensure 
that they are safe baker said adding that he did not know how 
many people were involved he said the family was cooperating fully 
with the investigation no arrests had been made 
a witness to the slayings of duane and jennifer chynoweth told 
police that shortly after chynoweth arrived at the house two men 
in a latemodel black or darkcolored pickup truck drove up and got 
out there was a short exchange of words and then a flurry of 
gunfire the witness said 
lebarons church of the lamb of god split into several groups 
after he died in prison in 1981 polygamist sects broke off from 
the mormon church when it outlawed multiple marriages in 1890 
turner said duane chynoweth was a polygamist but he had no 
information about mark chynoweth

for the 1977 murder of rival polygamist leader rulin allred 
marston and mark chynoweth were acquitted in allreds slaying 
marston also was acquitted in the 1975 slaying of another 
polygamist leader 
lillian chynoweth told the salt lake city tribune last october 
she was worried lebaron left a book of new covenants written 
while in prison which his sons are using as a blueprint for 
vengeance 
she said the writings included a list of people my father 
thought needed to be killed 
she said she and her husband were on the list and asked that her

turkish president kenan evren said tuesday his 
country needs more military aid and he complained that proposed 
congressional resolutions on the killing of armenians in turkey 
distort history and encourage terrorism 
the risks shouldered by turkey are much beyond her fair 
share evren said in a national press club address adding that 
american awareness of turkey falls short of what would reasonably 
be expected regarding an ally of 40 years 
situated in one of the most critical regions of the world 
turkey shares the longest border with the soviet union guards the 
strategic turkish straits and maintains the largest nato army after 
the us he said 
even though turkey has the lowest income of the nato countries 
its defense spending puts it among the top four nations in the 
16member alliance evren said 
he also appealed for the removal of us trade barriers to 
turkish exports of textiles apparel and steel 
evren said he preferred less aid more trade as a way of 
enabling turkey to obtain more income to pay for its military 
modernization 
he spoke in turkish his speech and answers to subsequent 
questions were translated simultaneously by an interpreter 
evrens references were as specific as he has been in public 
during his state visit about turkish complaints over cutbacks in 
us aid he didnt broach the subject during formal speeches at 
the white house on monday when he met with president reagan 
in exchange for the use of turkish bases us officials have 
pledged to the turkish goverment to make their best effort to 
persuade congress to provide sufficient aid to help the turkish 
military to modernize its forces 
but congress at the urging of the greekamerican lobby has 
consistently trimmed the request to keep it in line with aid to 
rival ally greece 
in recent years the administration sought about 800 million 
annually in military aid but congress reduced that to about 600 
million 
this year turkey said it needed 12 billion in us military 
aid but because of budget constraints the reagan administration 
sought only 570 million and congress cut that to 520 million 
evren canceled plans for a state visit to the united states last 
year in large part because of turkish anger over the aid cuts he 
also was displeased by a proposed congressional resolution 
condemning the alleged massacre of up to 25 million armenians in 
turkish territory during world war ii 
the turkish people are most sensitive to efforts to promote 
passage by your congress of resolutions that distort history and 
encourage terrorism evren said in a national press club address 
the resolutions he said encouraged armenian terrorists who 
have killed 40 turkish diplomats and injured about 400 people he 
added that armenians however have rejected terrorism in the 
past couple of years 
evren disputed armenian charges of genocide and said armenians 
incited by the russian army had first massacred turkish people

a fireworks manufacturer has won its 
case with the interstate commerce commission to force united parcel 
service to deliver class c fireworks to customers in other states 
the icc board voted 32 on monday to strike down a ups policy 
that permitted it to refuse to ship fireworks on grounds that too 
many states have conflicting regulations on fireworks shipment 
the icc order reverses an earlier decision to uphold the 
delivery service policy in late 1987 
bob kenney a ups spokesman said it was too early to comment 
richard streeter a lawyer for bj alan of youngstown and 24 
other fireworks companies in the case said the ruling would force 
ups to resume delivery to outofstate customers because the 
service is a common carrier holding a virtual monopoly on 
inexpensive parcel delivery to homes 
when they ups pulled the plug there was no reasonable 
alternative for the fireworks companies federal express was the 
only thing that saved the companies but they were just too 
expensive for most customers 
he said federal express would charge about 25 for a parcel of 
fireworks that could be delivered for 5 or 6 by ups 
he said the shipping ban extended only to fireworks and none of 
the other 34 categories of class c explosives including ammunition 
and explosive rivets 
bruce j zoldan president of bj alan said the policy cost 
the company an estimated 40 percent of its mailorder sales and 
forced the layoff of about 100 seasonal workers he said mailorder 
sales account for about one fourth of the companys business

the selective service system entered its 
ninth year of peacetime registration of drafteligible young men 
tuesday with a roll call of 137 million and a compliance rate of 
97 percent its director said 
samuel k lessey attending a training conference tuesday in 
orlando said the federal agency was proud of its success in the 
eight years since congress reinstituted registration for every 
male citizen between the ages of 18 and 26 
peacetime registration ensures that untrained manpower can be 
delivered to the armed forces quickly in a time of national 
emergency lessey told a news conference it also ensures a 
fair and equitable system to establish a priority of call he 
said 
lessey said florida and 15 other states were helping the 
compliance rate by passing legislation denying student financial 
aid to those who do not sign up the 1988 florida legislature also 
passed a bill requiring registration for anyone seeking state 
employment or promotion if already employed 
procrastination lack of information and ignorance are the main 
reasons for failing to register lessey said adding we dont 
notice any particular opposition to registration 
youths failing to register within 30 days of their 18th birthday 
face a felony charge punishable by five years in prison and a fine 
of 250000 
our biggest task is to assure that the 5000 men who turn 18 
every day are aware of the registration requirement lessey said

the high command is meeting with 
hundreds of officers to analyze the military situation in nicaragua 
as a truce with usbacked rebels runs out the defense department 
said tuesday 
the governmentdeclared truce ends thursday night a day after 
us secretary of state george p shultz is scheduled to arrive in 
the region for a round of consultations with four central american 
presidents 
the department called the meetings between defense minister 
humberto ortega and his commanders extremely important it said 
such meetings are held only in extraordinary circumstances 
it gave no details ortega is the brother of president daniel 
ortega 
the rebels known as contras rejected the leftist sandinista 
governments offer for more peace talks but offered to extend the 
truce indefinitely 
the government who said this week that 3000 contra fighters had 
started filtering across the border from honduras has not said if 
it will prolong the fragile truce 
both sides have accused the other of violating the agreement 
nicaragua has been at relative peace since march 23 when the 
contras and sandinistas agreed to the first in a series of 
ceasefires and peace talks 
the talks fell apart on june 9 with the two sides unable to 
agree on rebel disarmament and sandinista democratic reforms 
since then the sandinistas proposed a formal round of talks in 
managua on a lasting peace or informal discussions on the 
ceasefire in miami the contras rejected both offers 
the highlevel military meetings came as president ortega was on 
his first official visit to cuba 
the sandinista newspaper barricada said ortegas visit will 
deepen latin america unity against the traditionally aggressive 
policies of the united states 
in a clandestine broadcast monitored in managua tuesday the 
contras radio liberacion accused ortega and cuban president fidel 
castro of holding secret talks about crushing sandinista 
opponents 
the nicaraguan opposition newspaper la prensa called ortegas 
visit to havana inopportune and said it might encourage the 
united states to resume military aid to the contras 
cuba gave ortega its highest award monday night the order of 
jose marti 
in his acceptance speech ortega said the sandinistas will 
never sacrifice our revolutionary democratic process even if the 
united states orders new terrorist actions against nicaragua 
he said that while the sandinistas intend to continue fighting 
and confronting yankee aggression energetically they still want 
to find a negotiated end to the conflict imposed on us by the 
united states 
the united states has been funding the contras since 1981 two 
years after the sandinistas took power the war has killed more 
than 26000 people and has wrecked the nicaraguan economy 
shultz is leaving wednesday afternoon for guatemala city he 
ends his central american visit friday after consulting with 
officials from guatemala costa rica honduras and el salvador

president reagans top arms control advisers 
debated but failed to reach agreement tuesday on how to respond to 
a soviet radar installation they say violates the 1972 
antiballistic missile treaty sources said 
we dont know what approach we want to take said one 
administration official speaking on condition of anonymity 
the administration has been complaining since 1983 that the 
radar violates abm treaty provisions that such devices be located 
near the soviet border and aim outward conditions designed to 
prevent deployment of a nationwide ballistic missile defense 
at the recent summit in moscow us officials said that until 
the issue was resolved they would not sign a proposed strategic 
arms reduction treaty to slash longrange nuclear arsenals by up to 
50 percent 
soviet leaders repeated their claim that the radar was intended 
to track objects in space but last october in apparent response 
to us complaints they suspended construction of the incomplete 
radar facility at krasnoyarsk 
before the meeting on tuesday state department officials 
including arms control negotiator paul nitze advocated a formula 
designed to leave the soviets a graceful exit from the impasse the 
russians would complete no further work on the radar and the 
americans would determine that it was not a significant 
violation of the treaty according to administration sources 
defense department officials and some hardliners in the state 
department including arms control adviser edward rowny want 
reagan to declare the radar a material breach of the pact and 
to announce a tough response 
neither position prevailed at the session tuesday and the issue 
will be considered at a future meeting or decided by the president 
sources said 
a white house spokesman roman popadiuk said details of the 
meeting would not be made public 
sometime before oct 2 the joint ussoviet standing 
consultative commission created under the abm treaty is due to 
meet to review the pact said william f burns head of the us 
arms control and disarmament agency 
i believe the review process will deal primarily with the 
issues as we see them under the abm treaty and the primary issues 
are those issues of soviet violation primarily the krasnoyarsk 
radar burns told an american bar association conference on arms 
control verification issues 
other administration sources speaking on condition of 
anonymity said burns met tuesday with other arms control aides 
including presidential assistants nitze rowny and max kampelman 
and assistant defense secretary ronald lehman 
burns declined to discuss the issue in detail saying i 
really cant say anything more about that right now 
some administration officials want the us government to 
declare that the soviets have violated the abm pact and on that 
basis conduct more extensive tests of sensors designed as part of 
the strategic defense initiative or star wars sources said 
administration critics have argued that such tests would violate 
the abm pact and reagan so far has refrained from implementing a 
socalled broad interpretation of the treaty which would allow 
more extensive testing 
the soviets have said they will not sign a strategic arms 
reduction treaty unless the united states agrees to abide by the 
abm pact for another 10 years 
for the past two years congress has barred the executive branch 
from spending any money on sdi tests that would violate the 
traditional or narrow interpretation of the abm pact

the senate commerce committee approved a bill 
tuesday making the federal aviation administration an independent 
agency a change designed to make the government more responsive to 
aviation industry problems 
the measure sponsored by sen wendell ford dky chairman of 
the senate aviation subcommittee was sent to the full chamber by a 
144 vote 
its chances of passage by the senate appear strong because ford 
gathered 57 cosponsors but prospects of passage in the house seem 
weaker because some leading members including rep norman mineta 
dcalif chairman of the house aviation subcommittee have 
questioned the bills premise 
the legislation would pull the faa out of the department of 
transportation where it has been since the department was created 
in 1966 ford has argued that the transportation department 
heeding the reagan administrations efforts to cut federal 
spending has restrained the faa from aggressively embarking on 
various programs 
in a prepared statement after the bill was approved ford said 
the legislation would end a situation in which the faa is being 
strangled in the name of politics by the secretary of 
transportation and the evermeddling departmental staff 
opponents have said the measure actually would weaken the faa by 
removing the cabinetlevel clout it now has as a part of the 
transportation department 
in addition they have said an independent faa would be too 
sympathetic to aviation industry groups such as airlines and 
small plane owners which would no longer have to contend with 
transportation department officials industry officials have long 
called for an independent faa 
the legislation would give the chief of the faa a sevenyear 
term the administrator currently serves at the pleasure of the 
president 
it would allow the faa to increase by 10 percent or more the 
salaries of its air traffic controllers and other employees who 
work in sections of the country with high costs of living the 
agency has complained that it has difficulty finding workers 
willing to transfer to those parts of the country 
in addition it would allow the agency to streamline its 
procedures for purchasing equipment faa officials have said their 
efforts to acquire modern equipment are slowed by federal 
procurement rules 
in a report completed in april the presidents aviation safety 
commission recommended that the faa be removed from the 
transportation department

in the occupied west bank and gaza strip underground leaflets 
called for a strike and protests on the 21st anniversary of 
israels annexation of arab east jersualem which israel captured 
in the 1967 middle east war along with the west bank and gaza 
soldiers used roadblocks in the west bank to stop palestinians 
from entering jerusalem at one checkpoint on the road from 
bethlehem a large sign said in pink arabic letters it is 
forbidden to go to jerusalem

the reagan administration on tuesday 
reaffirmed the us commitment to israels security but told 
defense minister yitzhak rabin the jewish state should not use 
violence to quell palestinian unrest in the occupied territories 
neither should violence nor controls on violence become ends 
in themselves making a political solution more difficult the 
white house said in a statement summing up rabins talks with 
president reagan vice president george bush national security 
adviser colin l powell and other officials 
the statement also urged israel to show more flexibility in the 
us push for a middle east peace settlement although rabin and 
foreign minister shimon peres of the labor party have expressed 
general support for the us peace initiative prime minister 
yitzhak shamir has shown little enthusiasm for it 
realism and a willingness to nurture rather than reject 
possible opportunities for peace are essential as is a climate 
that makes negotiations possible the white house statement said 
the administration has been reluctant to criticize israels use 
of force against palestinians in the occupied west bank and gaza 
strip where 210 palestinians and four israeli settlers have been 
killed since arab unrest began in december 
in its statement the white house said while israel should 
not be expected to make concessions under the threat of violence

avoiding political discourse with the palestinians of the west bank 
and gaza

romania ordered the immediate closure of 
a hungarian consulate on tuesday and expelled the consular staff 
the hungarian state news agency mti reported in a widening rift 
between the two communist neighbors 
the action was unprecedented in recent soviet bloc diplomatic 
history romania and hungary are military allies in the sovietled 
warsaw pact 
the decision to close the hungarian general consulate in 
clujnapoca was apparently prompted by a demonstration of about 
50000 hungarians in budapest monday night to protest a project 
calling for demolition of 7000 romanian villages including ethnic 
hungarian communities by the year 2000 
clujnapoca is a city in transylvania in northwestern romania 
where most of the 17 million ethnic hungarians live hungarians 
know it as kolozsvar 
ethnic hungarians have long complained about alleged 
discrimination and denial of ethnic rights they form the largest 
minority group in east europe outside the soviet union 
mti said foreign minister ioan totu called in hungarian 
ambassador pal szucs on tuesday and told him romania considers 
operation of the consulate as terminated with immediate effect 
according to mti romania demanded that the staff leave the 
territory of romania within 48 hours 
romanian president nicolae ceausescu on tuesday rejected all 
criticism of his village demolition program and accused hungarian 
authorities of actively supporting the unofficial protest 
in a speech to the romanian communist partys central committee 
in bucharest ceausescu hinted that he may direct the hungarian 
embassy in budapest to scale down operations following the protest 
rally 
the resettlement plan calls for 7000 of romanias 13000 
villages to be torn down and replaced with agriculturalindustrial 
centers romanian staterun media said the goal is to gain more 
farmland for use by the countrys collectivized agriculture which 
is plagued by lack of incentives for farmers and livestock fodder 
shortages 
the protesters monday night filed quietly past the romanian 
embassy in the biggest unofficial rally in hungary since the 1956 
hungarian uprising police did not interfere 
the hungarian government newspaper magyar hirlap on tuesday 
praised the marchers discipline 
but ceausescu denounced new actions of a chauvinistic 
nationalistic antiromanian antisocialist nature in hungary 
he told the party meeting yesterday a new manifestation was 
organized with the agreement and as stated even by news coming 
from hungary under the aegis of the official party and state 
bodies of hungary the state news agency agerpres reported 
as reported by agerpres ceausescu also sought to depict the 
growing chorus of hungarian protests as means to make people forget 
about hungarys serious economic problems 
the mti agency said responsibility for violating the consular 
agreement lies with romania it added that this severe romanian 
measure will not divert hungary from its principled policy 
aimed at deepening friendship between the hungarian and romanian 
peoples strengthening the connecting role of the nationalities 
living in their countries 
both the hungarian government and speakers at mondays rally 
made it clear that a change of existing borders is out of the 
question under the 1920 trianon treaty predominantly hungarian 
transylvania became part of romania 
hungarys premier and communist party chief karoly grosz is 
scheduled to visit romania probably in late summer 
ceausescu said issues between the two parties and countries must 
be solved exclusively by way of talks in a spirit of equality 
respect and noninterference in the domestic affairs of either 
country

a lawsuit challenging attorney general edwin 
meese iiis plan to conduct random drug testing of justice 
department officials was filed tuesday by 42 employees mostly 
trial attorneys and several supervisors 
the lawsuit contends that random drug testing of employees in 
sensitive jobs is an unconstitutional invasion of privacy that 
violates the fourth amendments ban on unreasonable searches 
the suit filed a day after the justice department announced 
plans to begin random testing in two months also contends that the 
program is being implemented without any factual showing of a 
problem of drug use in the department 
the plan is arbitrary capricious and abuse of discretion 
because it would not require any suspicion that a particular 
individual has used drugs prior to testing and would subject 
employees to urinalysis tests for drug use even though such tests 
do not indicate whether employees are impaired in their job 
performance by drug use said the lawsuit filed by former 
maryland attorney general stephen h sachs who has also served as 
a us attorney in the state 
the 42 plaintiffs named in the suit were mostly justice 
department trial attorneys plus several supervisors including 
three deputy chiefs of the civil rights divisions criminal 
section barry kowalski daniel l bell and norajean m flanagan 
arthur spitzer an american civil liberties union attorney 
involved in the case said he had spoken to a number of other 
justice department officials who privately supported the lawsuit 
but didnt want to join it for fear of hurting their careers 
the drug testing plan is part of the reagan administrations 
program for a drugfree workplace in the federal government 
random drug testing has been challenged by a number of federal 
employee groups 
several federal appellate courts have upheld various kinds of 
drug testing programs but these courts have yet to rule 
definitively on challenges to widespread random drug testing of 
federal workers under the drugfree workplace program 
the us circuit court of appeals in washington is scheduled to 
hear arguments next fall on challenges to drug testing of 
transportation department and civilian army employees 
the same court ruled last year that the invasion of privacy 
entailed by testing could not be justified if the test didnt 
produce evidence that employees were impaired by drug use while on 
the job

teenage male prostitute whose body was found cut into pieces that 
were scattered as far as 200 miles apart 
max bernard franc stood calmly beside his attorney mark 
kaiserman as the verdict was read in a silent courtroom he showed 
no immediate reaction to the verdict but leaned forward to listen 
closely as the jurys decision was announced 
jurors deliberated 2 days before returning their verdict 
the victim tracy leroy nute was an 18yearold runaway from 
kansas city mo who came to california to be a movie star and 
wound up working as a prostitute

named terry adams adams never was found and the prosecutor 
claimed he was a phantom invented by franc 
forensic experts found traces of blood throughout francs west 
hollywood apartment as well as in his car the murder weapon was 
found in francs university office and a motorist identified franc 
as the man he saw sitting in a car near a freeway offramp where 
body parts were found 
during the fourweek trial witnesses described the bespectacled 
defendant as a sissy his lawyer argued that franc had neither 
the physical strength nor the personality necessary to commit the 
killing 
testimony about francs lifestyle disclosed the double life he 
had lived for years in fresnohe was a conservative public 
administration professor but in west hollywood he was a homosexual 
voyeur who paid young men to be photographed in sexual poses 
during their deliberations jurors played tapes of francs 
interviews with police after his arrest

had killed with his car later he claimed the dog belonged to 
underworld figures and adams used the saw to cut up the mafia 
dog ultimately he said adams shot nute in his apartment and used 
the saw to dismember the body

the judge in the irancontra conspiracy case 
was accused tuesday of unfairly denying oliver l north the chance 
to prove that his congressional testimony was illegally used 
against him by prosecutors 
lawyers for the fired white house aide charged that us 
district judge gerhard a gesell placed speed before fundamental 
fairness by ruling the case should go to trial without further 
proceedings on the issue of congressional immunity given north and 
two codefendants 
gesells procedures for conducting his inquiry and the reasoning 
behind his conclusions are most notable for their arbitrariness 
their superficiality and their unprecedented denial of due 
process said the brief filed by norths lawyers brendan v 
sullivan jr and barry simon 
the procedures employed stand as a striking departure from 
this courts long tradition of fair and evenhanded adjudication 
the brief said in one of several scathing attacks on the judges 
handling of the immunity question 
north former national security adviser john m poindexter and 
arms dealer albert hakim all claimed that independent counsel 
lawrence e walsh made impermissible use of the testimony they gave 
congressional hearings last year under grants of limited immunity 
from prosecution 
gesell has rejected defense motions to dismiss charges against 
the three on the ground that walshs investigation was tainted by 
exposure to widespread publicity of the trios congressional 
testimony 
to counter some of the legal problems posed by immunity gesell 
also ordered that north poindexter hakim and retired air force 
maj gen richard v secord be tried separately on charges of 
conspiring to illegally divert profits from the usiran arms 
sales to the nicaraguan rebels 
secord testified on capitol hill without an immunity grant 
in their latest pleading norths lawyers said they found most 
shocking the judges outright refusal to allow the defense to 
present witnesses at an april 25 hearing to determine whether 
walshs staff was exposed to congressional testimony 
the judge was also criticized for abruptly canceling a 
subsequent hearing on the issue of whether the defendants 
immunized congressional testimony was used by government lawyers to 
prepare federal officials before appearances before the irancontra 
grand jury 
at the outset of the april 25 hearing gesell said he would not 
allow the defense to present testimony because it had violated his 
orders by subpoenaing government officials and a wide range of 
documents for the proceeding 
gesell abruptly canceled the june 13 hearing after similar 
subpoenas for documents were issued by defense lawyers in both 
cases the judge quashed the subpoenas at the request of walsh 
in their latest filing norths lawyers said they had evidence 
that attorneys for the cia the white house and the state and 
justice departments relied upon the immunized testimony to 
prepare government officials for questioning by the irancontra 
grand jury 
evidence to support this claim was filed under seal by the 
defense lawyers 
in his june 16 opinion gesell said his findings on the immunity 
issue were provisional and depended on what happened during norths 
trial the judge said he would convene a posttrial hearing on the 
issue if such a proceeding were necessary 
in an separate and highly unusual motion norths lawyers moved 
to strike from the record gesells unjustified criticism of 
defense counsel during a june 6 hearing 
during the proceeding gesell said defense lawyers had not told 
the court that secord had been inteviewed 10 times by walshs 
office gesell said he had discovered it buried in a footnote in 
a brief 
when secords attorney thomas green told the judge that no one 
attempted to mislead the court gesell replied i didnt suggest 
you did i said that i was surprised that you did 
in their pleading norths lawyers said gesell had been informed 
of secords meetings with walshs staff on three previous occasions

gary michael heidnik committed horrible 
acts by chaining women and torturing them two until they died but 
he is insane not guilty of firstdegree murder his lawyer said 
tuesday in closing arguments 
the prosecutor however argued heidnik knew what he was doing 
and he knew it was wrong 
this man conducted repeated sadistic acts on six defenseless 
persons assistant district attorney charles gallagher said 
what he did was premeditated deliberate murder 
following tuesdays closing arguments the jury will be given 
instructions wednesday before beginning deliberations the jury was 
selected in pittsburgh because of intense publicity about the case 
in eastern pennsylvania 
gallagher pressed for a firstdegree murder conviction for 
which heidnik could face a death sentence the prosecutor also 
sought convictions on six counts of kidnapping five counts of 
rape four of aggravated assault and one of abuse of a corpse 
heidnik 44 was arrested in march 1987 after one captive 
escaped from heidniks car and alerted police he is accused of 
luring women to his basement torture chamber where he chained them 
and raped them repeatedly in hopes of breeding a superior race 
between november 1986 and his arrest 
he used a chain saw to cut up the remains of one woman and then 
fed the remains mixed with dog food to the other women according 
to police and trial testimony the body of the second woman was 
found in the woods in new jersey 
all four survivors testified about their experiences during the 
sevenday trial in common pleas court 
the bearded heidnik wearing the black flowered hawaiianstyle 
sport shirt he has worn most days ignored the lawyers tuesday 
a person who holds women captive in chains and kills two of 
them and feeds them dog food and human flesh is insane argued 
heidniks lawyer a charles peruto jr what was his purpose to 
raise 10 babies from 10 different women in his basement does that 
make sense 
even though we have conceded he committed those horrible acts 
we have not conceded firstdegree murder peruto argued 
the commonwealth says the defendant fooled all the doctors 
that he faked schizophrenia for 25 years if you dont believe that 
you have to say he was insane certainly he knew he was hiding the 
bodies certainly he knew what he was doing but he thought it was 
right 
gallagher challenged the reliability of medical experts who said 
heidnik was mentally ill two experts testified for the defense 
saying that heidnik was schizophrenic and had been in and out of 
mental institutions over 20 years 
if you rely on the evidence you will realize that this man is 
not legally insane and that he is guilty beyond a reasonable 
doubt gallagher said 
he repeatedly raped these girls for his own sadistic sexual 
pleasure how was he described when sandra lindsay died he was 
obsessed but not sorry and when debbie dudley was electrocuted he 
wasnt unhappy 
does this show he was psychotic i say it does not 
gallagher said what he did was premeditated deliberate murder 
reject the very idea that this man is legally insane 
peruto said the actions gallagher outlined proved heidnik was 
out of touch with reality 
when he cut up that woman with a hacksaw what kind of person 
is that and then eating some of the flesh and wrapping up the 
rest and putting it into his freezer who was trying to impress 
when he did that was he faking a mental illness 
this case is about mental capability was the defendant able 
to plan killings did he intend to kill i say that he didnt he 
is insane and you cant get around it

workers with heavy machinery tore apart the 
wreckage of two commuter trains tuesday and found more bodies 
raising to 59 the number killed in a headon crash the railroad 
blamed on a brake problem 
officials of the staterun rail company said the veteran 
engineer on the runaway train realized his brakes werent working 
more than a mile from the busy gare de lyon station and warned his 
passengers to get to the back of the train before impact 
the rail company also disclosed that the engineer first realized 
there was a brake problem after the train had been stopped five 
miles from the accident site by a passenger who had pulled an 
emergency cord 
one of the 38 people injured in the crash was not freed from the 
wreckage until 5 am tuesday more than 10 hours after the 
accident at 710 pm monday and rescuers said she probably 
survived because the bodies around her protected her from the 
jagged metal 
an official of the rail company societe nationale des chemins de 
fer or sncf said he was certain it was a brake problem that sent 
an eightcar suburban train hurtling at 4050 mph into a stopped 
train an investigation was opened to determine the specific cause 
of the accident 
raoul viger spokesman for the fire and rescue workers said 55 
was the final number of dead but the company said later that 59 
were killed at least two victims died in the hospital of injuries 
suffered in the accident city emergency services reported 
viger said the young survivor was found conscious at 8 pm 
monday and wasnt freed until about nine hours later she did not 
need to have any of her limbs amputated 
firefighters who were exhausted after so many hours of working 
among the dead and suffering began to gather up their equipment 
tuesday afternoon after the trains were separated 
at the height of the operation 250 rescue workers struggled to 
pull survivors out and 40 fire engines 15 ambulances and a 
helicopter were at the station 
roger gerin the company official said at a news conference 
that daniel saulin the engineer of the moving train realized his 
brakes were malfunctioning when he was about 1 miles from the 
station and he communicated with the gare de lyon 
he told his passengers to change cars and go to the back of 
the train gerin said 
at 600 meters the train ran through an activated stop 
signal without the power to stop gerin said adding that saulin 
42 jumped free of the train and survived 
the engineer on the train in the station andre tanguy was 
killed in the crash railway spokesman francis boulanger said 
earlier reports that he escaped might have resulted from confusion 
with other rail employees who jumped from the train boulanger said 
tanguy was one of seven employees who died 
the rail agency the transport ministry and judicial authorities 
will conduct separate investigations into the crash said philippe 
rouvillois director general of the rail company they will 
exclude no hypothesis he said 
gerin said one certainty was that the origin of the accident 
was in difficulties with the braking system but we do not know the 
exact cause 
he said both engineers were well qualified and that saulin had 
14 years experience 
before the accident saulins train had made 15 stops and the 
brakes worked normally at each gerin said 
a passenger pulled an alarm signal causing the train to halt at 
vert de maisons a station five miles from paris that is not 
normally a stop gerin said 
during this 26minute stop the engineer experienced 
difficulty in trying to rearm the brake system but he resumed his 
trip he said 
there is a tie the nature of which we do not yet know 
between the use of the alarm signal emergency stop which had 
immobilized the train a short time before and the catastrophe 
in addition gerin said the stop at vert de maisons 
disorganized rail traffic and contributed to delays of many trains 
among them the other one involved in the accident 
gerin said trains undergo maintenance four times a year in 
addition to routine checks and the train that failed to stop was 
checked three days ago 
the last major train accident in paris was in january 1981 at 
the auber station when two suburban trains collided killing one 
person and injuring 71 
the third worst train accident in history occurred in france on 
dec 12 1917 when more than 550 were killed at st michel de 
maurienne the worst was in samastipur india june 5 1981 when 
900 died

tank created a deadly gas that killed four people and injured 20 
others at a metal platings plant tuesday 
one worker was in critical condition fifteen of the injured

affected by the gas because it can be absorbed through the skin 
said robert corkwell a hazardous materials officer with the 
indiana state police 
workers at bastian plating co who were cleaning a tank with an 
acid solution caused the toxic gas hydrogen cyanide to form 
officials said it had not been determined how that happened 
three to 4 inches of chemical residue and sludge were inside the 
tank at the time of the cleaning said corkwell an independent lab 
later determined that cyanides which could have come from the 
cleaning solution were present in the tank he said

the house on tuesday approved a bill designed 
to crack down on telemarketing fraud which is estimated to cost 
american consumers at least 1 billion a year 
by a voice vote the house passed the measure which directs the 
federal trade commission to draft rules governing sales by 
telephone and would make it easier to sue telemarketing companies 
the bill does not specify the content of the rules but says the 
agency should consider including provisions that establish refund 
rights for customers and a period during which consumers can 
withdraw their order and set a time of day when unsolicited calls 
can be made 
no piece of legislation is going to end fraud rep thomas 
a luken dohio said during debate on the bill monday but i 
think this bill will significantly reduce the losses now being 
suffered by american consumers 
the ftc estimates that telemarketing sales in 1986 amounted to 
more than 100 billion the agency however has been able to get 
back only about 25 million for defrauded consumers over the past 
four years he said 
under the bill states and private individuals would be able to 
sue telemarketing companies in federal court currently suits must 
be brought in state courts making it difficult to prosecute 
telemarketers that conduct interstate business which most 
companies do 
the measure will help legitimate telemarketing companies by 
removing the bad actors from the scene and restoring the confidence 
of the american consumer in the products they buy over the 
telephone said rep michael g oxley rohio

a 25yearold canadian charged 
with spying for the soviet union appeared in provincial court 
tuesday and opted for a trial by judge and jury on three counts of 
espionage 
stephen ratkai wearing plaid pants and a tshirt entered the 
courtroom in handcuffs under police escort spectators and 
reporters were searched at the door 
he was ordered held without bail until a preliminary hearing 
aug 29 
ratkai was arrested june 11 at a st johns hotel and charged 
under the official secrets act with trying to obtain us military 
secrets for the soviets 
born in nova scotia of a hungarian father and a canadian mother 
ratkai moved to hungary at an early age to live with his 
grandmother he returned to canada a few years later and has 
traveled to hungary several times since 
the canadian security intelligence service investigation focused 
on the us naval base at argentia newfoundland which monitors 
the movement of soviet submarines in the atlantic 
four days later prime minister brian mulroney expelled eight 
soviet diplomats and officials and barred nine others from 
returning to canada because of alleged espionage activities 
that led to a series of retaliatory expulsions and barrings by 
the two sides involving 32 of their representatives the exchange 
finally cooled off monday when foreign minister joe clark met 
soviet ambassador alexei rodionov in ottawa to begin to rebuild 
relations 
security sources linked the expulsions to the purported soviet 
attempt to infiltrate argentia and to parallel operations at 
paramax electronics in montreal a us subsidiary making guidance 
and communications systems for a new generation of canadian 
frigates

many defense contractors did a slipshod job of 
protecting classified information according to a pentagon study 
that thendefense secretary caspar weinberger tried to withhold 
from congress last year sources say 
the study by the defense investigative service found that only 
10 percent of the contractors surveyed had no deficiencies in the 
way they handled classified information related to special access 
programs the highest level of secrecy and more than half fell 
into categories that were either unsatisfactory or 
exceedingly serious 
the 80page report was done in response to a congressional 
demand in the wake of reports that lockheed one of the nations 
biggest defense contractors couldnt account for 1400 documents 
relating to the topsecret stealth airplane 
the dis study is not directly related to the current criminal 
investigation of the pentagon and defense contractors that probe 
centers on allegations that defense contractors and consultants 
many of whom are former military men bribed pentagon officials for 
information crucial to winning contracts worth billions of dollars 
the report is itself classified and has not been publicly 
released but its contents were described by sources who had access 
to the document 
the study was finished in april 1987 but weinberger refused to 
send it to capitol hill until last october 2 hours before a house 
panels vote to subpoena the document the sources said 
instead weinberger sent a june 17 1987 letter noting the 
study was finished and describing what he said were its contents 
weinberger wrote that security of classified information was 
outstanding in some contractors satisfactory in the vast 
majority and unsatisfactory in a few contractor locations 
the study painted a far different picture the sources said 
attempts to reach weinberger for an explanation were 
unsuccessful he did not return telephone calls to his law office 
seeking comment 
the study looked at 101 different programs at 603 contractor 
sites the sources said many of the facilities worked on more than 
one classified program 
the dis created five categories for assessing how contractors 
handled the highly classified data the lowest was unsatisfactory 
next lowest was major deficiencies then came letter of 
requirement which meant problems were discovered that had to be 
corrected with the remedies confirmed in writing secondbest was 
corrected on the spot and the best was no deficiencies the 
sources said 
only 10 percent of the contractors had no deficiencies the 
sources said six percent were rated unsatisfactory 47 percent had 
major deficiencies 34 percent had letter of requirement 
deficiencies and 3 percent had problems that were corrected on the 
spot 
weinbergers letter may have used some semantical logic by 
counting anyone who ranked above the lowest dis grade of 
unsatisfactory when he said security was satisfactory in 
the vast majority of contractor sites but that also would entail 
using the word satisfactory in regard to contractors whose 
deficiencies the dis itself labeled as exceedingly serious 
in the report the dis defined major deficiencies the grade 
given the largest group of contractors as deficiencies which 
were exceedingly serious and which resulted in the compromise of 
classified information or which could have logically led to a 
compromise if not properly corrected 
according to dis unsatisfactory meant the contractor 
appears to be either unwilling or unable to take prompt corrective 
action to safeguard classified information which appears to be in 
imminent danger 
weinberger has defended his pentagon tenure saying he wasnt 
responsible for abuses which occurred while he was defense 
secretary i dont have any basis whatever for saying i didnt do 
enough and i certainly dont feel culpableweinberger said 
sunday on an abctv show 
but rep john dingell dmich chairman of the house energy and 
commerce committee said on the same show we warned mr 
weinberger there were problems in the way contractors handled 
classified information 
between 1984 and 1986 the energy and commerce investigations 
subcommittee held 17 public hearings on defense contractors many 
of them focusing on specific weapons and contractors subcommittee 
records show 
the dis study originated in august 1986 when rep ron wyden 
dore won approval of an amendment to the fiscal 1987 budget bill 
requiring the review wyden is the ranking democrat on the 
subcommittee 
wyden said he wasnt satisfied by weinbergers june 17 letter 
because our subcommittee had been investigating this issue and 
his letter just didnt feel right i felt it was a whitewash and 
then we heard from some people over in the pentagon that 
weinbergers letter was far different from what the dis report 
said 
the dis report wasnt sent to capitol hill until oct 2 hours 
before the subcommittee was scheduled to vote on whether to try to 
subpoena the report the panel went ahead anyway and voted for the 
subpoena but the action was never ratified by the full committee 
or house because the report had already been sent wyden noted

the defense departments top contracting 
official irritated with the sensational conduct of federal 
agents looking for evidence of fraud last month tried to limit 
searches of defense plants by investigators looking for corruption 
the official robert costello undersecretary of defense for 
acquisiton wrote a memo to defense secrertary frank carlucci 
suggesting that top pentagon officials including himself be 
given veto power over searches of contractor facilities 
the suggestion to involve politically appointed pentagon 
officials in what is normally a law enforcement function was made 
in a may 5 memo a copy of which was obtained by the associated 
press 
costello is to testify wednesday at a house armed services 
committee investigation into the procurement process a hearing 
triggered by allegations of widespread corruption in the defense 
contracting industry 
costellos memo was written before the existence of a massive 
twoyear investigation of defense contract fraud became publicly 
known on june 14 
that probe has relied heavily on a series of nationwide searches 
of private consultants offices and contractor facilities in 
attempts looking for evidence of possible bribery of government 
officials in return for classified documents 
costellos idea was rejected by carlucci whose spokesman called 
the idea something carlucci doesnt want to be associated with 
the spokesman air force col david j shea acknowledged 
however that carlucci initially responded this is a good idea 
but he said that response referred to costellos suggestion to 
establish a training program for defense department investigators 
not to the prior approvalof search warrants 
costellos suggestion also was turned down by pentagon inspector 
general june gibbs brown according to a pentagon source speaking 
only on condition he not be named 
the source said ms brown indicated to mr carlucci the 
department of justice will not accept a procedure whereby use of 
search warrants by defense criminal investigative organizations 
would require concurrence of any official outside the office of 
inspector general 
costellos memo said the appropriate level of review andor 
approval should be at least deputy secretary of defense will taft 
or myself and quite possibly yourself 
costellos anger was triggered by a search feb 25 at the 
electronic amp space division of emerson electric co near st louis 
in a fraud investigation that is apparently not related to the 
nationwide probe 
the search was partly based on an affidavit by john e lake an 
agent of the defense criminal investigation service the company 
responded to the search with a court suit asking that it be 
declared unconstitutional 
in court papers filed by emerson the company said government 
agents lied or left out important information when they asked for a 
search warrant 
the governments application included an affidavit by lake who 
said that in october he began investigating fraudulent billings 
for contracts performed for the department of defense 
authorities said emerson violated federal law by billing the 
government for parts that were installed on vehicles the company 
was making for egypt under a separate contract 
emerson acknowledged it transferred the parts but said that it 
did so under a written borrow and pay back agreement with the 
government 
costello complained in his memo that only minimal 
consideration was given to executing the search warrant in a less 
sensational manner 
he complained that no prior notice was given to emersons 
attorneys and added to send 19 dcis agents one customs agent 
and several missouri state troopers directly to the plant appears 
to me to be an unwarranted show of force that invites sensational 
treatment in the press 
costello recommended that carlucci ask ms brown to develop a 
program within the igs office to train dod investigators on 
techniques to obtain evidence in the least forceful and sensational 
manner a suggestion that was accepted 
explaining carluccis views on costellos suggestion shea said 
the secretary does not agree that searches should be reviewed or 
approved by him mr taft or mr costello which might be perceived 
as interference in the conduct of criminal investigations 
but shea said carlucci has asked ms brown to develop a policy 
to ensure uniformity and consistency for searches on corporate 
premises by all defense criminal investigative organizations 
her suggestions approved by carlucci require that 
search warrant applications and affidavits are coordinated in 
advance with appropriate legal advisers 
clearances to use search warrants as an investigative technique 
are approved at an appropriate level within the defense criminal 
investigtive organizations 
searches be conducted in a manner that will balance the need 
for compliance with the need to ensure minimal disruption with 
contractor operations 
defense criminal investigative organizations receive adequate 
training regarding this policy

what could be better than a rain dance 
for the nations driest city how about a convention of the 
international carwash association 
a lot of people have the opinion that if i wash my car its 
going to rain so wed love to have everybody go out and wash 
their car and have it rain thatd be wonderful association 
president thomas j hoffman said with a laugh monday 
last week the national weather service said nashville had 
received only about 12 inches of rain so far this year about 135 
inches below normal the agency rated the city the nations driest 
based on the difference between normal rainfall and the actual 
level 
theres a lot of joking about that with the customers at 
home said jim russell of cincinnati who owns rainbow car wash 
theyll say they want to be a hero today and get their car washed 
so itll rain 
the threeday convention was expected to draw up to 8500 people 
by the time it ends wednesday about 175 exhibitors set up aisles 
and aisles of carwash equipment ranging from huge carscrubbing 
brushes to newfangled wax treatments 
willard scott the jovial weatherman on nbcs today show 
won enthusiastic applause during his keynote address when he 
recounted a story of once doing commercials for a washington dc 
carwash 
you never say partly cloudy and i always guaranteed 
whoever paid the bills for the sponsorship that wed always give 
him a good shot and wed never forecast rain when i did the 
weather scott said 
jokes aside scott said he was concerned about the drought 
my heart does go out to the farmers said scott who has a 
farm of his own in virginia 
hoffman said the carwash industry which lives and dies by the 
weather recognizes the problems arising from the extended drought 
throughout much of the country and has taken measures to conserve 
water 
we have that question put to us continuously about the 
drought as far as water consumption we are very very visible to 
the public he said but we use much much less water than 
someone washing their car at home 
many carwashes filter and reuse water to conserve hoffman said 
one of the things that we talk about here is how to conserve 
water through high pressure pumps he added we conserve water 
with what we call programmers to program the amount of water when 
the water goes on the car 
we have solenoids and control valves that put the proper 
amount of water and the proper amount of solutions on so that we do 
not waste because this is definitely something were as concerned 
about as everybody else is he said 
and contrary to the popular belief that carwash owners usually 
dont want rain they really do like rain said hoffman who owns 
hoffman car washes with 13 locations in albany ny 
see rain dirties cars so a certain amount of rain is good 
he said 
but we realize too that other people have to live and were 
sure not praying for no rain hoffman said 
we need rain just like everybody else we have landscaping 
around our places and its all burning up he said and several 
of our car washes are in communities where theres bans on 
watering our lawns are messed up just the same as everybody 
elses

nearly 150 guerrillas loyal to plo 
chairman yasser arafat were evacuated tuesday from a devastated 
refugee camp captured by syrianbacked rivals in a bloody power 
struggle 
palestine liberation organization leaders accused damascus of 
aiding and encouraging the dissident fatahuprising faction to 
crush arafats forces in lebanon 
they said that endangered a reconcilation effort between arafat 
and syrian president hafez assad to end a 5yearold feud over who 
controls the palestinian movement 
the last group of arafat loyalists emerged from chatilla refugee 
camp before dawn tuesday escorted by 30 libyan soldiers 
they were put in three trucks bound for sidon 25 miles south of 
beirut but were stopped on the way by a leftist lebanese militia 
that controls the city the militia later allowed the guerrillas to 
be driven in ambulances to the ein elhilweh palestinian camp on 
the citys outskirts 
a police spokesman said 13 guerrillas were hospitalized 
the bodies of two palestinians a man and his fiancee also were 
carried from chatilla on stretchers 
arafats mainstream fatah had battled the syrianbacked 
dissident fatahuprising faction since may 1 for control of 
chatilla and a nearby shantytown bourj elbarajneh in all 127 
people were killed and 527 wounded 
fatahuprising guerrillas led by col saeed mousa overran 
chatilla in a fierce 13hour battle monday that leveled what was 
left of the camp most of arafats 200 fighters then surrendered to 
syrian and libyan officers 
the plos executive committee on monday blamed assad for the 
fighting 
the londonbased mideast mirror newsletter on tuesday quoted 
salah khalaf arafats deputy as saying the beirut fighting 
constitutes a big setback for syrianpalestinian relations he 
said the syrians were driving the plo from beirut under a plan 
drawn up with us secretary of state george shultz the 
publication said 
the plan on which shultz and the syrians agreed provides for 
ridding west beirut of weapons and fighters the newsletter 
quoted khalaf as saying in a telephone interview from tunis where 
the plo has its headquarters 
khalaf claimed the plan was aimed at establishing a prosyrian 
government in lebanon it reported 
he also was quoted as accusing damascus of seeking to undermine 
arafat and eliminate the plo as a force under his leadership and of 
predicting that interpalestinian feuding is likely to erupt in 
south lebanon 
syria the main power broker in lebanon has thousands of troops 
enforcing security in west and south beirut but none made any 
attempt to stop the fighting for chatilla and bourj elbarajneh 
syrian soldiers on tuesday confiscated weapons from arafat 
loyalists as they left chatilla and searched them before allowing 
them to board trucks for sidon 
the weapons were returned after they crossed the syrians 
southern checkpoint on the awali river just north of sidon the 
syrian escort returned to beirut 
the popular liberation army the leftist militia that controls 
sidon refused to allow the fivevehicle chatilla convoy into the 
city 
they blocked the highway north of sidon with burning tires the 
plas leader mustafa saad said in a statement he feared if he let 
the convoy through sidon would be flooded with other palestinians 
fleeing the beirut fighting 
libyan officers met pla officials to try to get the evacuees 
into sidon where there are refugee camps police said the pla 
later allowed the guerrillas to be driven in ambulances to the ein 
elhilweh palestinian camp

state rep thomas reed pleaded innocent 
to federal influencepeddling charges tuesday with a whisper of the 
noise that marked his attempt nearly five months ago to remove the 
confederate battle flag from alabamas capitol 
while the state naacp president drew a rowdy crowd and hordes of 
reporters on feb 2 when he tried to scale a chainlink fence and 
enter the capitol grounds to take down the flag reed stood near 
the bench and quietly answered a series of questions from us 
district judge myron thompson 
reed charged with bribery and extortion declined comment 
afterward and his attorneys george beck of montgomery and former 
lt gov bill baxley had little to add 
were not going to try the case in the press we think its 
been tried in the press too much said beck tom pleaded not 
guilty we intend to prove hes not guilty 
reed is accused of violating federal law by accepting at least 
15000 in cash and restaurant equipment to try to secure the early 
release of a convicted murderer from the state parole board 
baxley a former state attorney general who unsuccessfully 
prosecuted reed on unrelated bribery charges more than 10 years 
ago said the legislator said it all when he said he was not 
guilty 
what counts is what happens in court baxley added he said 
he had no qualms about defending a man he once prosecuted 
thompson gave reeds attorneys 10 days to file papers 
challenging the governments case and set the trial for aug 8 
the legislator also has been indicted on related state felony 
charges with arraignment set in circuit court for july 27 
both state and federal grand juries charged that reed a member 
of the legislatures joint prison committee accepted at least 
10000 in cash and 5000 in restaurant equipment from an uncle of 
convicted murderer anthony dennis chesser 
in return reed allegedly attempted to use his position to 
persuade the parole board to give chesser an earlier date for 
parole consideration and a workrelease assignment 
chesser serving a 40year sentence initially was given an 
earlier date for parole consideration at reeds request but the 
parole board later revoked that change and refused reeds request 
to give chesser a workrelease assignment chesser remains behind 
bars 
on the federal charges reed could be sentenced to a maximum 55 
years and fined 125 million if convicted if convicted in state 
court he could be sentenced to 20 years in prison and fined 
10000 
reed among 14 black legislators charged with criminal 
trespassing in the flag demonstration remains free on bond he has 
said he will continue efforts to take down the flag which he 
considers a symbol of racism and oppression

premier michel rocard named a new expanded cabinet 
on tuesday with socialists in all the key posts similar to the 
government that resigned two weeks ago 
rocard named four new ministers from centrist opposition 
parties bringing the total number to eight it was unclear 
however whether the appointments signaled a larger movement toward 
cooperation between socialists and centrists something president 
francois mitterrand a socialist had promised 
among the nine other new cabinet members were a leading cancer 
surgeon leon schwarzenberg deputy health minister a wellknown 
historian alain decaux deputy overseas territories and 
departments minister for frenchspeaking countries and the leader 
of an organization of the handicapped michel gillibert deputy 
health minister for the handicapped 
as expected rocard reappointed finance minister pierre 
beregovoy foreign minister roland dumas defense minister 
jeanpierre chevenement and interior minister pierre joxe all 
leading socialists 
other top socialist leaders reappointed from the first cabinet 
included education minister lionel jospin and culture minister jack 
lang 
the socialist premier on wednesday was to make his first major 
policy address to the national assembly since his appointment by 
mitterrand 
mitterrand was reelected to a sevenyear term on may 8 
defeating his conservative opponent former premier jacques chirac 
rocards first cabinet named may 12 resigned after the 
socialists failed to win an absolute majority in the 577seat 
assembly in legislative elections on june 12 
the socialists won 276 seats 13 short of a majority leading to 
speculation that mitterand might try to form a coalition with some 
members of the centerright grouping that holds 269 assembly seats 
the new cabinet included labor minister jeanpierre soisson 
foreign trade minister jeanmarie rausch family affairs minister 
helene dorlhac and deputy health minister theo braun all centrists 
but statements from opposition leaders indicated the four were 
acting on their own no prominent centrist joined the new 
government 
pierre mehaignerie leader of the social democratic center said 
party member rausch was acting on his own initiative and that 
his actions put him on the margins of the party 
mehaignerie said earlier his party was forming an 
semiautonomous group in the national assembly that would support 
or reject socialist initiatives as it saw fit he and other leaders 
have been unwilling to participate as junior members in a coalition 
with the socialists 
the socialists have said they expect to pass their programs by 
using tactical alliances with the centrists and the communists who 
control 25 seats 
the new cabinet was expanded in size from 41 to 48 ministers and 
included 24 nonsocialists the previous cabinet had 16 
nonsocialists 
there are six women in the new cabinet compared to four in the 
previous one 
as part of their overtures to the opposition socialist leaders 
in the assembly on tuesday allowed former president valery giscard 
destaing of the centerright union for french democracy to win 
reelection as head of the foreign affairs committee one of the 
six standing committee chairmanships

legislation requiring that fishing vessels 
carry such safety equipment as life rafts and survival suits was 
approved tuesday by the house capping a threeyear effort by 
northwest lawmakers who called the measure a memorial to those who 
have died at sea 
this was an important firststep in making the industry 
safer said robert barry whose son died when the fishing vessel 
western sea sank off the alaska coast in 1985 
barry who lives in washington dc said the 70yearold 
western sea which was registered out of seattle did not contain 
life rafts survival suits or an emergency locator when it went 
down with six crewmen aboard 
the crew of the western sea would have had a chance of 
surviving if they had had such things as life rafts said barry 
without them they didnt have a chance 
barry and his wife peggy lobbied hard for passage of the bill 
but added that more needs to be done including mandatory training 
of fishing boat crews and mandatory coast guard inspections the 
bill now goes to the senate 
it seems strange to me that men and women have died because 
they literally did not know how to open a pressurized life raft 
said mrs barry 
the bill specifically requires that fishing boats carry radio 
communications equipment including an emergency positionindicating 
radio beacon in addition boats must carry life rafts or lifeboats 
for each crew member and passenger and enough survival suits to 
enable them to survive for at least four hours in the water 
rep john miller rwash a cosponsor of the bill said the 
measure should assure the families who have lost their loved ones 
that we have heard their anguish and listened to their plea that 
others be spared 
the bill will not return loved ones lost at sea miller said 
in a floor statement but it is a lasting and fitting memorial to 
the men and women young and old who did not return home from 
fishing 
about 250 us fishing boats sink each year according to coast 
guard statistics 
rep mike lowry dwash another bill cosponsor said the 
death rate for fishermen is seven times the national average and 
twice that among miners the next most hazardous profession 
an alarming number of people have been killed in accidents on 
commercial fishing boats said lowry we cant allow this 
dangerous situation to continue 
saying that about 80 fishermen die every year in accidents 
involving commercial fishing boats lowry added the legislation 
will go a long way toward preventing these tragic accidents 
stripped from the bill was a provision that would have limited 
the liability of boat owners in the case of accidents 
the insurance provision strongly opposed by the trial lawyers 
lobby and some consumer groups had led to the defeat of the bill 
on the house floor during the previous session of congress miller 
also said lawmakers had to overcome considerable skepticism from 
the fishing industry over the need for the measure 
the fishing industry has this macho aura and are very 
skeptical of regulations miller said in an interview they 
feel they are masters of the sea

writers thought it was all right for the show to halt reruns and 
resume production 
and letterman let his sympathies be known on the show as he 
blamed the strike on producers whom he repeatedly called 
moneygrubbing scum and jerks 
i certainly have a bright future dont i he asked his 
audience which responded with laughter 
then he filled time talking about his 1500 ringside seat at 
monday nights heavyweight bout in atlantic city between mike tyson 
and michael spinks and about his failure to impress friends at the 
indianapolis 500 when he said hello to actor paul newman who all 
but ignored him 
and this strike may go on until christmas so im going to ask 
every member of the staff all of you in the band if you can come 
up with stories as this unfolds well call on you to help kill a 
little time he said 
on tuesday he called on an associate producer in the shows 
control room to play his accordion for the audience 
anything to kill a little time he said as pete fatovich 
performed lady of spain 
thats all were really trying to accomplish is to eat up 
valuable network time letterman said 
he acted surprised when members of his staff cued him to stop 
for commercials or let him know that the show had to move along 
youre giving me time cues our biggest goal tonight is to 
kill time he quipped 
his guests included comedian and writers guild member billy 
crystal actress susan sarandon and an inventor of odds and ends 
and although he announced at the start of the show that musician 
graham parker would appear he didnt 
we ran out of time letterman said to applause

vice president george bush said 
tuesday that aids victims should have federal protection from 
discrimination on the job in schools and elsewhere 
i think it is needed bush said embracing the key and 
most controversial recommendation of president reagans aids 
commission before reagan himself had taken a position 
i think it is important to do a lot to lay to rest some of the 
fears there is a lot of misunderstanding bush said 
the commission delivered its final report to the white house on 
monday calling for an executive order or new federal laws to 
prevent aids discrimination 
reagan has not taken a stand on the issue which has polarized 
some communities particularly as parents grapple with whether to 
send their children to classes attended by aids victims 
bush said reagan did the right thing by withholding 
judgment how can the white house be asked to take an instant 
position he asked 
when it was pointed out that bush himself was doing just that 
the vice president said reagan just saw this thing yesterday 
hes not running for president maybe he wasnt asked the question 
either 
bush certain to be the republican presidential nominee said 
ive got a different role here i want to say what i think 
the vice president endorsed the antidiscrimination proposal on 
a trip to san francisco a city whose homosexual population has 
been ravaged by aids 
bush spent part of the flight westward reading the aids 
commissions report and then went to the rear cabin to outline his 
views to reporters 
he said protection from discrimination against carriers of the 
aids virus should not be seen as a gay rights issue although 
homosexuals are the group hardest hit 
this is a national health problem were talking about 
children innocent victims he said 
bush said antidiscrimination policy should apply to everyone 
carrying the aids virus and should not be left to the states 
because theres some national federal responsibility 
the vice president said during his california trip on tuesday 
that he was not worried about a gallup poll for the times mirror 
corp released monday that shows him running 13 points behind 
democratic presidential candidate michael dukakis 
i dont make too much of it bush said adding that polls 
had shown him trailing before the new hampshire primary which he 
won handily i look at it as something that can be taken care of 
i like to come back i think im going to win he said 
the vice president flew to northern california to tour nasas 
ames research center and see its supercomputer which can perform 
250 million calculations a second 
during a news conference in a cavernous wind tunnel bush 
acknowledged that there will be some that differ with argue 
with one part or another of the commissions report i might be 
opposed i havent read the entire report there will be 
different voices he said he had no idea of penalties for people 
guilty of discrimination 
on a related subject bush voiced strong opposition to the 
distribution of free needles to drug addicts a step taken in some 
instances to curb the spread of aids it just offends me that 
concept of encouraging people to take shots of heroin or whatever 
kind of shots bush said 
on another subject bush clarified that he was not opposed to 
prison furloughs for all drug dealers im against particularly 
those who kill policemen and are kingpin narcotics types he said 
after a luncheon at the estate of industrialist david packard 
bush was attending a fundraising dinner in san francisco 
bush said he was moved by what he heard from james d watkins a 
retired admiral who is the aids commissions chairman about the 
need for people in the workplace to be able to come forward 
especially if the commission report endorses testing for aids and 
i think it does 
theyre not going to come forward if they think theyre going 
to be thrown out of their jobs bush said 
he repeatedly couched his discussion of aids discrimination in 
terms of its effect on children 
i would hate if a kid of mine got a blood transfusion if my 
grandson had aids and the community discriminated against that 
child innocent child particularly when the report concludes and 
surgeon general c everett koop im sure would agree that aids 
is not cant be transmitted in ways that some had feared 
asked if an executive order or law would strip parents of 
healthy children of their right to protect their young bush said 
i think the parents of an innocent child with aids have the 
right too and that is that that child is not the victim of 
invidious discrimination 
he said he would change his views if it can be shown that aids 
can be communicated in casual ways 
he said the aids commissions report will do a lot to lay to 
rest some of the fears about this disease a lot of 
misunderstanding 
theyve concluded there is a danger of discrimination against 
little kids that cant go to a school and the reason they cant go 
there is people think that they can communicate the disease and 
the facts show that that doesnt happen the vice president said 
he said that based on advice from the national institutes of 
health the federal government does not need to increase spending 
on aids research 
we have about the proper level of funding he said its 
close to 1 billion 
before returning to washington on wednesday bush is to deliver 
a foreign policy address before the world affairs council he also 
is to stop in appleton wis on wednesday afternoon to view 
drought damage affecting the nations farmlands

the drought has drained wells in nebraska and sizzling 
temperatures in minnesota were blamed for a shortage of blood 
donors but rumors of rain sent corn and soybean futures plummeting 
tuesday in a frenzied session on the chicago board of trade 
the plunge was based on concerns that rain may fall across the 
midwest and bring at least some relief to droughtstricken crops 
that dirty word was being heard on the floor today rain 
not a lot just a little bit but thats all it takes to scare 
anybody said victor lespinasse an analyst with dean witter 
reynolds inc 
corn prices dropped the limit set by the board of trade 15 
cents a bushel from monday when they closed up the limit soybeans 
also fell the 45centsabushel limit 
officials in parched communities in the midwest and southeast 
the regions hit hardest fretted over weekend forecasts and debated 
canceling fourth of july fireworks for fear that sparks could start 
timber and brush fires independence mo opted for a laser light 
show instead 
wisconsin gov tommy g thompson signed an executive order 
banning private fireworks displays open fires and even sparklers 
under the ban local governments and the state may make exceptions 
where conditions allow also exempted will be community fireworks 
displays but only where adequate fire prevention measures are 
taken 
meanwhile the federal government froze grain inventories in 
three hardhit counties in north dakota and iowa gov terry 
branstad and agriculture secretary dale cochran announced a joint 
effort to get up to 7 billion in drought relief 
branstad a republican and cochran a democrat said theyll go 
to washington to seek changes in federal legislation allowing 
farmers to keep deficiency payments theyve already gotten no date 
has been set for the trip aides said 
the american soybean association began a campaign for federal 
help saying soybean farmers should get whatever relief is approved 
for other commodity producers and should have more flexibility in 
planting and marketing soybeans 
first vice president james lee adams said in a telephone news 
conference from st louis that the nations crop could be as small 
as 12 billion bushels if there is no significant rain until 
august down from more than 19 billion bushels last year 
the coast guard tightened restrictions on barge traffic on the 
lower mississippi because of the continued grounding of towboats 
northbound towboats will be limited to 20 barges only 12 of which 
can be loaded said cmdr michael donohoe of the memphis district 
last week the guard imposed a limit of 25 barges per tow of which 
16 could be loaded 
limits for southbound towboats remained unchanged at 20 barges 
all of which can be loaded 
wisconsins department of natural resources has refused to let 
farmers withdraw water from some highly stressed trout streams 
until water levels rise said max johnson a fish manager at antigo 
it puts us in a very difficult position he said on the 
one hand the governor is saying give them water on the other 
hand we cant its an impossible position 
johnson estimated that 40 percent to 60 percent of the trout in 
streams in his area have died because of the drought he said the 
estimate probably applies to much of wisconsin 
nebraska officials say water supplies are marginal in 30 to 50 
towns in the eastern part of the state the towns of dawson and 
table rock began rationing water last week said jack daniel of 
nebraskas department of health 
in normally temperate minneapolis and st paul two weeks of 
temperatures in the mid90s have kept donors away from red cross 
centers and bloodmobiles said robert bowman medical director of 
the st paul regional red cross blood services 
its clearly the worst ive seen this early bowman said 
the part that worries me is that were already in the shape we 
didnt expect to be in until midsummer 
in addition to the unusually high number of noshows those who 
do come in are being rejected for physical reasons that may be 
weatherrelated such as red blood cell concentrations diluted by 
drinking excess fluids said bowman 
the grain inventory freeze in three north dakota counties was an 
effort to ensure there will be feed for livestock farmers said 
collyn peterson a deputy director for the agricultural 
stabilization and conservation service field office in kansas city 
mo 
in logan county in southcentral north dakota row crops are 90 
percent wiped out by county agriculture agent roger martins 
estimate he also predicted cattlemen would continue to sell off 
livestock as feed grain becomes increasingly scarce 
people are waiting till after the fourth he said after 
the fourth theyre going to admit defeat 
several years of belowaverage rainfall in north carolinas 
mountains are beginning to take their toll and older trees could 
die by summers end as they draw off their reserves forestry 
experts said

fighting has increased around the 
afghan capital of kabul where soviet airpower last week suffered 
its worst single blow of the war western diplomatic sources said 
tuesday 
the sources speaking on condition of anonymity said communist 
forces pulled back from kabuls outermost security ring to 
consolidate defenses against islamic guerrillas who have been 
penetrating in small units 
sources quoted other diplomats in kabul as saying nine rockets 
presumably fired by guerrillas slammed into the city in a 
sevenday span ending monday 
they said various reports indicate that hundreds of dead or 
wounded afghan and soviet troops arrived in the city from battles 
around the country 
kabul radio monitored in london said tuesday that 18 men 
women and children were killed on monday when their vehicle hit a 
land mine planted by extremists along the tokhamjalalabad road 
in eastern afghanistan 
it said the vehicle was taking the 18 from jalalabad to villages 
in sorkhdewar region 
one rebel rocket on friday may have touched off an explosion 
that destroyed an ammunition dump and eight soviet su25 
fighterbombers at kabul airport the sources said 
western diplomats estimated the aircraft cost about 70 million 
making it the worst singleday air loss since the soviets 
intervened in afghanistan in december 1979 
diplomats said the scale of fighting around kabul is increasing 
especially to the east and west 
the soviets and the marxist afghan government are said to be 
increasingly nervous over the situation in wardak province just 
west of the capital where insurgents claim to have taken the 
capital of maidan shahr 
the fall of wardak province would open the free flow of 
guerrillas and their equipment to the paghman heights overlooking 
western kabul 
the guerrillas also claimed to have taken kalat provincial 
capital of southeastern zabul province on june 16 but diplomatic 
sources said tuesday that local citizens asked the guerrillas to 
leave to spare kalat from retaliatory bombardments by troops 
in neighboring kandahar province guerrillas have cornered 
afghan and remaining soviet troops at the airport of the provincial 
capital according to combined sources 
the guerrillas asked civilians to evacuate the area in 
preparation for increased attacks on garrisons there the sources 
said 
despite guerrilla advances diplomats said the soviet pullout 
under terms of a unsponsored geneva agreement appears to moving 
on or ahead of schedule 
soviet officials claim about 25 percent of their 100000strong 
contingent have crossed the oxus river into home territory in the 
first six weeks of the pullout that began in may they promised to 
remove 50 percent of their troops by aug 15 
undersecretarygeneral diego cordovez the mediator of the un 
accords said tuesday he will review alleged violations of the 
10weekold agreement during official talks in the area 
the accords are being implemented as satisfactorily as one can 
expect under the circumstances cordovez told reporters on the 
eve of a trip to iran afghanistan and pakistan 
afghanistan and pakistan have lodged nearly 100 complaints with 
his office including afghan charges that pakistan is continuing to 
supply the guerrillas cordovez said

every other person who dies in africa is a 
child less than five years old and early in the 21st century 
nearly half of all the children who die worldwide will be african 
according to un figures 
new data from the un population division indicate that a 
childs chance of surviving to adulthood often depends on where the 
child is born 
about 15 million children died each year from 198085 and 98 
percent of those deaths were in underdeveloped countries most were 
in south asia but by 2025 most will be in africa the study says 
a child born in a developing country is on the average seven 
times more likely to die before reaching five than a child in the 
industrialized nations 
in the countries with the worst infant and child mortality 
rates such as afghanistan mali or sierra leone a child is 40 
times more likely to die than in a northern european country 
the un data published this month in mortality of children 
under age 5 world estimates and projections 19502025 do 
contain signs of hope 
the mortality rate under age 5 declined by more than half 
worldwide in the last 30 years from 240 per thousand in 195055 to 
118 per thousand in 198085 
east asia has experienced the most rapid child mortality 
decline of any region about 80 percent since 1950 from 248 per 
thousand to 50 per thousand 
china reduced child mortality from 266 per thousand to 55 per 
thousand in the last 30 years 
the soviet union lowered child mortality from 102 per thousand 
to 31 per thousand in 30 years a reduction of almost 70 percent 
north america lowered its child mortality rates over 30 years 
from 34 per thousand to 13 per thousand a reduction of 61 percent 
mortality figures vary widely among underdeveloped regions 
africa has the highest death rate at 182 per thousand in 
198085 followed by south asia at 157 per thousand latin america 
at 88 per thousand the developing countries of oceania at 81 per 
thousand and the developing countries of east asia at 53 per 
thousand 
fertility and mortality rates are expected to decline in all 
regions and the number of deaths are expected to decline everywhere 
except in africa 
in africa the high fertility rate and the fact that a large 
part of the population is of childbearing age are expected to 
offset declining mortality rates causing increasing numbers of 
deaths among children 
by the years 2020 to 2025 nearly half of all infant and child 
deaths worldwide are expected to be in africa the study concluded 
the mortality study was conducted by the population division of 
the un department of international economic and social affairs 
with the support of the united nations childrens fund unicef

us consumer activists tuesday accused the 
nestle food conglomerate of breaking promises to stop promoting 
infant formula in the third world and threatened to revive a 
sevenyear boycott of the companys products that ended in 1984 
douglas a johnson chairman for action for corporate 
accountability said the group objects to distribution of free 
formula through maternity hospitals as a promotional tactic that 
effectively undermines breastfeeding and creates the 
impression that health professionals recommend it 
once bottle feeding starts breastmilk begins to dry up he 
added when mother and baby leave the hospital there is a 
physical need to buy more formula both mother and baby are hooked 
addicted 
but nestle has refused to abide by these unequivocal 
statements to end its supplies program breaking the promise it 
made in 1984 johnson said 
aca based in minneapolis minnesota is the successor of groups 
that organized boycott activities against nestle the swissbased 
global food distributor from 197784 in the united states and nine 
other countries 
the groups halted the boycott after nestle agreed to comply with 
the world health organization code and promised a clarification 
covering donation of formula to institutions 
johnson estimated that the 10nation boycott had cost the 
multinational company 3 billion 
aca also warned a second firm american home products co 
against alleged promotion of formula for newborns on grounds it 
undermines the traditional and healthier practice of 
breastfeeding 
ahp and other us japanese and european formula 
manufacturers have hidden in the shadow of nestle but are no less 
guilty of marketing practices which endanger infant health 
janice mantell executive director of aca told a news conference 
we call upon nestle to produce a plan detailing how and when 
it will stop its practice of pushing free supplies in maternity 
wards and hospitals ms mantell said if this plan is not 
available by oct 4 the fourth anniversary date of the end of the 
first boycott the nestle boycott will be renewed at that time 
she added a warning to american home products to develop a 
detailed and reasonable code implementation plan by the same date 
or it will also be the target of a public pressure campaign 
spokespeople for both nestle and ahp rejected the accusations 
and said they were complying with the world health organization and 
individual national codes 
dr thad jackson washington spokesman for the nestle parent 
firm in switzerland said we totally reject either that were in 
violation of the who code or of our agreement we are industry 
leaders in supporting the code which is the standard by which we 
market our products in the third world 
the code permits donations or concessionary sales of formula for 
distribution to infants needing breast milk substitutes and says it 
may not be used for sales promotion jackson said nestle sends free 
supplies only to hospitals requesting it in writing and closely 
monitors against excessive requests 
ahp spokeswoman carol emerling reached by telephone at her new 
york office called the accusation against her firm not 
wellgrounded since we comply with the who code in all 
countries when full compliance is relevant or 100 percent with the 
codes of countries that have their own

investigation said tuesday 
more than one of the tapes picked up an audible sound track of

the sources refused to say whether the tapes show money or 
confidential government documents changing hands but one said 
the participants are doing more than talking 
one source said there arent that many videotapes videotapes 
are not an extensive technique in the case largely because of 
the difficulty of making arrangements to tape a meeting that might 
be taking place without much advance notice 
but the sources said the government regards the videotapes as 
important evidence when combined with extensive wiretapping that 
has been the basic tool in the investigation to date

in abcs new summer series hothouse set in 
a private mental hospital the inmates dont take control of the 
asylum or even the show the doctors are the ones worth watching 
this is the first new series from executive producer jay presson 
allen a screenwriter prince of the city among many others 
and novelist whose only previous network series was the critically 
acclaimed family hopes were high when abc announced she would 
be doing another hothouse might just live up to expectations 
hothouse premieres thursday with a twohour pilot then will 
continue as an hourlong series on thursdays 
the show is not on abcs fall schedule and that may frustrate 
viewers prone to getting hooked on wellwritten nighttime soaps 
especially in the midst of dull summer reruns 
dont be put off by a lackluster beginning of the twohour 
movie the writers at first seem to be asking that viewers get 
interested in the patients of the fictional garrison center a 
small private institution outside boston the transparent 
anxieties of an aging wife whose husband no longer seems to need 
her and a troubled youth whose worst offense is slinging a 
milkshake at a social worker arent exactly riveting 
but by the end of the two hours the doctors nurses and 
administrators emerge as interesting wellrounded characters 
the cast is exceptional and includes such notables as josef 
sommer alexis smith and michael learned 
sommer is dr sam garrison the patriarch of the center and a 
family that includes psychiatrist daughter issy short for isabel 
played by katherine borowitz her fathers biggest supporter and 
perhaps closest friend a bottomline accountant son matt tony 
soper i see he tells his father during one of their many 
money vs humanity arguments youre st francis and im ivan 
boesky and another son steve not seen in the pilot who also 
is a psychiatrist but moved to london with his young daughter to 
get over the death of his wife 
issy is married to leonard schrader bob gunton who played juan 
peron in evita on broadway the centers lovable medical 
doctor matt is married to beautiful young claudia susan diol 
who feels suffocated by her husbands family in the pilot we 
learn she is expecting a baby 
it turns out sam is not the knowall beall of mental health 
that he would seem his wife lily smith left him after 37 years 
of marriage and he is still running guilt trips on her she 
returns in the pilot with her wealthy new husband they buy a 
country place near the center so she can spend time with her 
children especially issy who resents her for abandoning dad 
among the other doctors are suave ved lahari played by art 
malik jewel in the crown an indian raised in england who is 
having an affair with an older doctor marie teller learned a 
consummate professional and longtime associate of garrison 
art makter michael jeter spends his time making jokes about 
his shortness and wants more than anything to write a pop 
psychology bestseller and go on oprah winfrey at one point 
the other doctors sit around the lunch room joking about his 
progress hes writing a chapter on narcissistic selfhatred 
called how can i miss me if i wont go away says one adds 
another he told me hes writing one called is the woman 
sitting next to you your brother gender confusion and sibling 
rivalry 
head nurse lucy cox maureen moore is the nononsense toughie 
who in the pilot runs off a struggling social worker for being a 
ditz 
hothouse needs to develop more compelling patient stories to 
become a wellrounded series the way la law involves viewers 
both with the attorneys and with their clients cases in at least 
the first two hours of hothouse the doctors are the only ones 
who seem human enough to need a psychiatrist fortunately they are 
enough reason to tune in again

editors note americans and soviets will be marching to the 
same drummer this summer at least for a while as youngsters from 
both nations set aside ideologies and take up musical instruments 
in an orchestratogo 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
while president reagan and soviet leader 
mikhail gorbachev were discussing weighty international matters 
dozens of young musicians in the united states and the soviet union 
were preparing for a musical summit of sorts 
the americansoviet youth orchestra composed of 110 musicians 
representing both countries will make its debut in august with a 
monthlong concert swing across the united states and the soviet 
union 
its such a great opportunity to make music and travel in the 
united states and travel in russia says caroline coade 20 of 
san diego calif 
coade a student of the viola who graduated may 30 from oberlin 
college is one of 58 americans and 52 soviets ages 17 to 23 
selected for the orchestra twelve participants are from oberlin 
college 
the orchestra will assemble on oberlins campus on july 16 for 
rehearsals and workshops to acquaint them with each others social 
and cultural traditions 
the orchestras opening concert is scheduled for aug 5 at the 
kennedy center for the performing arts in washington zubin mehta 
music director of the new york philharmonic will conduct 
the orchestra grew out of a luncheon attended by oberlin 
president s frederick starr an expert on soviet affairs and 
officials of afs intercultural programs an international exchange 
group based in new york says grace kennan warnecke the 
orchestras executive director 
warnecke daughter of george f kennan former us ambassador 
to the soviet union initiated negotiations with the soviet 
ministry of culture last year she says the idea was greeted with 
far more enthusiasm on both sides than anticipated which is not 
to say it still isnt hard 
in the soviet union the orchestra will be sponsored by the 
ministry of culture and gosconsert 
warnecke says a joint orchestra would have been impossible 
before glasnost the new spirit of openness in the soviet union 
although separate tours have been permitted 
whats different about this is were creating a brand new 
institution and thats never happened before says warneke who 
lived in the soviet union periodically as a child and attended 
fifth grade in a soviet school while her father was ambassador 
she says the orchestra could be ongoing but efforts are 
concentrated on this years program 
if glasnost becomes a complete success increasing openness to 
the point that we dont need a sovietamerican orchestra 
well put ourselves out of business and thats all the better 
she says 
the american musicians represent 24 states and were chosen from 
some 500 who auditioned either in person or by tape they are to 
receive expenses and a small allowance from foundations who have 
agreed to finance the program according to warneke 
while touring the united states the musicians will stay in 
dormitories private homes or hotels 
the trip to the soviet union is an important element for claudia 
lasareffmironoff 23 who is studying for a masters degree in 
viola at northwestern university her parents left the soviet union 
as children and emigrated to the united states after world war ii 
i think its really important that we share musical ideas the 
russian school of string playing is such a famous school im 
really excited to be an american string player and to be getting to 
share in that says lasareffmironoff who speaks russian 
one of the musicians calvin lewis 18 of hephzibah ga who 
studies the violin at the cleveland institute of music says hes 
eager to hear the soviet musicians perform lewis says he doesnt 
know any russian but suspects the soviets will know some english 
music is a language in itself i dont think therell be a 
problem says lewis who will be making his first trip out of the 
country 
one of the youngest participants will be junko kaji 17 a 
junior at maumee valley country day school in toledo shes been 
playing the violin since the age of 3 and plays in a youth 
orchestra in toledo 
kaji says the tour in the soviet union is an opportunity to see 
whether her perceptions of that country are valid i thought i 
might want to see what the soviets are really like she says 
during the orchestras 2 weeks in oberlin they will rehearse 
with larry rachleff oberlin conductor and music director and 
leonid nikolaev for the moscow conservatory of music 
after the opening concert the musicians will perform in new 
york city on aug 7 milwaukee aug 9 san francisco aug 11 and 
trenton nj aug 14 the soviet tour will open and close with 
concerts in moscow with four concerts in two other cities in 
between 
the orchestras repertoire will include works by american and 
russian composers and the new york performance will include the 
world premiere of a symphonic piece by soviet composer edison 
denisov

editors note it started as a backyard picnic over the past 
42 years it has become a family tradition for a special american 
family the veterans of the famed world war ii jungle fighting unit 
known as merrills marauders as one says were more than 
friends 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
they are old men now many in their 80s but they remain as 
fierce in their loyalty to one another and to an annual tradition 
as they were when they fought and suffered together and earned the 
nickname merrills marauders 
for the 42nd year in a row the graying marauders will assemble 
this time in charlotte nc on sept 24 to refight the old 
battles and talk about bullfight brandy a concoction of their own 
never approved by the medics and swap pictures of grandchildren 
im sure there will be a few who will attend for the first 
time along with those who show up every year says tom martini of 
charlotte this years reunion chairman 
the difficulty is in getting the word out with so many moving 
to new homes in retirement its hard to keep a current mailing 
list which was never complete to begin with 
after all these years some guys arrive and say i never knew 
about it before 
but they have never forgotten the marauders 
for six months in 1944 twice as long as the operation had been 
originally planned the marauders became the stuff of legend they 
fought in five major and 30 minor actions against veteran japanese 
troops behind enemy lines in northern burma when their final 
objective was taken their force of 3200 numbered fewer than 500 
who could be classified as effective fighting men 
yes says marauder phil piazza of seneca sc we were 
all volunteers and yes we have discussed at our reunions why we 
volunteered 
why did i i guess i was a little bit crazy i was single i 
was anxious to see some action dont forget world war ii was not 
like the vietnam war we had a clear purpose i wanted to be a part 
of it i think most of the others would tell you just about the 
same thing 
it was an experience none of us would want to relive but it 
had to be done and we would do it again if necessary 
they had all responded to a request for volunteers for a 
hazardous mission somewhere they were never told where and 
there is evidence supporting piazzas idea that they were men who 
actually liked combat 
in a book about the unit written in part from material gathered 
at a reunion marauder charlton ogburn of beaufort sc recalled 
the 1st battalion commander suggesting in a lull between battles 
that if nothing else was going to happen they might cross the ridge 
and start a fight with 2nd battalion 
of course he was joking writes ogburn but all the same 
the idea had occurred to him 
merrills marauders was the name given by a time magazine 
reporter to honor their commander brig gen frank merrill their 
official designation was 5307th composite unit provisional which 
led one marauder under fire to wonder what the hell had become of 
the other 5306 
they had come from army units in the south pacific puerto rico 
panama and the infantry school at fort benning ga their job was 
to cut japanese communications hit the enemy from the flank and 
rear and open the strategically important ledo road 
they fought in jungle never knowing what terror lay beyond the 
next bend in the trail and made famous such forgettable names as 
walawbum shaduzup nhpum ga inkangatawng and myitkyina but they 
never forgot 
they lost 93 killed 293 wounded and five times that many to 
disease in the end wrote the medical historian of the 
chinaburmaindia theater amoebas bacteria rickettsiae and 
viruses rather than japanese soldiers and guns vanquished the 
most aggressive bravest and toughest outfit that fought in the far 
east in the second world war 
in the end merrills marauders won a presidential unit 
citation six distinguished service crosses four legions of merit 
44 silver stars and a bronze star for every man in the regiment 
their shoulder patch lives on as the symbol for the 1st battalion 
of the 75th infantry ranger regiment 
a few years ago a marauder spotted a decal of the patch on the 
window of a car ahead chased the car for miles along the 
pennsylvania turnpike caught up motioned for the driver to pull 
over and learned about the reunion 
phil piazza was the one who started the reunion he was 
commander of a heavy weapons company of blue combat team of 2nd 
battalion 
we had three battalions each with two combat teams 
naturally nobody in the unit could know all the 3000 men in the 
regiment but i knew my company and my battalion i lived in 
bridgeport conn then and after the war a few of us in the area 
would get together from time to time and finally i said to them 
why not make it an annual affair 
we were all back working at new jobs and none of us had any 
vacation time accumulated so we picked labor day weekend we held 
the first reunion in my back yard we worked from a list of 
whoknowswherewhois and about 75 guys showed up 
well labor day weekend became the traditional time to hold 
it which makes it difficult for some who have other family plans 
but in recent years we have always had 300 to 400 on hand that 
includes wives and children and now grandchildren 
over the years the generations the reunion has grown from a 
gathering of warriors to a fellowship of families some save up all 
year for the annual blast 
weve had some wonderful trips says jean martini whose 
courtship with tom included frequent letters to him in burma 
weve been to phoenix chicago savannah charleston st louis 
new york boston orlando and i cant remember where all last year 
we went to new orleans 
romance has blossomed the widow of a marauder married a 
marauder widower the son of a marauder married the daughter of 
another 
we are closer than friends jean says we are family its 
a family reunion

many of the reforms now emanating from moscow 
were put forth 20 years ago in czechoslovakia only to be swept 
away by a sovietled invasion their rebirth with the kremlins 
imprimatur however is met with skepticism in todays 
czechoslovakia heres why 
</TEXT>

twenty years after soviet tanks 
crushed alexander dubceks prague spring of reform 
czechoslovaks are deeply leery of the changes now proclaimed in 
moscow and echoed by their own leaders 
a key reason is that dubcek was crushed and disgraced for trying 
them or at least letting them go too far 
czechoslovaks today wonder if the same will happen to mikhail s 
gorbachev and his soviet reforms perestroika restructuring and 
glasnost openness leaving them worse off than they are now 
they are aware that oldtime conservative communists are still 
around and a fear of their traditional hard line remains 
the skepticism of reform surfaces in countless jokes 
what is the difference between mikhail gorbachev and alexander 
dubcek none but gorbachev doesnt know it yet 
what is the difference between perestroika and chess in chess 
you think before you move 
think in a new way a cartoon character asks his boss 
echoing a new communist slogan but for years youve been telling 
me not to think at all 
in the years after the prague spring czechs and slovaks still 
seemed stunned by the sovietled invasion on the night of aug 
2021 1968 that erased dubceks movement to bring a new face to 
czechoslovak communism multiparty politics freedom of the press 
speech and religion a liberalized economy 
when it was over dubcek was expelled from the communist party 
and went off to his native slovakia to work as a clerk in a 
forestry office 
at the same time the chanting singing joyous people of the 
prague spring vanished from the streets and squares most retreated 
morosely back to their private lives to pursue a material wealth 
that was the partys reward for their political silence 
in 1988 that postinvasion reward is running low 
czechoslovakias outmoded industry is performing poorly forcing 
planners to scale down production targets and to slash coveted wage 
bonuses 
shortages are again apparent in shops 
on the political front while pragues leaders tinker with 
reform the winds of change blowing from gorbachevs kremlin are 
prompting more citizens to challenge the communists on issues 
ranging from ecology to cultural and religious freedom 
but the memory of 1968 makes czechoslovaks wary of placing too 
much faith in gorbachev and in turn their own leaders as well as 
reforms 
as one prague man put it soviet reforms sound to czechoslovaks 
like the right ideas from the wrong side 
even deeper skepticism is reserved for the cautious reforms 
adopted so far by the communist leaders installed by moscow 20 
years ago to make sure dubceks experiments would not be repeated 
after spending 18 years assailing change czechoslovakias 
communists have now fallen in step behind gorbachev endorsing 
perestroika and adopting the rhetoric of reform but the sense 
among many in prague is that there is no guarantee of any 
meaningful or lasting effect 
this past december the party even changed its leader 
substituting a 65yearold apparatchik milos jakes pronouned 
yakesh for an increasingly frail gustav husak 75 
jakes immediately set about trying to revamp the image of the 
party leader emulating gorbachev by taking wellpublicized trips 
to factories and farms to chat with workers 
borrowing many phrases from gorbachev jakes spoke of the need 
for economic and social reform at a key party meeting in april that 
brought some new younger faces into the party elite 
but jakes lacks gorbachevs touch at februarys snowdampened 
celebrations of the 40th anniversary of communist power crowds 
streamed away from the square when jakes got up to speak 
few czechoslovaks can forget that it was jakes who oversaw the 
expulsion of almost 500000 party members in a postdubcek purge 
they also know that husak who took over from dubcek in march 
1969 is still on the ruling politburo 
when jakes talks of reform however he pointedly omits mention 
of glasnost which has brought startling frankness to the soviet 
media jakes stresses that czechoslovakias 17 million communists 
must dictate the pace and shape of any change 
an unspoken fear is that reform will spin outside the partys 
control as the communists say it did in dubceks days 
even economic change is treated with extreme caution 
particularly by managers who report that overhasty reforms in the 
soviet union are making it difficult for them to deal with soviet 
enterprises 
planned decentralization of management is not likely to go as 
far here as it has in the soviet union and wont be in full force 
until 1991

restructuring cannot be too hasty said svatopluk smutny an 
economics editor at the communist party newspaper rude pravo it 
is far too important a change and needs to be thought out in detail 
and consequences 
communists like smutny reluctantly admit to some parallels 
between the current situation and 1968 when dubcek at the age of 
46 became party leader with a mandate to implement marketoriented 
reforms designed to boost the economy 
but dubcek opted for political reform as well advocating 
changes gorbachev now wants 20 years later 
it was a heady spell wistfully remembered by many 
it was quite simply the best time of my life recalled one 
man who was then a teenager in prague 
for communists 1968 carries a different message they remember 
how dubcek promised that his reforms were irreversible and look 
anxiously now toward moscow for signs of a conservative backlash 
that could crunch gorbachev 
if gorbachev strengthens his hold on power both moscow and 
prague may eventually reevaluate the 1968 invasion in effect a 
kremlin acknowledgment that it was the wrong thing to do and wont 
happen again 
such a reappraisal would be popular with those who remember 
1968 and create space for change that would be welcomed by those 
who have grown up since 
both these groups increasingly have turned outside the system 
for spiritual fulfillment opening up what the banned playwright 
vaclav havel recently termed a yawning chasm between two 
virtually unrelated worlds the world of official ideology and the 
world of the authentic attitudes and beliefs of society 
the rigid controls on czechoslovakias active staterun culture 
have loosened a little with the advent of glasnost in moscow 
the first political satire in 20 years has been staged a few 
unofficial art shows mounted and a handful of previously banned 
movies screened 
the immense popularity of officially tolerated and underground 
rockmusic groups has forced authorities to issue more good rock 
music on the sole stateowned record label as well as to relax 
bans on some groups and to promote the occasional rock concert 
anxious perhaps to follow the example of soviet television 
programs beamed daily to czechoslovakias 155 million people the 
staterun media have become a mite more lively and provocative 
but while the name of franz kafka has made a rare appearance in 
a literary journal his full works are still unpublished in his 
native prague 
orthodox communists visiting moscow return genuinely appalled by 
the outspoken new plays books and films in the soviet union 
plays by havel performed to high acclaim in the west remain 
banned in czechoslovakia and dissidents forced to take manual jobs 
are unlikely to return to their professions any time soon 
secret police no longer block the doors of dissidents homes 
but three seminars called by the human rights group charter 77 have 
been broken up by police who expelled 33 foreigners who attended 
meetings in prague june 1718 
in bratislava in march authorities sharply dampened the growing 
activism of religious believers when police broke up a peaceful 
demonstration by about 2000 roman catholics 
religion has proved an increasingly attractive spiritual refuge 
over the past five years and some 600000 believers recently 
signed a 31point petition for religious freedom the largest such 
action in soviet bloc history 
another issue on which czechoslovaks are increasingly outspoken 
is the environment which has been severely damaged by crash 
industrialization 
opinions vary about whether these specific challenges to or 
retreats from official doctrine will one day spill over into revolt 
the moral situation is each year worse said a pessimistic 
ivan klima a writer and charter 77 signatory the people are 
cautious that is the mildest word they dont find any reason for 
engagement in political activity 
fear rules our society said the rev vaclav maly a roman 
catholic priest stripped of his license to preach people are 
generally well informed but fear prevents them from doing 
anything 
very slowly he said this attitude is changing as people 
realize it is not enough to preserve the perks of a relatively 
high standard of living 
havel too sees change coming 
between the society and the leadership there is a bigger and 
bigger gap he said you dont find anybody anywhere who says 
this excellent government i dont know if something will 
happen but i think that something must happen 
if political change comes he added society is well prepared 
people know what to do

alexander dubcek ousted by the soviets after they crushed his 
prague spring liberalization movement in 1968 lives today in the 
seclusion of a villa overlooking bratislava capital of his native 
slovakia 
officially he is a retired forestry clerk 
dubcek was arrested after the sovietled invasion of august 1968 
but released and allowed to remain on in his post as 
czechoslovakias communist party leader 
from then on it was an escalator ride to oblivion 
april 1969 he is removed as party leader and named president 
of parliament a largely ceremonial post 
september in a purge of the party central committee he is 
fired as parliament president 
december dubcek is named ambassador to turkey 
march 1970 he is suspended from the communist party 
june he is formally expelled from the communist party and 
called home from turkey 
july dubcek is recalled as a deputy in parliaments house of 
the people his last remaining official post he and his wife 
anna move into political exile in slovakia where he is given a 
job as a clerk in a forestry office 
from then on little is known except that dubcek now 66 years 
old is retired from his forestry job 
he and his family are said to have been kept under close 
surveillance until mikhail s gorbachev the reformist soviet 
leader visited czechoslovakia in april 1987 
he made a few trips to prague this year and on one occasion was 
loudly applauded when he attended a theater performance 
however an attempt earlier this year by dubcek and some other 
communist leaders from the prague spring to found an alternative 
political grouping was repressed

a major force the 
czechoslovakias communist leaders face is growing religious faith 
in defiance of the governments atheistic teachings 
every sunday people of all ages cram bratislavas roman 
catholic churches 
more and more young czechoslovaks are turning to the roman 
catholic and other churches 
no official statistics are available on the number of believers 
the vatican estimates that 60 percent of the countrys 155 million 
people are roman catholics but state television says believers 
make up just 25 to 30 percent of the population 
the roman catholic church has recently become a newly powerful 
force with some 600000 believers signing a lay petition for more 
religious freedom 
the petition had the unprecedented backing of 89yearold 
cardinal frantisek tomasek who took the mass support as a signal 
for a strong attack on the communists refusal to appoint bishops 
in nine of the countrys 13 sees or to allow more religious 
education 
believers frustrations over church policy have spilled over 
into regular demonstrations outside the cardinals residence in 
prague with calls for religious freedom and a visit from pope john 
paul ii 
perhaps influenced by the kremlins new tolerance of the russian 
orthodox church and growing western condemnation of its church 
policy the prague government sanctioned the consecration of three 
new bishops in june 
but a slovak believer recently warned religion is not free 
here dont be deceived 
it is not clear where the new militancy of the roman catholic 
church could lead as the only organized body outside communist 
control it has always attracted party ire 
the churchs situation in czechoslovakia is much worse than 
elsewhere in the soviet bloc something believers attribute in part 
to the ideological crackdown that followed the failed attempts at 
communist reforms in 1968

like many paramount pictures in recent years the presidio 
is slickly produced actionfilled well acted and empty 
disneys touchstone pictures produced mostly by paramount alumni 
exhibit the same tendencies the films have the same kind of 
homogeneity of the warner bros movies of the 1930s but without an 
equal vitality 
the formula has obviously worked wonders at the boxoffice 
beverly hills cop top gun but the sameness of product 
may be responsible for paramounts precipitous drop before 
crocodile dundee ii in its share of the nations theater 
business 
theres nothing about the presidio that cant be enjoyed 
between gulps of popcorn director peter hyams provides an 
abundance of wellstaged action some of it meaningless and the 
players are attractive but you have the feeling that given a 
wider range of imagination the film could have been more than a 
generationgap detective chase 
mark harmon is a former military police officer now working for 
the san francisco police department sean connery is an army 
provost marshal whose service dates back to the korean war his 
accent is explained by his scottish birth they detest each other 
because harmon did not follow army regulations in arresting an 
abusive officer years before 
the antagonism grows as harmon casts his lecherous eyes on 
connerys nubile independent daughter meg ryan he soon beds her 
and she rebels against her domineering father 
the two detectives are investigating the murder of a woman mp 
at the officers club of the 212yearold presidio near the golden 
gate bridge connery and harmon are constantly at odds but of 
course each develops a grudging respect for the sleuthing skills of 
the other the investigation leads them to a smuggling conspiracy 
by former agents of the cia hollywoods favorite new villains 
larry fergusons screenplay offers no real surprises except for 
the identity of one of the conspirators hyams 2010 running 
scared is an expert at this kind of action his chases through 
san francisco that most photogenic of american cities pack 
excitement and his cars leap higher into the air than those in 
bullitt and whats up doc 
sean connery is his usually dominating self though his barroom 
punchout of an annoying punkster is one of the least convincing of 
recent movie brawls mark harmon is ingratiating but he has yet to 
show much behind that puppydog smile meg ryan has a few effective 
moments amid all the macho doings 
the presidio is rated r for language sex and violence 
running time 97 minutes producer d constantine conte

benji the hunted provides fresh evidence that the soulful 
canine star may be the most accomplished actor in movies today 
in his latest outing benji survives a shipwreck off the oregon 
coast and is on his way to a reunion with owner frank innes when he 
stumbles upon a litter of orphaned cougar cubs for the rest of the 
films 89 minutes benji struggles against rugged terrain and an 
assortment of human and animal villains to find the cubs shelter 
and a new mother 
director joe camp elicits a truly amazing performance from 
benji his expressive eyes registering whatever emotion the plot 
calls for whether it be fear or slyness or tenderness in one 
startling scene he brilliantly portrays a canine in conflict as 
benji must decide whether to reveal himself to a searchandrescue 
helicopter or hide so he can remain in the wilderness to help the 
cubs 
the other actors cant match benji although the cubs are 
awfully cute and a particularly vicious wolf has a grand death 
scene the human participants are few and there is virtually no 
dialogue 
children over 4 should enjoy benji the hunted although the 
pace is slow and the story line is occasionally confusing

out of order warner bros rod stewart 
 
spin the first side of out of order and you not only wonder 
why rod stewart still has a recording contract but why he earned 
one in the first place 
fortunately most records still have two sides and side 2 of 
this album is as impressive as the first side is depressing 
that rod stewarts been a shallow trend mongerer for most of the 
last decade is hardly news word that hed recruited exduran duran 
andy taylor and much of the power station crew for his new record 
seemed to promise an album about two years behind the time 
instead this crew seems to have loosened up stewart as his 
howl on crazy about her suggests if this isnt the real rod 
stewart who knows what is anymore at least its a stewart that 
wears well 
the two ballads that close this record a cover of try a 
little tenderness and when i was your man are both stellar 
as stewart turns his distinctive growl into something soulful 
dynamite is a raunchy rocker thats more fun than some of 
stewarts more studied efforts you can almost pity the mod one on 
nobody knows when youre down and out although his complaint 
of opening his door and finding a woman he doesnt know saying 
shes having his baby is one of those problems only rod seems to 
have 
so what happened to side 1 its packed with clunkers made all 
the more sinful because most are stretched two or three minutes 
beyond what a listener can endure 
one side good one side bad the ways stewarts been going 
lately he should take that batting average

evening star contemporary records joshua breakstone 
 
guitarist joshua breakstone plays textbook jazz with a few notes 
scrawled in the margins 
if ever a label name fit a musicians style contemporary suits 
breakstone perfectly yet he delivers enough of himself in this 
recording his second for the label to keep the record from being 
merely a send up from ghosts of guitarists past such as wes 
montgomery or grant green note for example the opening bars of 
the album closer just open your heart a reference to the 
atonal mastery of thelonious monk they quickly leave monks world 
of surprises for more familiar ground traditional straightahead 
jazz 
if youre looking for developing young guitarists to preserve 
the traditions of jazz the new jerseyborn breakstone is a 
candidate his choice of sidemen for this session proves it tommy 
flanagan is on piano and jimmy knepper plays trombone their styles 
polished by years of playing flanagan and knepper make breakstone 
sound refined beyond his 32 years 
evening star mixes breakstones own compositions with 
standards its an album of nearly seamless playing on which two 
masters of the craft flanagan and knepper are bringing along 
the next generation

the everversatile sally kellerman appears 
this summer in two divergent movie roles as a film actress 
shattered by the end of her marriage and as operator of a 
wargames school for women 
is there anything kellerman cant do apparently not when she 
isnt playing her wide range of acting roles you might find her in 
local stage plays doing voiceovers for commercials and cartoons 
or singing her own brand of bluesy music in new york and hollywood 
night spots 
kellerman recently chatted about her life at the hollywood hills 
home she shares with her producerhusband jonathan krane and a pair 
of friendly dogs her blond beauty remains untouched as she nears 
50 and she talks more levelheadedly than you would expect from 
seeing her in eccentric film roles 
she currently appears in someone to love which has drawn 
raves from some reviewers for its freeform humanistic qualities 
its another idiosyncratic film from henry jaglom whose offbeat 
movies have usually included his mentor orson welles in his last 
performance welles appears throughout someone to love sitting 
in a theater seat and offering a running commentary on what is 
happening 
henry and the character he plays in the movie had the idea of 
finding out why various friends of his were alone on valentines 
day kellerman said he invited them all to a theater the 
mayfair in santa monica he said id be a movie star who just left 
her husband that was it 
so we all arrived and he asked questions and had us think 
about our characters it was essentially improvised and he ended 
up in the editing room putting it all together people say oh 
its real but it wasnt really real 
kellerman first impressed the film world as hot lips houlihan in 
the landmark comedy mash which brought her a 1970 academy 
nomination as supporting actress 
i dont think i understood show business in the sense of 
realizing how lucky i was to get a role and have a job she said 
after mash i was out to prove that i was not just hot lips 
but i could be a million other people so i looked for the most 
serious drama i could find i tried to dodge around but i often 
ended up with roles that were not hot lips but were this kind of 
zany kookie largerthanlife character 
at this time of my life im absolutely loving those kinds of 
roles i enjoyed doing a more human character like the one in 
someone to love but i also have discovered that i love something 
like alls fair which i did with george segal its the kind of 
classic comedy where you start out in suits and painted fingernails 
and end up in the dirt fighting 
so im not worried about typecasting look at clint eastwood 
hes done all right playing the same kind of roles 
sally kellerman was born in long beach but grew up in the san 
fernando valley before they raped the land and before smog 
then she attended hollywood high school unlike another alumna 
lana turner she was not discovered for films 
my interests were class the buddies i hung out with and the 
boys i went out with she recalled i did plays in church 
worked as a waitress on sunset boulevard went to acting class with 
jack nicholson robert blake richard chamberlain 
no i wasnt discovered in a malt shop 
instead she made her way up the ladder the hard way in episodic 
television 
i had a lot of fun whirling from one episode to the other 
she said i was in the pilot of star trek one time i played a 
swedish viking opposite fred macmurray in my three sons id do 
kraft and chrysler and ben casey and alfred hitchcock but i 
was an oldfashioned girl and i always wanted to be in the movies 
her first movie was reform school girl which gave her one 
line in the back of the bus she followed with bigger parts in 
the boston strangler the third day and april fools 
then mash came along 
did she know it was going to be a hit 
well bob altman the director thought it would be and 
making it was certainly fun she recalled it doesnt always 
mean when you have a good time that it will be a good picture nor 
does it mean if you suffer and struggle it will be good but that 
was one time when a picture was both fun and good i had a blast 
she also had a blast doing back to school playing an 
english professor to student rodney dangerfield in august she 
teams with dave thomas in a liveaction version of boris and 
natasha from the rocky and bullwinkle cartoon series

for decades the russian 
revolutionary masters were condemned to storage vaults of soviet 
museums for not toeing the line of stalinist art 
perestroika has allowed them to reemerge in the plush 
lakeside villa favorita amid the priceless art collection of 
switzerlands wealthiest citizen baron heinrich von 
thyssenbornemisza perestroika or restructuring is the 
term used to describe soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs policies 
of economic and social reforms 
thyssens own art collection comprises 1400 priceless paintings 
ranging from medieval masters to american modern art plus 600 
sculptures and other works published estimates of his fortune 
range from 700 million to 28 billion 
the special exhibition on loan from three soviet museums 
comprises 39 works of revolutionary art by vassily kandinsky 
kasimir malevich mikhail larionov and other avantgardists most 
of whom became nonpersons under joseph stalin 
the works represent what became known as the great 
experiment in russian art between 1910 and 1930 influenced by 
pablo picasso and other westerners as well as russian traditions 
most of the works date back to before the bolshevik revolution 
and before all big names went into exile 
composition vi is a huge 78by120 inch canvas by 
kandinsky dated 1913 the lugano show features seven other works 
by him thyssens own collection comprises 10 
kandinsky a pioneer of abstract art died in neuillysurseine 
france in 1944 thirtysix years later his widow nina was the 
victim of a robberymurder in switzerland that was never solved 
larionov and his wife natalia goncharova also died in french 
exile they married in 1955 after 45 years of companionship and 
are represented with four works each they include her peasants 
picking apples of 1911 influenced by folk art and his 
rayonnist landcsape of 1912 a result of experiments with 
rayonnism which aimed to portray the light emanating from objects 
nine exhibits are by malevich the father of what he named 
suprematism because he felt that supremacy should be given to 
perception divorced from any particular object 
among them is one variant of his monochromatic black square 
of 1913 that stirred a sensation in the world of art and which he 
called a zeroform it is shown together with a black 
circle and a black cross a commentary in the exhibition 
catalog said it is very unlikely that these suprematist 
compositions will ever be completely deciphered a view some 
visitors may share 
thyssen said at the opening that it took several years of 
negotiations before soviet authorities gave the goahead for the 
loan facilitating things was raisa gorbachev the wife of the 
soviet leader whom thyssen met during one of his frequent trips to 
the soviet union 
the choice of the exhibits was a difficult undertaking he said 
there are books but there is no complete list and often i had to 
scout the storage rooms 
thyssen said that as a liberal he welcomed perestroika and 
the resulting opening up in russian art 
things are being straightened out now he said but it 
cannot be done from one day to the other it must take its time 
the show which will last until oct 2 is part of the fourth 
exchange organized by the thyssen family foundation and the soviet 
ministry of culture since 1983 but the first comprising modern 
russian art 
thyssen praised what he termed an exemplary collaboration 
with his soviet partners despite occasional unspecified 
difficulties 
when we started some people asked me why i was sending our 
treasures to russia they warned me they would be never returned 
but they came back in perfect shape in fact the paintings 
received a better treatment there than in some western countries 
he said 
popular interest in the soviet exhibitions from his collections 
has been incredibly strong 
the people are starved for what comes from the west he 
said to help satisfy such hunger the foundation is giving away 
several glossy catalogs which are printed in the west 
this years show from the thyssen collections opened june 16 in 
the leningrads state russian museum and will move to moscow in 
august it features 40 modern masters including an early work by 
american artist jackson pollock 
however as in lugano russian revolutionaries are represented 
too kandinsky larionov and goncharova coming home for the first 
time since the artists sought creative freedom in the west

the resume is impressive rolling stone 
cover participation in the sun city and a very special 
christmas benefit records an upcoming amnesty international 
tour antidrug concerts frequent community activism 
so who are we talking about sting bruce springsteen 
nah try rundmc three homeboys from hollis queens 
im just happy to do everything they bring said jam master 
jay the dj for the reigning kings of rap in discussing their 
frequent charity efforts i probably dont even hear about half 
the stuff were asked to do but we do whatever we can 
strange words from a band that was the subject of screaming 
headlines last summer invariably and incorrectly predicting 
gang violence on their tour with the beastie boys publicity got so 
bad that at one point national lampoon provided tips on how to 
survive a rundmc concert 
we had press hanging on poles cameras in the crowd in every 
city on the tour and every night they went home disappointed 
nothing bad happened said jay whose band has just released its 
fourth album tougher than leather 
i dont think we can put that stuff behind us for five years 
it sells man nothing positive sells the history of the press 
is negative things he continued theyre all in a race to get 
the negative things 
but jay whose real name is jason mizell and partners joseph 
simmons run and darryl mcdaniels dmc insist they are a positive 
act toward that end they have established scholarships for kids 
from their hollis neighborhood this summer the band will have 
voter registration booths at every show on their national tour 
last year when we were visiting beaten kids high school 
kids telling kids to stay off crack wed ask how many yall 
vote and nobodys voting nobody knew nothing and the main thing 
is nobodys registered said jay a supporter of democratic 
presidential contender jesse jackson 
mention of tipper gore wife of sen albert gore dtenn and 
her parents music resource center prompts a quick and cold 
response 
tipper gores the type who wont say anything about the 
positive just the negative looking for controversy mizell 
said if i could sit down and talk to tip i could set her 
straight 
on tougher than leather there are some lyrics which could 
raise tippers eyebrows mostly though the bands first record 
since 1986s platinum smash raising hell is aimed at reclaiming 
turf from upandcoming rappers such as ll cool j and kool moe dee 
my feeling is im very happy about everybodys success but i 
know who we are and what we did mizell said we didnt make up 
rap but we made up being hard they other rappers just dont 
know how to do some of the things we do 
and the things we do that they know how to do we stomp their 
stuff its a business thing with us were professionals 
mizell lists public enemy as his favorite rappers they will be 
touring with rundmc and jazzy jeff amp the fresh prince this summer 
the tour will take rundmc around the globe and will include 
appearances on this summers amnesty international benefit tour 
mizell said 
the new record features more turntable work by mizell than 
raising hell he scratches more and manages to interject 
snatches of the monkees the temptations and james brown 
its new times time for a different record time for a better 
record said mizell in explaining his enlarged role on the 
tougher 
i listened to the last record and i didnt do enough 
scratching on it so this time i cut it up real loud 
mizell is certain of one thing the group can and will 
maintain its standing at the top of the rapping mountain 
nobody can do what i do i got the best mcs a positive 
message he summed up it keeps coming we keep creating 
getting better and better

flamboyant william lee golden voted out 
of the oak ridge boys country quartet last year has a fresh 
career singing with his two sons in the new group the goldens 
he has been performing this year with rusty 29 and chris 25 
in the aftermath of his wellpublicized ouster from the oak ridge 
boys after 22 years 
during goldens 22 years with the group it won five grammy 
awards the oak ridge boys are best known for their hits 
elvira which sold 2 million and bobbie sue which sold 1 
million 
joining his sons has a special significance for golden who sang 
lead on one of the oak ridge boys many hits thank god for 
kids 
ive learned about music and their youthful enthusiasm the 
49yearold golden said we go to concerts together and study 
whats happening in the music business when i hear someone on the 
radio i dont know i ask them who is that they usually know 
and seem attuned to whats going on 
the other three members of the oak ridge boys replaced golden in 
1987 because of personal and musical differences his successor was 
former child actor steve sanders who had played rhythm guitar in 
their band for five years 
golden who stood out because of his waistlength hair and 
flowing beard recently talked about his ouster 
i could see the writing on the wall for a while he said 
when it came down at first i laughed at how it was handled then 
i got mad it hit all the emotions because after all those years 
22 years it was sad to think that it had come down to the end the 
way it did 
my emotions went in all directions he said they can 
still get in a lot of different directions it takes a team to do 
what we did and i still believe in harmony and try to teach harmony 
to my family 
some days you disagree but a family is forgiving im not 
perfect either i have my faults ive been guilty of having too 
much fun 
i sang harmony every way i could with them i was there for 22 
years and was a dedicated team player i guess all my time and 
energy can be looked upon as a certain phase of my life now now 
id rather help my family with guidance and assistance 
it was the groups first personnel change in 10 years 
a year before his ouster golden recorded an album on his own 
american vagabond 
i was getting frustrated because i had music inside me 
golden said thats why i did the solo album they didnt want me 
to do it and wouldnt allow me to sing songs from that album on 
stage as the oak ridge boys 
after being voted out golden filed a 40 million lawsuit 
against the group seeking 10 million in general damages and 30 
million in punitive damages 
but golden says feelings are mellowing among the four lawyers 
have been working to settle the lawsuit out of court 
the oak ridge boys attended a nashville concert by the goldens 
in early june 
i respect that golden said 
we speak when were around each other he added theres 
no need in me holding a grudge if we can settle our differences 
the goldens and the oak ridge boys have the same booking agency 
and this has led to speculation the two groups may work together 
theres been talk of joining forces and well see what would 
happen its just talk at least were talking 
golden is not the only oak ridge boy connection to the goldens 
two members of the goldens band formerly played in the oak ridge 
boys band 
the oak ridge boys a former gospel music group have continued 
to do well without golden the quartet recently was voted favorite 
group in a poll of viewers by the nashville network cable channel 
from what i read they are happy and doing what theyve wanted 
for a long time golden said they seem happy so thats good 
golden a native of brewton ala said hes had to take a 
higher profile since teaming with his sons 
the adjustment has been to come out of the shadows to where 
im singing lead on each song and keep it moving from song to song 
i sing more and im singing better the more i sing the better i 
am singing is physical and emotional 
golden said hes reluctant to sing elvira any more 
i just sang harmony on the chorus with the oak ridge boys 
its a good song but i would feel funny singing it now i enjoyed 
singing it when we did it

full range of gm retiree benefits winters said 
analyst kathleen heaney of nikko securities international in new 
york said johnson never had a clear shot at the chairmanship 
because he was an outsider and he lacked automaking experience 
usually everybody at gm has been there since right out of 
college its like a lifetime career she said 
in addition johnson was a little bit critical said the 
company wasnt moving fast enough for him to have gotten roger 
smiths job in 1990 would have been a real long shot heaney said

stag brewery the last remaining 
fullsized brewery in illinois and one of the oldest in the 
midwest will close by fall putting more than 200 people out of 
work company officials said 
an official with g heileman brewing co which owns stag said 
monday the plant was closing because of certain financial and 
operational considerations 
the brewery dates back to the 1850s 
this decision to end operations here is difficult in view of 
the cooperation and support extended to us by the employees the 
labor unions mayor richard brauers administration and the 
community said charles nicks administrative manager at the 
parent company 
while company officials refused to discuss specific reasons one 
observer linked it to the location of heilemans other midwestern 
breweries the age of the plant and an enormous excess capacity 
robert f weinberg an industry research specialist in st 
louis said heileman used only 64 percent of the capacity of its 
plants last year 
the company has the capacity to brew 253 million barrels of 
beer weinberg said they shipped 1625 million barrels last 
year obviously they decided they didnt need the belleville 
brewerys 11 million barrel capacity 
nicks said about 230 employees will lose their jobs between 200 
and 300 employees are employed by the brewery depending on the 
season 
the remaining beer manufacturers in illinois are classified as 
microbreweries because they produce only limited amounts of 
brew and serve it only on their own premises rather than bottling 
or canning it

eric anthony looked over his farm one 
year ago and saw his fields soaked with water from a summer flood 
this year hes thankful some of that water held in the ground 
for it may mean the difference between survival and disaster 
brought on by the nations worst drought in more than 50 years 
anthony grows soybeans and corn on his 1400acre farm west of 
this northcentral ohio community in morrow county 
the flood seemed devastating last year but it gave us a lot 
of retained moisture anthony says for every hole it drowned 
it made the others so much better 
last july the area was hit by flooding after up to 6 inches of 
rain fell during 24 hours the floods caused more than 20 million 
in damage the ohio disaster services agency estimated crop losses 
at an additional 54 million 
crawford marion morrow and richland counties were declared 
eligible for federal disaster aid 
a much bleaker picture faces farmers this year rainfall totals 
since april 1 are as much as 6 inches below normal and 
agricultural officials have warned of heavy losses from the drought 
ohios soil moisture is 93 percent short and less than 20 
percent of the corn and soy crops are rated as good or excellent 
state officials said monday 
anthony said that although last years flooding devastated the 
area it may have helped this seasons rainstarved crops more than 
is believed 
steve ruhl agricultural extension agent for morrow county 
agreed 
our wells would be in a little better shape because of that 
last year ruhl said monday at least the ground was saturated 
at one point last summer 
this seasons sparse showers have done little more than keep 
corn and bean plants alive what rain the state has received hasnt 
been enough to get much height out of crops anthony said 
corn stalks should be 8 feet by july 4 but most of his stalks 
range from 5 inches to 1 feet he is not as worried about his 
soybeans because he said they will sit until august and still grow 
to their full height 
anthony said although the corn will mature despite its small 
size the ears will be smaller and the quality not as good 
anthony a farmer for 18 years said this is the worst drought 
he has seen he said many of his neighbors are depressed over the 
loss of their crops 
wheat yields are going to be down significantly ruhl said 
it looks like hay yields are down about a third of what we 
normally would have 
although anthony said the outlook for this years crop is not 
good hes not ready to give up 
you have to wait on the end results he said

an agreement between the southeastern 
pennsylvania transportation authoritity and the brotherhood of 
railroad signalmen allowing random drug testing of rail workers is 
being hailed as the first of its kind in the country 
dave murdoch a septa spokesman said the agreement signed 
monday is the first in the country in which a rail union has agreed 
to random drug testing he stressed that the testing would not be 
used as a dragnet 
the agreement also includes an employee assistance program with 
educational components and red block a nationally recognized 
program in the rail industry which allows employees to refer other 
employees for assistance 
in january a federal judge ruled railroad employees would not 
be subject to random testing unless the individual rail labor 
organizations agreed 
with the support of my members the signalmen initiated this 
type of agreement for the safety of fellow employees and the safety 
of the riding public said brs general chairman roland e 
mckenzie in a news release 
my members have no fear of such tests and in the event a 
member has a drug or alcohol related problem the agreement goes 
further and addresses those needs providing rehabilitation help in 
an accessible manner mckenzie said 
the program should be in operation by the fall 
we would like to give credit and applaud the brs for their 
efforts and willingness to take a stand which was obviously a 
difficult one james kilcur acting general manager of septa said 
in a press release

the arrival of summer has made stars of 
crocodile mile jamball and groove tube 
they are among the hottest toys of the season entertaining 
children and crucial for the recovering toy industry bringing 
in sales for manufacturers 
summer toys are viewed as an area where the companies can 
potentially get a stable base of revenues said paul valentine 
who tracks the toy industry for standard amp poors corp 
stability is exactly what toymakers want after the industrys 
1987 washout when manufacturers committed too much cash to 
overambitious product lines that failed many big companies ended 
up losing money 
one bright spot last year last summer in fact was hasbro 
incs pogo bal 
the spherical toy used like a pogo stick was the hottest toy 
of the season for all of 1987 hasbro sold 3 million pogo bals 
raking in an estimated 35 million in sales and its doing well 
again in 1988 
this has not been lost on other toymakers 
the huge success of pogo bal last spring and summer led to 
increased emphasis by the industry on these toys said valentine 
everyone jumped into the segment 
analysts say there is no one single blockbuster summer toy in 
1988 but summer toys and sports look quite strong said barry 
rothberg of the investment firm mabon nugent amp co 
the most popular summer toy this year according to the 
bestseller list compiled by the trade publication toy amp hobby 
world is coleco industries incs jamball a game in which players 
throw and catch a large orange ball without touching it 
toys r us inc the nationwide toy store chain reports 
crocodile mile a backyard water slide by marchon is selling well 
as is groove tube a game involving a ball and a long plastic tube 
produced by hasbros milton bradley division 
bubbles are big this year so dip stix by lewis galoob toys inc 
and fisherprices bubble mower are selling well said angela 
bourdon a toys r us spokeswoman 
but bicycles which did well in 1988 have slipped huffy corp 
the ohiobased manufacturer of raleigh and huffy bicycles said it 
has suffered a slowdown in sales in the second quarter 
barry ryan huffys vice president for finance attributed the 
slump in part to a possible saturation of the market after several 
years of strong sales 
in addition ryan said retailers just overbought and created 
a logjam in the pipeline 
kites another summer standard are again popular including 
milton bradleys air america valentine said 
so are jump ropes at worlds of wonder inc which is undergoing 
reorganization under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code the 
summer has been brightened by the success of skipstik a variation 
on the jump rope 
struggling companies like worlds of wonder and coleco which is 
trying to stay out of bankruptcy court desperately need the 
profits from their seasonal offerings but the sad fact is no 
matter how successful such toys are theyre unlikely to turn the 
companies around 
the problem with summer toys is their lifespan is brief just a 
few months and while they can help a company they dont have the 
kind of bottomline impact of more timeless products 
even pogo bals exceptional 1987 sales were far below what a 
successful yearround toy would have done valentine said in 
contrast to pogo bals 35 million in sales the video game 
nintendo the biggest toy of 1987 took in 750 million 
it should also be noted that even with the popularity of 
seasonal items the topselling toys are still the same ones that 
occupied children during the winter 
nintendo took the no 1 spot on toy amp hobby worlds list of 
bestselling toys in may the most recent month for which figures 
are available no 2 was mattel incs everpopular barbie doll 
followed in third place by the board game pictionary manufactured 
by games gang ltd 
as was the case last year there are no megahit toys on the 
market like the cabbage patch kids teddy ruxpin or lazer tag that 
had consumers jamming into stores in the past but video games and 
what are called basic toys such as board games barbie and 
preschool toys are bringing the industry back 
the third quarter when christmas toys are shipped is the 
biggest for the industry and the one that will ultimately 
determine how well the manufacturers do but so far the analysts 
said the business has a better tone than it did a year ago 
the environment is getting better said rothberg the mabon 
nugent analyst product movement is pretty good 
steven eisenberg who tracks the industry for bear stearns amp 
co gave an industry forecast of reasonably healthy to possibly 
very healthy for some of the larger companies 
in the meantime the summer is proceeding right on 
expectations he said

a virginia man who organized a haylift from ohio to his 
droughtstricken state two years ago plans to reciprocate while 
fourth of july fireworks displays in wisconsin were jeopardized by 
the worst us dry spell in 50 years 
parts of the parched south and southern plains received rain 
during the past few days but except in texas it was not enough to 
aid thirsty crops todays forecast called for more showers and 
thunderstorms from the southern high plains into texas 
eugene morris of charlotte county va said monday he had 
contacted farmers in the southern virginia county in an effort to 
help ohio farmers who lack hay to feed their animals due to the 
drought 
weve got some hay lined up and we plan on doing what we can 
to help the situation in ohio said morris who works for the 
soil conservation service of the us department of agriculture 
morris said the current drought was not as severe in southern 
virginia and many growers had surplus hay alice walters a 
spokeswoman for the ohio department of agriculture said about 
6000 bales had been lined up 
four tractortrailers and their drivers donated by goodyear 
tire amp rubber co will leave akron on wednesday to pick up the 
hay ms walters said 
in wisconsin gov tommy g thompson said monday he would ban 
private fireworks displays open fires and even sparklers because 
of tinderdry conditions that have led to fires over thousands of 
acres 
under the ban which thompson planned to sign today local 
governments and the state may make exceptions where conditions 
allow also exempted will be community fireworks displays but only 
where adequate fire prevention measures are taken 
several cleveland area suburbs said they may cancel public 
fireworks this fourth of july weekend 
if we get rain wednesday or thursday well be all right 
berea mayor stanley j trupo said monday if not ill cancel on 
thursday 
some officials in iowa also planned to restrict fireworks 
it wouldnt be a popular move a lot of people say lets take 
a chance but i dont know who would take the responsibility if 
anything happened said dennis ballou fire chief of exira iowa 
a heat wave gripping st paul minn appears to be behind an 
unusually high number of noshows at donation centers and at 
bloodmobile stops a red cross official said 
we see a shrinking and we know darn well we cant go on like 
this without getting into serious trouble dr robert bowman 
medical director of the st paul regional red cross blood services 
said monday 
its clearly the worst ive seen this early bowman said of 
blood inventories which normally are lower in summer months the 
part that worries me is that were already in the shape we didnt 
expect to be in until midsummer 
texas south plains and panhandle received 12 inches of rain 
over the weekend and monday providing relief just when the ground 
was beginning to dry out said county agents 
its a shame that somebody else has to suffer before someone 
else makes a crop said bob benson hale countys extension 
agent a few years ago we were in a drought and the midwest was 
laughing off with good prices but thats just the cold hard facts 
of farming 
in alabama weekend thunderstorms gave parched crops a temporary 
boost but officials said steady rain was needed 
rep bill dickinson rala toured farms that had received a 
soaking but he said the fields were still the worst hed ever seen 
mississippi gov ray mabus toured droughtstricken areas of his 
state monday and called for greater government relief efforts 
asked if president reagan was moving too slowly mabus said i 
wish he would come down and see the things i have seen 
cool weather moved into parts of the upper midwest on monday 
but officials said that would do little to alleviate drought damage 
hot weather continued in the plains and the south 
highs in the 80s and 90s were expected to continue across the 
nations midsection and south except for the upper great lakes 
region and the upper ohio valley where 60s and 70s were expected 
barge traffic flowed again monday on most of the lowwater 
mississippi river after the army corps of engineers dredged out 
channels near st louis mo and memphis tenn but there were new 
blockages as barges ran aground near memphis 
fire lines were completed monday around a 57000acre blaze 
along the montanasouth dakota line but authorities did not 
declare it contained smaller fires were fought in wyoming idaho 
and southern california 
the scientist who popularized the greenhouse effect theory 
said he believes the drought is not a symptom of the gradual 
warming of the atmosphere he predicted as a result of air pollution 
stephen schneider of the national center for atmospheric 
research in boulder colo said he believes the drought more 
likely was caused by the jet stream swinging well north of its 
usual track this year depriving the middle of the country of 
rain and leaving hot weather in the south

the government charged today that the 
international brotherhood of teamsters is dominated by organized 
crime and sued to force free elections and other reforms in the 
nations largest union 
organized crimes control is so pervasive that for decades the 
ibts leadership has permitted la cosa nostra figures to dominate 
and corrupt important teamsters locals joint councils and benefit 
funds claimed court papers filed with the suit 
the governments complaint alleges that organized crime has 
deprived union members of their rights through a pattern of 
racketeering that includes 20 murders a number of shootings 
bombings beatings a campaign of fear extortion and theft 
said us attorney rudolph giuliani in a prepared statement 
teamsters president jackie presser currently under indictment 
in cleveland and the unions other top 17 officials were named as 
defendants as were 26 alleged mafia members or associates 
including the alleged heads of six mob families 
the government wants a federal judge to remove from office any 
teamsters officers found at trial to have violated federal 
racketeering laws and is seeking appointment of a union trustee to 
ensure free and fair union elections 
the civil racketeering lawsuit in preparation for more than a 
year was filed at federal court in manhattan by giuliani 
prosecutors charged that the mafia has gained control over 
the union and now uses the ibt and many of its affiliated 
entities to engage in racketeering activity 
the government used a similar suit two years ago under the 
racketeerinfluenced corrupt organizations act to put teamsters 
local 560 in new jersey under the control of a governmentappointed 
trustee 
presser is on temporary leave from the union after undergoing 
surgery last month for a brain tumor in his absence 
secretarytreasurer weldon mathis is serving as acting president 
anticipation of the suit prompted the 16millionmember union 
to seek refuge with the aflcio last october rejoining the labor 
federation after a 30year absence 
among those named in the suit were convicted crime family bosses 
anthony fat tony salerno of the genovese group anthony tony 
ducks corallo of the luccheses and carmine junior persico of 
the colombo family all three were convicted in 1986 of sitting on 
the us mafias ruling commission 
salerno 77 also was convicted last month in another massive 
rackets case of bid rigging in new yorks construction industry 
but the same jury acquitted salerno and two others of rigging the 
election of presser and his predecessor roy williams

the senate moving to vote on the 
controversial plantclosure bill this week agreed today that 
employers need not give strikers 60 days notice they are being 
laid off 
an amendment by sen orrin hatch rutah including that 
exemption was approved 910 
president reagan last month vetoed a massive trade bill 
primarily because of the mandatorynotice provision the issues has 
become a major domestic political issue in this years election 
marjority leader robert c byrd dwva made it clear monday 
that he wants final congressional votes on the legislation before 
lawmakers leave town to spend july 4th on the hustings 
the same urgency was expressed on the house side where speaker 
jim wright dtexas said his chamber would vote in fairly quick 
succession wednesday on the plantclosing legislation and then on 
the 1000page omnibus trade bill 
byrd said he had hoped for a senate vote today but to be on the 
safe side he took steps to invoke cloture or halt debate if that 
were needed to bring the matter to a vote later in the week 
the plantclosing measure newly detached from the trade bill 
would require companies with at least 100 employees to provide 
advance notice of largescale layoffs and plant closings president 
reagan singled it out for special criticism in his may 24 veto of 
the trade legislation 
reagan said it would rob managers of flexibility needed to 
operate their companies at peak economic health proponents say 
advance notice is the only decent way to treat breadwinners facing 
layoffs 
the senate on monday voted 6432 to kill a move by sen nancy 
kassebaum rkan to drop advance notice of layoffs from the bill 
critics said the overall bill was too broad and that dropping 
the layoff provision represented one way to impose limits 
a layoff of 50 employees at a 10000employee manufacturing 
plant would not be a plant closing to most people but it is under 
terms of this legislation said sen orrin hatch rutah 
sen howard m metzenbaum dohio called the plan a blueprint 
for employers who want to disobey the plantclosings law itself 
employers would simply lay them off piece by piece bit by 
bit until there was nothing left metzenbaum said 
the plantclosing provision was dropped from the trade bill and 
reconstituted as a separate piece of legislation after the senate 
was unable to override reagans trade bill veto 
labor unions have been seeking plantclosing legislation in one 
form or another for 15 years 
reagan is expected to veto the legislation if as seems likely 
it reaches his desk in its new standalone form 
the trade bill was initially viewed as an ideal vehicle to 
propel the plantclosing provision through congress but sponsors 
are now saying that they might have a better chance to override a 
veto without being tied to the numerous other controversies in the 
trade bill

lists for the latter half of 1988 a period ripe for fastpaced 
buyouts 
a relatively cheap dollar is expected to keep luring foreign 
investors while a fear of tighter regulations in the postreagan 
era should keep domesticled takeovers rolling 
topping it off is a plethora of companies whose share prices 
remain depressed in the wake of octobers stock market bloodbath 
rendering them relative bargains 
most wall streeters covet such opportunities and are more than 
reluctant to point fingers at potential takeover or restructuring 
targets 
people pay us for our opinions said one analyst at bear 
stearns amp co so i dont want to give them to you for nothing 
but the grapevine is abuzz with names like texaco whirlpool 
american brands mcgrawhill and plenty more 
using a purely numerical approach to identify targets linda 
zimbalist smith said she searches for stocks that would jump in a 
takeover restructuring or leveraged buyout and while a company 
may appear on her list today a few ticks upward in its stock price 
could render it undesirable in an instant according to her complex 
formula 
in may smith head of the greenwich connbased research firm 
zimbalist smith named 28 target companies including american 
brands monsanto whirlpool goodyear and zayre but many of these 
companies no longer pass her test 
still experts remain keen on american brands a company with 
farflung interests from tobacco to biscuits 
it is one of the ultimate consumer conglomerates with dozens 
of separate companies pasted together without any synergy noted 
michael metz an analyst at oppenheimer amp co 
that means the companys separate parts could be spun off or 
sold to finance a takeover or pay shareholders a handsome dividend 
for the investor a takeover is not the only way to cash out any 
kind of restructuring or leveraged buyout is designed to boost 
shareholder value and put profits in the pockets of investors 
smith conceded that american brands breakup value is great and 
that its stock price is hampered by the cloud hanging over the 
tobacco industry 
a depressed stock price alone is not the only red flag on a 
potential target internal forces such as low debt levels coupled 
with higher projected earnings also can highlight target companies 
you have to look at the financials of a company the cash 
flow the balance sheet and you have to look outside directors 
whether they are friends of management said metz 
antitakeover provisions are likely to be only a slight 
deterrent to takeover offers 
there are even more subtle issues to consider we look for 
values as well as a catalyst said mario gabelli who heads the 
investment firm gabelli amp co 
among his socalled catalysts are things like divorce death 
big blocks of stock in the hands of octogenarians 
for example gabelli said he is buying lots of stock in thomas 
industries inc a kentuckybased lighting manufacturer the 
companys founder lee b thomas died in march and a spokesman 
said he does not know what became of thomass stake in the company 
newell co an illinois home hardware concern apparently also 
likes thomas newell has picked up a 65 percent stake in the 
company and could serve as an important ally to a potential suitor 
if it does not make a bid of its own 
divorce is taking its toll on rp scherer corp karla scherer 
fink who has filed suit to divorce the companys president has 
said she wants to sell the pharmaceuticals company in which she 
holds a 33 percent stake one investor group that controls more 
than 13 percent of the company has already held talks with her and 
may be jockeying for an acquisition 
if internal strife is a major criteria nowhere is such a force 
more evident that at texaco inc despite defeating raider carl c 
icahn in a critical proxy battle the oil giant remains vulnerable 
icahns 149 percent stake may be for sale giving any purchaser 
a solid springboard for an offer in addition the aggressive new 
york investment firm kohlberg kravis roberts amp co which sided 
with management in the proxy battle conceivably could push for a 
leveraged buyout and retain texaco management with whom they 
likely have established a working rapport oppenheimers metz said 
one deal often turns the spotlight on an entire industry it 
starts a conflagration and investors and speculators look to 
mirror images and clones to see if other potential vehicles could 
go the same way metz said 
turmoil at texaco has turned up the heat on other oil companies 
in particular unocal corp and phillips petroleum co both are 
selling at large discounts considering their breakup value as 
well as in terms of cash flow and the value of underlying gas and 
oil reserves metz said 
in the publishing industry macmillan incs announced 
recapitalization as a defensive measure against offers from the 
robert bass group has sparked rumors that time inc or mcgrawhill 
inc might also be pressed to restructure 
and general electric cos acquisition of roper corp turned 
fresh attention to the home appliance market since then there has 
been plenty of talk about whirlpool corp and fellow appliance 
maker maytag corp including rumors that whirlpool might make a 
bid for maytag 
not all undervalued companies are targets most drug companies 
for example are trading at a discount but are not choice 
candidates metz noted that these companies are undervalued in part 
because of the uncertainty surrounding the future of government 
health insurance plans and because the revived dollar will not 
benefit their overseas sales as it did in the previous year 
but smithkline beckman corp is one pharmaceutical company whose 
stock is so downright depressed it just might be attractive 
smithklines stock recently plummeted from about 54 a share to the 
45 range after the company revised its earnings projections 
downward 
because of eastman kodak cos megapurchase of sterling drug 
inc earlier this year zimbalist smith has the company on her 
watch list 
its in line to do something to boost its stock price and 
theres a lot it can do now that it has more pieces to sell off 
she said

an investor group led by new york 
financier asher edelman complained tuesday that payless cashways 
inc refused to provide information in connection with a possible 
takeover bid for the building materials retailer 
edelmans group twice requested information used by payless 
senior management to formulate the 26ashare bid they offered 
last week to take the company private in an 875 million leveraged 
buyout 
edelman spokesman corey horowitz said the group received a 
letter friday denying the information he did not say why the 
request was denied 
we believe the failure to give us the information is unfair 
and without legal precedent horowitz said it certainly works 
to the detriment of the shareholders 
payless officials confirmed the letter was sent but declined 
further comment 
the edelman group which once held a 99 percent stake in 
payless and said it might make a bid for the entire company now 
controls about 81 percent of the companys 336 million 
outstanding shares 
in addition to edelman the group also includes payless 
competitor sutherland lumber southwest inc also of kansas city 
payless spokeswoman brenda nolte declined comment on whether the 
boards special committee had received other bids or has acted on 
the management officials leveraged buyout offer 
separately two payless shareholders filed suit monday in 
jackson county circuit court against payless chairman and chief 
executive david stanley larry kunz the president and the board 
of directors 
the suit contends that the defendants are carrying out a 
preconceived plan to eliminate the public common stockholders of 
payless at a grossly inadequate price 
the shareholders robert gillespie of westtown pa and terry 
shickler of new york also contend that the primary objective of 
the management buyout is to allow those involved to acquire 
payless at a fraudulently low and unfair price

britains commercial banks heeding a signal from 
the bank of england on tuesday announced a half percentage point 
increase in their base lending rate to 95 percent 
a rise in the benchmark lending rate the fourth this month was 
expected following a government report monday of a sharply wider 
record merchandise trade deficit which sent the pound and the 
london stock market reeling 
the report and the markets reaction fueled speculation that 
the government would push up interest rates to cool the economys 
growth by discouraging consumer buying and to counter inflation 
some analysts had expected the central bank to go as far as 
signaling a one percentage point gain another halfpoint increase 
might follow shortly analysts said 
the central bank signaled the halfpoint increase at midday by 
raising a key money market intervention rate of its own 
major banks such as barclays bank plc midland bank plc 
national westminster bank plc and lloyds bank plc announced they 
were increasing their rate the banks also increased the base 
lending rate half a percentage point on june 2 june 6 and june 22 
corporate borrowers can obtain loans at a percentage point above 
the base rate 
britains merchandise trade deficit soared to a record 1705 
billion pounds or 29 billion in may with imports running at 
their highest level since last summer the government said in its 
monday report 
the pound which plummeted 4 cents monday to 17030 from 
17430 was quoted at 17260 after the rate increases tuesday 
the financial timesstock exchange 100share index was down 
around 3 points at the 1838 level by midday tuesday it fell 298 
points or 16 percent to 18415 in the previous session

pleasantly surprised by a smallerthanexpected hike in a benchmark 
british interest rate

points or 08 percent to close at 18569

the market was initially little affected by the midday news that 
the bank of england signaled a rise in the commercial banks base 
lending rate to 95 percent from 90 percent but investors soon 
became heartened that the increase had only been a halfpoint and 
not a full point as had been widely expected in the market 
an advance on wall street added a bit of upward stimulus to 
rising london equities dealers said 
charles larkum equity analyst with james capel amp co said the 
markets rise was an expression of relief 
the widely anticipated rate increase followed a government 
report monday that showed the briitsh merchandise trade deficit 
widened sharply to a record 1705 billion pounds or 29 billion 
in may while its current account gap also widened to a record 
1205 billion pounds 
the trade figures drove equities and the pound sharply lower on

their daily limits tuesday on the chicago board of trade in a wild 
reversal based on concerns that rain may fall across the midwest

not a lot just a little bit but thats all it takes to scare 
anybody said victor lespinasse an analyst with dean witter 
reynolds inc

corn prices closed down the daily limit expanded tuesday to 15 
cents a bushel in all but two months while soybeans fell the

said

the value of new construction projects rose 9 
percent in may reversing a declining trend according to a report 
released tuesday 
but the improvement which translated to an annualized 2464 
billion in new construction projects was dominated by a cluster of 
major nonbuilding projects said the fw dodge division of 
mcgrawhill information systems co 
general construction activity which includes housing and 
commercial buildings was up only slightly from the previous month 
and still held below last years levels 
the contract statistics measure the value of newly started 
construction that will be completed in the upcoming months they 
indicate the amount and direction of future expenditures of the 
building industry 
george christie fw dodge vice president and chief economist 
called the surge in contracting an isolated event affecting a 
narrow slice of the construction sector and not a turnaround 
he noted that commercial building markets remain overbuilt 
public funding is under restraint and homeuilding is vulnerable to 
rising interest rates 
contracting for nonbuilding construction leaped 30 percent to an 
annualized 529 billion in may largely on the strength of three 
major projects a fuel processing plant in idaho an oil products 
distribution center in california and a new jersey wastetoenergy 
facility 
nonresidential building construction rose 3 percent to an 
annualized 794 billion while the value of newly started 
residential buildings rose 4 percent to an annualized 114 billion 
christie attributed the weak showing in the nonresidential 
sector to acceleration of the office building cutback which 
had been confined to a few regions but now is becoming a national 
trend 
he also noted that higher interest rates might make doubtful the 
prospect of achieving a total of 15 million housing starts this 
year 
for the year to date construction contracts totaled 978 
billion down 2 percent from the same period a year earlier

the great lakes region simmons will continue in that role after 
the acquisition the two companies said

we think it was just a smart business decision the company 
was for sale and we think that by applying the marketing expertise 
and financial strengths of american airlines we can do a much 
better job of operating the company although it was doing a fine 
job for us as a partner of american eagle said american 
spokesman al becker 
simmons founded in 1978 operates about 350 weekday departures

we wanted to slow the pace of the developments in the market 
and give the market a certain breathing space to think about where 
the dollar should be going said a spokesman for the swiss

a federal judge has ordered a holding company 
owned by canadas belzberg family to pay 476000 in interest 
penalties on the 27 million in stock trading profits it must 
forfeit for violating federal securities law 
us district judge barrington parker in an order issued last 
friday gave first city financial corp ltd five days to surrender 
the profits from its unsuccessful attempt to takeover ashland oil 
co in 1986 
the interest penalty was assessed as part of the final judgment 
that parker entered in favor of the securities and exchange 
commission which brought the complaint against the belzberg family 
company 
earlier this month parker ruled that the vancouverbased 
company and marc belzberg a vice president violated the 1934 
securities exchange act by concealing ownership of ashland stock 
parker found that first citys failure to publicly disclose 
ownership of its 5 percent stake in the oil company was intended to 
prevent the price of ashland stock from soaring while the company 
continued to buy more shares in the oil company 
first city sold its 890100 shares back to ashland for 51 a 
share after the takeover bid was thwarted 
the company has said it will appeal parkers ruling that it 
violated the disclosure provisions of the 1934 securities law

ef hutton amp co has been fined 400000 and 
censured by the new york stock exchange in connection with the 
firms 1985 check overdraft scandal the nyse announced tuesday 
two former hutton officers president george l ball and 
executive vice president thomas p lynch the companys chief 
financial officer also were censured the nyse said in a statement 
a censure is one of the mildest forms of sanctions the exchange 
can impose on members the nyses action against hutton and the 
former executives had been expected for some time 
the hearing panel found that from 1980 to 1982 hutton failed to 
supervise and control its cashiering operations and several areas 
of its business operations the nyse said 
the hearing panel also found hutton had engaged in conduct 
inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade through 
the overdraft scheme which the exchange said deprived banks of 
their property because hutton did not pay interest on the funds it 
used 
hutton ball and lynch consented to the findings of an exchange 
hearing panel without admitting or denying guilt the nyse said 
the exchanges investigation stemmed from a 1985 
checkoverdrafting scheme that hutton orchestrated through its 
retail brokerage network the firm earned up to 8 million in 
interest income at commercial banks by deliberately overdrawing 
checking accounts and putting the money to use elsewhere 
hutton pleaded guilty to 2000 federal fraud counts and paid a 
2 million fine in may 1985 because of the scheme which exposed 
serious management lapses at the firm and led to a chain of events 
that forced hutton to sell itself to shearson lehman brothers inc 
late last year the merged firm is known as shearson lehman hutton 
inc 
in a report on the disciplinary actions the nyse said there was 
no evidence that ball now the chairman of prudentialbache 
securities inc or lynch had been aware of excessive overdrafting 
before february 1982 but should have questioned whether there was 
adequate supervision and control over branch offices 
the 400000 fine is among the largest levied by the stock 
exchange in 1981 the nyse fined first wall street settlement 
400000 and in 1982 it fined bache halsey stuart shields the same 
amount 
the nyse routinely disciplines member firms for violating its 
rules of conduct with punitive actions ranging from expulsions for 
severe infractions to fines or censure for less serious offenses

bond prices advanced broadly tuesday as a surge 
in the dollar and a decline in commodity prices dampened inflation 
fears 
the treasurys bellwether 30year bond rose by more than a full 
point or 10 for every 1000 in face value as its yield fell to 
885 percent from 896 percent late monday the closelywatched 
bond fell more than 10 on monday 
analysts said the market appeared to be impressed that the 
dollar continued its rise despite concerted intervention by central 
banks 
the dollars appreciation has made dollardenominated 
securities such as us treasury bonds and notes more attractive 
to foreign investors 
bonds also benefitted from a decline in the commodity research 
bureaus index which fell 332 points after rising more than 5 
points on monday 
nonetheless some analysts such as harold nathan of wells fargo 
amp co in san francisco remain skeptical that the bond rally will 
continue 
nathan said he expects that the central banks in west germany 
and japan may boost their base lending rates in support of their 
currencies and that could depress foreign demand for us bonds 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
government issues rose 532 point intermediate maturities were up 
by between 516 point and 2332 point and 20year issues rose a 
full point according to figures provided by telerate inc a 
businessinformation service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman hutton daily treasury bond which measures 
price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with maturities 
of a year or longer rose 459 to 115202 the merrill lynch bond 
index which makes a similar measurement rose 048 to 11009

movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or 
longer rose 088 to 28438 
in the taxexempt market prices were steady according to the 
bond buyer municipal index

the senate on tuesday agreed to exempt 
businesses affected by the farm belt drought from legislation to 
make employers provide 60 days advance notice of large layoffs and 
plant closings 
the amendment by senate minority leader bob dole rkan was 
approved unanimously after farm state lawmakers said they have been 
told by bakeries flour mills and meatpacking poultry egg 
ethanol and farm equipment plants they anticipate future layoffs 
resulting from the drought currently afflicting much of the country 
i dont think we ought to get carried away by the demands from 
organized labor dole said if were serious about alleviating 
the effects of the drought on the economy then we ought not to be 
hitting businesses with both barrels 
meanwhile majority leader robert c byrd dwva filed 
motions for three more votes to cut off debate on the plant closing 
measure now in its fifth day and threatened to hold lawmakers 
in session the rest of this week or most of next week 
were going to pass this bill sooner or later its 
inevitable byrd said if necessary well stay here until 9 
oclock every night until we do it 
dole denied that republicans were trying to delay final action 
but admitted both sides are playing hardball politics on it 
i dont know precisely whats happening myself dole said of 
a string of republican amendments many of them approved 
unanimously tuesday but some of them rejected 
byrd admitted he does not have the 60 votes necessary to end the 
debate and bring the bill to a final vote wednesday 
but republicans leading the opposition to the layoff notices 
indicated they may throw in the towel wednesday particularly after 
byrd threatened to cut short a july fourth holiday that many 
senators on both sides planned to spend in their home states 
campaigning for reelection 
i think we can finish plant closing by tomorrow sen orrin 
hatch of utah the chief republican opponent of the legislation 
replied when asked about byrds carrotstick offer 
house speaker jim wright dtexas said the house would likely 
vote on the bill thursday assuming the senate approves it before 
recessing wednesday night 
meanwhile the house rules committee delayed acting on a revised 
trade bill that president reagan vetoed last month largely because 
it included the plantclosing notification requirements 
democratic leaders fulfilling a promise to the nations labor 
leaders have agreed to delay final congressional action on the 
trade bill until after first acting on the plant closing and layoff 
notices 
wright also had hoped to win passage of the trade bill before 
the house recesses thursday 
however sen lloyd bentsen dtexas a chief author of the 
trade measure said tuesday he doesnt anticipate senate action on 
it until august after congress has had a chance to override 
reagans expected veto of the plantclosing bill but before the 
republican national convention 
without a separate plantclosing law aflcio officials have 
vowed to withdraw what congressional supporters of the trade bill 
agree is organized labors pivotal backing of it 
house and senate republican leaders met tuesday with reagan at 
the white house where officials said they continue to recommend 
that he veto any mandatory notice legislation 
but opposition among some republicans and a few onetime 
democratic opponents of the measure appeared to be softening 
sen dale bumpers dark chairman of the senate small business 
committee had opposed the notifications in two previous senate 
votes but he said he now supports them 
and hatch said tuesday that he would urge reagan not to veto the 
bill if the notices were limited only to plant closings and 
excluded other layoffs however a republican attempt to do that 
was defeated monday 
as long as the layoff provisions are in there i think hell 
veto it hatch said of reagan ive lost on the major issues 
asked if the administrations opposition to the bill was 
weakening white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said i would 
have no way to judge that 
the senate on tuesday unanimously accepted four minor amendments 
by hatch including one to exempt replaced strikers from having to 
get the 60day advance layoff notices 
but it rejected an amendment by sen dan quayle rind that 
would exempt companies from having to give the notices to 
nonstrikers whose jobs might be lost from a plant closing or 
layoffs that results from a strike or lockout 
also turned down was an amendment by sen pete domenici rnm 
that would have limited the notices in layoffs only to workers 
losing their jobs as a result of hostile corporate takeovers

atampt is not projecting earnings per share to 
increase 15 percent this year as its chairman seemed to say two 
months ago the companys chief financial officer said tuesday 
morris tanenbaum told reporters at a briefing that american 
telephone amp telegraph co does not make earnings forecasts he said 
chairman robert e allen misspoke or was misunderstood when he 
seemed to project a 15 percent increase at a news conference in 
april 
tanenbaums statement did not shake up atampts stock which rose 
25 cents to 2675 in consolidated new york stock exchange trading 
lapp lee an analyst for salomon brothers inc said he had been 
slightly skeptical of the statement attributed to allen anyway 
because of the possibility allen was misquoted or had been speaking 
of a goal rather than a forecast 
at a news conference at atampts annual meeting in denver in 
april allen was asked whether atampt would be able to sustain for 
all of 1988 the 15 percent increase in earnings per share that it 
achieved in the first quarter allen answered thats our firm 
commitment 
tanenbaum who did not attend the press conference said he had 
reviewed a transcript of it and said it seemed possible either that 
allen misspoke or that reporters had misunderstood his response

debates on aids and the nursing shortage might 
grab the most attention but medical policymakers meeting this 
week are also tackling such issues as the hazards of tanning 
parlors and a ban on reallooking toy guns 
the american medical associations lawmaking body began acting 
tuesday on more than 100 reports and 200 resolutions ranging from 
proposals to require health warnings in alcohol advertising to 
cautions about of clove cigarettes 
the annual meeting of delegates who represent 295000 members 
continues throught thursday 
the amas 420 delegates considered proposals to double the 
federal tobacco tax from 16 cents per pack to 32 cents and end 
federal price supports to tobacco farmers 
delegates were to vote tuesday on proposals to work for a ban on 
the manufacture and sale of realisticlooking toy guns and real 
guns made from plastic or other nonmetallic materials that are 
hard to detect with screening devices 
the growth of tanning parlors across the country spawned two 
proposals aimed at requiring tanning booths to post warning labels 
describing the health hazards of exposure to ultraviolet rays 
dr russell kridel of houston representing the american academy 
of facial plastic and reconstructive surgery said at one hearing 
that advertising for tanning parlors mislead many people into 
thinking exposure to ultraviolet radiation from tanning booths is 
safer than the suns rays 
there are a number of myths that the tanning parlors are 
putting out to the general public and we need to debunk these we 
need to have warning labels on these booths like the warning labels 
you have on cigarettes kridel said 
the committee agreed and tuesday urged the delegates to adopt 
the policy and work to educate the public about the hazards of 
ultraviolet radiation 
while on the subject of warning labels dr jack menendez of 
macon ga called on the ama to work to force alcoholic beverage 
manufacturers to put warnings about the dangers of alcohol abuse in 
their advertisements 
i think the idea would be to say something like abuse of 
alcohol is bad for your health he said 
the committee recommended the ama investigate the need for such 
warnings 
the amas council on scientific affairs also issued a report on 
the health hazards of smoking clove cigarettes a mixture of 30 
percent to 40 percent clove buds with tobacco 
a committee recommended that the ama adopt a policy opposing the 
use of indonesianimported clove cigarettes which may be linked to 
severe respiratory illnesses 
the growing use of steroids by athletes to build up their 
muscles produced a proposal for ama action improper steroid use 
poses such dangers as permanently impairing the ones sexual 
functions 
this is not a matter of a few athletes popping some pills 
said dr dave richards of salt lake city these young athletes 
are taking intravenous steroids in doses far larger than are 
considered therapeutic they are spending amounts of money that 
approach the amount spent for illicit drugs 
the committee urged the ama delegates to adopt a policy 
declaring that using steroids to enhance athletic ability is 
entirely inappropriate and calling on state legislatures to 
enact laws to control their use and distribution

a forecast for rain and possible relief for droughtstricken 
crops brought corn and soybean futures prices down their daily 
limits tuesday in a wild turnaround at the chicago board of trade 
a day earlier prices were limitup as corn and bean traders 
anticipated a continuation of the drought and further crop 
deterioration the new forecast calling for showers to move into 
the midwest later tuesday and wednesday made buyers nervous and 
sparked a massive selloff and other markets dipped in sympathy 
in other markets cattle and hog futures prices were mixed at 
the chicago mercantile exchange cotton prices fell at the new york 
cotton exchange crude oil and heating oil declined at the new york 
mercantile exchange gold and silver prices dipped at the new york 
commodity exchange and sugar prices rallied at the new york coffee 
sugar amp cocoa exchange 
that dirty word was being heard on the floor today rain 
not a lot just a little bit but thats all it takes to scare 
anybody said victor lespinasse an analyst with dean witter 
reynolds inc 
corn prices closed down the daily limit expanded tuesday to 15 
cents a bushel in all but two months while soybeans fell the 
expanded 45centsa bushel limit in all months except november 1989 
were at a turning point here lespinasse said as nobody 
knows the impact rains forecast for the next few days over much of 
the midwest will have on thirsty crops 
wheat prices settled 23 cents to 27 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in july at 373 a bushel corn settled 2 
cents to 15 cents lower with july at 337 a bushel oats settled 
15 cents lower across the board and soybeans settled 25 cents 
lower to 45 cents lower with july at 1014 a bushel 
the sharp drop in the corn and soybean markets added a negative 
tone to trading in cattle and hog futures at the chicago mercantile 
exchange analysts said 
all of a sudden with the corn and soybeans limit down that 
gave a signal to those people who had been maintaining the 
droughttype spread to kind of cash in said chuck levitt an 
analyst in chicago with shearson lehman hutton inc 
but losses were tempered by a usda announcement after the close 
of trading that they intended to expand beef purchases under the 
food assistance programs by 50 million levitt said 
the result will be that ranchers who are liquidating cows on 
the market will find a little better price than what theyve been 
experiencing of late he said 
hog prices were pressured by a fresh round of price decreases on 
the wholesale pork market when a stronger market was 
anticipated levitt said 
cattle prices settled 55 cent lower to 55 cent higher with 
the contract for delivery in august at 6462 cents a pound feeder 
cattle were unchanged to 150 cents higher with august at 7305 
cents a pound live hogs were 85 cent lower to 22 cent higher 
with july at 4557 cents a pound and frozen pork bellies were 127 
cents lower to 165 cents higher with july at 3785 cents a pound 
cotton prices followed the lead of grains and soybeans falling 
down the daily 2centsapound limit on concerns of cropenhancing 
rains after surging up the limit on monday 
cotton settled 125 cents lower to 238 cents lower for the july 
contract which has no limit the july contract was 6642 cents a 
pound 
precious metals also felt pressure from the selling wave in corn 
and beans said jack barbanel an analyst with gruntal amp co in new 
york 
when the agriculturals could not sustain a rally there 
were quite substantial selloffs in gold and silver he said 
gold prices settled 540 to 560 lower with the june contract 
at 43750 a troy ounce silver settled 179 cents to 187 cents 
lower with june at 6757 a troy ounce 
sugar prices rallied on talk of bottleneck in shipments of 
imports as well as expectations that a droughtinduced shortfall 
in corn production will lead to high corn syrup prices persuading 
manufacturers to use more sugar instead analysts said 
sugar prices settled 50 cent to 66 cent higher with the 
contract for delivery in july at 1262 cents a pound new york 
coffee sugar and cocoa exchange tuesday 
energy futures were lower in lackluster trading pressured by an 
oversupply of crude oil said peter beutel an analyst with elders 
futures inc in new york 
crude oil settled 8 cents to 21 cents lower with the august 
contract at 1578 a barrel heating oil settled 28 cent to 53 
cent lower with july at 4231 cents a gallon and unleaded gasoline

the federal government on tuesday sued the 
international brotherhood of teamsters to force reforms on the 
nations largest labor union calling it a major american 
scandal dominated by the mafia 
the civil racketeering lawsuit in the works for more than a 
year was filed in federal court in manhattan by us attorney 
rudolph giuliani 
we are not seeking overall control of the teamsters union 
giuliani told a packed news conference this is a use of the 
racketeering statute in a surgical way to attempt to take back from 
the mafia the teamsters union 
weldon mathis the secretarytreasurer and acting president of 
the 16 millionmember union condemned the suit as a vicious 
antilabor attack two us senators and the aflcio of which 
the teamsters is a member attacked the lawsuit as overstepping 
government authority 
giuliani stressed that this lawsuit is not in any sense an 
attack on trade unionism or on the many many teamsters who are 
honest hard working people 
named as defendants were the international brotherhood of 
teamsters chauffeurs warehousemen and helpers of america the 
general executive board of the union as a group the executive 
boards 18 members and one former member as individuals 26 alleged 
members or associates of the american mafia or la cosa nostra and 
the mobs ruling commission as a group 
twentyfive of those 26 defendants already have been convicted 
of teamstersrelated crimes such as labor peace extortion 
embezzling union funds or taking labor payoffs the board consists 
of teamsters president jackie presser mathis and 16 vice 
presidents 
the government wants a federal judge to remove from office any 
teamsters officers found at trial to have violated federal 
racketeering laws 
us district judge david n edelstein granted the government a 
temporary restraining order that bars the board from making large 
expenditures of union funds or destroying union records the order 
also banned the 25 previously convicted mob defendants from 
participating in union affairs 
the lawsuit also sought appointment of a union trustee to ensure 
free and fair union elections 
prosecutors planned to attack and reverse once and for all a 
major american scandal organized crimes alliance with the 
teamsters giuliani said 
speaking at a news conference in montreal where the union 
general executive is holding its quarterly meeting mathis said the 
suit was a shameful attempt to destroy a democratic union it 
will not be tolerated 
at the same news conference teamsters lawyer john climaco said 
its pure myth that this organization is in any way influenced or 
controlled by organized crime 
im shocked and surprised that anyone who had reviewed this 
case not in the soviet union not in poland but in the united 
states of america would take such action climaco said 
the leaders declined to outline how they will fight the suit 
were not going to litigate this in front of the media climaco 
said 
sen orrin hatch of utah the ranking republican on the senate 
labor and human resources committee said the suit sets a 
terrible precedent 
if there are union officers who are corrupt or are connected 
with the mafia then the government should come down on them with 
dispatch hatch said on the senate floor but i have great 
difficulty in the trusteeship of an entire international union i 
dont think the government or any court in this nation is capable 
of being a trustee over a union 
sen paul simon dill echoed hatchs remarks i think were 
getting on very very thin ice here he said 
at the justice department attorney general edwin meese called 
the suit a very carefully developed you might call it almost 
legally surgical step to remove the corrupt influences from the 
teamsters 
it is designed to give the members of the teamsters what they 
deserve that is a union that represents them rather than 
organized crime he said 
meese also said he had no apologies for president reagans 
having accepted teamsters support in his 1980 campaign for the 
white house 
one of the things that was looked at was to see whether 
there was evidence of organized crime or other information 
available he said there was no such evidence available at the 
time 
the government used a similar suit two years ago under the 
racketeerinfluenced corrupt organizations act to place teamsters 
local 560 in new jersey under the control of a governmentappointed 
trustee giuliani said it was the ninth time prosecutors had used 
civil provisions of the rico laws to attack alleged mob control 
over unions or businesses 
that control is so pervasive that for decades the ibts 
leadership has permitted la cosa nostra figures to dominate and 
corrupt important teamsters locals joint councils and benefit 
funds prosecutors said in court papers 
giuliani said organized crime has deprived union members of 
their rights through a pattern of racketeering that includes 20 
murders a number of shootings bombings beatings a campaign of 
fear extortion and theft and misuses of union funds 
the aflcio issued a statement calling the lawsuit a clear 
abuse of the governments prosecutorial power and if sustained 
would undermine a free trade union movement 
if the justice department has evidence sufficient to prove 
that officers of the international brotherhood of teamsters or any 
other union have committed federal offenses the department should 
proceed against those individuals directly under laws which forbid 
convicted criminals from holding union office the statement said 
the teamsters union rejoined the aflcio in october after a 
30year absence from the labor federation 
among the 26 alleged mafia members or associates named in the 
civil action were the reputed heads of six mob families 
they included convicted crime family bosses anthony fat tony 
salerno of the genovese group anthony tony ducks corallo of 
the luccheses and carmine junior persico of the colombo family 
all three were convicted in 1986 of sitting on the commission 
that ruled the us mafia since prohibition 
salerno 77 serving a 100year prison term for the commission 
conviction also was convicted last month of bid rigging in new 
yorks construction industry but the same jury acquitted him and 
two others of rigging the election of presser and his predecessor 
roy williams 
williams serving a 10year prison term for trying to bribe a 
us senator testified at the salerno trial that he was controlled 
by kansas city mobsters 
presser under indictment in cleveland for an alleged ghost 
employee scheme is on leave from the union following surgery last 
month for a brain tumor in his absence mathis is acting president

the closing of an old garbage incinerator tuesday 
raised the prospect that up to 200 daily overseas flights into 
torontos international airport soon may have to fly without food 
for passengers 
under canadian government regulations garbage from incoming 
international flights must be incinerated to prevent the 
importation of disease 
but the old toronto incinerator used for that purpose closed 
tuesday because of fears that it was spewing dioxins and other 
pollutants into the air 
temporary disposal facilities at the airport may be ready in 
about four weeks but in the interim the 52 airlines using toronto 
airport have been unable to find a place to burn 25 tons a day of 
waste said transport canada spokesman ian taylor 
the executive committee of the metropolitan toronto council 
agreed tuesday night to keep the old incinerator open at least for 
a few days to avert a crisis on wednesday 
earlier taylor had said that without the incinerator 
well have nowhere to store the garbage and nowhere to 
incinerate it he said the airlines have said that as a last 
resort they may have to withdraw food service its a major 
problem 
a spokesman for minneapolisbased northwest airlines whose only 
direct flight into toronto is from detroit said his airline will 
simply take any garbage from the short flight back to detroit 
airlines making stopovers at other airports can empty their 
garbage there 
but carriers operating longer direct flights serving two or 
three meals have no such solution 
you cant fly airplanes around full of garbage said 
spokesman barry corbett of the canadian airline wardair which has 
regular service between toronto and london paris and honolulu 
it would only take a day or so and your plane would be full of 
garbage with no room for baggage we believe this is resolvable 
somehow before that happens corbett said 
the airlines had hoped to ship the waste to a new incinerator in 
hamilton an hour south of toronto by road but hamilton officials 
announced june 22 they will not take the garbage unless airlines 
schedule more flights to their city a sore point in a steel town 
jealous of torontos economic dominance 
as a stopgap taylor said the government will allow the 
airlines to install compacting and dehydration machines at the 
airport to turn the waste into odorless pellets the pellets can 
then be stored in an airport building until a permanent solution is 
found he said 
but that equipment cant be up and running for about four

the staff of the nuclear regulatory commission 
unveiled a proposal monday aimed at making it easier to license new 
nuclear plants and warned that no one will ever build one again 
unless something like it is adopted 
under the proposal the commission could grant a conditional 
operating license at the same time it grants a construction permit 
provided that the plant design conformed with previously tested and 
approved models 
the nrc still would have to decide when construction was 
complete if the conditions for operation had been met but the 
procedure would entail far less time and effort than the current 
licensing system in which some plants have remained idle for years 
even after construction was complete 
the draft regulation would sharply restrict the required public 
hearings on operating licenses to allegations of material and 
uncorrected nonconformance with the conditional license or 
allegations that adequate protection is threatened 
the commission has long sought congressional authority to grant 
the operating license and the construction permit at the same time 
for standardized plants but various bills to encourage 
standardization and allow such onestop licensing have not 
gotten beyond the hearing stage 
in presenting the regulatory proposal william c parler the 
nrcs general counsel told the commissioners it is my judgment 
that unless the licensing process is changed it is not likely to 
be used by people who have to make the decisions about obtaining 
bulk power supply in the future 
utility executives have voiced similar sentiments for years 
commission chairman lando zech said he hoped to publish the 
proposal for public comment soon he said it was perhaps the most 
important initiative we are engaged in this year 
loring mills vice president for nuclear matters at the edison 
electric institute the nations principal trade association of 
private utilities said later we are in favor of whatever the 
nrc can do administratively to move forward on standardized plant 
design and onestop licensing 
though 107 commercial plants provide more than 18 percent of the 
nations electricity huge construction costs delays and 
controversy over safety have meant no new plant orders since the 
1970s 
the 107 plants encompass more than 60 reactor designs from five 
providers and built by more than a dozen engineering companies at 
connecticuts millstone plant three different builders provided 
reactors 
standard designs to which modifications are strictly limited are 
bound to save costs make operation easier and facilitate the 
transfer of expertise and safety information from one operator to 
another the commission believes 
the new plan would permit utilities to win approval for a site 
in advance of approval of plant design with such authorization 
good for 20 years to permit banking of sites 
the commission would also certify standard plant designs as 
safe normally after operation of a demonstration reactor 
according to the draft regulation the site application 
shall contain emergency plans which are as fully developed as 
circumstances permit and which show that the area surrounding the 
site is amenable to emergency planning which would provide 
reasonable assurance that adequate protective measures could be 
taken in the even of a radiological emergency at the site 
the construction application would require a showing that the 
utility had made a good faith effort to win approval of 
emergency plans by local and state governments 
refusal by the state and local governments to cooperate in an 
evacuation plan has kept the shoreham plant on long island from 
winning an operating license and similar objections by 
massachusetts have kept the seabrook plant just over the border on 
new hampshires seacoast from operating 
the commission insists as a general matter that it can license 
plants in such circumstances and to require state and local 
approval would give those authorities a veto that congress never 
intended 
under the proposed plan a utility failing to get that 
cooperation would still have to show that its proposed emergency 
plans nonetheless provide reasonable assurance that adequate 
protective measures can be taken in the event of a radiological 
emergency at the site

the credit card may have come to symbolize the 
american economy in the 1980s but checks and cash are still the 
preferred means of doing business for many consumers 
remember the great predictions of the 1970s that by the 
mid1980s america would be a cashless society observed david 
walker economist at the bridgeport connbased peoples bank 
the experts were wrong and probably will continue to be 
according to recent data from the federal reserve bank of san 
francisco american households use cash to make 36 percent of their 
purchases while credit cards accounts for just 7 percent 
checks which also were once thought likely to be destined for 
oblivion still rank at the top with 57 percent 
checks predominate for a couple of important reasons they are 
heavily used for paying bills by mail since cash in the mail can 
get lost stolen or otherwise go astray without leaving any 
evidence of its having been sent 
in addition they provide a running record for people on a 
budget or simply wishing to keep track of their spending habits 
cancelled checks are also useful to have on hand for figuring 
and documenting tax deductions or to settle any dispute that might 
come up over whether a given payment has been made 
as walker notes however cash remains popular as the quickest 
and most convenient means of payment for everyday purchases 
cash transactions also are anonymous making them attractive 
for illegal transactions or tax evasion he adds indeed 
economists often rely on cash usage patterns to detect the size of 
the underground economy 
walker argues that the lowering of income tax brackets under tax 
reform could stand to reduce the attractiveness of using cash to 
avoid taxes that remains to be seen 
ironically he says the trend to automation in consumer banking 
that was supposed to usher in the cashless society has instead 
given cash a fresh boost with the spread of automatic teller 
machines or atms 
in 1977 there were about 10000 atms around the country today 
the total exceeds 80000 
these machines are available to dispense cash to consumers at 
any time of day or night and their proliferation has doubtless 
changed the way many people go about spending and managing money 
banks have been quick to adopt atm systems in lieu of employing 
more human tellers as a way to lower their operating costs 
another incentive for banks to promote their atms walker says 
lies in their dealings with the federal reserve 
the fed charges banks a fee for wire transfer of funds and for 
processing checks but it imposes no such fee for its 
cashprocessing services 
the credit card has meanwhile been dealt a significant setback 
under tax reform the tax deduction for interest paid on consumer 
interest is being reduced in stages to zero by 1991 
of course many people pay their monthly creditcard balances in 
full so that they seldom or never incur interest charges there 
are also increasing numbers of debit cards with which purchases 
are processed just as if a check had been written 
still amid all the plastic and paper coin and currency 
continue to hold a prominent position concludes walker visions 
of a cashless society are likely to remain just that cold cash 
will be with us for some time to come

everything is suddenly backward for the nations 
central bank which ordinarily worries the dollar may fall too 
quickly and disrupt the world economy 
now the federal reserve has to worry that the dollar may rise 
too quickly and disrupt the world economy 
when the dollar is in danger of falling the fed is reluctant to 
stimulate the economy by cutting interest rates it fears the lower 
rates will drive away foreign investors and sink the currency 
with the dollar strong everything is reversed if the fed 
raises interest rates to keep inflation frm heating up in the 
strong economy foreign investors may swarm in to take advantage of 
the attractive yields 
the foreign buying would shove the dollar even higher defeating 
the intentions of the fed and other central banks to keep a lid on 
the us currency 
it may already be happening world expectations that the fed 
will keep tight reins on money could be one factor pushing the 
dollar up economist robert litan of the brookings institution said 
monday 
litan said he thinks the dollar still is destined to sink under 
the weight of the trade deficit although he said one can easily 
concoct a scenario where it stays up for several months even as 
long as until the next election 
whether its going up or going down the dollars movements 
illustrate how us policymakers have to keep foreign investors in 
mind when they make decisions about the domestic economy 
if the dollar shoots too high us companies become 
uncompetitive in world markets too low and inflation heats up 
because of the increasing cost of imports and the heating up of the 
economys export sector 
the suddenness of the dollars rise also illustrates how 
unpredictable exchange rates remain despite efforts by central 
banks to smooth out their fluctuations 
you should learn to distrust people who say they know where 
the dollar is going to go because no one has the slightest idea 
where exchange rates are going to move from week to week or month 
to month said allan meltzer a professor at carnegiemellon 
university in pittsburgh 
meltzer is fairly bullish on the dollar despite his reluctance 
to forecast exchange rates that sets him apart from the economists 
who believe the dollar will come under pressure from rising 
inflation and continued trade troubles 
david hale chief economist of kemper financial services inc in 
chicago said there is a limit to how much trade can improve as 
long as the united states needs to continue importing capital to 
cover its shortfall in savings 
hale said the savings shortfall can be solved only by cutting 
the budget deficit raising the personal savings rate or worse 
cutting investment so less capital is needed 
with no clear signs of any of those happening hale said i 
think the dollar will go lower again later this year 
after months of glassy calm the dollar burst out of its trading 
range with gains of 4 percent against the japanese yen and west 
german mark and 5 percent against the british pound from last 
monday to this monday 
the commerce department helped trigger the dollars rally with 
its june 14 report that the merchandise trade deficit narrowed to a 
seasonally adjusted 989 billion in april its lowest level since 
1984 
but mieczyslaw karczmar a new yorkbased adviser for deutsche 
bank said he believes the biggest factor in the dollars rise is 
the markets perception that the major central banks would stand by 
and permit the climb 
the markets are testing this to see what extent the tolerance 
will go karczmar said 
at some point the central banks will agree to bash the dollar 
back down and the west germans may lead the way out of fear that a 
weaker mark will add to their inflation rate karczmar said 
historical experience shows that euroepans are never happy 
with the dollar whether it goes up or it goes down he said

the biggest insider trading case since the ivan 
boesky scandal erupted more than two years ago has jolted wall 
street this time implicating a trainee at a prestigious brokerage 
and a hong kong businessman whom the government says reaped 19 
million in illicit profits 
a securities and exchange commission civil complaint filed 
monday accused stephen wang jr a junior analyst in a training 
program at morgan stanley amp co of giving secrets about impending 
corporate takeovers to fred c lee a morgan stanley client with 
homes in hong kong and mclean va a swank washington suburb 
from at least july 1987 through at least april 1988 lee 
placed longdistance telephone calls from mclean va hong kong 
and elsewhere to wang at his home and office in new york read 
the sec complaint filed in manhattan federal court during these 
telephone calls wang improperly disclosed to lee the material 
nonpublic information 
lee paid wang at least 200000 for the information according 
to the complaint 
thomas c newkirk the secs chief litigation counsel said a 
probe into the activities of wang and lee was continuing and he did 
not rule out the possibility that others may have been involved 
sec sources speaking on condition they not be identified also 
said they expected federal prosecutors to seek criminal indictments 
against wang and lee the same pattern that emerged in the boesky 
case 
the sec said lee made 19 million by trading on the tips and 
shared at least 200000 of the money with wang it demanded the 
pair return the money plus pay triple that amount in penalties for 
a total of 76 million 
the amount is second only to the record 100 million in profit 
and fines paid in november 1986 by boesky the former wellknown 
speculator was at the center of a massive scandal in which wall 
streeters illegally used confidential corporate information to 
profit in stock transactions 
boesky who implicated a number of other wall street 
professionals was banished from the securities business for life 
and is serving a threeyear federal prison term 
morgan stanley which was an adviser in the proposed takeovers 
listed in the complaint moved quickly to distance itself from any 
suggestion of wrongdoing the firm said it suspended wang last 
friday after the sec subpoeanaed him 
the firm also said it had been cooperating with the sec for some 
time in its probe and was considering separate but unspecified 
legal action against wang and lee 
the new york times in todays editions quoted unidentified 
sources as saying that morgan stanleys compliance department had 
picked up suspicious trading in lees account as early as last year 
newkirk said the sec began investigating the matter in april but 
the probe did not break until friday when lee admitted details of 
his arrangement with wang to commission officials interviewing lee 
in hong kong 
morgan stanley officials said wang lived in new york but his 
whereabouts were unclear wangs lawyer former sec regional 
commissioner ira l sorkin declined to comment on the complaint or 
his client 
wang 24 was only a few days away from the july 1 expiration of 
his twoyear training period at morgan stanley which like other 
big brokerages utilizes an extensive recruiting system he had 
spent the second year of the program in the firms mergers and 
acquisitions unit 
trainees are expected to leave at the end of the program most 
usually go to graduate business school and some are invited to 
return 
an employee of wangs rank generally made a salary and bonus 
that totaled around 35000 a year sources at the firm said 
lee 38 was described by morgan stanley and sec sources as a 
wealthy member of a taiwanese family who had a number of trading 
and bank accounts interests in real estate importexport 
operations and public utilities 
sec investigators also asked that lees bank accounts be frozen 
alleging in the complaint that lee had attempted to move money out 
of the united states 
gary lynch the sec enforcement chief said investigators allege 
the trading on inside information involved stock in about 25 
different companies including ef hutton group inc stop amp shop 
cos utah power amp light co and impact systems 
the complaint said for example lee made 3 million in profit 
by trading the stock of stop shop 12 million in profits on the 
stock of ef hutton and 840000 in profits on utah power

stephen wang jr was days from completing a 
twoyear traineeship at prestigious morgan stanley amp co when the 
government implicated him in the secondbiggest insider trading 
scheme ever to rock wall street 
the 24yearold junior analyst in the mergers and acquisitions 
department was named in a securities and exchange commission 
complaint monday alleging he conspired with a hong kong businessman 
to profit illegally from takeover stocks using inside information 
morgan stanley said it suspended wang last friday when sec 
investigators subpoenaed him following a discreet investigation 
that lasted two months wangs whereabouts werent known monday and 
his attorney former sec regional commissioner ira l sorkin 
declined to comment on any aspect of the case 
the complaint asked the federal court in new york to order the 
return of 19 million in alleged trading profits plus triple that 
amount in damages for a total of 76 million 
wang who was said to make about 35000 annually in salary and 
bonus was scheduled to complete his training program this friday 
gary lynch the secs enforcement chief said the case is the 
second biggest insider trading case ever handled by the sec 
dwarfed only by the case brought against ivan boesky the former 
speculator who paid the enforcement agency a record 100 million in 
disgorged profits and penalties in november 1986 
wang attended the university of illinois at champaignurbana for 
four years beginning in the fall of 1982 first studying political 
science then switching to finance and accounting officials at the 
school said 
but administrators at the universitys main record office and at 
the college of commerce said wang did not finish his course work 
larry friedman a morgan stanley spokesman said the investment 
house was aware wang was about two credits shy of his degree 
when he entered the training program in the summer of 1986 
asked whether wang had access to particularly sensitive material 
while working at morgan friedman said it sure looks that way 
the investment house considers the analysts full employees 
they sit in on meetings theyre put to work but they should not 
break the rules the spokesman said 
like all morgan employees wang and his peers were given written 
guidelines that address how to deal with sensitive information 
client confidentiality as well as insider information the morgan 
spokesman said the detailed guidelines go beyond a code of 
ethics

the crash of an airbus a320 jetliner during a 
demonstration flight in eastern france could make potential 
purchasers of the plane wary and may be damaging for its 
manufacturer according to some airline analysts 
although officials do not yet know exactly what caused sundays 
crash of the ultramodern air france jet a preliminary probe 
indicated the plane was flying too low when it made a pass during 
an air show french officials said monday 
but the president of air frances pilots union said the planes 
engines may have failed to restart at the pilots command 
as investigators attempt to sort out the cause of the crash the 
destruction of the highly computerized aircraft has raised 
questions about the a320s safety and the potential impact on 
airbus industrie the european consortium that builds the plane 
its obviously not good said anthony hatch an airline 
analyst for argus research corp 
the accident could inflict psychological damage against the 
highlytouted a320 and prompt cancelled orders and lost sales 
hatch said because only a handful of the narrowbody jets have are 
in service yet he said the a320s defenders can not point to a 
long flight safety record 
the incident also focuses attention on the trend toward more 
technology and fewer pilots the newer planes rely on two pilots 
in the cockpit instead of the usual three 
airbus which is financed by the governments of france britain 
west germany and spain competes intensely with us aircraft 
makers boeing co and mcdonnell douglas corp 
the crash of the a320 does help boeing somewhat its hard to 
say how much said bill gorman an aerospace analyst for 
provident national bank in philadelphia 
the a320 competes most closely with newer versions of boeings 
737 and with mcdonnell douglas md80 which also are relatively 
small planes ideal for shorter hauls but the us rival planes are 
less technologically advanced than the airbus jet 
air canada which is on the verge of buying 33 a320s said 
monday it will keep close tabs on the french governments inquiry 
into the crash airbus is believed to be close to winning the air 
canada contract over boeing and mcdonnell douglas 
the a320 which carries about 150 passengers uses 40 percent 
less fuel than similar aircraft and is the fastestselling plane in 
aviation history 
only four of the new planes are currently in service two are 
operated by air france in addition to the one destroyed in the 
crash and two by british airways plc but more than 500 have been 
ordered by 21 customers worldwide including the french and british 
carriers 
among us carriers northwest airlines has ordered 100 of the 
planes in a deal valued at 32 billion 
i doubt the crash would have an impact on our decision to 
purchase from airbus alan muncaster a spokesman for northwest 
said sunday but obviously we would want to check into the cause 
of the crash 
pan am corp another major us airline has ordered 16 a320s 
for 488 million with an option to buy 34 more it would be 
premature to reevaluate that decision until the full results of 
the crash inquiry are in pan am spokeswoman pamela hanlon said 
monday 
two us leasing companies also have ordered the a320 gatx air 
a subsidiary of gatx corp has ordered 10 while international 
lease finance corp has three on order spokesmen for the two lease 
companies were unavailable for comment monday 
british airways suspended use of its two a320s after sundays 
crash but put them back into service starting tuesday as the 
result of discussions with airbus and britains civil aviation 
authority air frances two remaining a320s which also were 
grounded were put back in operation as of tuesday 
the planes highly computerized system replaces the pilots 
control stick with a series of computers and miles of electronic 
cables instead of the pilot physically moving the stick to adjust 
the aircrafts flaps for example computers are used to send an 
electronic signal to the flaps 
we have full faith in this airplane said david venz an 
airbus spokesman in herndon va it will continue to be one of 
the most successful in aviation history 
if the cause of the crash turned out to be a computer software 
problem it would be a sort of black eye for airbus but would 
be easily ironed out suggested edward starkman an airline analyst 
for investment firm painewebber inc

fort howard corps decision to go 
private in a managementled 357 billion leveraged buyout could 
spark a bidding war led by foreign investors according to analysts 
the agreement unveiled monday calls for a cash offer of 53 per 
share starting july 1 for all 674 million outstanding common 
shares of the giant 69yearold manufacturer of disposable paper 
plastic and foam products 
fort howard stock jumped 387 to 5387 a share in heavy 
trading on the new york stock exchange following a 250 a share 
rise on friday when fort howard announced it was negotiating for a 
leveraged buyout 
the company said the merger was recommended unanimously by a 
special committee of fort howards outside directors which now 
will make itself available to receive inquiries from any other 
parties interested in acquiring the company 
one could certainly interpret that they have left the door 
open for other bidders to come through should they see fit to do 
so said hugh f denison director of research at the milwaukee 
company i wouldnt be surprised if somebody does 
but denison suggested it would take japanese or other foreign 
buyers looking at the longterm worth of the company to offer more 
than 53 a share 
my guess would be that if somebody new comes into the picture 
they would apt to be from a foreign land he said 
its possible that another bidder might come forward said 
rudolph a hokanson of the firm blunt ellis amp loewi in milwaukee 
i have no idea who that could be but it would have to be someone 
who is well financed and who will have to act quickly 
the board of directors stated it had signed a definitive merger 
agreement with three top fort howard executives and the morgan 
stanley leveraged equity fund ii an east coast limited partnership 
formed late last year 
the fort howard executives are paul j schierl the chairman and 
chief executive officer president donald h demeuse and kathleen 
j hempel first vice president 
this change in ownership from a public to a privatelyheld 
corporation is in the best interests of shareholders employees 
customers and the company communities in which we have 
operations schierl said 
as a private company we can continue to provide excellent job 
and career opportunities for our 16000 employees while maintaining 
our commitments to the many communities that depend on fort 
howard 
schierl said fort howard had the financial resources necessary 
to serviecs the debt it would incur under the buyout in a 
leveraged buyout a company is acquired mainly with borrowed funds 
that are repaid with money raised by asset sales or cash flow 
the morgan stanley leveraged equity fund ii and morgan stanley 
group inc plan to provide approximately 153 billion in temporary 
financing for acquisitions and equity the socalled bridge 
financing is expected to be repaid through a public or private 
offering of longterm debt 
the equity fund has received commitments of more than 16 
billion from investors including pension funds and financial 
institutions 
also subject to certain conditions bankers trust is to lead a 
syndicate of banks in providing up to 255 billion in primary 
financing of which bankers trust will provide 500 million 
fort howard is a fine company with a strong record of 
performance tom saunders chairman of equity fund said we 
believe fort howard has excellent prospects and we are pleased to 
be associated with them 
fort howards product line includes bath and facial tissues 
napkins and industrial wipers paper and plastic cupss lids 
plates sandwich containers food packages straws and ice cream 
cones 
fort howard founded in green bay in 1919 reported 1987 sales 
of 18 billion and net earnings of 1577 million it went public 
in 1970 
the company employs nearly 16000 people in north america 
europe and the far east

although european economic 
community leaders have agreed to study what steps they could take 
to establish a european monetary union they will not necessarily 
be seeking to establish a multination central bank 
leaders of the 12 european economic community nations meeting 
in a twoday summit in hanover agreed to create a panel that will 
be chaired by eec commission president jaques delors aimed at 
recommending concrete steps toward establishment of a european 
monetary union 
dutch prime minister ruud lubbers told reporters early today the 
panel also would include central bank presidents from the eec 
nations 
the committee will prepare a report with proposals for leading 
to increased european monetary integration although there probably 
would not be any mention of a european central bank in the panels 
mandate lubbers said 
a senior british official said prime minister margaret thatcher 
who opposes the idea of a european central bank did not oppose the 
initiative he also said the concept of monetary union would have 
to be betterdefined in the coming year 
european finance ministers would review the panels 
recommendations before their proposals are discussed at the eec 
summit slated to be held in spain a year from now lubbers said 
establishment of a centralized european bank is one of the main 
topics at the eec gathering 
a spokesman for the british delegation said mrs thatcher was 
still skeptical such a development could ever occur 
you will only have it a european central bank when you 
dissolve the british house of commons among other political 
institutions said the british official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
we do not think it would be fruitful to set up a european 
central bank he said 
the british official also said mrs thatcher had proposed six 
nearterm priorities for the eec to focus on in its drive to create 
a barrierfree internal market by 1992 
according to the official thatcher suggested the eec 
concentrate on among other things further liberalization of 
financial services to include banking securities and life 
insurance markets streamlining of testing and product standards 
throughout the eec further opening of markets for public works 
projects and liberalization of the european transportation market 
supporters of the creation of a european central bank and a 
common eec currency say those aims are important to the communitys 
plans for achieving a totally barrierfree market by 1992 
britain also has been reluctant to join the european monetary 
system 
the ems is a program under which the currency exchange rates of 
participating eec nations are kept within a certain range to 
prevent wide fluctuations eight of the 12 eec countries 
participate in the system 
mrs thatcher has been reluctant to connect the pound with the 
ems because that would decrease domestic control over monetary 
policy
