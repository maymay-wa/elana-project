president bush on wednesday declared the 
earthquakeshattered san francisco bay region a major disaster 
area calling the devastation a matter of grave national 
concern and directing an initial 273 million to relief efforts 
bush said he wants to inspect the damage personally and 
officials said the trip west was likely friday or saturday 
i want the citizens of the san francisco bay area and its 
neighbors first to know that our hearts are with them as they face 
this terrible tragedy the president said 
words cant adequately convey our sentiments i know but i 
can say that we will take every step and make every effort to help 
the bay area in its hour of need 
stung by criticism of the governments response to hurricane 
hugo bush made a point of praising the federal emergency 
management agency which plays the lead role in federal disaster 
relief efforts 
i hope there will be less carping bush said i think they 
took a bad hit on that other one from some quarters he commented 
after an unscheduled moraleboosting visit to fema headquarters 
where relief efforts by 25 federal agencies were being planned and 
coordinated 
bush received a telephoned report from air force two carrying 
vice president dan quayle to washington from a tour of the damage 
quayle told reporters at andrews air force base near washington he 
stressed the importance of volunteer rescue efforts and 
preparation noting an august earthquake response drill held by 
state and federal agencies 
it could have been much worse if we had not had that 
preparation quayle said 
the vice president said he believed its under control and we 
are making progress there will be adequate personnel there 
are many volunteers federal funds will be forthcoming 
bush received messages of sympathy and offers of support from 
numerous world leaders including soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev who received us help after last decembers devastating 
earthquake in armenia 
if these countries can help we certainly welcome their 
assistance said white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
bush said he wants to visit the devastated area but that there 
are certain security constraints connected with this job and the 
last thing we want to do is clutter things up but i do want to 
make a trip out there and i probably will 
the white house said the initial 273 million will come from 
unallocated money in a 11 billion appropriation approved earlier 
for hurricane hugo relief 
rep vic fazio dcalif chairman of the house appropriations 
subcommittee with jurisdiction over fema said members of congress 
were giving the agency high marks so far but it would need more 
money no question we would want to take funds out of existing 
programs we need the administrations cooperation to get that 
funding fazio said 
bushs earthquake disaster declaration authorizes the government 
to play a major role in relief and recovery efforts paying at 
least 75 percent of the cost of rebuilding bridges and other public 
facilities and providing lowcost loans for individuals and 
businesses 
even the internal revenue service got into the act announcing 
that it would waive penalties for taxpayers unable to file returns 
or make scheduled payments because of the earthquake 
the areas covered by bushs order include the city and county of 
san francisco and the counties of alameda monterey san benito 
san mateo santa clara and santa cruz 
bush during a meeting with elementary school principals from 
around the country singled out ray tolcacher superintendent of 
windsor union school district in san francisco 
we just hope that your kids and your schools and all the 
families are safe and sound bush said 
he said his administration is working closely with california 
state officials to provide assistance saying it is a matter of 
grave national concern 
within hours of the earthquake bush had dispatched 
transportation secretary samuel skinner to san francisco and 
directed vice president dan quayle in san diego after a speech to 
hook up with skinner for a helicopter inspection tour they were in 
touch during the day by telephone with bush 
fitzwater acknowledged the relief efforts for hurricane hugo 
could be strapped by the diversion of funds to the earthquake 
when the money runs out well have to assess the need and go 
back for more he said

safety complaints from stunt 
workers at the new disneymgm studios are being investigated by 
federal inspectors for possible safety violations 
the tourist attraction says it is cooperating in the review and 
a company spokesman said walt disney world does not expect to be 
cited by the occupational safety and health administration 
inspectors from oshas atlanta office were called in after a 
performer was involved in an accident last month during an outdoor 
show that recreates scenes from indiana jones adventure movies 
the stunt worker fell from a moving ladder and osha said the 
complaints indicated the man suffered injuries to his head neck 
back and right elbow 
during the show a cast of stuntpeople escape from exploding 
jeeps jump from buildings and reenact other daring escapades that 
indiana jones manages on celluloid the show is performed several 
times daily 
some workers complained that broken equipment was causing falls 
and smoke machines were irritating the workers noses and throats 
they also complained of slippery footing and improperly placed 
padding used to cushion falls 
i dont know of anything other than some minor falls said 
disneys publicity director charlie ridgway i know that in the 
training process and the whole business there are lots of sore 
muscles but there havent been any serious accidents 
he said disney has tried to ensure the safety of its workers 
and the company would be willing to accept any osha recommendations 
for improvements 
to assess the shows safety oshas advisers will review the 
procedures 
this is really something new for us so it may take several 
weeks to complete said rafael rodriguez an osha industrial 
hygienist

on the morning of april 18 1906 the people of san francisco 
woke abruptly to face calamity a devasting earthquake bringing 
widespread devastation and fire that killed at least 2500 and 
possibly 5000 people here are some excerpts of associated press 
accounts of that disaster 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
san francisco april 18 earthquakes and fire today have put 
nearly half of san francisco in ruins 
at least 200 persons have been killed thousands injured and 
the property loss will exceed 100000000 
thousands are homeless and destitute and all day long streams of 
people have been fleeing from the stricken districts to places of 
safety 
most of the principal buildings have already been destroyed and 
others are in imminent danger over all the scene of desolation 
hangs a dense pall of smoke 
it was 513 this morning when a terrific earthquake shock shook 
the whole city and surrounding country 
one shock apparently lasted two minutes and there was almost 
immediate collapse of flimsy structures all over the city 
the people became panicstricken and rushed into the streets 
most of them in their night attire they were met by showers of 
falling buildings bricks cornices and walls many were instantly 
crushed to death while others were dreadfully mangled 
fires have been raging all day and the fire department has been 
powerless to do anything except dynamite buildings threatened all 
day long explosions have shaken the city and added to the terror of 
the inhabitants 
all efforts to stay the progress of the fire were futile the 
south side of market street from ninth street to the bay was soon 
ablaze the fire covering a belt two blocks wide 
at the same time the commercial establishments and banks north 
of market street were burning the burning district in this section 
of the city extended from sansome street to the water front and 
the entire city seemed to be in flames 
the greatest destruction occurred in that part of the city which 
was reclaimed from san francisco bay much of the devasted district 
was at one time low marshy ground covered by water at high tide 
the damage by the earthquake to the residence portion of the 
city the finest part of which is on nob hill and pacific heights 
seems to have been slight 
the magnificent fairmount hotel not yet completed stands on 
the brink of nob hill overlooking the bay the hotel was not 
seriously damaged 
telegraph and telephone communication was shut off for a time 
the western union was put completely out of business and the 
postal company was the only company that managed to get a wire out 
of the city about 10 oclock even the postal was forced to 
suspend 
deep fissures opened in the filledin ground near the shore and 
the union ferry depot was injured 
the valencia hotel a fourstory wooden building sank into the 
basement a pile of splintered timbers under which were pinned 
many dead and dying occupants of the house the basement was full 
of water and some of the helpless victims were drowned 
at 9 oclock this morning 1000 men from the presido arrived 
down town to patrol the city streets the soldiers have been 
ordered to shoot down thieves caught in the act of robbng the dead 
and to guard with their lives the millions of dollars worth of 
property which has been placed in the streets that it may escape 
the ravages of the flames

scientists hope the galileo space 
probe carried into earth orbit aboard the space shuttle atlantis 
will find clues to the origin of the universe when it reaches 
jupiter in six years 
the mission also will look for organic chemicals in the gasses 
covering the largest planet chemicals that could also have been 
the basis for life on earth 
the jupiter system is so full of exciting phenomenon that we 
hardly know whats going on there said torrence johnson the 
galileo projects chief scientist what were trying to do is 
learn fundamental things about how the universe was formed how it 
ticks and where we came from 
the planet jupiter and its moons are in effect a minisolar 
system and jupiter itself is often called a star that never caught 
fire its hydrogenrich atmosphere should be a window into the 
conditions that existed when the sun and its planets formed 
the small probe will radio back readings during its 75minute 
plunge into the fifth planets atmosphere but galileo itself will 
continue a wide orbit around jupiter for 22 months keeping track 
of changes in its weather for the first longterm study of an outer 
planet 
while jupiter is the main target galileo will first circle 
venus to learn how its clouds circulate and look for lightning 
then the craft will fly twice by earth mapping hydrogen in the 
home planets atmosphere and photographing the moons north pole to 
look for ice 
galileo will also povide the first closeup data about 
asteroids passing within 600 miles of gaspra and ida on its way to 
jupiter

abdou mohammed sold a cow in his egyptian 
village to to buy a bus ticket to libya where he hoped to make his 
fortune as a farmer 
today squatting beside the sidewalk stand where he sells 
plastic water bottles and combs he laments his decision 
i cant find any work he said all i want is just to 
go back home 
mohammed is among thousands of egyptians who in the last four 
months have poured across the border in search of prosperity in 
libya formerly egypts bitterest enemy their enticements are 
warmer official relations between the two countries and bleak 
prospects in egypt with its faltering economy 
wealth eludes most of them in libya however they compete with 
thousands of workers from south korea poland romania sudan and 
ghana for fewer jobs as reduced oil revenues force libya to abandon 
grandiose construction schemes 
many egyptians now arrive with made in egypt aluminum pots 
plastic mats and chocolate bars all libyan favorites 
but those like mohammed and his friend rabia ahmed brought 
only their visions of careers as farmers expecting to earn much 
more money than back home in sohag 245 miles south of cairo 
egypts capital 
there are no jobs so ive had to buy these from other 
egyptians said mohammed waving a hand over his wares lined up 
on the sidewalk of an old covered bazaar nearby other egyptians 
were selling similar items arrayed on similar cardboard sheets 
i sold my cow for 2000 pounds 780 mohammed said 
thats gone and now all i want is just to make enough for a 
return ticket and go back home he said 
however rabia ahmed who sold land to finance his move to 
libya said things could be worse than hawking egyptian 
paraphernalia to libyans 
i might continue the business he said 
life is not plush for egyptians newly arrived in benghazi the 
first major stop for buses on the routes across the border opened 
last summer for the first time in more than a decade 
scenes from cairos poor and squalid quarters have been 
transported to this mediterranean city egyptian women carrying 
babies roam among cars at traffic lights to beg others wipe 
windshields in hopes of earning a few dinars or sell plastic 
lanterns 
in september col moammar gadhafi the libyan leader came 
across hundreds of homeless egyptians in one of benghazis main 
parks shortly afterwards they were moved to an unfinished 
concreteandsteel school building 
all an egyptian needs to travel to libya is a 75pound 30 
work permit or an invitation 
when borders were reopened thousands of egyptians poured into 
libya many of them merchants along with them came skilled workers 
and farmers riding 20 buses and 250 private cars or taxis a day 
at salloum a border crossing on the egyptian side the few 
passport control and customs officers were unprepared for the 
traffic load one recent day 
it took seven hours for a bus with 53 passengers to pass through 
during the wait a passport officer said an average 1500 
egyptians go through every day by bus and car there were a lot 
more a month ago many have come back without jobs and in tears

no one can agree on whose idea it was but a 
defense attorney has agreed to let the plaintiffs in a lawsuit give 
him a beating rather than ask his client to pay a 50000 
settlement 
i would love to hit him said anna manz of cincinnati whose 
daughter sued over her husbands death in a construction accident 
lawyer tom alexander who represents derr construction co of 
euless texas agreed to allow mrs manz her daughter machelle 
parks and their attorneys take their best shots at him 
the clients are very pleased said alexander he likes to 
have a lawyer so to speak who will go to the mat for him 
derr construction was one of several defendants in a wrongful 
death case brought by mrs parks on behalf of her husband billy 
parks 29 a foreman who was killed in a january 1987 construction 
fall in houston 
derr construction was a subcontractor on the job as was baker 
concrete parks employer 
the various litigants agreed sept 26 to a roughly 3 million 
settlement to be shared by all the defendants alexander who had 
sought numerous delays and postponements in the case was not 
involved in the negotiations when he learned his partner had 
offered that derr pay a 50000 share he angrily refused to let 
derr pay anything 
he was loud and he insisted that he wouldnt pay this mrs 
manz said he just kept really spouting off i really knew if 
i could just sock him it would be justified 
he was acting very pompous and was reneging on the 
agreement said dale friend who represents mrs parks 26 
out of the arguing and protests came the suggestion that 
alexander take it on the chin 
their agreement was left out of the formal settlement approved 
by judge davie wilson who didnt learn of the deal until later 
this sounds like one that might only come out of texas the 
judge said 
alexander 59 said the beating will be worth it 
ill be glad to take it on the chin for my client alexander 
said they all got aggravated at me but i refuse to pay nuisance 
settlements in the long run it costs you money to pay little 
rewards to people every time someone sues you 
alexander said the family had won its settlement from the 
responsible party and that his client had little to do with the 
liability 
friend wants the pummeling done at his firms christmas party 
this year but alexander said april 1 1990 april fools day is 
more appropriate 
mrs parks said she doesnt believe the event will ever take 
place 
i think it was something said to alexander to show him that 
that was really rotten to renege on the deal but its not 
something thats really going to be done she said 
but she added it would be great fun because he was a real 
creep he wasnt very compassionate and was very unprofessional

when word got out that the socialist party 
was running maria del carmen romero lopez a 42yearold former 
schoolteacher for parliament the opposition cried foul and 
likened her to eva peron and imelda marcos 
carmen romero happens to be mrs felipe gonzalez wife of 
spains twotime prime minister who is running for reelection 
mrs romero who uses her maiden name was given the no 3 spot 
on her partys list for cadiz where seven of the current nine 
deputies from the southern province are socialists 
because of the system of proportioning parliamentary seats to 
parties on the basis of their provincial votes she is certain to 
be elected 
mrs romero mother of children aged 17 16 and 10 has shunned 
the limelight during her husbands seven years in office and rarely 
accompanies him on official trips she has not adopted any causes 
or become involved in charitable work she says spain has only one 
first lady queen sofia wife of king juan carlos 
at the socialist party congress last year she tossed red roses 
at the executive committee that had just approved a 25 percent 
minimum quota for women in party and government positions 
gonzalez has been noticably neutral about his wifes candidacy 
limiting himself to remarks about the lack of democratic 
sentiment on the part of those who liken her to the wife of the 
late argentine leader juan d peron although she never ran for 
office eva peron also known as evita played a dominant political 
role in argentina in the 1940s until her death in 1952 
imelda marcos also had an influential role in the philippines 
before her husband the late ferdinand e marcos was ousted in 
1986 
mrs romero says that as a member of parliament she would 
concentrate on issues related to women education and youth 
unemployment 
press response to her first campaign appearance oct 1 in the 
town of chiclana was less than enthusiastic 
jose luis guitierrez a commentator for diario 16 called her 
political discourse outdated and her speaking voice not 
exactly good 
in spite of her partys decision to promote women gutierrez 
wrote carmen romero is not just another woman and for obvious 
reasons does not have the same rights and duties as other spanish 
women 
the feminist lidia falcon questioned mrs romeros record and 
says the invitation from the cadiz branch of the socialist party to 
run there seems more like an offer of an honorary presidency made 
to queens and aristocrats than a recognition for past services 
but cristina almeida a human rights attorney who is running for 
parliament on the opposition united left ticket in madrid welcomed 
mrs romeros candidacy saying she had all the right in the 
world to seek office

with his son steven is set for release in december fanneli said 
tuesday 
my great love was and still is horses farley said in an 
interview last year i wanted a pony as much as any boy or girl 
could possibly want anything but i never owned one 
farley who had lived in venice fla since 1946 was born in 
syracuse ny he started writing the black stallion as a 
child using his experiences with an uncle who was a famed horse 
trainer 
the final manuscript of the novel was delivered to random house 
in 1941 when farley was still a high school student in new york 
city and about the same age as his 17yearold hero alec ramsay 
farleys romantic tale about a young boy stranded on a desert 
island with a spirited horse brought him 1000 
after army service he attended columbia university then 
returned to writing and horses he produced 20 more books in the 
black stallion series and wrote 11 other books including 
shorter workers for younger children 
what he captured best is a childs love for a horse fanelli 
said his own love of horses shines through his books 
the black stallion was made into a movie produced by francis 
ford coppola in 1979 farley had refused dozens of previous movie 
offers fearing the story would be lost in the translation to film 
the movie received two academy award nominations and was 
followed by a sequel the black stallion returns 
farleys success enabled him to own many horses he and his 
wife rosemary spent their summers in the hills of central 
pennsylvania where they owned a farm at earlville 
in addition to his wife he is survived by a daughter two sons 
and a brother

dustin hoffmans shylock on the london stage is 
now a memory leaving a legacy of mixed reviews packed houses and 
great expectations for broadway where he opens in december 
sir peter halls production of shakespeares the merchant of 
venice was the lone smash hit in an otherwise lackluster summer 
for british drama it opened june 1 at the phoenix theater for a 
13week run that was extended through sept 23 
hoffman as shylock was a risky venture it wasnt just a 
question of ironing the new york inflections out of hoffmans 
voice but of how the fastidious british theatergoing public would 
take to a hollywood star attempting shakespeare 
i didnt quite know what it would be like all i knew is i 
would learn something hoffman said 
explaining the mixed reviews he blamed the speed with which the 
production was rushed onto the stage due to his fathers illness 
which forced him to spend time at his bedside in the united states 
we opened in this play after 10 public performances and my 
performance for me was like those incisions you see from people 
whove been operated on he said in an august interview 
you still see their fresh wounds and their stitches now im 
at a point where you can barely see the scars 
shylock is the jewish moneylender whose thirst for revenge 
against antonio leigh lawson the venetian merchant of the title 
finds its match in the exactingly legalistic heiress portia 
geraldine james 
hall who directed the play said that as an authentically 
jewish actor hoffman changed the part historically 
merchant seemed to me particularly right for him hall 
said in an interview shylock is about the outsider the man 
coming into the society which he is foreign to which was very much 
dustins situation coming into an english theater company 
assessing hoffmans achievement toward the end of the london 
run hall said shylock is wheeling and dealing and surviving 
and thats what dustin seizes hold of to me he answers the 
question is shylock comic or tragic by saying hes both hes a 
man 
the shylock character traditionally provokes the accusation that 
shakespeare was antisemitic and anyone involved in staging the 
merchant of venice knows how sensitively it must be handled 
to have a jewish actor play shylock is mandatory in our age 
said hall if youre going to talk about jewishness youd better 
do it from a position of integrity and knowledge not ham acting 
some of the plays success may have been due to renewed 
enthusiasm for shakespeare but the real draw undoubtedly was 
hoffman fresh from his second academy award for rain man in a 
play that marked both his british and his shakespearean stage debut 
hoffman who grew a beard for the show and shaved it off after 
the last performance eschewed abovethetitle billing and appeared 
half way down the cast list 
but despite such modesty the mixed reviews and a top ticket 
price of 1750 pounds 28 expensive by london standards the 
play quickly sold out only the london megamusicals such as 
phantom of the opera and aspects of love sold as many 
tickets 
the play starts new york performances dec 4 at the 46th st 
theater with an opening on dec 19 
hall recalled that hoffman first thought of playing hamlet but 
was judged too old at 52 malvolio in twelfth night another 
possibility was shelved for want of a suitable viola the two then 
hit on shylock one of shakespeares most controversial parts and 
also surprisingly small in light of its importance shylock appears 
in only five scenes 
a planned outoftown tryout in bath was canceled because of 
hoffmans fathers illness and hoffmans performance had to evolve 
during the run the opening said costar geraldine james was 
very rushed 
dustin hit his peak in the middle of the run she said in an 
interview he hadnt got the confidence at the beginning and 
i think he might have gone too much the other way towards the 
end playing too much into the audience 
she said she found his attitude anything but starry he was so 
generous spiritually and literally he wouldnt have his name over 
the title and insisted on me having the last curtain call 
julia wilsondickson the productions dialogue coach admired 
hoffman as a fanatical worker a seeker after the truth but 
perhaps a little more free in his enthusiasm than most british 
actors 
it fell to her to turn his dawg into dog and bawnd 
into bond and his performance over time got simpler more 
straightforward and physically stronger vocally she said in an 
interview 
the actual conception of it is exactly the same but the 
practical delivery has been honed greatly 
could hoffman tackle other shakespeare parts absolutely 
wilsondickson said ive told him so about 50 times and hes 
definitely humble enough to ask

in a campaign thats given new meaning to 
stretching the truth both candidates for new jersey governor 
are running tv ads that portray their opponents as pinocchio whose 
nose gets longer with every lie 
it has not exactly been an intellectual tea party kenneth 
connolly campaign manager for republican james courter said this 
week 
the namecalling between courter and democrat james florio has 
been denounced by popular twoterm republican gov thomas h kean 
and by newspaper editorials 
florio hit the huge new york and philadelphia television markets 
this month with commercials featuring courters nose getting longer 
and longer as a narrator ticks off a series of his supposed lies 
and misleading statements 
courter and his advisers liked the idea so much that they too 
employed the wooden character from c collodis the adventures of 
pinocchio 
courters commercial showed millions of viewers the faces of 
both congressmen florios regular nose grows longer and longer 
while courters enlarged proboscis simultaneously shrinks back to 
its regular shape 
the reason we ran the pinnochio spot is that jim florio on tv 
called jim courter a liar you simply cannot let that charge go 
unanswered we were forced to respond connolly said 
richard sinding president of the center for analysis of public 
issues at princeton university called the campaign for governor 
the dirtiest he has seen 
kean who is barred by state law from seeking a third 
consecutive fouryear term predicted the negative campaigning will 
depress the electorate people will say neither of them are any 
good 
jon shure a florio spokesman defended the opening pinocchio 
ad which blasted courters record in civil rights and 
environmental protection 
whats negative in this campaign is jim courters record 
shure said thats what our ad shows that was an 
attentiongetting advice a somewhat humorous way to make a serious 
point 
the courter campaign apparently did not enjoy it 
florio lied the narrator says in the republicans return 
volley 
poor jim florio the narrator concludes as florios nose 
stretches into pinocchian proportions even the newspapers say he 
has an ethical cloud hanging over his head 
courter is running an uphill battle against florio in novembers 
election recent polls indicate he is trailing by between 14 and 23 
points 
at the end of the classic childrens tale pinocchio turned into 
a real boy 
its not clear at what stage in his adult life he moved to new 
jersey and decided to run for governor said adrian heffern a 
political columnist for the asbury park press there are 
suspicions that his consultants are the fox and the cat who led him 
astray the first time

thousands of stranded office workers 
mingled with the homeless in san franciscos darkened streets 
tuesday night as a pitchblack night a night of fear and 
festiveness fell over this quakedamaged city by the bay 
fire engines and ambulances sirens howling picked their way 
through the darkness and over glassstrewn streets as a few stars 
peeked through a layer of smoke from a fire raging in the marina 
district 
an occasional office building running on emergency generators 
stood out in the blackness electrically powered trolleys formed 
little empty holes of light where they stalled emergency blinkers 
winking on and off car headlights crisscrossed pedestrians 
dodging among them 
and desperate people lined up 20 deep at pay telephones to call 
home 
answer dammit jeff darling yelled into one phone as he 
tried to reach his wife and child across san francisco bay in 
berkeley after the earthquake 
when the phone went unanswered darling dropped the receiver and 
sobbed uncontrollably ive got to know ive got to know what 
happened he said his house was undergoing renovation and he 
feared that some of the supports may have been undermined by the 
work 
but on other streets the scene seemed festive some fireworks 
were set off and children played outside 
people are out in the streets and it looks like a huge parade 
is about to come down the street said texas state treasurer ann 
richards who was walking in downtown san francisco when the deadly 
quake hit just after 5 pm 
but she added its really frightening 
after dark with power out people gathered in candlelit bars 
and restaurants groups of 10 or 20 stood on sidewalks downtown 
listening on large radios to reports on the quake others strolled 
in a surreal promenade in the darkness buses were jammed with 
riders but no one appeared to panic 
people sat outside dingy hotels on the stoops of apartment 
houses on curbs and thoughts turned to worrying about where to go 
for food and water 
in san franciscos haightfillmore district cracks were visible 
on some stoops and buildings some in the stucco and some 
structural many buildings in the neighborhood are victorianstyle 
homes that survived the great san francisco earthquake of 1906 
john kunze 26 of mountain view said he was on an overpass 
driving home from work when he noticed my car swaying back and 
forth and i thought i had a tire blowout it was just a scary 
eerie feeling 
then i noticed telephone polls swinging back and forth and i 
knew it was an earthquake 
at candlestick park the capacity crowd stood frozen for a 
moment but cheered when the quake passed the scoreboard and 
electricity to the park were knocked out beer cups tumbled from 
the shelves at one concession stand 
jim van sickle who lives about 60 miles east of san francisco 
said plates were knocked off his fireplace mantle by the earthquake 
asked his age van sickle said i was 52 before the 
earthquake but now im 82 
downtowns thousands of office workers were left with no major 
transportation routes to homes across the water in east bay areas 
a section of the top deck of the san franciscooakland bay 
bridge collapsed onto the lower road the subway was shut down 
large sections of the twotiered nimitz freeway collapsed onto the 
lower roadway 
cooperation and innovation sprung up amid the paralysis however 
motorists gave rides to people trying to get across town the 
owner of one office building allowed reporters to file news stories 
via a facsimile machines phone line although the machine itself 
did not work 
tempers flared occasionally at the lines for telephones at one 
a shoving match broke out between a man in line and a man on the 
phone the two were pulled apart and the people in line agreed to 
talk no more than three minutes each

president bush said tuesday night he would 
provide federal assistance to earthquake victims in california and 
a spokesman said transportation secretary samuel skinner would 
land as close as he can get to assess the damage 
the president was informed of the earthquake after addressing a 
republican governors dinner he paused outside his limousine and 
told reporters at a distance that the federal government will do 
everything it can to help 
skinner was flying overnight to california military officials 
mobilized two national guard units to aid california rescue 
efforts the federal emergency management agency fema established 
a command center at its headquarters in washington white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said they will coordinate all the 
information and dispatch of whatever support they can provide 
white house chief of staff john sununu said he had contacted the 
office of california gov george deukmejian the governor was in 
frankfort west germany and sununu authorized a us air force 
plane to fly deukmejian immediately back to california 
sununu also phoned vice president dan quayle who was visiting 
san diego the vice president was aware of the earthquake there 
was no experience of it that far south however fitzwater said 
quayle was to return to washington at about midnight said 
fitzwater he wanted to return was scheduled to return and we 
saw no reason to suggest a change of plans an hour later 
however the white house said quayle would remain overnight in 
california and confer with skinner on wednesday 
skinner was being flown aboard a special military aircraft and 
was to land as close as he can get according to fitzwater he 
said marilyn quayle was accompanying skinner and was going out to 
be part of the assessment team she has made disaster relief a 
special interest as the vice presidents wife 
several bayarea members of congress also were aboard the flight 
after calls from their home districts there is extensive 
damage said rep norman mineta people are frightened out 
there said rep don edwards 
national guard spokesman dan donohue said two california air 
national guard units were being activated 
donohue said the 129th air rescue and recovery group from 
moffett naval air station and the 146th tactical airlift wing at 
van nuys and channel island would send helicopters rescue and 
recovery aircraft and cargo planes to the san francisco area 
its a given they will get whatever disaster aid is called 
for he said 
fitzwater said sununu had talked to officials at department of 
defense and they will be prepared to help in any way they can 
coordinating again through fema 
fitzwater said fema would keep sununu informed no top officials 
planned to stay at the white house throughout the night fitzwater 
said and the president got his final briefing of the evening from 
sununu at 1045 pm 
reporters learned of the earthquake while bush was just 
beginning his address at the ballroom in the capital hilton a few 
blocks from the white house 
fitzwater described how bush was informed after he finished his 
speech we handed him the note just as he was coming off and he 
read it and just said mentioned something to barbara look at 
this it looks like a very serious problem do we know anything 
more about it 
said bush john sununu called the governors office and got 
some information there the governors out of the country but were 
beginning to get a lot of information back here and obviously the 
federal government will do everything that it possibly can to help 
but at this point were just assessing 
white house domestic adviser roger porter informed by abctv 
correspondent brit hume darted out of the room to gather 
information sununu who was also at the dinner along with skinner 
five other cabinet members and numerous other top administration 
officials also left the ballroom to try to contact the governors 
office in california

american telephone amp telegraph corp appealed 
to the nation thursday night not to try telephoning 
earthquakewracked san francisco 
the company said it blocked part of a flood of calls into the 
area so san franciscans could call out 
atampt spokesman herb linnen said 1 million attempted long 
distance calls were recorded on the atampt network at 9 pm roughly 
2 times the normal volume 
he said network managers in 12 locations applied controls to 
block calls into the san francisco area so there would be circuits 
for people to call out 
those controls were still in place late tuesday night well 
play it by ear in deciding when to remove them linnen said 
we are urging people elsewhere to not call into that area so 
we can devote more of our circuits to what were trying to do 
give priority to calls coming out of that affected area he said 
and this request will apply until further notice 
the veterans up there in bedminister nj atampts control 
center for its longdistance network tell me they have never seen 
anything like they have seen tonight in monitoring the nationwide 
network linnen said 
some callers from elsewhere in the nation could not place calls 
to countries on the pacific rim because the atampt switching center 
at sacramento calif which handles those calls was jammed with 
calls fro san francisco 
we have asked the foreign telephone administrations in pacific 
rim countries to block calls coming into the bay area in order to 
take some of the load off said linnen 
atampt handles about 70 percent of the nations longdistance 
calls

state sen gene taylor won an overwhelming 
victory over republican tom anderson in a special congressional 
election tuesday giving the democrats all five of mississippis 
us house seats for the first time in 17 years 
with all 372 precincts reporting in the race to pick a successor 
to the late us rep larkin smith taylor had 83093 votes or 65 
percent to 44430 or 35 percent for anderson a veteran 
washington aide 
the gop which holds both of mississippis us senate seats 
lost its only house seat which it had held since 1972 smith a 
republican died in a small plane crash in august 
taylor carried all but one of the 12 counties in the 5th 
district in mississippis southeastern corner which includes the 
gulf coast and the cities of biloxi gulfport and hattiesburg 
im kind of bewildered by the numbers taylor 36 said in a 
telephone interview from biloxi on tuesday night we hoped to 
win but were overwhelmed 
taylor a conservative said residents of the district can 
expect someone who is going to go to bat above all i hope they 
come to expect honest government he said he would ask to be 
sworn in next tuesday 
anderson conceded defeat around 830 pm saying he hadnt had 
enough time to build a successful campaign 
we came from nowhere we worked hard he said its been 
the longest 50 days of my life 
taylor represented bay st louis in the state senate anderson 
43 was a longtime chief of staff to us sen trent lott who held 
the seat for the republicans for 16 years before going on to the 
senate smith defeated taylor for the post last year 
the gop showed the importance they place on the seat in the 
amount of money anderson spent a campaign appearance by president 
bush and lotts visibility anderson spent about 500000 roughly 
five times taylors spending 
that district is important to us not because it has been in 
republican hands for so long said state democratic chairman ed 
cole thats one of the reasons 
but that district represents the best of what mississippi has 
to offer in that it has the strongest economy the highest per 
capita income the highest technology base and the greatest 
population growth in the last 10 years 
in the primary oct 3 taylor got 42 percent of the vote and 
anderson 37 percent attorney general mike moore a democrat got 
21 percent of the vote and was eliminated 
authorities found smith and his pilot aug 14 in wreckage of 
their singleengine plane smith a popular law enforcement 
official on the coast was returning from opening ceremonies at the 
dixie world series in hattiesburg 
tuesdays election was the seventh special congressional 
election this year of the previous six democrats won four 
republicans two 
there is an eighth such election scheduled for nov 7 in texas 
to fill the seat of the late mickey leland who also died in a 
plane crash

abcs coverage of the world series helped end 
nbcs record 68straight weeks at the top of the ac nielsen co 
ratings 
abc moved into first place for last week with its coverage of 
the first two games between the san francisco giants and the 
oakland athletics 
nbc which has dominated the ratings for the past four years 
was second last week followed by cbs 
one of the previous 68 weeks included a tie between nbc and cbs 
when that network telecast lonesome dove earlier this year 
oddly enough neither of the first two games saturday and sunday 
made the top 10 or even won the night but on saturday for 
instance the game raised abc to an average rating of 150 compared 
with its usual 70

beware of plays that include talking bears 
even if they are only part of a dream 
in beside herself which opened tuesday at offbroadways 
circle repertory company mary an aging lonely widow hears the 
voice of her longdead first love who happened to be her husbands 
brother he speaks through a furry creature that wanders into 
marys kitchen and sounds a little like james cagney with a head 
cold 
but the bear is just a fleeting vision conjured up by mary she 
has more extended visits from her past self as a young girl as a 
teenager and as a woman in her 20s you can tell they are from 
long ago because the smoke machine kicks in flooding the floor of 
marys island home with fog and the background music by jonathan 
brielle turns all tinkly 
playwright joe pintauro has written a memory play in which talk 
of the past nearly drowns the present and the audience what 
saves much of the evening is the fine acting of lois smith as mary 
and in a supporting role william hurt as a ups delivery man she 
tries to befriend 
they give a credibility to a play awash in symbolism and 
unconvincing dialogue between the woman and her other personas 
pintauro also has a fascination with wounded or dying animals a 
lot of the awkward conversation seems to return to the raccoons 
which keep getting hit on the highway next to marys house are 
they metaphorical standins for the poor woman 
theres a giddy vulnerability to smiths performance and she 
undergoes a remarkable physical transformation from dowdy old 
lady to understanding older woman between the plays two acts 
hurt returning as a member of the circle rep company for the 
first time in seven years plays against his blond good looks at 
first hes almost unrecognizable sporting long sideburns a fu 
manchu mustache and a baseball cap pulled down over his eyes and 
he affects a credible bluecollar accent that is a fine 
counterpoint to smiths more educated way of speaking 
their scenes together are warm and funny particularly when 
smith tries flirting with the younger man and he resists but not 
too hard melissa joan hart calista flockhart and susan bruce 
adequately handle the minimal demands of marys past lives while 
edward seamon makes a game effort as an older delivery man and in a 
second thankless role as that hapless bear 
set designer john lee beatty has created a charming rustic cabin 
dappled in autumn colors by lighting designer by dennis parichy 
director john bishop handles the quiet realistic moments of the 
play the best when marys other selves scamper around the stage 
he resorts to that hokey music and the smoke machine but they 
dont obliterate the quiet conversation between the older woman and 
the younger man its too bad the two of them couldnt be on stage 
all the time but those three ghosts keep getting in the way

human rights abuses in the soviet union have 
declined dramatically but people still are persecuted for their 
political and religious beliefs amnesty international said in a 
report today 
the human rights group said its list of soviet citizens in 
prison for nonviolent exercise of their human rights shrank from 
600 three years ago to about 90 in july and would have been lower 
but for further arrests 
but despite this clear trend toward reform the human rights 
picture in the ussr is deeply confusing the report said for 
example amnesty said new decrees have been issued that restrict 
political activity 
an amnesty delegation was allowed into the soviet union for the 
first time in march and found that the soviet perspective on 
human rights has shifted dramatically since 1986 the report said 
the most promising prospect for longterm reform is a major 
review of law apparently aimed at bringing soviet law into line 
with international standards it said 
for the first time the report said soviet authorities are 
freely discussing human rights issues and acknowledging them to be 
an international issue not merely a domestic matter 
the soviet union hopes to hold the helsinki conference on human 
rights in moscow in 1991 
amnesty said that of the 600 prisoners of conscience held three 
years ago 337 were released early and another 79 were freed from 
psychiatric hospitals where some had spent 15 years or more 
against their will 
most of these 416 people were prosecuted for expressing 
nonconformist opinions or for their religious activities some 
had been arrested for trying to leave the ussr it said 
they make up the largest single group of prisoners of 
conscience to have been freed since the 1950s political arrests 
have also fallen noticeably since 1986 it said 
despite the change in attitude toward human rights amnesty said 
it was concerned about what it called new moves to curb political 
activity it cited a ruling in april that effectively bans 
electioneering for radical change and another in july restricting 
rights of assembly 
a new centrally controlled police force with extensive powers 
was set up in july 1988 under a decree that gives the authorities 
unrestrained powers to ban or break up peaceful assemblies the 
report said on more than one occasion since july 1988 they have 
been used for this purpose 
the law on public gatherings is available in writing and 
decisions on applications for public meetings have to be given five 
days in advance but authorities may ban meetings as 
unconstitutional even where they pose no threat to public order 
and there is no right of appeal amnesty said 
there also had been new arrests so that when the amnesty 
delegation visited moscow it had a list of 100 detainees including 
25 conscientious objectors to military service 25 people in 
psychiatric institutions and about 30 imprisoned for nonviolent 
nationalist activity the report said 
the rest had been convicted of trying to leave the soviet union 
illegally or of criminal offenses that appeared to be false or 
politically motivated the report said 
it said 19 people whose cases were raised by the delegation were 
subsequently released including 12 armenian nationalists who are 
awaiting trial 
since the delegation came home it has learned of new arrests of 
conscientious objectors and nationalists in the moldavian republic 
and more cases of longterm psychiatric incarceration have emerged 
the report said 
also it said some of those freed were given secret pardons 
without having their convictions quashed so that they have 
difficulty getting work and housing 
on freedom of expression amnesty said it was heartened by a new 
approach to individual cases that has led to the release of 221 
people jailed for antisoviet agitation and propaganda leaving 
just two awaiting freedom it said it learned of no new 
prosecutions in 1988

san franciscos killer earthquake sent a 
televised jolt throughout the nation tuesday as the three major 
networks and cnn scrambled to send live and videotape reports from 
the scene 
for network news staffs it was controlled pandemonium at times 
cnn augmented its own coverage with video feeds from three 
stations all of whom it credited on the air the stations were 
independent ktvutv and two nbc affiliates kcratv in sacramento 
and krontv in san francisco 
because abc had planned to air the third game of the world 
series from candlestick park it had the largest staff and 
electronic gear at the scene with allsports espn which it 
coowns it aired some of the widest earliest live and taped video 
coverage of the quakes aftermath 
the abc sports blimp provided early live and taped aerial 
pictures of a oneblock fire in san francisco a shattered highway 
and the broken upper section of the bay bridge abc sports reporter 
al michaels at an abc control truck at candlestick park helped 
describe the scenes 
at one point espn which was to cover the world series game but 
wasnt broadcasting it when the tremor struck showed a live 
quaking picture of the field at candlestick park as an aftershock 
hit 
espn reporter bob ley describing his initial move to leave the 
park after the quake reported that san francisco giants manager 
roger craig was right behind me it was scary 
although allnews cnn got the first jump on the story for cable 
viewers abcs michaels had been on the air when the quake hit 
doing a pregame report at candlestick park 
the abc picture turned to static a still slide for the world 
series appeared then abc cut to the series roseanne then at 
810 pm edt an offscreen announcer said there had been a 
major quake in the san francisco area 
cbs anchor dan rather in a flash booth for bulletins in new 
york began his first report lasting one minute at 821 pm he 
was followed two minutes later by abcs washingtonbased 
nightline anchor ted koppel 
nbcs man at the quake scene bob jamieson wound up trapped in 
san francisco traffic after leaving candlestick park he had to 
report by cellular telephone from his car 
two of the networks cbs and abc signed off coverage after 
1230 am edt with cbs the first to go returning to the pat 
sajak show abcs koppel signed off at 1240 am edt 
however rather returned with a startling update shortly after 
that reporting that as many as 200 persons were killed in the 
quake 
although nbcs continuous coverage went past 1 am edt 
wednesday it was was the slowest off the mark earlier a staff 
member said its coverage started at 840 pm edt tuesday with a 
bulletin by burbankbased correspondent keith morrison 
eight minutes later mary alice williams anchored for nbc from 
new york but without the pictures that abc and cnn already were 
airing she said that nbcs tv signal from san francisco had been 
temporarily knocked out by the quake 
shortly after 9 pm anchor tom brokaw succeeded her with nbc 
airing its first live shots from san francisco 
all three networks relied on live and taped video pictures and 
interviews from their san francisco affiliates kgotv for abc 
kpixtv for cbs and krontv for nbc with abc having more of its 
own coverage on the air 
during its coverage abc illustrated with tape footage what it 
said was the gallows humor of some fans at candlestick park it 
showed several persons holding a paper banner that said the 
sleeping giants have awakened 
several times during the night nbc and cnn simultaneously aired 
the same videotape footage that kron nbcs affiliate had made of 
the fire and quake damage from a helicopter and on the ground cnn 
gave an onair visual credit to the station each time 
rather said in an interview late tuesday that he was at the cbs 
broadcast center here when first word of the quake came in 
our initial thought washow big is it he said then it 
was lets go lets go on the air at least with a bulletin i 
remember thinking i hope its not the big one

new national park service director james 
ridenour faces his first big test among environmentalists as he 
ponders whether to allow about 20000 truckloads of timber to go to 
mill through yellowstone park 
if he does the wrong thing hell see us in court said 
steve whitney of the wilderness society 
federal law prohibits commercial operations in the parks except 
in emergencies whitney said 
national parks spokesman george berklacy said interior 
department lawyers are reviewing the matter yellowstone park 
superintendent robert barbee is due in washington on thursday to 
discuss the problem with ridenour 
the timber in national forests bordering yellowstone amounts 
to about 40 million board feet from trees that were partially 
burned when fire blazed out of control in the park last year 
anxious to get rid of the wood to speed new tree growth the 
us forest service sold the timber to brands lumber co in 
livingston mont for about 1 per 1000 board feet 
brands the closest lumber mill to the burned forests is about 
100 miles away if you drive through yellowstone 
we could go around the park but it would cost more money 
said doug crandall brands manager 
its about 75 miles farther to drive around the park crandall 
said adding that that route is a more difficult pass through the 
mountains and is not cleared during the winter 
hoping for approval soon from the national parks brands is 
cutting down trees and piling up timber 
we have about half a million board feet cut said crandall 
leaving a dead tree standing diminishes its value because of 
deterioration he said 
i know the wilderness society is concerned about a bad 
precedent but these circumstances are unusual and abnormal a 
once in a lifetime occurrence crandall said 
crandall said his company has promised to repair any damage 
caused by the trucks but that doesnt satisfy the wilderness 
society 
we will challenge any effort to haul through the national 
parks said michael scott northern rockies regional director for 
the society 
the trucks would go through an important grizzly bear habitat 
he said adding that the potential damage to the bears and other 
wildlife could not be repaired with dollars 
a park is supposed to be a place apart from the normal 
commerce of the world said scott it is not designed to be a 
throughway from commercial operations 
berklacy said ridenour will rely heavily on barbees 
recommendation which a spokeswoman at yellowstone said has not yet 
been made barbee was not available for comment 
if he ridenour errs he will err on the side of environmental 
concerns said berklacy at this point there is some question 
about legality he has questions about impacts on the roads and 
visitor activity and the wildlife 
both whitney and his assistant at the wilderness society brian 
culhane say a new breeze is blowing at interior since the 
reagan administration appointees left office but they are 
withholding judgment on ridenour to see whether his actions match 
his words 
the rhetoric is good said culhane citing a recent ridenour 
speech in which the director told park officials to more actively 
protect the parks against external threats 
culhane said ridenours decision on hauling timber in 
yellowstone will be the first major test 
were talking about the worlds first national park he 
said if we dont start with yellowstone where are we going to

most folks buying tickets for a shot at a 
40 million lottery daydream about mansions and yachts but nine 
holyoke residents have a different hope ending their school 
districts financial crisis 
the nine members of the citys school committee anted up 1 each 
to play this weeks mass millions game 
we thought it was an excellent idea member bill collamore 
said tuesday it got a lot of people worked up and were very 
happy 
the idea surfaced at monday nights school committee meeting a 
member who works for the massachusetts lottery commission and 
therefore cannot play it suggested that the board buy a few 
tickets and then have them notarized so that winnings would go to 
holyoke schools 
members immediately started digging into their pockets to come 
up with the money for the 1 tickets 
odds against winning are more than 9 million to one but 
collamore said holyoke schools need any help they can get 
you know the city of holyoke is in dire straits for money our 
school system is in really bad shape he said 
because of state budget cuts the school department had to trim 
10 million from its budget request this year getting 29 million 
that meant laying off 107 people and cutting some programs such as 
music collamore said 
the school committee joins millions of people hoping for the big 
prize last week the lottery commission did 115 million in 
sales spokesman dave ellis said tuesday there was no winner 
friday and sales are expected to be about 15 million this week 
if the school committee should win in fridays drawing the 
expected jackpot would be 1 million more than the original budget 
request collamore noted 
he said he does not think that committee members would have any 
problems seeing the fortune go to school coffers 
we would be very very happy to have this money and to help out 
the students collamore said

would be terrific as surgeon general 
novello apparently has satisfied the white house that her views 
on abortion are acceptable to the president bush says he opposes 
abortion except in cases of rape incest and danger to the mothers 
life 
chase untermeyer bushs personnel chief said tuesday that the 
white house has been asking candidates recommended for jobs where 
abortion is an issue about their views on the subject those 
questions were asked of candidates for surgeon general he said 
but he would not comment on novello and refused to confirm or deny 
that she is bushs choice 
the presidents position on abortion and that of the 
republican party is well known and the american people knew that 
when he was a candidate untermeyer said 
therefore it is entirely appropriate for people being 
considered for appointments at hhs to be asked if they hold the 
same views as those of the president of the united states who 
would appoint them he said 
lee said tuesday he would like to be surgeon general but was out 
of the running because he disagrees with the president on abortion 
i would love the job lee said adding i think its 
wrong to require a litmus test on the abortion issue 
koop who during his seven years used the surgeon generals post 
as a pulpit to preach healthy living to the country is strongly 
opposed to abortion and was a darling of conservatives when he was 
nominated 
however he alienated many of those early supporters with a 
report on aids advocating use of condoms and sex education at 
young ages and he incurred their wrath again earlier this year 
when he refused to issue a report requested by thenpresident 
reagan on whether women suffer psychological harm from abortion he 
said there was insufficient scientific evidence to reach the 
conclusion the white house wanted 
antiabortion groups have been closely following progress on 
filling the surgeon generals post to make sure the person bush 
chooses holds his views on abortion

federal subsidies that keep commuter airlines 
flying into 21 small towns from temple texas to benton harbor 
mich are on the verge of elimination a casualty of budgetary 
warfare 
if we lose the subsidy mansfield loses air service said 
ralph baker vice president of gcs air services which has shuttled 
passengers from mansfield ohio to cleveland since february 1988 
the company has lost money on the route despite the federal 
assistance baker said 
this is going to be a drastic blow to us said john 
chaddock manager of twin cities airport which serves benton 
harbor and st joseph mich 
a housesenate conference committee voted this week to spend 
307 million for the essential air service program which 
subsidizes air carriers that serve small communities 
the senate had sought the 355 million needed to preserve 
funding for all 110 communities now being helped the house called 
for only 124 million while the bush administration proposed 
phasing out the program starting with a 55 million cut 
the 307 million figure is close to last years 316 million 
total but the lawmakers adopted new criteria that will squeeze out 
21 towns that currently qualify 
under the agreement towns would not be eligible if the average 
subsidy exceeds 200 per passenger current rules deny aid to 
communities with average subsidies exceeding 300 per passenger 
communities also would not qualify if they are closer than 70 
miles to the nearest large or medium hub airport within 55 miles 
of a small hub or 45 miles of a qualifying nonhub which 
averages at least 100 passenger boardings a day the restrictions 
do not apply to alaska or hawaii 
the program is included in the 119 billion transportation 
spending bill for fiscal 1990 which began oct 1 the compromise 
bill must be approved by the house and senate and signed by 
president bush 
congressional attitudes about the program perennially split 
along geographic lines pitting lawmakers from urban areas against 
those from sparsely populated and large states senate 
appropriations committee chairman robert byrd dwva is a vocal 
supporter of the program 
backers say the program helps small communities attract and 
maintain industry through their link with larger airports 
opponents say the deficitstrapped federal treasury cannot afford 
the subsidies which sometimes reach 400 per passenger 
a loss of federal funds does not necessarily mean the end of 
commuter service to affected airlines but unless state or local 
governments or other sources take up the slack the future of air 
service at the 21 towns will depend on whether the airlines find it 
worthwhile to continue 
philip trenary whose small airline provides subsidized service 
to temple texas said he will not abandon the central texas town 
and will try to keep providing service to dallasforth worth 
international airport until the route turns a profit 
im going to let the community know were not bailing out 
were going to find a way to stay there said trenary he said he 
would ask temple to join his airline exec express ii in a 
promotional campaign 
rep marvin leath dtexas whose district includes temple said 
his constituents are suffering from the governments lack of fiscal 
discipline 
our failure to deal with the deficit will cause many worthy 
programs to be cut or eliminated leath said 
but rep donald pease dohio who represents mansfield said it 
was difficult to complain about cutting subsidies to some 
communities fewer than five passengers a day take the 
mansfieldtocleveland flight according to the transportation 
department the subsidy is 170 per passenger 
i got discouraged from doing too much when i saw how big the 
subsidy was pease said

the earth shook and the sky burned just as 
in 1906 if tuesdays earthquake wasnt the big one it was 
close enough to send tremors of fear through natives used to the 
unsteady underpinnings of their city 
my first thought was it was the big one said gerald 
volkman who was drinking a milkshake at a groundfloor eatery when 
the quake struck 
the whole floor shook i was born and raised here and i never 
felt one like this i was scared 
the big one is the quake san franciscans have been told is 
just around the corner after every temblor of appreciable size 
newspapers radio and tv roll out stories about how the area could 
be devastated by a great quake and how to prepare for it 
every april on the anniversary of the 1906 quake and fire that 
killed at least 500 people here reporters interview survivors who 
recall that day when the earth heaved and the sky glowed with the 
flames of a city alight 
on tuesday smoke from a fire in the marina district near the 
bay rose high into the sky creating a backdrop to city hall miles 
away 
chuck gee also a native san franciscan thought he saw smoke 
from a fire as he jumped under a desk in his secondfloor office 
it was dust from masonry that fell into the street outside 
he said as he stood in front of a market street building whose 
broken sprinkler system sprayed water onto the busy thoroughfare 
im used to earthquakes ive even slept through some 
sometimes youre not sure if they are quakes and your first 
reaction is it might be a passing truck not this one i knew right 
away powerful thats what it was powerful 
gee spoke shortly after darkness set in only the lights of cars 
and other vehicles and the flashlights of a few pedestrians 
provided any light on market street 
people stood in clusters recalling their experiences their 
voices mingled with the sounds of pedestrians feet crushing 
splinters of glass the remains of windows that crashed to the 
pavement 
old buildings seemed to lose the most windows glass littered 
the front and sides of the old furniture mart on market street 
across the street the newer fox plaza apparently lost no windows 
further down market the san franciscan hotel lost some ornate 
facade fixtures 
one of the first rules of quake survival is to get in the clear 
and away from possible falling objects a lesson not lost on many 
who gathered in parking lots and in front of city hall 
another one might happen said roland hidalgo who stood in 
a parking lot off market he was asked what he did when the quake 
struck 
im religious he said i prayed 
down at powell and market people gathered around a 
batteryoperated radio to hear the latest news cable cars stood 
idle nearby 
sonia avitia of san jose asked for directions to a hotel she 
was told theyre all up and down powell street 
i want a new one she said i want an earthquakeproof 
one 
dora cortez said she wasnt too frightened during the quake 
cortez hands out religious tracts on market and she was very 
busy 
we are in the last days and things like earthquakes will 
happen she said 
people often ignore her and refuse to take the tracts 
not today yes yes she said

a constitutional amendment to ban flagburning 
is moving toward a vote in the senate minus two original sponsors 
who bailed out saying they do not want to tamper with the bill of 
rights 
it was a mistake of the heart but nonetheless it was a 
mistake sen john c danforth rmo told the senate on tuesday 
as he withdrew as one of 53 cosponsors of the proposed 
constitutional amendment 
sen warren rudman rnh another cosponsor also took to the 
senate floor to abandon his support 
and democratic critics said for the first time the measure was 
likely to be defeated in a floor vote set for thursday morning 
i hope and expect that there will not be sufficient votes for 
the amendment to prevail senate majority leader george mitchell 
dmaine told reporters 
the measure would authorize the federal and state governments to 
ban burning the american flag 
the house approved and sent to president bush on thursday a bill 
that would ban burning and other desecration of the american flag 
by simple statute he said he would allow it to become law without 
his signature while continuing to press for a constitutional 
amendment 
supporters of a constitutional amendment say any statute is 
likely to be overturned in court on grounds that it violates free 
speech guaranteed under the bill of rights 
the campaign for a constitutional amendment began in june after 
the supreme court threw out the conviction of texas flagburner 
gregory lee johnson on grounds that his right to free speech had 
been violated 
critics of the amendment say a content neutral law that 
outlaws flagburning regardless of whether it involves political 
protest is better than tampering with constitutional freedoms 
if the measure is approved by the senate it goes to the house 
and then to state legislatures a proposed constitutional amendment 
must be approved by 38 legislatures before becoming part of the 
constitution 
danforth said that if the senate did approve the measure it most 
likely would eventually be ratified adding if it is going to be 
stopped it must be stopped in the senate 
this is not a throwaway vote danforth said this is not 
just the kind of vote you cast thinking well this is nothing 
somebody else can act as the safety net 
we are the decisionmakers he said we will be 
responsible if the constitution will be amended and if it is 
amended it will be the first time in the history of our country 
that we have altered the bill of rights 
a backer of the amendment sen orrin hatch rutah scoffed at 
the notion that the senate would be unduly tampering with freedom 
of speech if it passed the measure 
this freedom has never been deemed absolute hatch said 
obscenity has never been protected under the first amendment 
he said other restrictions also exist such as libel laws 
hatch said the measure does not prevent a single idea or 
thought from being expressed it merely prevents conduct with 
respect to one object and one object only and thats our flag we 
can withdraw that object from desecration without limiting freedom 
of speech 
i believe it is futile to try to overturn this particular 
supreme court interpretation of the constitution by a statute 
hatch said 
sen alan cranston dcalif said however that the measure 
would put new powers in the hands of government and it contains 
no limits no checks on the exercise of that power

president bush is expected to quickly sign 
legislation providing 9 million to the nicaraguan political 
oppositions campaign to wrest power from the sandinista government 
in februarys national elections 
the senate approved the package 64 to 35 late tuesday after 
soundly defeating a series of attempts to cut or restrict the 
money the house had approved it oct 4 on a vote of 263156 
bush is expected to sign the measure soon so that aid can begin 
to flow this month the only month when voter registration is 
conducted for the feb 25 1990 balloting 
the opposition coalition known as uno needs our assistance 
desperately bush wrote in a lastminute letter to the senate 
urging support for the package only by receiving help can it 
make a real contest of this election he wrote 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater called the upcoming 
elections the last crucial shot at getting representative 
democracy in nicaragua 
agreement on the package represented a political truce of sorts 
on what has been the most divisive foreign policy issue to confront 
congress this decade 
since president reagan helped create the contra rebels eight 
years ago to oust the leftist managua government the united states 
has spent some 350 million to apply military pressure with each 
increment of aid heatedly fought in congress congressional 
restrictions on contra aid played a large role in reagans greatest 
scandal the irancontra affair 
in his letter to lawmakers bush acknowledged administration 
discomfort with a nicaraguan law that could send as much as 2 
million directly to the sandinistacontrolled supreme electoral 
council but he added we should not let this displeasure be 
used as a transparent attempt to prevent the united states from 
helping its democratic friends 
the package would send 9 million through the national endowment 
for democracy a quasigovernmental agency that promotes democratic 
elections around the world to pay for ostensibly nonpartisan 
activities like voter registration election monitoring and party 
building 
while neds charter forbids direct partisan campaign support 
the bush administration believes that money spent to promote the 
democratic process will work to the advantage of opposition 
presidential candidate violeta chamorro publisher of the 
opposition newspaper la prensa 
the opposition coalition includes 14 parties spanning the 
spectrum from conservative to socialist and communist party 
officials complain they lack even basic office supplies while the 
ruling sandinistas have all the resources of the government 
including staterun media at their disposal 
while the legislation was vague on how the money will be used 
it appeared that up to 6 million could go directly to the uno 
opposition group and as much as 2 million to the 
governmentcontrolled electoral council nicaraguan law levies a 50 
percent tax on foreign political contributions for certain purposes 
the endowment has been involved in elections in the philippines 
chile and poland among others but critics both liberals and 
conservatives point out that the administrations planned 
spending in nicaragua far exceeds anything the endowment has used 
in other countries congress already had given it 35 million in 
the last year to aid the election process there 
rather than ensuring free and fair elections this package 
could well undermine them said sen tom harkin diowa do we 
really want mrs chamorro to be known as the best candidate the 
united states can buy 
harkin and others also attacked the vagueness of the spending 
request while just over 1 million of the money would go to three 
independent election monitoring groups including one led by former 
president carter the rest of the money is less specifically 
described 
the endowment could conduct getoutthevote activities pay 
costs of voter registration campaigns civic education about 
elections and spend money to build party infrastructures 
the measure would authorize no new money but would instead 
transfer the funds to the endowment from unspent balances in other 
accounts as a condition of the aid the administration gave 
congress private assurances it would not seek to covertly influence 
the election

a businessman trying to become the first blind 
person in the us foreign service says he wants to become a true 
diplomat and not be swept into a sheltered corner reserved for the 
handicapped 
any attempt to categorize blind people means separation and 
separation is a denial of equality 47yearold avraham rabby 
told a joint meeting of house foreign affairs and civil service 
subcommittees on tuesday 
the oxfordeducated rabby is near his goal of joining the 
foreign service after a 15year effort following the state 
departments announcement last week that it would no longer bar 
candidates just because of their blindness 
rabby who lives in new york city said he hopes he and blind 
diplomats who may follow him will have their handicap considered 
as merely one characteristic in a normal individual who like any 
sighted foreign service officer brings to the service a wide 
variety of strengths and weaknesses 
blind people are as different from one another as sighted 
people rabby said there is no such thing as a category 
labled the blind 
he objected to what he called the state departments past 
assumption that if one is blind one is necessarily slow 
inattentive to ones environment and hopelessly vulnerable to any 
international terrorist who may be intent on doing harm 
describing his long battle to become a member of the foreign 
service rabby noted his honors degree from oxford university in 
spanish and french his masters degree in business administration 
from the university of chicago and his success leading a business 
aimed at helping the handicapped begin careers 
although he passed the foreign service entrance examination 
several times rabby said his candidacy was always rejected because 
of his blindness with officials offering one explanation after 
another of why that was a disqualification 
but last week the state department announced it was reversing 
its policy 
rabby in what he called that welcome telephone call was 
told he could meet with department officials to discuss the terms 
and conditions of his employment as a diplomat 
its historic and its one of those occasions when you can be 
joyful said rep gerry sikorski dminn who fought for rabbys 
appointment 
ambassador edward j perkins the new director general of the 
foreign service told the panel the agency had decided it could 
make accomodations for blind people just as we do for sighted 
people based on what they can accomplish 
sikorski and other panel members advised rabby not to settle for 
an inferior foreign service post 
some said they would not object if he were named as an 
ambassador

the countrys judges went on strike to 
protest a colleagues assassination and gunmen killed yet another 
journalist the eighth news industry worker slain since the 
government launched its allout war on cocaine barons 
an anonymous caller claiming to speak for drug traffickers took 
responsibility for tuesdays killing of hector jimenez rodriguez a 
federal appeals court judge in the cocaine trafficking center of 
medellin 
hours later in medellin assassins gunned down radio journalist 
diego vargas escobar in similar fashion police said 
the slaying of jimenez 55 sparked a threeday strike by about 
17000 judicial workers including most of colombias judges to 
demand more protection from drug gangs 
traffickers seek through murder bombings and threats to force 
an end to the governments crackdown on colombias cocaine cartels 
which was launched after the aug 18 slaying of presidential 
candidate luis carlos galan an antidrug crusader 
vargas escobar 54 was the eighth news industry worker slain 
since the crackdown began a radio journalist said vargas escobar 
who worked for the medellin station la voz de las americas had 
recently received death threats 
the journalist who did not want to be identified for security 
reasons said he did not know who made the threats 
in anonymous calls to radio stations last week the 
extraditables alleged traffickers wanted in the united states 
claimed responsiblity for the slayings of two journalists in 
medellin 
police said jimenez was about to step into the car of a 
colleague outside his home when two men pulled up on a motorcycle 
and one strolled over and shot the judge six times 
an anonymous caller told a radio station in medellin that the 
extraditables killed him in retaliation for the extradition of 
colombian drug suspects to the united states 
colombia has extradited four suspects since president virgilio 
barco initiated the crackdown and the extraditables have promised 
that they would kill 10 judges for every drug dealer extradited 
none of the 12 alleged top colombian drug bosses wanted by the 
united states have been captured but the government has seized 
millions of dollars in their alleged assets 
jimenez was a federal appeals court judge for 20 years in 
medellin all federal judges in the city have handled drug matters 
but it was not known whether jimenez had any cases recently 
the court workers union declared a 72hour strike to demand 
more protection for the judicial branch 
various figures are given on the number of judges slain in 
colombia the court workers union says 221 court employees 
including 42 judges have been killed during the past 12 years 
many of them by drug traffickers 
union officials said colombias 4600 judges are still waiting 
to receive bulletproof vests as part of a 19 million us aid 
program to protect them 
the justice ministry told us some time ago that it had 
received just 15 bulletproof vests and would distribute them 
soon said yolanda parra an administrator at the court workers 
union but judges have still not gotten anything 
the unions president antonio suarez met late tuesday with the 
countrys justice minister roberto salazar manrique to repeat 
judges demands for more government protection 
ms parra said judicial officials had sent numerous messages 
expressing their security concerns but had received no response 
from the ministry 
part of the problem has been the instablity at the ministry 
she said referring to the recent resignation of monica de greiff 
who became justice minister july 16 and quit 70 days later 
former communications minister carlos lemos simmonds took on the 
duties of justice minister until oct 8 when roberto salazar 
manrique was named to the post

state officials are eager to get grants for 
toughening their highway safety laws but say congress would be 
going too far if they were penalized for not falling into line 
the officials objected in senate testimony tuesday to a 
provision in a proposed law that would withhold up to 10 percent of 
a states federal highway funds unless it required the use of seat 
belts in automobiles and helmets on motorcycles 
the law introduced by sen john r chafee rri also would 
provide grants to help states implement and enforce their programs 
thirtyfour states and the district of columbia have mandatory 
seat belt laws fortyseven states have some motorcycle helmet 
laws but only 22 states and the district of columbia require them 
for all riders over 21 
the proposed law also covers child restraint devices although 
all 50 states have laws on the books 
any federal legislation should seek to encourage efforts to 
find just the right mix of requirements and incentives to result in 
increased safety virginia state senator charles waddell told the 
senate environment and public works subcommittee on water 
resources transportation and infrastructure 
adding to the list of ways in which a state can jeopardize 
funding for transportation including safety only limits the 
states ability to find the most effective combination of laws 
regulations and educational efforts to encourage driver and 
passenger safety said waddell speaking for the national 
conference of state legislatures 
we believe that sanctions would be counterproductive said 
paul jones of the national association of governors highway safety 
representatives 
the group says it supports the incentive grant portion of the 
proposed law to finance training and enforcement community 
education and information worksite and other programs 
but the sanctions have no appeal 
withholding a states highway construction funds could 
exacerbate highway safety problems by preventing a state from 
rehabilitating deteriorating pavement adding capacity or making 
other engineering improvements which would improve the safety of 
the highways the group said in prepared testimony 
chafee said nearly 50000 people are killed on the highways each 
year the national highway traffic safety administration estimates 
20000 lives have been saved over the last five years because of 
motorcycle helmets and automobile safety belts 
public health groups physicians and the insurance industry 
support chafees proposal motorcycle rider groups are among the 
opponents

former president reagan says he wonders now 
whether the irancontra affair that rocked his second term in the 
white house wasnt a setup a sting operation by the iranians 
reagans latest comment on the most controversial foreign policy 
initiative of his eight years in office comes in a new book 
speaking my mind published by simon and schuster 
the book is a collection of speeches each preceded by a short 
essay containing reagans reflection on the subject or the occasion 
one of the speeches is his march 4 1987 address after the 
release of the tower commission report on his administrations 
decision to sell arms to iran while seeking iranian help for the 
release of american hostages 
the commission appointed by reagan to look into the 
controversy said his decision to sell arms to iran rewarded a 
regime that clearly supported terrorism and hostagetaking 
reagan in his speech took responsibility for things that had 
happened on my watch but also said he didnt ask enough 
about the specifics of the total iran plan 
he has since said there are many aspects of the affair he still 
does not understand 
in his new remarks the former president defended the initiative 
although he said that something clearly went wrong with our 
original plan 
im going to cover this more completely in my memoirs he 
wrote but i get beside myself when i think that people believe i 
would actually trade arms for hostages 
i did not see it as trading arms for hostages because we were 
dealing with iranian intermediaries not the kidnappers 
themselves said reagan i know it may be a fine line to most 
people but its what i believed then and what i still believe 
i have to say that in looking back i wonder if this whole 
thing wasnt a setup a sting operation by the iranians said 
the former president maybe we were conned into believing these 
were moderate iranians seeking to reach out to the west while in 
reality they were working directly for the ayatollah just to get 
some arms who knows 
the episode became known as the irancontra affair because some 
of the sale proceeds were diverted to the contra rebels in 
nicaragua whose fight against the countrys leftist regime was 
strongly backed by reagan 
elsewhere in his book reagan writes that nicaraguas sandinista 
government completely bamboozled many on capitol hill and adds 
i also honestly believe that the sandinistas hoodwinked many in 
the american press 
on another subject reagan says that even his wife nancy was 
against his going ahead with a planned visit to a cemetery at 
bitburg west germany despite the controversy that arose because 
48 nazi storm troopers were buried there he says he decided to go 
anyway because i didnt feel that we could ask new generations of 
germans to live with this guilt forever without any hope of 
redemption 
in the prologue to the march 8 1983 speech in which reagan 
denounced the soviet union as an evil empire he writes that 
the characterization was apt at the time but i could not in good 
conscience today call the soviet union an evil empire 
of his speech before departing for his first meeting with soviet 
leader mikhail gorbachev in geneva in 1985 he says i did not 
know when i left for that meeting in geneva i would eventually 
call mikhail gorbachev a friend

take a look at the potatoes in france if you 
want to learn something about the local lifestyle 
four years ago it was usual to see sacks of unwashed potatoes 
on supermarket shelves but such presentation is no longer 
acceptable says an agriculture department report 
today is is usual for raw potatoes sacked or loose to be 
washed before they are presented to shoppers the report said and 
many french food buyers are opting for frozen precooked potatoes 
the departments foreign agricultural service said the 
comingofage of frances baby boomers along with fewer 
adolescents and a rapid increase in senior citizens has meant a 
rise in demand for more conveniently packaged or prepared foods 
over twofifths of french women are now in the workforce 
the report said they want foods that require less preparation 
time stimulating a rise of readytoeat and microwaveable foods 
a similar trend developed in the united states in the 1970s and 
1980s the agency said in a forthcoming issue of agexporter 
magazine the study of french grocery habits was undertaken to help 
give us exporters a better understanding of the changing french 
market 
the increasing number of senior citizens also is creating a 
market for products and packaging adapted to the special needs of 
older consumers the report said 
and the leisurely french lunch is fading into memory as the 
typical french work week is becoming shorter the midday meal is 
more hurried increasing the demand for meals at fastfood 
restaurants and cafeterias 
more and more french consumers prefer to make a weekly trip to 
the supermarket rather than frequent and timeconsuming trips to 
butchers bakers produce markets and other small specialty 
shops the report said 
the preference for supermarket or hypermarket shopping is 
especially evident among singleperson and twoincome households 
where time for shopping is limited 
another result of the changes has been the domination of big 
supermarkets in the french retail grocery industry they accounted 
for 46 percent of grocery purchases in 1987 compared with 37 
percent in 1983 the report said 
this year for the first time french shoppers are estimated to 
buy more than 50 percent of their food in the big hypermarkets

brick walls and stairwells collapsed and 
cheers for the home team turned to horror as thousands of oakland 
residents struggled through the killer earthquake that rocked the 
bay area 
as workers frantically tried to reach victims trapped in their 
vehicles between two concrete slabs on interstate 880 dr carter 
clements assistant chief of the emergency department at oaklands 
highland hospital prepared for the worst 
i expect a lot of people unfortunately are going to die at the 
scene of their injuries because of the difficulty of getting them 
out clements said 
you cant drop that much concrete on a car and get out of it 
im afraid a lot of people will be dead 
at least 200 people were killed in their cars when a milelong 
section of the upper level of interstate 880 collapsed onto the 
lower level said marty boyer the alameda county public 
information officer county sheriff charles plummer confirmed the 
death toll of 200 people 
clements said that more injuries were likely as the hours passed 
my guess is that were going to see over the next 12 to 24 
hours injuries related to the quake but not severe injuries he 
said 
at jack london square a crowd gathered to watch the world 
series game between the as and san francisco giants on a giant 
television screen at first the fans thought the quake was not 
severe and even applauded but when the screen flashed to a 
collapsed bay bridge there was horrified silence 
they tell you this is going to happen but i never believed 
it one shaken fan told the tribune of oakland 
caroline thomas was at work in a brick building at 13th street 
and broadway when the earthquake struck when the shaking stopped 
she ran for the stairwell 
it wasnt there 
my god it collapsed just like that she said after a 
terrifying walk down an eightstory fire department ladder 
just a few doors away anita williams stood shaking clutching 
her chest and trying to regain control 
the buildings swayed the walls jerked and cracked she 
said adding that she ran from her building and discovered part of 
its facade littering the street with rubble 
as a bart train jerked on its track robert steller thought 
this is what it feels like to die 
in oaklands chinatown people gathered on the sidewalks 
comparing notes in rapidfire cantonese 
and throughout the city neighbors and shop owners opened their 
homes to strangers allowing them to make frantic calls home 
on streets littered with glass and plaster people lined up 10 
deep at pay phones to say they were ok some of the citys grandest 
old buildings showed the effects of the quake their windows

ivory is falling out of favor in america in an 
effort to keep the elephant from falling into extinction 
leaders in the fashion industry say many stores have stopped 
selling and many customers stopped buying jewelry made of ivory 
one trade paper says women soon may be wearing jewelry made of cow 
bones instead 
i talk to jewelers every day from main street to fifth 
avenue and they all express abhorrence at selling ivory today 
says david federman gemstone writer for modern jeweler magazine 
if theyre doing it theyre selling it under the counter 
so thoroughly has the ivory boycott caught on that some see in 
it the seeds of an environmental ethic in high fashion 
there seems to be a very strong trend among americans to think 
first of wildlife of compassion and not our own vanity says 
reenie brown publisher of the trade magazine accessories its 
becoming unfashionable to wear furs too she says 
ms brown has banned ivory from a trade show she runs and from 
the pages of her magazines ive lost some ads she says 
environmentalists say the ivory story is comparable to what 
happened a decade ago when people became aware of the threat that 
the spotted cats jaguars cheetahs and leopards could become 
extinct 
coats made of those furs virtually disappeared from the market 
under the pressure of an outcry for endangered species 
ivory industry faces extinction colored stone another 
trade journal says in its current issue 
many dealers are switching to ivory substitutes the 
publication says treated cow bone seems to be the current 
favorite 
environmentalist brian day of the world wildlife fund says the 
price of ivory at places that still sell it has dropped by 50 
percent as dealers seek to unload their stocks 
steinway amp sons wrote this summer to 800 steinway artists 
ranging from vladimir horowitz and van cliburn to billy taylor and 
peter nero that the company would stop producing ivorykeyed 
pianos for concert tours and switch to plastic it made that switch 
years ago for ordinary pianos 
without exception all were appreciative of the environmental 
concern said spokesman leo spellman 
the ivory boycott took off this summer after president bush 
signed an order prohibiting the import of african ivory canada 
western europe and japan followed suit 
the united states had accounted for 12 percent of world ivory 
imports japan and hong kong were the heaviest importers 
bushs action set the stage for the vote this week by an 
international conference to classify the elephant as an endangered 
species and ban all trade in elephant products 
five african nations balked saying they would continue selling 
tusks but the ban is still likely to undercut the market for 
elephant poachers who hunt with automatic rifles 
about 70000 elephants are killed each year according to 
william conway general director of the new york zoological 
society he said the african elephant population has fallen from 
15 million 10 years ago to 625000 
last week major retailers pledged not to sell ivory and and 
clothing designers said they would not use it in a campaign 
organized by designer liz claiborne 
taking the pledge were such stores as macys lord amp taylor 
nordstrom marshall fields and the federated allied and carter 
hawley hale chains and designers oscar de la renta dana buchman 
linda allard and bill blass 
we believe that ivory must be kept out of fashion and in the 
possession of the magnificent creatures for whom it was originally 
designed those firms said why should a baby elephant be 
orphaned for a few bangles and beads

making television sets that can decode closed 
captions for the hearing impaired would also benefit millions of 
other americans who need help with language and reading skills 
supporters say 
the captions can currently be seen only on televisions hooked up 
to a separate electronic decoder that costs about 180 limiting 
their availability 
but the national captioning institute on tuesday announced a 1 
million project to spur development of tvs with builtin decoders 
saying it would bring closedcaptioned programming to millions more 
americans with and without hearing problems 
tv sets with the decoder chip builtin will be attractive to 
people who find captioned television helpful in learning english 
said nci chairman warren h simmons jr were speaking of 
immigrants learning english as a second language as well as 
children who have reading problems 
the builtin decoder initially would add only about 20 to the 
cost of a television with costs eventually becoming negligible 
the institute predicted 
by the mid 90s we hope virtually all tv sets at least color 
tv midtolarge screen size models will be available with 
captioning as a welcomed new feature simmons said 
the institute a nonprofit corporation set up to provide 
closedcaptioned television service awarded itt corp a 1 million 
contract to design develop and produce the tiny decoder chip that 
could be built into new tvs vcrs and cable converters 
the grant was announced at gallaudet university the only 
accredited liberal arts college for the hearing impaired gallaudet 
president i king jordan said captioning expands the world for 
our deaf students its also valuable for many others such as the 
elderly experiencing hearing loss and those recently arrived in 
america and learning english 
i look forward to the day when captioning can be taken for 
granted as a right for all americans jordan said 
nci president john ball estimated the decoder chips could be 
available to tv manufacturers by late 1990 and that televisions 
equipped with the devices could be on the market by late 1991 or 
1992 
sharad rastogi director of marketing for itts semiconductor 
division said tv manufacturers see the builtin decoders as a 
attractive lowcost marketing feature and are anxious to 
incorporate the new technology 
closed captioning converts the audio portions of a television 
program into written words which are displayed on the television 
screen similar to the subtitles that appear on foreignlanguage 
films the captions can be switched on and off at the viewers 
option 
nearly 300 hours of closedcaptioned programming are available 
weekly on major networks and through cable services many 
videotapes also are captioned 
the national captioning institute said it plans to manufacture 
separate closedcaptioned decoders through the end of the century 
ball estimated about 250000 decoders are now in use he said the 
disadvantages of the separate decoder are its price and the 
complexity of hooking up another device to the tv in addition to 
vcrs and cable converters

federal bank regulators are investigating the 
legality of large political contributions from a phoenix 
millionaire to five senators who intervened on behalf of his failed 
savings and loan association 
we will be looking at every piece of evidence we can find to 
determine whether or not laws were violated with respect to 
political contributions by charles h keating federal deposit 
insurance corp chairman l william seidman said tuesday in sworn 
testimony before the house banking committee 
keating chairman of american continental corp the parent 
company of lincoln savings and loan association of irvine calif 
gave money to the campaigns of sens alan cranston dcalif 
dennis deconcini dariz john mccain rariz john glenn 
dohio and donald w riegle jr dmich 
in april 1987 the five met with regulators on keatings behalf 
deconcini and riegle have since returned keatings 
contributions but the citizens group common cause last week asked 
the senate ethics committee to investigate the matter 
common cause also asked the justice department to determine 
whether the contributions violated the law but seidmans statement 
is the first sign that a federal agency is actively pursuing the 
matter 
meanwhile seidman suggested strongly that the government waited 
three years too long before trying to contain the lincoln failure 
expected to be the nations costliest 
the fdic chief said if his agency had been regulating lincoln it 
would have sought in 1986 to take it over or issue an order 
stopping abuses 
that would have prevented some of what seidman estimates will be 
a 15 billion to 2 billion loss to taxpayers the government took 
control of the thrift in april 
were looking at the biggest bank heist in history said 
rep jim leach riowa at the first of four scheduled hearings on 
lincoln 
seidman refrained from directly criticizing m danny wall the 
top us thrift regulator but his assessment raised questions 
about walls decision to delay action against lincoln from 
mid1987 when he took office until april 14 of this year 
lincoln was seized by walls agency the federal home loan bank 
board and turned over the fdic which insures bank and sampl 
deposits last month the government filed a 11 billion civil 
fraud and racketeering suit charging that keating his family and 
associates diverted lincolns deposits for their personal use 
a march 12 1986 examination by the san francisco branch of the 
bank board found that lincoln had violated rules limiting risky 
direct investments in commercial ventures was not in compliance 
with accounting standards had substantial loan losses had 
inadequate and missing records and was speculating in junk bonds 
my staff indicated that had we made such findings in one of 
our own institutions we would have sought an immediate 
ceaseanddesist order to stop the hazardous operations seidman 
said 
the focus of the house panels probe is walls decision after 
meeting with keating to order a second examination by 
washingtonbased regulators to confirm the findings of the san 
francisco office delaying action against the thrift 
however committee chairman rep henry b gonzalez dtexas 
said he has not ruled out asking the senators to appear before the 
panel if later testimony shows their intervention caused the delay 
gonzalez said cranston offered about a month ago to appear 
before the committee riegle issued a statement saying he was 
providing information to the senate ethics panel and was prepared 
to share the same information with the house 
seidman also testified it was fairly clear keating was 
tipped off to the april 14 seizure because a day earlier american 
continental filed for bankruptcy complicating government efforts 
to recover part of the cost of the sampl failure 
additional hearings are scheduled oct 24 oct 31 and nov 7 
keating and wall are not scheduled to appear until the last session

tanker operators will have to have 
stateapproved plans outlining how they would respond to oil spills 
in prince william sound or they will be barred from loading oil in 
valdez officials said 
alyeska pipeline service co a consortium of oil companies that 
operates the transalaska pipeline terminal in valdez has been 
ordered not to load tankers without approved plans after nov 13 
said dennis kelso commissioner of the state department of 
environmental conservation 
be ready to contain and clean up a spill and demonstrate it 
with an approved plan that is the message kelso said in a 
statement monday 
letters warning of the new policy were sent last week to those 
chartering owning or operating tankers in the sound where the 
tanker exxon valdez spilled nearly 11 million gallons of oil march 
24 creating the nations largest oil spill 
a response plan must show details including how workers and 
equipment will be deployed to a spill the methods of cleanup 
disposal and communications and response times kelso said 
officials previously assumed that tankers going in and out of 
valdez the southern end of the pipeline were covered by 
alyeskas spillresponse plan said larry dietrick director of the 
departments division of environmental quality in juneau 
but there were problems in the early days of the exxon valdez 
cleanup and since then alyeska has said its obligation is limited 
to the initial response after the spill not the longterm efforts 
in the future if a tanker is claimed to be covered under 
alyeskas response plan its owners must show evidence that alyeska 
will respond fully to its spills kelso said

a top us arms control official says the bush 
administration is looking after the national security of the 
united states by deciding to make new chemical weapons while it 
seeks an international ban on the deadly weapons 
it is not good to cut programs in anticipation of negotiations 
that undercuts your negotiation leverage it undercuts your 
security ronald lehman head of the arms control and disarmament 
agency told reporters 
lehman said the key to us elimination of its older chemical 
weapons is to get other nations have to eliminate theirs and 
until they are committed to such a thing we will have a stock 
albeit a very small stock 
so we will be continuing our production program the president 
has asked us to look at how we would structure the program how we 
would implement this in the context of the overall negotiations 
lehman said 
you dont have to be born yesterday to understand we have 
taken a big step here but were also looking after the national 
security of the united states lehman said 
recent news reports citing unnamed administration officials 
said president bush has signed an order allowing the continued 
production of a new generation of chemical weapons for an 
unspecified period of time 
bush told the united nations last month the united states and 
the soviet union should cut their existing chemical weapons 
stockpiles by 80 percent as an impetus to the negotiations in 
geneva on curbing chemical weapons 
the president did not mention his decision on production in his 
un speech 
in 1984 bush as vice president carried a draft text to the 
geneva negotiations proposing that nations signing a chemical 
weapons ban cease producing such arms right away and destroy their 
stockpiles over a 10year period the international talks in which 
40 nations are taking part resume next month 
a draft of the international treaty calls for the immediate end 
to the production of such weapons 
senate democratic leader george mitchell of maine on monday 
criticized bushs stance on producing new chemical weapons calling 
it a major step backwards that threatens the international 
negotiations 
lehman said the threat of chemical weapons needs to be 
addressed and our policy has been to seek a total ban on the 
production and storage and use of these weapons 
but he stressed the administration also has been quite clear 
and told congress it intends to maintain our binary program 
binary chemical weapons consist of two nonlethal chemicals that 
become deadly when mixed 
lehman said the administration made progress on the issue during 
the recent ussoviet talks in wyoming and as a result of that 
session the two superpowers will begin exchanging data on the 
location and types of stocks and amounts that the two sides have 
before the end of this year 
but soviets diplomats speaking privately have said the kremlin 
is concerned about bushs decision to continue production of the 
new generation of chemical weapons 
under bushs un proposal the two superpowers would reduce 
their stockpiles to a level equivalent to 20 percent of the current 
us level 
only the united states the soviet union and iraq acknowledge 
having chemical weapons but more than 20 nations are believed to 
have them or have the capability to produce them

the world psychiatric association today 
conditionally readmitted the soviet union after a soviet official 
acknowledged that pyschiatry had been abused in his homeland for 
political reasons 
but the body said the official soviet organization could be 
ousted if an investigation finds that the soviets still use 
psychiatry as a political weapon against dissidents 
delegates at the eighth world psychiatric congress in athens 
voted 29145 with 19 abstentions early today to conditionally 
readmit the soviet allunion society of psychiatrists and 
narcologists 
the psychiatric congress also admitted a second soviet group 
the independent psychiatric association which was set up several 
months ago by psychiatrists who wanted to distance themselves from 
alleged abuses by the official allunion society 
the independent association was admitted unanimously with no 
conditions 
no members of the independent group attended the congress 
because they were unable to get visas in time congress sources 
said 
the allunion society withdrew from the world psychiatric 
congress in 1983 to avoid expulsion because of allegations 
dissidents were being certified as insane 
wednesdays decision empowers a world congress delegation to 
visit the soviet union within the next year to investigate whether 
the political use of psychiatry has ended 
if the delegation finds abuses a special meeting of the 
congress would be convened to consider suspending the allunion 
society 
i think the conditions will allow us to assess whether or 
not there has been an amelioration in the political use of 
psychiatry in the soviet union said dr melvin sabshin medical 
director of the american psychiatric association 
the move to admit the soviet union came after peter morozov the 
soviet representative acknowledged that psychiatry had been used 
for political purposes 
his group acknowledges that previous political conditions 
created an environment in which psychiatric abuse occurred 
including political morozov told the congress before his 
delegation left the hall for the vote 
the soviet union publicly admitted the political abuse of 
psychiatry had previously referred to breaches of professional 
ethics and the law as nonmedical use of psychiatry 
morozov told the associated press on monday it is clear we 
regret our past not only political abuses but the whole system 
there was heated debate over whether to readmit the soviet group 
the most strident opposition came from dr james birley 
president of the british royal college of physicians who said 
the soviet group is run by the soviet foreign office i 
have only been given contact with foreign office officials in my 
attempts to have talks with soviet psychiatrists 
a us delegation of psychiatrists led by a state department 
official visited the soviet union in february to investigate soviet 
claims that psychiatry was no longer being abused 
the group noted in a report that despite some progress more 
legal safeguards were needed to prevent the hospitalization of 
dissidents 
a soviet official told a us congressional panel earlier this 
month that an eightmember commission had been set up to prevent 
the use of psychiatry for nonmedical reasons 
but on monday a soviet foreign ministry spokesman told a news 
conference in athens that the authorities were still looking 
for professionals to become members of the commission which he 
said was not a part of any government department or organization 
the netherlandsbased international association on the political 
use of psychiatry which campaigned against the soviets 
readmission claims to have evidence that 40 dissidents are still 
being held in soviet psychiatric institutions 
and amnesty international said in a report released today that 
an amnesty delegation that visited the soviet union in march found 
100 cases in which people were in psychiatric institutions for 
political reasons 
it said more such cases had emerged since

few domestic issues give president bush more 
apparent agony or political grief than coming to grips with 
abortion 
its an issue hes very uncomfortable with conceded a 
senior bush aide as the presidents position took its latest twist 
a tuesday announcement that he would veto a bill expanding 
federally funded abortions to cases of incest and rape 
bush urged congress not to use tax dollars to compound a 
violent act with the taking of an unborn life just days after he 
told a news conference there may be room for flexibility in his 
stand 
the dispute involves a housepassed provision that would expand 
medicaid coverage for poor women to include abortions in cases of 
rape and incest 
the present law which bush wants retained only permits 
public funding when the pregnant womans life is in danger 
white house aides were backing and filling this week to show 
that bushs position has remained unchanged almost for many 
years 
the presidents positions not the same i mean is the same 
is the same freudian slip said presidential press secretary 
marlin fitzwater fielding one question after another on the 
subject 
in fact bush has wavered several times on critical abortion 
issues and many bush loyalists were privately conceding that the 
president may now have painted himself into a political corner as 
public opinion polls seem to reflect growing resistance to tighter 
restrictions 
although saying he has long morally opposed abortion bush as 
recently as his 1980 republican presidential campaign voiced clear 
opposition to a constitutional amendment to overturn the supreme 
courts roe vs wade decision legalizing abortions 
that position put him at odds with ronald reagan and sometime 
after bush joined the gop ticket as reagans running mate he 
abandoned his opposition to an amendment since then he has 
embraced just such an amendment 
you know there has been i have to make a confession an 
evolution in my position he told a 1984 campaign debate with 
geraldine ferraro the democratic vice presidential candidate 
in a campaign debate last year with democrat michael dukakis 
bush said his opposition to abortion was hardened as he watched the 
christening of adopted granddaughter marshall now 3 years old 
in a virginia church 
i was very pleased indeed that the mother had not aborted that 
child and put the child up for adoption he said 
bush experienced another apparent shift this one overnight 
rather than over the years after suggesting in another 1988 
debate with dukakis that women who have abortions could be 
subjected to criminal penalties if the procedure were outlawed 
his top lieutenants circulated the next morning insisting that 
bush upon reflection had decided that such penalties should not 
be imposed 
bushs current position is one of flat opposition to federally 
funded abortions for poor women except when their lives are 
endangered 
but this does not seem to square with his general view in 
support of a human life amendment that would also allow 
abortions in the case of rape or incest 
bush in a letter on tuesday to sen robert c byrd dwva 
tried anew to explain this apparent contradiction claiming the nub 
of the matter was who was paying the bill 
abortion is a difficult often painful and very personal 
decision for all americans it is made even more difficult when the 
underlying issue is whether the government and ultimately the 
american taxpayer is asked to pay for abortions and under what 
circumstances he said 
but rep les aucoin dore said that position showed a timid 
president who wouldnt lift a glove to get rid of panamanian 
strongman manuel antonio noriega who now tries to show his 
political backbone by pushing around poor women who are the victims 
of rape and incest 
in defense of the president rep chris smith rnj who also 
favors sharp abortion restrictions said the president took a 
very principled albeit very difficult stand

commuters found themselves driving at a 
50degree angle to the roadbed when an earthquake rippled 
through the san franciscooakland bay bridge and shook loose a 
30foot section 
first i thought my shocks werent working said susie allen 
then i realized the car wasnt having problems the ground was 
having problems 
the road rose up to meet me said ms allen who was headed 
from her office in san francisco to oakland where she lives i 
couldnt figure out why the road was at a 50degree angle to my 
face 
ms allen 26 stopped her car locked it and with other 
motorists began walking the 150 yards toward the huge gap in the 
top level of the span which collapsed onto the bottom level 
there was a car hanging off the edge with one tail light 
blinking ms allen said 
the bay bridge is made up of two spans one between san 
francisco and treasure island and the other connecting the island 
to oakland the span of roadway that collapsed was on the oakland 
side of treasure island 
we started walking back toward treasure island but hordes of 
people kept coming back toward us ms allen said 
officers from the treasure island naval reserve told ms allen 
and the other motorists to return to their cars where they waited 
for about two hours until an exodus from the bridge was organized 
you could see smoke from fires around the area she said 
at one point we watched a helicopter they lowered a stretcher to 
a coast guard boat to pick up somebody theyd fished out of the 
water 
ms allen returned to san francisco where she spent the night 
with friends

medicare patients and college students are 
among those who will take a financial hit because the white house 
and congress dont agree on how to cut the federal budget deficit 
officials say 
the automatic federal spending cuts which took effect tuesday 
in place of a budget agreement will have substantial effects 
elsewhere in the government if the reductions stand however most 
agencies report it would take a while for the cuts to trickle down 
even if efforts to resolve the impasse fail 
other than general restraint on spending nothings on hold 
a commerce department official said tuesday speaking on condition 
of anonymity 
the grammrudman deficit reduction law orders spending cuts 
totaling 161 billion in the 1990 fiscal year that began on oct 1 
we are waiting to see what congress does said spokesman 
pete williams of the defense department which was hit with half 
the reductions 
labor department spokesman tracy dennison said the department is 
studying ways to trim 465 million but it will probably be 
sometime down the road before we can say exactly what well be 
doing 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater raised the 
prospect that president bush might not accept legislation restoring 
the money to the budget 
there is some feeling here that they are the way to go he 
told reporters it will reduce spending in a very effective 
fashion 
house and senate leaders meanwhile looked for a way out of the 
dilemma 
the senate has passed a deficitreduction bill with almost 
nothing else attached to it but the house version includes a horde 
of controversial provisions ranging from child care assistance to 
the fairness doctrine in broadcasting 
if congress and bush fail to agree soon federal employees and 
many taxpayers would feel the effects of the cuts 
for example the labor department would delay employee transfers 
unless absolutely necessary and some new programs could be 
postponed 
the internal revenue service the fbi and other agencies with 
personneloriented budgets would have to furlough workers because 
the deficitreduction law prohibits cutting employee salaries 
as a practical matter we probably dont have to consider 
that for 30 to 45 days said pentagon spokesman williams 
at the department of health and human services dennis williams 
deputy assistant secretary for budget said the most immediate 
effect of the cuts will be on medicare 
for everybody else it will be a cumulative impact over 
time williams said 
doctors and hospitals that participate in the medicare program 
will see a reduction of 2092 percent in their payments he said 
in addition some people who submit their bills directly to 
medicare will have to cover the 2092 percent themselves 
medicare is taking a total 17 billion cut while defense 
spending accounted for a 81 billion reduction 
medicaid payments to states are exempt from the budget cuts as 
are social security supplemental security income and aid to 
families with dependent children 
sally christensen director of budget service for the education 
department said the student loan program is the only education 
program immediately affected by the budget cuts 
the law raises the loan origination fee from 5 percent to 55 
percent and cuts the special allowance payment to lending 
institutions from 325 percent to 3 percent ms christensen said 
with these changes banks will make less of a profit and students 
will pay more for taking out a loan 
dennis kaplan chief of budget control and analysis for the 
agriculture department said it is widely believed there that 
congress will soon work out a budget agreement to replace the 
automatic cuts 
if not he said the food safety and inspection service will 
probably furlough a lot of their employees but that wont occur 
until august or september of next year 
the same would be true of the forest service and farmers home 
administration he said 
much of the agriculture departments spending is exempt from the 
cuts including food stamps school lunches and other child 
nutrition programs 
at the federal aviation administration which oversees 16800 
air traffic controllers spokesman john leyden said there would be 
no immediate impact other than pulling back on hirings 
procurements and changes of status for personnel 
the white house office of management and budget said a prolonged 
impasse might force the layoff of air traffic controllers for three 
days a month and a reduction in military forces by 160000

there may be 145 million americans infected 
with the aids virus by the year 2002 unless stronger measures are 
taken to combat a growing epidemic the hudson institute predicts 
in what it calls a dark view of the future 
hudson a conservative think tank released a report tuesday 
based on a 2year study of the progress of the nations fight 
against aids and warned a catastrophe is sweeping over america 
the study warns if the nation shrinks from taking responsible 
action now to contain the epidemic it tacitly will be 
accepting a disaster of immense proportions 
unchecked aids will kill more americans in the next decade 
than have died in combat in all of the nations wars since our 
founding the study said already aids has claimed the lives of 
as many americans as did the vietnam war 
the centers for disease control reports aids has been diagnosed 
in more than 100000 americans and almost 60000 have died these 
numbers do not include americans who are only infected with the 
aids virus and not experiencing symptoms that would classify the 
case as aids the hudson study estimates are based on all people 
who are infected with human immuniodeficiency virus or hiv which 
causes aids 
william b johnston coauthor of the study and vice president 
of hudson said the report studied three possible scenarios and 
drew up mathematical models to project possible consequences 
in the worst case the report said there would be some 14 
million new hiv infections annually in the united states 
this worst case said johnston assumes no vaccine is developed 
and there are no major changes in current socialsexual behavior 
even with the best case which johnston said would include a 
vaccine by the middle of the 1990s and remarkable behavioral 
changes throughout society the report predicts there will be 
30000 new hiv infections annually by 2002 there would be about 
16 million americans with the disease that year under this 
scenario the report said 
the middle case which is the most reasonable said 
johnston gives us about 6 million cases of hiv infection 
that case assumes some changes in socialsexual behavior with a 
vaccine available by the year 2002 
johnston said widespread voluntary free hiv tests for all 
people between the 15 and 65 would be the primary factor in 
controlling the epidemic this will help establish the hiv 
status of all sexually active people he said 
by encouraging massive routine voluntary testing we can 
enable society voluntarily to segregate itself sexually into two 
groups those who carry the virus and those who do not the 
report said no other means is likely to alter the course of the 
hiv epidemic 
because of the biological dynamics of hiv the report said 
the disease can be controlled in a society that is not 
universally monogamous only by limiting sexual contact between 
the infected and the uninfected 
the only safe sex is sex between uninfected partners the 
study said 
the study said it is equally important however to protect 
the rights and privacy of all people in society 
in all three scenarios the aids epidemic would be most 
disastrous to black americans the study said 
under the worst case the researchers forecast by the year 2002 
almost 42 percent of the black population aged 15 to 50 would be 
infected with hiv under the best case infection among that same 
group would be 15 percent while the rate in the middle case would 
be 155 percent 
for hispanics of the same age the infection rate would be 92 
percent for the worst case 33 percent for the middle case and 1 
percent in the best case 
the same numbers for the white population would be 29 percent 
worst case 08 percent middle case and 01 percent best case 
currently the study estimated that there are 11 million 
americans infected with hiv this is about 09 percent of the total 
population 
comment on the report was requested from officials at the 
national institute of allergies and infectious disease the lead 
agency in the national institutes of health in the battle against 
aids and from the national cancer institute where the virus was 
first isolated in this country officials however did not return 
the calls 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is an incurable 
contagious disease that attacks the bodys immune system rendering 
it incapable of resisting other diseases and infections it is 
spread most often through sexual contact needles or syringes 
shared by drug abusers infected blood or blood products and from 
infected pregnant women to their offspring

a committee of the illinois house 
blocked a bill to restrict abortions in the state in a vote that 
prochoice legislators said would kill the issue for this year 
abortion opponents in the general assembly however said they 
would ask for a vote in the full house 
in pennsylvania legislation to impose more restrictions on 
abortions passed a committee tuesday on a 167 vote clearing the 
way for full debate by that states house 
tuesdays vote by the illinois houses rules committee blocked a 
bill similar to the missouri legislatures restrictions on 
abortion which were upheld in july by the us supreme court 
democratic rep barbara flynn currie a leading abortionrights 
lawmaker predicted the panels vote would hold 
this looked to me like a pretty solid pretty strong pretty 
clear signal that the bill will not be considered in the 
legislature during the fall veto session flynn said 
but republican rep penny pullen a leader of antiabortion 
forces in the assembly said it was wrong for a single committee 
to hold the bill without having any opportunity for the members 
of the house and senate to express their opinions 
nine of the 18 lawmakers on the rules committee voted to move 
the abortion bill to the full house but that was one vote short of 
the required majority of 10 eight lawmakers voted against further 
action and one was absent 
the panels approval was required for further action on abortion 
legislation in the fall session which is limited to emergency 
legislation and action on the governors vetoes 
a draft of the bill would require doctors to determine the 
viability of a fetus believed to be 20 weeks old or older before 
performing an abortion and require that a second physician be 
present for abortions of viable fetuses 
it also would bar public employees and public facilities from 
direct involvement in abortions except when performed to save the 
life of the mother 
the bill required threefifths majorities in both houses of the 
assembly to reach the governors desk 
before the committee vote gov james r thompson had warned 
lawmakers against hasty action on the abortion legislation he 
declined to take a position on the measure 
in the past the republican governor has vetoed most abortion 
restrictions on constitutional grounds 
the pennsylvania bill would ban abortions after the 24th week of 
pregnancy except to save the life of the mother it also would 
prohibit abortions based on the sex of a fetus and require women in 
most cases to notify their husbands if they plan to get an abortion 
the bill approved by the house judiciary committee also calls 
for a 24hour waiting period for abortions 
democrat robert odonnell the majority leader has said the 
house will consider the measure oct 24

supporters of a bill calling for wider use of 
the death penalty in federal crimes say a lastminute addition 
designed to avert racial bias could scuttle the whole bill 
make no mistake its a killer amendment sen strom 
thurmond rsc declared tuesday as the senate judiciary 
committee debated the measure 
the committee agreed to send the legislation to the senate floor 
for action at a time which has not been determined 
but the committee first voted 76 to adopt an amendment 
sponsored by sen edward m kennedy dmass which would allow 
defendants to use statistical evidence of racial bias in their 
efforts to escape the death penalty 
in sending the measure to the floor the committee did not 
recommend whether it should be passed 
the legislation would bring into line with supreme court rulings 
existing federal law that calls for the death penalty for offenses 
including murder treason espionage air piracy and certain deaths 
involving explosives 
the bill would for the first time authorize the death penalty 
for attempts to assassinate the president murder by a federal 
prisoner serving a life term taking a hostage if the hostage or a 
wouldbe rescuer ends up being killed genocide and murder for hire 
or in aid of racketeering 
the bush administration had sought such a measure as part of its 
anticrime package 
democratic leaders promised senate action on the death penalty 
and other elements in the crime package before congress adjourns 
for the year 
broader use of the death penalty called for by the bill would 
involve only federal cases but kennedys amendment would also 
apply to state cases 
it would allow defense attorneys to present to the court state 
statistics showing lopsided application of the death penalty 
against racial minorities prosecutors would then have to 
demonstrate that bias was not involved before capital punishment 
could be imposed 
kennedy said after the committee meeting that his provision was 
certainly not a killer amendment 
i dont know why it would be kennedy said if the state 
courts dont apply the death penalty in a racial way whats the 
problem 
after the amendment was adopted sen charles grassley riowa 
voted against the bill democrats said more republicans may oppose 
the measure rather than accept the racial provision 
thurmond acknowledged it would cause problems for the measure 
i dont see how you can vote for his amendment if you believe 
in a death penalty at all he said 
american indian groups oppose the legislation saying 47 percent 
of all firstdegree murder cases prosecuted in federal courts from 
july 1987 through june 1988 arose on indian reservations 
the new mexicobased all indian pueblo council in august 
approved a resolution urging lawmakers to vote against it 
judiciary committee chairman joseph biden ddel told the 
committee he would offer an amendment addressing the indians 
concern when the legislation reaches the senate floor

the chairman of the senate intelligence 
committee says it is time to remove an unintended chilling 
effect on the cia that results from a ban on us involvement in 
assassination plots 
sen david boren dokla said tuesday he welcomes president 
bushs desire to clarify what the ban means and what restrictions 
it should and should not place on american intelligence 
operatives 
the cia is suffering the aftershocks of vietnam and of the 
irancontra affair boren said in an interview there has grown 
to be a builtin cultural reticence to become involved in plots 
such as the failed oct 3 coup in panama against dictator manuel 
noriega 
that coup while not directly raising the question of 
assassination has prompted the administration to review its policy 
on us participation in plots that could lead to the death of a 
foreign leader 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said the 
administration will propose changes that would not fundamentally 
alter the 13yearold assassination ban but would make it easier 
for the cia to be in contact with plotters of a coup 
other administration officials have said they want to offer 
clear guidance to permit activities which while they may involve a 
risk of death to a particular official do not amount to a 
premeditated murder plot 
we want the agency to be aggressive about entering into 
discussions and not just passive collectors of intelligence 
said boren who conceded that he was more hawkish on the issue than 
some of his colleagues on the intelligence oversight committees 
sen william cohen of maine the committees senior republican 
said it is entirely proper for the administration to reexamine 
its guidelines for intelligence officials he said he did not 
believe congress ever intended to prevent them from a dialogue with 
those who might be plotting a coup 
if a person might be killed incidental to a coup thats 
quite a bit different from a premeditated assassination he said 
but he cautioned that the ban itself should not be disturbed 
i dont want to see us getting into the assassination business by 
another name cohen said 
rep doug bereuter rneb a member of the house intelligence 
committee said he agreed there may be room for clarifying what 
constitutes participation in an assassination 
but he added if it is any weakening of the prohibition on 
assassination at the initiation of the us government it is not 
likely to be acceptable to congress or to the american public 
following the failed panamanian coup administration officials 
complained that cia officers in panama were essentially prevented 
from advising the coup plotters because of the possibility that 
noriega might be killed 
when the rebel leaders outlined their plans to the cia the 
agency failed to ask essential questions about their intentions and 
tactics when they asked for support in blocking roads us 
officials felt unable to respond 
president bush at a news conference last week indicated he 
wanted to see the restrictions relaxed i want as broad a power 
as possible and i think under the constitution the president has 
it he said on friday 
bush said his powers were broader than some in the senate or 
house might think adding i may have a difference with some on 
interpreting what the powers of the president might be boren 
said the subject came up when he and cohen met with bush last week 
and he invited the president to submit any new guidelines to his 
panel 
the executive order prohibiting us involvement in 
assassination attempts was signed by president ford in 1976 after 
congressional investigations detailed the cias role in 
assassination plots against cuban president fidel castro and 
others the order was strengthened by president carter and 
continued without change by president reagan

a downtown emergency shelter drew a mixed 
group of about 100 stranded tourists conventioneers and residents 
from nearby transient hotels who fled pitch dark streets looking 
for a safe place to spend the night 
no food or cots were available in the makeshift red cross 
shelter late tuesday in the ballroom of the moscone convention 
center near the heart of the citys financial district and near 
major rail and bus terminals 
people ousted from their hotels or unable to reach them rested 
their heads on tables set for conventioneers others stretched out 
in corners trying to sleep 
an emergency power supply provided dim lighting in the 
underground convention center 
the red cross had no food to offer but volunteers were trying 
to find some combing nearby streets for any small market that 
might be open despite the lack of electricity 
once you provide food everything else becomes secondary 
said shelter manager theresa hull adding that she hoped those 
foraging for food could at least buy some peanut butter and jelly 
for sandwiches 
radio notices informed those seeking safe haven about the 
shelter thought to be the citys only red cross outpost in the 
first night following the devastating quake others said they were 
directed there by police officers on the street 
the mood in the dimly lighted ballroom was one of shock as 
people recalled the wave of earth movement 
i thought it was a train going across the building said 
phyllis shook a tourist from des moines iowa it had a roar 
we heard an explosion and it turned out to be concrete from 
the walls and windows blowing out said kim house of san jose 
who was walking in the san franciscos tenderloin district with her 
fiancee when the quake hit 
at first we thought it was a bomb and thats when all hell 
broke loose people were running out the buildings 
douglas schmillen a transient staying at hotel where the city 
refers the homeless was lying on his bed when the tremor struck 
the bed moved from one side of the room to the other 
schmillen said i didnt know if the walls were going to come 
down next 
schmillen said he was evacuated from the hotel because of a gas 
leak and the lack of electricity 
bob witzgall a conventioneer from sacramento said he was in 
the shower of his union square hotel room when the earthquake hit 
it was scary i couldnt get out of there fast enough 
witzgall said it started out as a little rumble but it was 
pretty violent where i was 
lack of electricity and fears of being stranded on the street 
all night sent witzgall back to the shelter 
im going to stay here until the power is back on and once 
its back on i think ill get in my car and leave he said 
frank odill a milwaukee visitor traveling with his wife said 
he was grateful they did not have to spend the night in total 
darkness 
at least here weve got power and light he said but his 
wife betty was less able to see a bright side

here is the text of president bushs letter to 
sen robert c byrd dwva outlining his opposition to a bill 
that would extend medicaid benefits to pay for abortions for 
victims of rape or incest byrd is chairman of the senate 
appropriations committee which has jurisdiction over the bill 
dear bob 
as the senate begins consideration of hr 2990 the conference 
report accompanying the department of labor health and human 
services and education and related appropriations bill for 
fiscal year 1990 i want you to know that i will not sign the 
measure should it include language that expands federal funding for 
abortion beyond that which has been current law sine 1981 
my position on the issue of abortion is clear i support a 
constitutional amendment that would reverse the supreme courts 
decision in roe v wade i also support a human life amendment with 
an exception for rape incest or where the life of the mother is 
threatened i do not support federal funding of abortions except 
where the mothers life is threatened 
as hr 2990 progressed through the legislative process my 
senior advisors indicated that they would recommend i veto the 
measure if it included expanded federal funding for abortion beyond 
the life of the mother exception although i wrote a letter to 
members of congress clearly expressing my concerns during 
consideration of the district of columbia appropriations bill for 
fy 1990 i nonetheless asked my senior advisors to take another 
look at this complex issue particularly the role of public funds 
consistent though with my position as stated above 
this decision is one that i have not reached easily or lightly 
many citizens and members of congress were consulted as this 
question was reviewed abortion is a difficult often painful and 
very personal decision for all americans it is made even more 
difficult when the underlying issue is whether the government and 
ultimately the american taxpayer is asked to pay for abortions 
and under what circumstances since 1981 the federal government 
has determined i think wisely that taxpayer funds should be used 
for abortion in only the most narrow of circumstances where the 
life of the mother is endangered if abortion funding were expanded 
to include other circumstances it would be difficult to limit to 
the few cases of actual rape or incest and could have the 
unintended consequence of allowing the taking of countless other 
lives of unborn children well beyond the few cases argued as 
reasons for the proposed legislative change 
my intense personal concern for those women who are victims of 
the crimes of rape and incest is as strongly felt as my position on 
abortion rape and incest are crimes of violence which must not go 
unpunished and those convicted of such crimes must be brought to 
justice 
the question raised by hr 2990 however involves whether the 
federal government and american taxpayers should be forced to pay 
for the termination of an unborn childs life in the case of rape 
or incest that such a child may have been conceived through an 
unconscionable act of violence makes this question difficult and 
indeed agonizing it does not however alter the basic fact that 
federal funding is being sought that would compound a violent act 
with the taking of an unborn life and in the absence of perfect 
legislation that would reconcile these difficult issues if i have 
to err i prefer to err on the side of human life 
for these reasons should hr 2990 reach my desk with language 
expanding federal funding of abortion i will veto the measure and 
return it to congress

an allwhite high school academy has 
agreed to play a football game against a school that has a black 
player reversing a decision that had prompted several team members 
to quit 
the headmaster of the allwhite east holmes academy said he 
decided not to cancel fridays game against columbus heritage 
academy after the mississippi private school association threatened 
to expel the school 
headmaster frank drake continued to insist that the earlier 
decision to cancel the game wasnt based on racism however he 
wouldnt say what it was based on and he refused to comment when 
asked whether east holmes discriminated on the basis of race 
im not saying we violated a rule drake said tuesday after 
a meeting with a committee of the private school association im 
saying the association told us we violated a rule 
coaches on both sides of the weeklong controversy said they 
hope all can be forgotten by game time 
all we intend to do now is to get our football team ready to 
play and to get on with the season with as few distractions as 
possible heritage academy headmaster and coach ray wooten said 
seven east holmes players who had quit the team in protest of 
the planned forfeiture of their game to heritage have been 
reinstated school officials confirmed 
the only thing i ever wanted to do was play the game said 
east holmes coach riley myers i just want my humans to block and 
tackle their humans now that the game is back on its a huge 
sense of relief to me its the right thing to do 
wooten had said earlier that east holmes and other private 
schools were considering forfeiting games against his school 
because of scott fuller a 15yearold black student who 
transferred to the school from west point high school five weeks 
ago 
sharkeyissaquana academy forfeited its game with heritage last 
friday at the time headmaster wayne pinkerton said his team 
wouldnt play because it was riddled with injuries and needed time 
to mend

president bush setting the stage for a nasty 
confrontation with congress is promising to veto legislation 
allowing federally financed abortions for rape and incest victims 
i think wisely that taxpayer funds should be used only in the 
most narrow of circumstances where the life of the mother is 
endangered bush said tuesday in a letter that drew criticism 
from democratic leaders in congress and abortion rights activists 
unfortunate and regrettable house speaker thomas foley said 
after bush issued his veto threat he conceded the house might 
sustain the veto but said he would make an attempt to override it 
sen robert packwood rore a prochoice lawmaker said the 
fallout from the battle could wind up harming gop candidates 
but bushs decision was hailed by rep chris smith rnj a 
leading abortion foe in the house he said the president had taken 
a very principled albeit very difficult stand and added 
doing right isnt always popular 
bush issued his veto threat several days after saying publicly 
he hoped there could be flexibility on the controversial issue and 
after quiet talks designed to draft a compromise that could satisfy 
prolife lawmakers who oppose any liberalization of the current 
restrictions on medicaid funding for abortion 
no blame it just didnt work out white house spokesman 
marlin fitzwater said 
at issue is a provision attached to legislation funding programs 
for the department of health and human services it would permit 
medicaid funds to be used not only for abortions to save the life 
of the mother as is now the case but also for cases of incest and 
rape 
the legislation has passed the house on a vote of 216206 far 
less than the twothirds majority needed to override a veto it is 
still awaiting senate action 
bushs decision was a bow to conservatives 
that a child may have been conceived through an 
unconscionable act of violence makes this question difficult and 
indeed agonizing bush said it does not however alter the 
basic fact that federal funding is being sought that would compound 
a violent act with the taking of a human life 
bush wrote to byrd because the west virginia democrat as 
chairman of the senate appropriations committee will manage the 
legislation on the senate floor 
in the past administration officials had suggested a veto was a 
strong likelihood fitzwater on tuesday ended any doubts 
in the end we couldnt find any flexibility fitzwater 
contended 
fitzwater insisted that bush last week never intended to signal 
a liberalization in his position on the issue and was only 
speaking about flexibility in the process 
the abortion provision is part of a spending bill for the 
departments of labor and health and human services that has already 
been approved by a housesenate conference committee and by the 
full house it awaits final senate approval 
packwood who favors the broadening provision said bushs 
intention to veto the measure hurts the republican party it 
hurts our candidates 
it is clear that the time and tides are on the side of us on 
the prochoice side he said he told reporters that when a 
republican president vetoes such legislation that becomes the 
republican party position in voters eyes 
but fitzwater denied that current election campaigns in virginia 
and new jersey where public opinion polls suggest republicans 
voicing strong antiabortion views are trailing had been a factor 
in bushs interest in finding a compromise 
no the president said early on you know my position i 
dont want to change it fitzwater asserted 
while opposing use of federal funds for abortions in cases of 
incest or rape the president has a slightly less restrictive 
position when it comes to abortions that are not paid for by the 
public and he would not ban those privately financed abortions 
for pregnancies from rape or incest

a spate of racially charged attacks on 
and near the brown university campus has prompted the schools 
president to consider asking for federal assistance to protect 
students 
in a letter to students released tuesday vartan gregorian said 
racism apparently was the motivation for some of the attacks 
the adminstration will join the local state and if need 
be federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute the perpetrators 
of such cowardly acts gregorian wrote 
in a letter monday to providence mayor joseph r paolino jr 
gregorian also said he might ask for unspecified federal assistance 
i believe i have a moral and legal obligation to protect the 
welfare of the brown community and i am determined to take every 
measure to do so he said 
robert reichley vice president of university affairs would not 
say whether gregorian was considering asking for help from the fbi 
the justice departments civil rights division or another federal 
agency or when he might make the request 
sixteen attacks with racial overtones have occurred since 
classes began in september reichley said in most cases black men 
have jumped white male students punching and beating them and 
sometimes drawing guns or other weapons reichley said no one has 
been seriously injured he said 
reichley said it was almost certain the attackers were not 
students 
the campus newspaper also has reported that black and asian 
students have been taunted by whites on campus 
we have anxious parents and a student body that is clearly on 
edge reichley said anything could set it off a larger 
internal action vigilantism what have you 
gregorian asked students to use good judgment and caution 
this is not a time for the bravado of vigilantism 
brown has been troubled by racial episodes since last spring 
when racist and antihomosexual epithets were scrawled in some 
parts of campus including a dormitory 
gregorian warned students that the latest incidents were more 
serious than the ones last may he urged students to use campus 
shuttle buses lighted walks emergency call boxes and studentrun 
escort services for safety

theres not much chance of a sequel to 
last years big event in this northern alaskan outpost the rescue 
of three whales trapped in an ice floe 
conditions are warmer this fall leaving much less ice in the 
lagoon where the whales were sealed according to the biologist who 
led the international rescue effort 
the situation is just totally opposite this fall geoff 
carroll said this week the pack ice is way way offshore there 
is no chance of a pressure ridge forming 
last year the pack ice had formed a pressure ridge by early 
october sealing off a shallow lagoon northeast of barrow 
an eskimo hunter scouting for bowhead whales was startled to 
find three young california gray whales clustered around a small 
breathing hole in the rapidly thickening ice in the lagoon 
when word of the whales plight went out an international 
clamor arose to rescue them even president reagan got involved 
authorizing the use of military planes and personnel and 
telephoning encouragement to rescue officials 
while the government the military and the oil industry monkeyed 
with a series of expensive hightechnology solutions carroll and 
local whalers set to work with chainsaws 
by cutting a path of new breathing holes toward the open water 
they lured the whales toward freedom one of the whales disappeared 
early in the effort but the two others followed the path with 
growing enthusiasm 
finally two soviet icebreakers battered through the 
30foottall ridge of ice and the whales were on their own 
their fate remains unknown as government scientists chose not to 
attach transmitters that would have kept track of the whales 
progress although free of the barrow ice the whales faced more 
than 200 miles of heavy pack ice before open water in the chukchi 
sea 
unlike last fall when barrow was a nightly fixture on 
television newscasts around the world this autumn has slipped into 
the quiet rhythm of the arctic as winter approaches 
there is no ice on elson lagoon whalers are ranging out in 
search of their favorite target the bowhead a 39footer was taken 
tuesday the sixth of the fall season 
although there is no horde of reporters and photographers 
clamoring about town no fleet of helicopters clattering overhead 
the whale rescue isnt forgotten 
a small ceremony and dance were held thursday to commemorate the 
long hours of hard work by people in a community hardpressed to 
cope with the onslaught of media attention 
carroll who worked as a biologist for the north slope borough 
last year and went to work for the state last week said there were 
discussions during the winter about what to do if the trappedwhale 
dilemma ever arises again 
carroll said no consensus was reached but many whalers he knows 
say privately they would harvest any whales trapped in the future 
others would ignore trapped whales leaving them on their own to 
find a way out 
a lot of people had a pretty good time with it last year 
although nobody wants to go through another fullscale effort that 
was so expensive carroll said 
the borough estimated it spent about 750000 on the rescue 
government military and oil industry officials involved in the 
operation steadfastly refused to give estimates of their expenses 
interest in the fate of the two freed whales remained high 
during the summer as an unusually large number of gray whales 
turned up dead carroll said on one 40mile stretch of beach 
southwest of barrow nine grays washed ashore 
one was about the size as the surviving whales and had numerous 
wounds on its snout similar to those the trapped whales suffered as 
they nosed up through their iceclogged breathing holes 
he was kind of cut up but we came to the conclusion it wasnt 
as bad as they the survivors were carroll said im pretty 
confident it wasnt the same whale

a music store owner fined 500 for 
selling a rap recording that police found sexually offensive has 
accused the city of selectively enforcing its obscenity statute 
tommy hammond owner of the taking home the hits music store in 
this city of 14000 said his attorney will ask a tallapoosa county 
circuit judge at a nov 9 hearing to throw out the conviction 
hammond was convicted and fined in august 1988 for selling a 
cassette 2 live crews move somethin 
hammond said other stores in alexander city are carrying the 
same cassette and he believes he was singled out for what he 
considers wrongful prosecution 
i stepped on some toes he said 
john dillon an attorney who works as a prosecutor for the city 
said he was certain police would charge other store owners if the 
cassette was found in their shops 
but hammond said his attorney had someone purchase the recording 
at another store and present it to police who took no action 
against that stores owner 
hammond said police told him a parent complained about the sale 
of the cassette but hammond said he was careful not to sell move 
somethin to minors 
daniel brown another attorney for the city said 2 live crew 
violates the citys obscenity laws because its lyrics provide 
detailed descriptions of perverse sexual acts and sadomasochism 
hammonds lawyer elizabeth johnson of montgomery disagreed 
profanity and offensive music are not what obscenity is all 
about ms johnson said you may be offended by it but that 
doesnt make it obscene 
the group in question 2 live crew records on the miamibased 
luke skywalker label which is paying half of hammonds legal fees 
debbie bennett a publicist for the recording company said 2 
live crew can be raunchy but is not obscene 
its very restricting to consider it pornography she said 
its far far from being that its humorous rap the group 
considers themselves the founders of comedic rap

sen john danforth an episcopal priest before

letting people know its ok to plan for death just as they 
think about life 
we are walking along living our lives and thinking everything 
is fine the missouri republican said at a news conference 
tuesday then suddenly somebody youve never met before has you 
hooked up to a machine youve never heard of before in an 
institution youve never seen before 
far better says danforth is for each individual to plan for 
the possibility and decide in advance whether they want to be 
allowed to die with dignity when all hope of recovery is gone or be 
maintained in a vegetative state by machines for weeks or months or 
even years 
the legislation he introduced tuesday along with sen daniel p 
moynihan dny would require the 10 states that do not already

leftist salvadoran rebels and 
government negotiators broke a deadlock over truce conditions and 
agreed to meet again today for peace talks aimed at ending their 
countrys decadeold civil war 
the talks nearly broke off after men firing automatic weapons 
killed the daughter of an army colonel in san salvador on tuesday 
the salvadoran government accused the rebels of the killing but 
guerrilla leaders emphatically denied the charge 
both sides later agreed to extend the twoday session another 
day in response to an appeal by president oscar arias of costa 
rica who won the 1987 nobel peace prize for his plan to bring 
peace to central america 
there are agreements the meeting has been saved it was 
already known that this would be a critical meeting said bishop 
gregorio rosa chavez of el salvador who has been monitoring the 
talks 
we know the process will continue and there is more than a 
mere agreement to continue meeting he said adding that both 
sides pledged not to comment further until todays session ends 
rosa chavez one of several roman catholic leaders and 
international observers monitoring the talks spoke to reporters 
during a dinner break late tuesday 
both sides had appeared eager to call a ceasefire in the civil 
war that has killed more than 70000 people but differed sharply 
on the terms 
the rebel farabundo marti liberation front called for a 
temporary truce beginning nov 15 and for broad political and 
social reforms president alfredo cristianis rightist government 
demanded an immediate ceasefire with virtually no preconditions 
arias intervened tuesday night when it appeared the talks were 
seriously threatened by the deadlock and the slaying ana isabel 
casanova she was shot to death in her car a block from her home as 
she celebrated her 23rd birthday 
arias rushed to the parish house in the little town of moravia 
just north of the capital where the talks are being held 
i came to encourage both sides to continue he told 
reporters i know that after 10 years of war it is difficult to 
attain peace which is a slow and complicated process 
arias invited the two delegations to dinner after they promised 
to continue talking today 
the talks are the second meeting between the rebels and the 
cristiani government which took office in june an opening session 
was held in mexico city in september 
a previous round of negotiations between the government and 
rebels in october 1987 broke off because of the assassination of 
herbert anaya the leader of a leftist human rights group

educators and their supporters at the statehouse 
turned out to honor pulitzer prizewinning author tracy kidder who 
chronicled a year in the life of a massachusetts teacher in his 
latest highly acclaimed book 
among schoolchildren the chronicle of kidders year with 
holyoke schoolteacher chris zajacs fifthgrade class has left a 
lot of people nodding in reluctant recognition 
gov michael s dukakis says its among the best four or five 
books hes ever read and public schoolteachers are using it as a 
rallying cry 
about 200 education activists showed up at a statehouse 
reception tuesday for kidder the author of the soul of a new 
machine and house and hear him read excerpts from his latest 
effort 
everyone who has read the book agrees it tells it like it 
is said phyllis smith a former teacher and now an administrator 
at marbleheads public schools no honeyfaced lies and a lot you 
can identify with 
in the book kidder doesnt gloss over low pay lack of respect 
and poor working conditions teachers face he demonstrates little 
patience with highminded reform efforts that he says seem to 
leave teachers right out of the equation 
the story has had particular resonance in massachusetts this 
fall because of the states fiscal crisis and the resulting 
financial problems of many public schools 
in holyoke for instance students dont have physical 
education art or music courses this year because the funds arent 
available and residents arent willing to approve a tax increase 
kidder said 
i constantly am questioning why im doing something and 
reflecting on my weaknesses said zajac who was 34 years old 
when kidder persuaded her to let him join her class three years ago 
i am not a saint or a miracle worker or even a witch doctor 
she told her colleagues tuesday afternoon im a public school 
teacher from holyoke just one of millions 
its important for us to be as concerned with what something 
is worth as with what it costs said rep nicholas a paleologos 
chairman of the house committee on education arts and humanities 
and sponsor of a petition introduced tuesday to add a penny for 
education to the 5 percent sales tax

georgia officials have asked a federal appeals 
court to let them enforce a law requiring young women to inform 
their parents before having an abortion 
but a lawyer representing planned parenthood urged the 11th us 
circuit court of appeals on tuesday to uphold lower court decisions 
that for two years have blocked enforcement of the law 
the law would require young women under age 18 to bring a note 
from a parent before having an abortion or otherwise show the 
parents had been notified it includes a provision under which a 
minor could secure the permission of a juvenile court judge to 
undergo an abortion without parental knowledge 
the law mandates a 24hour wait between parental notification 
and an abortion 
the statute was passed in 1987 but a challenge by planned 
parenthood resulted in key portions being ruled unconstitutional 
before it took effect 
the legislature revised the statute in 1988 with the same result 
among other things us district judge robert hall cited the 
statutes failure to provide for swifter forms of written notice 
and held that it improperly allowed a juvenile court intake 
officer to screen and possibly dismiss a young womans request 
for a waiver 
kathryn allen a senior assistant state attorney general 
complained to the three appeals court judges that hall applied too 
strict a standard 
she argued that the state is not required to meet every 
contingency as long as the statute is narrowly drawn 
if anything can be learned from the us supreme courts 
abortion decision last summer ms allen added it is that state 
statutes will be given the benefit of the doubt and the court will 
attempt to read it in a manner that will make it constitutional 
but dara klassel an attorney representing planned parenthood 
chapters in atlanta and augusta argued that the supreme court 
decision did nothing to change the standard of review 
laws affecting a fundamental constitutional right have to be 
subjected to strict scrutiny she said 
the court took the appeal under consideration without indicating 
when it would rule

rows of police officers flanked a coffin draped 
in white to mourn a young recruit who shot himself to death after 
he fell short of his lifelong goal of becoming a policeman 
danny morales was not depressed and was not the type to plan his 
death the rev robert stiefvater told about 250 mourners who 
packed a roman catholic church tuesday 
when his dream of becoming a police officer began slipping the 
21yearold morales took his revolver and shot himself in the head 
friday in front of his instructor at the police training academy 
shooting range 
we cannot condone what he did stiefvater said we cannot 
condemn him for what he did what he did is a part of us 
stiefvater said all of milwaukee where homicides and 
drugrelated crimes have risen to record levels this year is 
hurting in this autumn of a hundred violent deaths 
there is something missing in the way we support each other 
that allows these things to happen he said but we can turn 
things around and we can start right now 
turning to morales uniformed academy classmates who were seated 
in pews at the side of the altar stiefvater said the lord tells 
us to live our values the way you wear that patch so that all 
can see it 
stiefvaters church is across the street from milwaukee 
technical high school where morales launched the second generation 
of his familys tradition of winning high school wrestling 
championships morales helped coach sports teams at the parish 
he was remembered as a promising young man whose suicide stunned 
family and friends 
inspector joseph kalivoda commander of the police departments 
training bureau recalled morales role within the current training 
class and how he would be remembered 
every recruit class has a different personality a few days 
after they started an instructor noted this class was very 
teamoriented kalivoda said 
danny was taken from us because of the will of the lord some 
day we will understand why when his class graduates january fifth 
i believe his spirit will be with them 
morales was accepted to the recruit class that started training 
aug 20 a month later he failed a firing range test and then 
failed the retest and resigned from the academy sept 29 
after finding out he was nearsighted morales got glasses and 
appealed his resignation he was allowed another chance to take the 
shooting test 
on friday after a week of remedial training and full of renewed 
hope he returned to the range to retake the test but it quickly 
became clear the glasses werent the only problem with his 
marksmanship 
morales needed a score of 210 of 300 in three rounds of shooting 
he scored a poor 62 in the first round and 66 in the second he 
needed an 82 in the third round and it was clear he couldnt get 
it he used the remaining shot to kill himself

time will come when we will have to part if for no other 
reason then when allah calls us to his bosom ozal said to the 
deputies who gave him a standing ovation this way it will be 
easier there will be change 
analysts say ozal 62 who had a triple heart bypass operation 
three years ago wants the less strenous job of president for 
health and political reasons 
parliament will begin voting friday to elect a successor to 
president kenan evren whose sevenyear term expires nov 9 
the motherland party has a 289seat majority in the 450member 
legislature 
the opposition parties came out strongly against ozals 
candidacy but so far they have not offered a candidate of their 
own erdal inonu leader of the chief opposition social democrat 
populist party said tuesday that party members would boycott 
parliament sessions during presidential balloting 
the opposition says an ozal presidency would be against the 
spirit of the constitution because he lacks sufficient public 
support and could never be the nonpartisan president required by 
the constitution 
under turkeys constitution general elections must be held if 
parliament fails to elect a president by the fourth and final 
ballot which is scheduled for nov 4 
a twothirds majority is necessary on the first two ballots and 
political analysts say ozal is likely to be elected oct 31 on a 
third ballot when a simple majority is sufficient 
ozal said party members have indicated they will allow him to 
designate his successor as party leader and premier but some 
analysts say the party could be divided over the choice and that a 
government crisis could follow 
some names mentioned as possible candidates for premier are 
foreign minister mesut yilmaz finance minister ekrem pakdemirli 
and former education minister hasan celal guzel 
ozal became premier six years ago when the newly formed 
motherland party won elections that restored civilian rule a 
military junta had taken over in 1980 at a time of widespread 
political terrorism and an economic crisis 
during military rule ozal served as deputy premier in charge of 
the economy and implemented economic liberalization measures that 
since have quadrupled turkeys exports 
there also has been a massive investment in roads power plants 
and telecommunications during ozals leadership 
but the price has been high inflation which has run at 75 
percent for the past two years 
public support for ozal and his party has been sliding in 
recent polls published by turkish papers at least 60 percent of 
the respondents opposed an ozal presidency in local elections in 
march the motherland party won only 2175 percent of the vote

the earth shook for 20 seconds and when it 
stopped the bigleague ballplayers werent talking about their 
championship anymore 
frightened giants and athletics dashed out of their dugouts 
while in the stands their stunned fans watched the concrete 
overhang ripple ominously as tuesdays earthquake struck and forced 
cancellation of the third game of the world series at candlestick 
park 
it makes you realize just what place baseball should have in 
your life said san francisco giants catcher terry kennedy i 
found that out tonight 
you cant stop concrete oakland outfielder dave henderson 
said forget the world series 
fans in the sellout crowd of about 60000 remained calm when the 
tremors struck several people were hit by small chunks of metal 
and concrete before candlestick was calmly evacuated no serious 
injuries were reported at the stadium 
as of early today there was no word on when the series might 
resume 
we needed to get everybody out of here before it gets dark 
baseball commissioner fay vincent said that was the governing 
issue in the decision to postpone the game 
game no 3 of the championship series between the san francisco 
bay area teams had been scheduled to start at 530 pm the quake 
struck at 504 pm 
viewers of abcs world series pregame show saw the picture turn 
to static and heard an unidentified voice yell were having an 
earth before the transmission was lost 
the picture then disappeared and the network put up a still 
slide for the world series before switching to the program 
roseanne 
it could have been a catastrophe said will clark the san 
francisco giants star first baseman we had one in la last 
year but this was more scary because we have a packed house here 
security guard mark dandridge 26 said he saw a stadium light 
tower sway and then i looked down to the luxury boxes and i saw 
all that starting to shake and i said oh god help us 
said oakland slugger jose canseco i didnt know where i was 
for five seconds 
it was a steady sort of shake and roll and it was an extremely 
uneasy moment said al michaels abctvs announcer who was in 
the candlestick press box when the quake hit the sense i got for 
a split second was we were going backward 
umpire al clark was still in the dressing room 
it was one of the scariest situations ive ever been in as 
soon as it started my legs went numb he said i looked up 
and the walls were waving i became frightened and i realized it 
was an earthquake 
i knew something was wrong when i saw the first base dugout 
moving said kennedy my first thought was to look for my wife 
in the stands i spotted her and rushed over 
carl epolite of san jose decided to leave as soon as he felt the 
first aftershock about 35 minutes after the quake he was sitting 
in the upper deck under a concrete overhang 
we saw the overhang starting to ripple carl said it 
rippled all around the stadium but we kind of took it in stride 
and people started cheering some people took it as a good sign for 
the giants that it was a sign from god that the giants would start 
winning

ever since the 1906 earthquake devastated san 
francisco many scientists have believed the next big one would 
strike the los angeles end of the mighty san andreas fault 
but studies in recent years have reminded the bay area that it 
also faced another seismic disaster and those studies became a 
reality tuesday when a quake measuring 69 on the richter scale 
rocked the bay area 
a 1985 paper in the geophysical research letters predicted a 
69magnitude quake could happen any time on a portion of the san 
andreas fault that stretches 50 miles from palo alto southward 
through the santa cruz mountains and on to san juan bautista 
the quake was centered on the san andreas segment described in 
the article but tom heaton the scientist in charge of the us 
geological survey office in pasadena said it wasnt clear yet 
whether it broke all or part of the 50mile segment 
the epicenter of the quake was about 8 miles northeast of santa 
cruz and 75 miles south of san francisco 
the 1985 study by columbia university geology professor 
christopher scholz was among several that produced conflicting 
estimates on the likelihood and size of the quake that finally 
happened tuesday 
these studies gave various interpretations of how much stress 
inside the earth was released by the great san francisco earthquake 
of 1906 which had a magnitude of about 83 and killed at least 
2500 people 
the bigger a quake the more stress it relieves and thus the 
longer it takes for the same size quake to happen again 
scholz pointed to evidence that the 1906 quake didnt relieve as 
much stress in the santa cruz mountains as other scientists 
believed that suggested a bigger quake might happen in the san 
francisco bay area sooner than some believed 
others disagreed faced with conflicting estimates the 
geological survey issued a july 1988 report that it said 
represented a consensus on the debate 
the report said the 50mile segment had a 20 percent likelihood 
of producing a magnitude7 quake within 30 years it said the 
southernmost 20 miles of that segment had a 30 percent chance of 
generating a magnitude65 quake within 30 years 
tuesdays jolt was centered within those southernmost 20 miles 
of the fault segment 
clearly scientists had identified this segment as a 
particularly hazardous one heaton said there was some debate 
about the length of the rupture and the size of the earthquake 
the last great southern california quake in 1857 killed very 
few people in a region that was then sparsely populated 
thus most assumed that los angeles not the bay area would fall 
victim to the next seismic catastrophe the 1988 usgs report cast 
doubt on this assumption 
federal emergency officials have estimated that the next big 
one a quake like the 1906 san francisco quake could kill 
3000 to 14000 people in southern california and 3000 to 11000 
people in the bay area 
as bad as tuesdays quake was it was not a 1906 earthquake 
geological survey director dalas peck said 
the question is not whether a big earthquake is coming the 
question is when peck said

a father and son accused of helping run the 
smuggling ring cracked in the worlds largest cocaine seizure were 
ordered tuesday to return to los angeles and face charges in 
federal court 
us magistrate lawrence leavitt ruled there was a clear 
showing of probable cause that carlos tapia ponce and his son 
hector tapia anchondo were involved in the drug ring that led to 
the warehouse seizure last month of 19 tons of cocaine 
leavitts ruling came after an hourlong preliminary hearing 
during which prosecutors presented a drug enforcement 
administration agent as the only witness against the two men 
tapia ponce 68 and tapia anchondo 38 both mexicans have 
been jailed without bail since their arrest at a las vegas hotel 
sept 29 the day the cocaine and 122 million in cash was found 
in the sylmar warehouse 
dea agent william sherman who participated in the surveillance 
of the warehouse testified during the hearing that james mctague 
one of four men arrested in los angeles identified the father and 
son as the leaders of the massive cocaine distribution operation 
he claimed to have been hired by carlos tapia ponce and hector 
tapia anchondo to run the warehouse and supervise the distribution 
of the cocaine sherman said 
sherman said another suspect arrested in los angeles gilbert 
mendoza claimed he was hired by the son to drive a tractortrailer 
on cocaine runs from el paso texas to los angeles 
defense attorney david chesnoff making an unsuccessful attempt 
to get the charges dropped claimed both men have recanted their 
statements and will not testify against the tapias in their federal 
court trial 
prosecutor tom green however said the government only needed 
to establish bare bones probable cause in the hearing and had 
met its burden of proof 
tapia ponce and tapia anchondo were arrested the day the bust 
was made in los angeles while vacationing with their families at a 
las vegas hotel 
in an affidavit filed in the case a dea agent said mctague 
married to tapia anchondos sister said he had been in charge of 
the warehouse for about a year and during that time 60 tons of 
cocaine had moved through the facility 
authorities estimated the street value of the seized cocaine at 
from 2 billion to 20 billion

the cabinet minister assigned 
to promote negotiations with black leaders says hes prepared to 
meet with freed african national congress leader walter sisulu 
about the ancs possible role in talks 
if we want to get going the fewer preconditions the better 
constitutional development minister gerrit viljoen said tuesday 
he said the the outlawed guerrilla movement would have to 
demonstrate that it was committed to peaceful negotiations to 
participate in talks between blacks and the government about 
whiteblack powersharing 
but viljoen indicated that it would not necessarily have to 
formally renounce violence as previously demanded by the white 
minority government 
despite the apparent concession to guerrilla movement an anc 
official in kuala lumpur malaysia for the 49nation commonwealth 
summit called for more sanctions against south africas government 
anc foreign affairs spokesman thabo mbeki also said it is 
very important to pay attention to the question of building up 
the military capacity to conduct a sustained armed struggle not 
merely to carry out an operation once in a while however 
spectacular 
it is more important than a bomb going off here and there 
he said 
mbeki called on the commonwealth an association of britain and 
its former colonies to impose tougher sanctions africa despite the 
release sunday of sisulu and seven other longtime political 
prisoners and promises of reform by president fw de klerk 
however the rev allan boesak a founder of south africas 
antiapartheid united democratic front said he supported the idea 
of a sixmonth moratorium on further sanctions 
boesak also in malaysia said the deadline should be for the 
repeal of all discriminatory laws when parliament convenes early 
next year the laws range from regulations segregating residential 
areas to denying the vote to the black majority 
the commonwealths stand on south africa was a main issue at the 
summit which opened today 
sisulu six other african national congress leaders and a member 
of a smaller black nationalist movement were freed unconditionally 
sunday after lengthy prison terms 
the anc leaders said they still supported the principle of 
violent resistance but added that they would encourage orderly 
and disciplined antigovernment pressure 
its not because the anc believes in violence for its own 
sake it is because of compelling conditions remove the compelling 
conditions and there will be peace sisulu said tuesday in 
soweto the huge township outside johannesburg 
sisulu 77 is the highestranking of the freed activists and 
spent 26 years in prison along with his close friend senior anc 
leader nelson mandela 
sisulu said the anc would be prepared to enter negotiations if 
the government legalizes all banned political organizations lifts 
the 3yearold state of emergency and releases all political 
prisoners 
de klerk has said he is reviewing these matters to see what 
steps he might be able to take and viljoen expressed willingness 
to meet with sisulu to discuss the demands

the government appeared ready today to allow the 
release of at least three people convicted of 1974 irish terrorist 
bombings and news reports said police investigators involved in the 
cases would be prosecuted 
the home office responsible for law enforcement announced 
tuesday that it would not oppose an appeal by the socalled 
guildford four who were imprisoned 14 years ago for the two fatal 
ira bombings that targeted british soldiers 
the three man and a woman have maintained their innocence since 
being convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison news 
reports said at least three probably would be released soon after a 
court of appeal hearing thursday 
the government refused to comment on reports that police 
involved in the investigation of the case would face prosecution 
the times of london reported today without attribution a 
handful of officers who were then of relatively junior rank will 
face charges after an investigation by police into a number of 
aspects of the original inquiry 
the independent quoted unidentified parliamentary sources as 
saying two or three police officers were expected to face criminal 
proceedings for alleged corruption 
a third newspaper the guardian said the governments former 
director of public prosecutions sir norman skelhorn withheld 
crucial alibi evidence from defense lawyers at the 1975 trial 
in january home secretary douglas hurd agreed to a review by an 
appeals court following mounting pressure from the irish 
government church leaders former cabinet ministers and senior 
judges 
circumstances have recently come to the notice of the director 
of public prosecutions allan green which have caused him to 
conclude that it would be wrong for the crown to seek to sustain 
the convictions said a statement issued by greens office on 
tuesday 
paul hill gerard conlon and patrick armstrong all of belfast 
and armstrongs english girlfriend carole richardson were 
convicted of bombing two pubs in guildford southwest of london in 
oct 5 1974 five people including two soldiers were killed and 
65 injured 
armstrong and hill also were convicted of a pub bombing in the 
london suburb of woolwich on nov 6 1974 in which two people died 
and 26 were injured 
hill is serving a concurrent sentence for the murder of a former 
british soldier in belfast that conviction also in 1975 was 
based on statements obtained by belfast police while he was in 
prison in guildford 
his lawyer michael fisher said he hoped the home office will 
have the decency to release him from the belfast conviction 
the guardian quoting unidentified home office sources 
reported there is written evidence that a conscious decision was 
taken to withhold alibi witness statements from conlons 
lawyers 
in ordering the case reviewed hurd had cited possible alibi 
witnesses for two of the convicts and evidence that ms richardson 
had been injected with drugs during interrogation because she was 
suffering from withdrawal from barbiturates 
amnesty international the londonbased human rights group 
issued a statement today welcoming the governments announcement 
amnesty international said it had for years been concerned 
about the guildford convictions which were based solely on 
confessions allegedly obtained through coercion and had repeatedly 
called on the government to review the case the statement said 
all four were convicted on the basis of incriminating statements 
they repudiated at trial 
four members of an irish republican army unit confessed to the 
guildford pub bombings after their arrest in december 1975 but 
they were never charged in dublin the irish government welcomed 
the decision in the most positive terms cardinal basil hume 
head of the roman catholic church in england and wales told 
british broadcasting corp television he was immensely grateful 
for the decision 
but gerry adams president of sinn fein the outlawed iras 
legal political wing told 500 supporters at hackney in east london 
tuesday night we dont thank the british government theyve 
only done what they should have done 14 years ago 
the almost exclusively catholic ira is fighting to push the 
british out of protestantdominated northern ireland and join it 
with the republic of ireland

california gov george deukmejian 
said today he was very surprised by the extent of highway 
damage caused by the devastating earthquake in his state and 
promised a probe into why roads failed 
deukmejian said he had not spoken with president bush but that 
state officials would ask bush to declare a federal emergency for 
the stricken area in and around san francisco 
california has a prudent reserve of 1 billion that we can 
use and that we will use to help recover from tuesdays temblor 
deukmejian during a hastily called news conference at a 
frankfurt hotel also warned of the possibility of gas line 
explosions and said he had heard of very minor incidents of 
looting 
the governor looking somber and tired later broke off his 
trade mission to west germany and rushed back to california to 
supervise rescue and reconstruction efforts 
jim robinson the governors spokesman said that deukmejian had 
left frankfurt on a flight that originally was to arrive at san 
francisco airport robinson said that the airplane would be 
diverted most likely to los angeles if it is not possible to land 
in san francisco due to the earthquake 
he told the associated press that wherever deukmejian lands he 
would immediately board a waiting us military aircraft and be 
taken for an inspection of the damaged areas 
we will have to have the maximum use of equipment the 
necessary kind of equipment to assist in the rescue and the 
restoration and of course personnel said deukmejian 
to the extent the federal government can make that available 
either through the military or the corp of engineers or other 
agencies all that will be welcomed and im sure will be needed 
the governor said the number of confirmed deaths was 
approximately 70 people 
however the state office of emergency services said at least 
200 people were crushed to death in their cars when a 
halfmilelong section of the upper level of interstate 880 in 
oakland collapsed onto the lower level other deaths also were 
reported 
in addition a section of the san franciscooakland bay bridges 
top deck collapsed onto the lower deck and police said at least two 
bridges in the santa cruz area collapsed 
i had been under the impression that the highways had been 
constructed to deal with any severe earthquake deukmejian told 
reporters and i am very surprised to see what has happened with 
some of those 
i think that we are going to have to have some inquiry with 
respect to that to determine why they did not withstand a quake of 
the severity of this one he said 
deukmejian said the state was primarily responsible for ensuring 
that californias highways can withstand quake damage 
he declined to comment on damage to buildings saying he did not 
have details about which ones were affected or when they were built 
there is of course massive destruction he said and 
were not going to know for a long time yet what the full extent of 
it is 
the governor said utility companies were working vigorously 
to restore electricity to stricken areas 
he said emergency teams also anticipate there will be gas 
explosions and the like 
he noted that various emergency agencies had planned and 
practiced for the possibility of such a disaster the medical 
facilities seem to be working quite well 
deukmejian said the national guard was involved in emergency 
efforts but denied what he called television reports that the 
guard had been brought in specially to assist in quelling 
rioting 
jim robinson deukmejians chief of public affairs said the 
governor would leave frankfurt later in the morning on a nonstop 
lufthansa flight for california robinson said that deukmejian 
would arrive in los angeles if it were impossible to land in san 
francisco

to the san francisco area were diverted or canceled because of the 
earthquake 
the delays and cancellations affected travelers as far away as 
japan which has direct air service to san francisco and some 
passengers landed far from their destinations 
the quake stranded more than 800 travelers at ohare 
international airport in chicago where crowds huddled around tv 
sets tuesday night watching news reports about the quake 
most of the ones who were trying to get back to their families 
were pretty distressed said racquel obryant spokeswoman at the 
holiday inn ohare where more than 100 stranded travelers stayed 
a lot of people were calling for their families but there was 
just no way to get through the phone lines were open only for 
emergencies 
san francisco international airport and oakland airport remained 
closed early today san jose international airport was open with 
only minor damage officials said 
united airlines had at least 30 flights canceled or diverted 
because of the earthquake as of tuesday night said spokesman joe 
hopkins in chicago he said san francisco is a major hub for 
united with about 140 arrivals and 140 departures every day 
al becker a chicagobased spokesman for american airlines said 
several hundred of the airlines flights had been affected by the 
disaster

hundreds of small earthquake aftershocks were 
continuing along the san andreas fault where tuesdays tremor 
struck northern california government scientists said today 
we are looking for any unusual characteristics and will be 
putting out more portable instruments to measure the aftershocks 
said dave russ assistant chief geologist for the us geological 
survey 
an earthquake of this size will typically by followed by many 
thousands of aftershocks in the weeks to come a usgs statement 
said california still faces the danger of large tremors as well 
said russ 
this certainly was not the big one he said referring to 
a major quake that has long been feared for california the 
anticipated big quake would be expected to read at 80 or more on 
the richter scale while tuesdays quake is being estimated at 69 
the temblor was centered between los gatos and san juan 
bautista an area south of san francisco where scientists said in a 
report last year was among three regions where dangerous tremors 
were likely 
a serious shock of magnitude 70 or more is still a possibility 
along the nearby hayward fault russ said and he said the 
continuing chance of a quake of magnitude 80 or more in southern 
california has us very worried 
russ explained that when an earthquake occurs it releases 
stress in the ground that action however can increase the stress 
in nearby areas resulting in many aftershocks that follow major 
earthquakes 
earthquakes result from the movements of plates deep within the 
earth russ said these plates can move fairly easily at depths of 
six miles or more because the heat and pressure cause the rocks to 
become like plastic so they can slip past one another 
closer to the earths surface however the rocks are more rigid 
and stick together causing strain to build up until it is released 
in an earthquake 
in california the boundary between the pacific plate that 
underlies that ocean and the north american plate forms a series of 
faults running north and south through the state these plates move 
in different directions at a rate of about two centimeters which 
is nearly an inch a year 
the major and best known fault is the san andreas which 
consists of a series of segments that russ said do not all move 
together thus there can be an earthquake in one area without 
necessarily causing a tremor in another part of the fault 
the region where tuesdays quake was centered had been 
relatively quiet in recent years until 1988 a strong quake rated 
at 51 on the richter scale occurred in june 1988 and a second 
rated 52 occurred in august of this year 
such quakes can indicate that a larger one will follow russ 
said 
scientists had rated the probability of a severe quake in this 
region at about 30 percent he said 
by comparison the geologist said some studies have indicated a 
60 percent chance of a severe quake in the los angeles region some 
time in the next 30 years

thatcher told a summit meeting of the 49nation commonwealth today 
that imposing sanctions on south africa would be utterly 
irresponsible her aides said 
mrs thatcher said south african president fw de klerk had 
made a major step forward by releasing eight black nationalist 
leaders allowing peaceful demonstrations and being willing to 
consult all shades of opinion 
we are most likely to achieve our aim by giving encouragement 
not by trying to behave as if nothing significant had happened 
an aide who asked not to be identified quoted her as saying 
mrs thatcher the sole opponent in the commonwealth of 
sanctions against south africa spoke during a closed session soon 
shortly after the weeklong biennial summit opened 
her aide said the prime minister thought sanctions at this 
stage would be utterly irresponsible 
gongs cymbals and malaysian dancers greeted the leaders of the 
association of britain and its former colonies as they filed into 
kuala lumpurs putra world trade center 
in another development the commonwealth leaders elected chief 
emeka anyaoku of nigeria as the new secretarygeneral over former 
australian prime minister malcolm fraser malayasian prime minister 
mahathir mohamad the summit host refused to disclose the voting 
breakdown after what had been a closely fought contest 
anyaoku 56 has been deputy secretarygeneral at the 
commonwealth secretariat in london since 1975 he will replace 
guyuanan sir shridath ramphal whose third fiveyear term expires 
next june 
earlier in opening speeches before the summit went into closed 
session mahathir called for stronger sanctions against south 
africa while canadas prime minister mulroney urged the 
maintenance of existing measures 
the opening speeches reflected differences on whether to press 
for tougher sanctions against south africa now or give de klerk 
six months to implement promised reforms 
british officials said mrs thatcher will oppose any move to set 
a sixmonth deadline as well as any tougher measures 
debates on the deterioration of the global environment and 
international drug trafficking were also scheduled to dominate the 
informal agenda mahathir in a speech blamed developed countries 
for the worlds environmental problems on the developing countries 
pakistan returned to the commonwealth this month after a 17year 
absence and prime minister benazir bhutto headed the delegation

a woman who claims her 12yearold daughter was 
kidnapped as an infant and a baby sitter who says the mother gave 
the child to her because she couldnt care for her are locked in a 
legal battle over the seventhgrader 
juvenile court judge orrelle weeks ruled tuesday that temporary 
custody of the girl be given to maxine mccaslin 43 who has raised 
the child since she was 6 months old a hearing on permanent 
custody was not immediately scheduled 
until friday the girl was unaware that mccaslin was not her 
biological mother that day cynthia anderson 31 was in a 
supermarket when she heard the voice of mccaslin who used to work 
for her as a baby sitter anderson had not seen mccaslin since 
1977 when she said the sitter and andersons daughter vanished 
anderson got mccaslins license number and notified police 
detective mona jaramillo said the women had lived just 17 blocks 
apart for the last two years 
its a very sticky situation said police sgt gordon reed 
theres always two sides to every story 
anderson has charged that police mishandled the case and failed 
to investigate abduction charges she filed at the time of the 
disappearance 
i will fight this i will anderson said they can believe 
it and if they think theyre going to wear me out they can think 
again 
police said tuesday that anderson did not report her child 
missing until six weeks after mccaslin allegedly disappeared with 
her daughter the report she filed was for a violation of custody 
not kidnapping officials said 
mccaslin told police that anderson asked her to care for the 
child because anderson could not 
it was hell keeping the secret police quoted mccaslin as 
saying she had an unlisted telephone number and could not be 
reached for comment 
all supplemental reports and investigative reports if there was 
an investigation have been destroyed police said they are forced 
to rely on officers memories 
the rocky mountain news quoted sources close to the 
investigation who said that at the time her child disappeared 
anderson was working as a dancer at a strip joint or as an employee 
in a nearby adult arcade 
when she said her baby sitter had taken her child the officer 
thought i was overreacting anderson said tuesday he said i 
couldnt just accuse someone of a felony 
he said i had to wait a legal amount of time and file a 
missing person report i went back and signed a piece of paper that 
said she was kidnapped they said they put out an arrest warrant 
denver police never put out a warrant they filed the case as a 
custody dispute 
mccaslin told the girl of her history after both were taken to 
police headquarters friday night police said no charges were 
filed 
we are not sure whether we will file criminal charges against 
mccaslin at this point said capt jim fitzpatrick the main 
person we and the courts are concerned about at this point is the 
victim 
police said the girl had been well treated and was raised in an 
excellent environment neighbors and school officials said the girl 
is a welladjusted seventhgrader a bplus student and a 
volleyball player at a private school 
jaramillo said police were unable to comment on mccaslins 
whereabouts until two years ago because it is part of the 
investigation there also was no information immediately available 
about the girls father 
andersons lawyer dennis blewitt said his client was an unwed 
mother who was kicked out of her home as a teenager although 
she is unemployed and not married she received an insurance 
settlement after an accident and is financially capable of caring 
for her daughter he said 
blewitt said the city department of social services which took 
custody of the child over the weekend refused to let his client 
see her daughter tuesday

air said greg higgins who was driving near santa cruz close to 
the quakes epicenter when it struck it was complete 
pandemonium

through a darkened san francisco headlights and an occasional 
office building running on emergency generators stood out buses 
were jammed and traffic was backed up

before being brought under control 
up to 20 people were hurt in the fire officials said

an entire block estimated by agnos to be 12 buildings the fire 
apparently was caused by a natural gas leak agnos said

santa cruz county including three crushed in collapsing buildings 
one san jose resident suffered a heart attack during the quake 
and died 
willis jacobs of the earthquake center said the quake was

a pharmaceuticals executive was fined 150000 
and placed on 18 months probation for bribing a food and drug 
administration chemist in a generic drug scam 
ashok patel 49 of upper saddle river nj was also sentenced 
tuesday a year of community service 
the former senior vice president of par pharmaceuticals of 
spring valley ny pleaded guilty in july to paying a 500 
gratuity to fda chemist david brancato 
prosecutors said patel paid brancato a total of 1600 to 
influence fda approval of par generic drugs he was also accused of 
paying 2900 to charles chang brancatos boss in the fda generic 
drug division 
generic drugs are the chemical equivalents of brandname drugs 
the rush by generic companies to get approval from the fda for 
their cheaper products has created a lucrative market susceptible 
to corruption investigators said 
authorities are investigating allegations that fda chemists 
accepted cash for inside information and favorable treatment of 
drug applications 
earlier this month chang was fined 10000 ordered to spend a 
year in a workrelease program and perform 1000 hours of community 
service brancato is to be sentenced wednesday 
the investigation so far has resulted in guilty pleas from three 
generic drug company officials three fda chemists and two 
pharmaceutical companies

a new drug that prevents and even reverses 
rejection of transplanted organs is 50 to 100 times more powerful 
than medication now used and is also less toxic a leading 
transplant surgeon said today 
its a marvelous drug said dr thomas e starzl of the 
university of pittsburgh who headed the team responsible for its 
development its the best drug that has been put out to this 
time 
the drug fk506 appears to be an eventual replacement for 
cyclosporine the major antirejection drug now being used he 
said it may also lower transplantation costs and prove useful in 
treating other disorders 
the biggest bonus is better survival starzl said in a 
telephone interview this morning 
dr robert corry president of the united network for organ 
sharing said he has not yet reviewed the findings but has every 
reason to believe that dr starzl is correct 
he certainly has made enormous contributions and this may be 
yet another one that hes done corry said 
starzl performed the worlds first liver transplant in 1963 and 
pioneered the use of cyclosporine in the early 1980s he first 
tried fk506 on a patient in february 
starzl and other university of pittsburgh doctors have since 
administered the drug to 111 patients including a few children 
the liver heart kidney pancreas and lung recipients were 
given fk506 after cyclosporine failed to work as intended or their 
transplanted organs had failed starzl said 
the new drug has been used on humans for only eight months 
making it difficult to predict the drugs longterm side effects 
starzl said so far though it has not caused kidney failure the 
leading side effect of cyclosporine 
researchers assume that fk506 like other antirejection drugs 
will increase patients risk of getting cancer that risk however 
probably will be not enough to cancel the effect and usefulness 
of this drug starzl said 
fk506 also has reduced the need for steroids normally 
administered with cyclosporine to help prevent rejection said 
starzl 
seventyfive to 80 percent of all patients receiving new livers 
in pittsburgh the worlds leading transplant center have properly 
functioning organs a year after surgery he said the success rate 
could climb to nearly 100 percent with fk506 he said 
starzl plans to present his findings later this month in 
barcelona spain 
a record 1680 liver transplants were performed in the united 
states among 12798 organ transplants last year according to the 
united network for organ sharing 
as of monday 18453 people were awaiting organ transplants in 
the united states the network said 
starzl said there is no reason for the time being for a patient 
to switch to fk506 if cyclosporine is not producing serious 
problems 
the new york times reported today that some scientists believe 
the apparent success of the drug derived from a fungus found in 
japan could worsen the already high shortage of donor organs 
because it would greatly increase the number of successful 
transplants 
starzl discounted that notion 
theoretically it should improve the donor supply in that 
people might be more accepting of transplantation with much better 
results corry said 
increased success rates mean fewer patients will require 
additional transplants starzl said twenty percent of pittsburghs 
liver transplant patients need another transplant within 60 days of 
surgery he said 
starzl said fk506 also will likely reduce the cost of liver 
transplants which exceeds 100000 by as much as onethird 
because of speedier recovery and less need for blood tests to 
monitor the drugs effectiveness 
starzls team plans wider use of the drug to treat disorders 
that impair the immune system and affect the skin eyes bowel 
kidney and brain the times said 
the university of pittsburgh is the only center with government 
approval to test the drug manufactured by fujisawa pharmaceutical 
company ltd of osaka japan 
dr gregory p burk of the food and drug administration told the 
times that the agency has encouraged starzl to submit patient 
records and other data for examination so it can determine whether 
to move quickly to allow other doctors to use the drug

richard nixon and 22200 for the widow of lyndon johnson 
each presidents annual pension is 99500 their other expenses 
vary

protecting the former chief executives the secret service is 
expected to spend 125 million this year to provide security to 
the former presidents and their families 
there was no separate vote on the money for the former 
presidents but at one point rep paul kanjorski dpa complained 
about the costs singling out reagans plans to travel to japan 
shortly to reportedly deliver a pair of speeches for a 2 million 
fee he said it was an unmitigated atrocity for reagan to make 
such a trip with the help of taxpayers money 
this congress should examine whether we are too great in our 
largesse in providing services and costs to former presidents who 
engage in personal income endeavors he said 
the money was included in an 184 billion spending bill for the 
treasury department postal service and several smaller agencies 
for fiscal 1990 which began oct 1

the cia weary of student protests will 
no longer hold job interviews at middlebury college a cia

i will not come back on campus to do any more recruiting i 
promise you that brian p peters chief of the agencys new 
england recruitment center told 15 students tuesday who staged a 
twohour sitin at middleburys placement office 
more than 50 students faculty members and townspeople 
demonstrated outside 
to end the sitin peters one of two recruiters conducting 
interviews signed a paper drafted by the protesters agreeing he 
will not initiate interviews at the 1600student school 
i cant be speaking for the entire agency he added we 
could have a change of command tomorrow but peters said he would 
be in charge of recruiting in new england for three more years and 
would abide by the agreement 
middlebury officials say they will now have to decide to what 
extent the colleges career counseling service will continue to 
help students who want to interview with the cia 
the student protesters were demanding that the counseling office 
not act as a liaison between interested seniors and the cia 
its a fairly legitimate employment option for our students

students karl lindholm said of the anitcia protest 
the protesters criticized the agencys policy of not hiring

the soviet union has boosted military aid to 
afghanistan prolonging the bloody civil war in that country 
members of congress said today 
the soviets this month increased the amount of arms in daily air 
cargo shipments to the afghan capital of kabul and are sending scud 
missiles that are being fired against guerrilla positions by 300 
red army advisers rep don ritter rpa told a news conference 
ritter estimated soviet arms deliveries to kabul at 400 million 
in october the previous level was estimated by government 
officials at between 250 million and 300 million a month 
us military aid to afghanistans mujahedeen guerrillas has 
been running at 550 million to 600 million per year according to 
congressional sources the exact level of the covert american 
program is classified 
the afghan and soviet governments boosted the proportion of 
weapons in air cargo sent to kabul from about twothirds of the 
daily volume to about threequarters ritter said 
secretary of state james a baker iii said on monday that an 
earlier boost in soviet arms deliveries had prolonged the fighting 
these disturbing actions this seeming preference for military 
solutions may work in the short run to keep a najibullah in 
power baker in the long run however only political 
solutions can settle these conflicts 
one administration analyst however said calculating the exact 
tonnage and value of soviet arms shipments to kabul was very 
uncertain and stressed the mujahedeen also were beset by internal 
rivalries and disorganization 
the increase in soviet arms shipments and problems among the 
guerrillas have prompted the united states to find new arms routes 
to the mujahedeen say congressional and administration sources 
the cia working through pakistani intelligence is sending 
fewer arms through seven resistance parties based in peshawar 
pakistan and channeling them instead to guerrilla commanders who 
control the countryside and who increasingly are thought to hold 
the key to afghanistans future according to the sources 
neither the exile afghan interim government formed last 
february when the soviets withdrew nor the guerrilla commanders 
have shown inclination to compromise with najibullah forces loyal 
to najibullah remain entrenched in kabul and other major cities 
and the battlelines have shifted little since the red army left 
us arms shipments slowed to a trickle at the beginning of the 
fighting season last summer say administration congressional and 
afghan sources although that point is in dispute 
some arms shipments were disrupted last summer because of the 
turmoil in china which sends arms by rail to pakistan for 
distribution to the mujahedeen according to a report released oct 
1 by the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee sen 
claiborne pell dri

the nations poverty rate was 131 percent 
last year about the same as in 1987 the census bureau reported 
today that means 319 million americans were living in poverty in 
1988 
in 1987 about 323 million people or 134 percent of the 
population were living in poverty the census bureau said the 
changes between 1987 and 1988 were not statistically significant 
the census bureau also reported that americans median household 
income was 27230 in 1988 up from 27140 a year earlier after 
adjusting for the rise in consumer prices again the change was 
not considered significant 
per capita income meanwhile rose 17 percent to an alltime 
high of 13120 in 1988 a change that was considered significant 
its a year basically in which most groups stayed the same or 
improved said william butz associate director for demographics 
at the census bureau 
the report said the nations poverty rate for whites declined by 
03 percentage point last year to 101 percent the poverty rate 
for blacks was 316 percent down from 326 percent in 1987 and 
the rate for hispanics dipped to 268 percent from 281 percent 
none of those changes was considered significant 
regionally the only statistically significant change in the 
poverty rate occurred in the midwest where the rate dropped from 
125 percent in 1987 to 115 percent last year the poverty rate in 
the south was 162 percent in 1988 up from 161 percent a year 
earlier in the west the rate was 127 percent up from 125 
percent and in the northeast the rate was 102 percent down from 
109 percent 
todays report on poverty in 1988 was prepared by the census 
bureau based on a survey of about 58000 us households last march 
while debate rages over the cost and adequacy of programs to 
fight poverty battles also continue over defining and counting it 
advocates for the poor insist the formal definition 
underestimates the problem because it doesnt really reflect their 
spending habits 
but other researchers contend the measurement may overestimate 
poverty because it only considers peoples cash income and not 
government assistance 
the official definition of poverty was developed by the social 
security administration in 1964 based on department of agriculture 
research on what people spend on food 
agriculture analysts had calculated that people spent about 
onethird of their income to eat and developed a variety of plans 
to provide adequate nutrition at high middle and low cost levels 
the definition of poverty was then set at three times the cost 
of the lowest price food program known as the thrifty food plan 
adjusted annually for inflation the poverty threshold has risen 
from about 3000 per year in the early 1960s to nearly 12000 
today for a family of four the poverty level varies slightly for 
urban and rural residents and rises with the size of family many 
assistance programs kick in at 125 percent of the poverty rate 
in recent years advocates for the poor have challenged the 
definition of poverty contending the cost of living has changed 
over the years the rising cost of housing has been a particular 
problem they say leaving the poor with less than in the past for 
food and other necessities 
with food now a smaller share of the minimum cost of living the 
poverty rate underestimates the number of poor they contend 
in addition the annual poverty estimates do not include the 
growing army of homeless people although most would certainly 
qualify as poor 
but economists at the commerce department say poverty may be 
overestimated because the definition doesnt include government 
benefits 
assistance programs such as food stamps subsidized housing and 
medical assistance help people defray their cost of living these 
statisticians say but are not considered when poverty is 
calculated 
the annual reports in recent years have included supplements 
showing somewhat lower poverty rates if the value of benefits is 
considered although debate continues on how to calculate the worth 
of some programs

the first question to ask about fridays sudden market panic 
isnt why it happened when it did but why it didnt happen sooner 
the economy is awash in debt making everyone constantly uneasy 
virtually any bad news can cause a selloff friday was simply an 
accident waiting to happen and though monday didnt bring more of 
the same as many investors feared the bulls have hardly run the 
bears out of town 
there are two messages in this one urgent the other only 
slightly less so 
the first is the need to improve regulation of the securities 
markets to prevent a panic from getting out of hand some measures 
have been taken since the great plunge of 87 but not nearly 
enough 
the second imperative the indebtedness of business government 
and the nation must finally be reduced

the times trenton nj on states filling a policy vacuum 
recently the federal government has displayed a new kind of 
usefulness it allows the states to lead when a policy vacuum 
exists at the federal level 
california the state most plagued by autocreated air polution 
required refiners to change the mix of gasoline ingredients to 
inhibit evaporation of unburned fuel acting on californias 
example new jersey new york and the six new england states 
jointly decided last year to do the same this spring the us 
environmental protection agency said it would implement the 
requirement on a national basis 
the pattern now seems to be repeating itself in regard to 
antipollution equipment on automobiles 
the states are leading because the reagan administration beat a 
retreat on cleanair policy and the bush administration has acted 
only tentatively to reverse it unless there is bolder federal 
action on other environmental problems many more such national 
campaigns will be born in the state capitals

if more evidence were needed that president bush is lagging 
behind americans strong support for stricter clean air rules a 
house subcommittee has provided it by agreeing to extend 
californias tough auto emissions standards to the rest of the 
nation by 1996 
the house should regard the amended auto emissions measure as a 
minimum standard bipartisan support already has emerged in the 
senate for even tougher antismog rules the senate version is in 
fact better than its counterpart in the house 
the final legislative package due on the presidents desk by 
jan 1 ought to reflect americans growing demand for cleaner air 
and their willingness to pay reasonably higher costs to achieve it

argus leader sioux falls sd on flagburning 
considering the social and budgetary problems confronting the 
nation one would think that president bush and members of congress 
would be too busy to waste time on the nonexistent problem of 
flagburning 
think again 
its been almost four months since the us supreme court struck 
down flagdesecration laws in 48 states plus a federal statute 
 
there has not been a rash of flag burnings since the june 21 
ruling there has been some criticism of the decision but 
overall many americans seem to be coming to the understanding that 
launching a legal attack on freedom of expression is an even 
greater danger than flag desecration 
rather than waste any more time on the flag issue congress 
ought to recognize that the right to dissent is essential to 
freedom trying to protect the flag with questionable laws and 
longshot amendments weakens rather than strengthens the freedoms 
the flag symbolizes

the saginaw mich news on education in united states 
just before the gallup poll turned up the latest evidence that 
american education fails to educate americans the new york times 
published a pained account by a fiftyish journalist appalled at the 
vacant minds of her juniors 
she told of a reporter working on a music story who interviewed 
pierre boulez a famed composer and conductor without the 
slightest inkling of his background 
she mentioned a radio producer who could not identify a 
campy piece of theme music the names of singer dinah shore and 
songwriter jerome kern meant nothing 
well not everyone is going to keep in mind every factoid but 
when young professionals know so little about their own field 
there should be no surprise when the gallup poll reports that a 
fourth of students draw a blank on the date 1492 or that 42 
percent cannot come within a halfcentury of placing the civil war 
 
the remedy is as simple as a new classroom focus elementary 
facts first then creativity that would cost little compared to 
the longterm price of sending educated fools out into the world

lawmakers in parliament today were denied the 
chance to defend a daring editor who had been rebuked by president 
mikhail s gorbachev and is in danger of being fired one of the 
parliamentarians said 
it was the second time the group of lawmakers was kept from 
speaking in the supreme soviet legislature nikolai a kutsenko a 
deputy from the ukraine said the group will submit a petition 
signed by 34 legislators accusing gorbachev of using pressure 
tactics that contradict his own reforms 
also today communist lawmaker boris n yeltsin accused 
gorbachev of masterminding a campaign to purge him from politics 
the 58yearold yeltsin who was ousted as moscows communist 
party boss in 1987 but staged a spectacular comeback by winning a 
seat in this springs legislative elections made the claim in a 
printed statement 
on monday interior minister vadim bakatin told the supreme 
soviet of an investigation into yeltsins report of an attack on 
his life bakatin said police found the charge to be unfounded and 
yeltsin replied on the floor of the legislature that the affair 
stemmed from a joke he made to a policeman 
the strange encounter was carried on the national evening news 
program vremya yeltsin accused gorbachev of making a new 
attempt to ruin my health and knock me out of the sphere of 
political struggle 
meanwhile kutsenko said leaders of the supreme soviet 
legislature decided not to permit the defense of vladislav a 
starkov editor of the weekly arguments and facts to be raised at 
the legislature because they considered it an affair of the 
communist party rather than the government 
the tabloid was responsible for several sensational stories in 
the past year including the first soviet disclosure that dictator 
josef stalin imprisoned or killed as many as 40 million people it 
was also the first soviet publication to print excerpts of the 
memoirs of nikita s khrushchev 
kutsenko said he wanted to speak at this mornings session of 
the legislature but was told he could not have the floor by 
gorbachevs handpicked vice president anatoly i lukyanov and 
the chairmen of the bicameral legislatures two houses rafik n 
nishanov and yevgeny m primakov 
the petition kutsenko hoped to read on the floor of the 
legislature accuses gorbachev of trying to discredit the weekly he 
tried to be recognized at tuesdays evening session but was denied 
the floor by lukyanov 
gorbachev lashed out at selected soviet editors at a closeddoor 
communist party meeting friday in an apparent attempt to regain a 
measure of control over the press which has been carrying daily 
reports critical of the soviet system and occasionally of its 
leaders 
the journalists quoting their bosses who attended and asking 
not to be identified said gorbachev accused starkov and other 
editors of seeking his political downfall when the nation is torn 
by economic crisis and ethnic strife 
one journalist said gorbachev likened the situation in the 
country to a lake of gasoline that could be set afire by a single 
match 
soviet journalists said chief party ideologist vadim a medvedev 
has told starkov he must resign and offered him a post at the state 
publishing committee but that starkov intended to fight to keep 
his job 
human rights activist andrei d sakharov called today for 
journalists around the world to stand up for starkov 
i call on journalists of the world to defend him sakharov 
the 1975 nobel peace prize laureate told the associated press in 
an interview outside the supreme soviet hall 
sakharov also called on the supreme soviet today to strip the 
communist party of its constitutional monopoly on power calling it 
an anachronism most lawmakers appeared to dismiss the idea 
known for critical and poignant articles written in plain 
language the weekly arguments and facts is the countrys most 
widely read newspaper with a circulation of 26 million 
the tabloid recently calculated that according to readers mail 
sakharov was more popular than gorbachev or any other member of the 
soviet congress of peoples deputies

the sun bremerton wash on childcare 
after months of wrangling the house and senate are close to 
agreeing on a childcare bill already its clear that the 
legislation will be inferior to president bushs original proposal 
he should veto it 
during his presidential campaign last year bush stressed his 
commitment to provide some form of relief for families with working 
parents and rightly so the need for day care is among the 
nations fastest growing concerns 
cost estimates for the democratic plans range from 103 billion 
to 22 billion over the next five years they target not just the 
poor but also families who make as much as 100 percent of their 
states median family income 
while some tax credits the heart of bushs plan are 
included the bulk of the money will go toward block grants to 
subsidize institutional childcare facilities and attached to 
those federal funds is a raft of regulations along with the 
bureacracy to make sure theyre followed to the letter 
the white house has already labeled the final childcare bill 
whatever its precise form a veto candidate now the president 
should follow through and then tell congress to take another look 
at his own perfectly sound proposal

the observer la grande ore on summits 
weve had arms control summits and economic summits recently we 
had an education summit now president bush is planning to attend a 
drug summit in latin america 
summits are mostly useless ceremonial exercises that result in 
nothing more substantial than a considerable burnishing of the 
participants public images 
the recent education summit resulted in nothing more than a 
resolution to appoint a study panel to set goals for education in 
america 
what is needed is grassroots support for real improvements and 
its difficult to see how the summitappointed study panel will 
help 
it is likewise difficult to imagine what sort of substantial 
action could result from the planned drug summit

bush administration officials seem to take criticism of their 
performance during the failed panamanian coup as a challenge to 
prove they are not wimps but they must not lose sight of what is 
really at stake in panama 
president bush repeated at a friday press conference his desire 
to see noriega ousted insisting that he did not mean to imply 
carte blanche support to a future coup attempt the president 
added i wouldnt mind force if it could be done in a prudent 
manner 
apart from being unclear the statement was unwise 
but with the widespread opposition of his own people noriega 
will fall in time until then the only way he can survive 
politically is to pose as a nationalist standing up to yanqui 
intervention

intervention as embarrassing and damaging 
they wanted to give the impression at least that the coup was 
the work of patriotic panamanians not of a cadre of officers 
carrying out orders from washington 
the question that members of congress should be asking 
themselves is whether the american people want military 
intervention in panama so far the polls indicate that a majority

egon krenz who cautiously fashioned his career by 
closely following erich honecker has replaced his mentor as the 
new east german leader 
the staterun news agency adn announced today that the 
52yearold krenz would succeed honecker as head of the communist 
party and head of state honecker had come under increasing fire at 
home as opposition mounts and a refugee exodus continues 
krenz is by far the youngest official on the 21member politburo 
dominated by aging communists many of them in their 70s but he 
has a reputation for following honeckers hardline stance 
a burly bushyhaired man krenz for long has been plagued by 
rumors he was an alcoholic although there has been virtually 
nothing to substantiate that 
he is known for his spontaneous visits to local bars and 
restaurants that are the bane of his bodyguards 
krenz was born the son of a tailor in kolberg a coastal town in 
what is now northwestern poland on march 19 1937 
he joined the fdj communist youth organization in 1953 while he 
was still in high school and east germany was only four years old 
krenz studied to be a teacher but joined the east german army 
and rose to the rank of lieutenant before being discharged in 1959 
after studying in moscow from 1964 to 1967 krenz returned to 
become a leading official of the communist youth organization in 
east germany 
he has been a member of the communist partys central committee 
since 1973 and joined the ruling politburo 10 years later 
in recent years he has been in charge of the communist youth 
organizations and internal security officials while many 
acknowledged he was being groomed to take over from honecker 
krenz lives in a heavily guarded compound reserved for 
highranking communist party officials at lake wandlitz about nine 
miles north of berlin 
he has long mirrored honeckers line on various issues for 
example repeating the longheld assertion that the allegedly 
imperialist west poses a threat to communist east germany 
west germanys bild am sonntag newspaper in a profile on oct 
8 said that krenz is married and has two children

parliament today overwhelmingly 
approved constitutional amendments that are to transform communist 
hungary into a multiparty democracy 
among the 94 changes passed by the 380member parliament were 
amendments eliminating all references to the leading role of the 
newly dissolved communist party justice minister kalman kulcsar 
said they effectively end oneparty rule in the east bloc nation 
the countrys formal name also was changed from peoples 
republic of hungary to republic of hungary to reflect a break with 
the communist past 
another change in the 1949 constitution abolishes the 21person 
collective presidency and replaces it with the office of the 
president 
the powers of president who also is commanderinchief of the 
armed forces and wields other authority will be temporarily 
assumed by parliament speaker matyas szueros until democratic 
elections are held next year 
one amendment states that political parties may be freely 
established and may freely function providing that they respect the 
constitution and the laws 
another declares that the leading role of the marxistleninist 
party of the working class has been outdated instead the 
necessary legal framework of a multiparty system must be stated 
the historic voting came on the heels of another landmark 
decision the dissolution last week of the communist party and its 
replacement by the hungarian socialist party 
unlike its monolithic marxistleninist predecessor the new 
party created last week professes commitment to multiparty 
democracy and market forces in the economy 
the moves are the latest in hungarys dizzying moves in the past 
year to break with its socialist past by establishing democratic 
economic and social reforms and improve ties to the west like 
poland hungarys rush to reform has created friction with 
hardline warsaw pact allies 
oneparty rule continues at least temporarily despite 
termination of the communist party its successor continues to 
dominate politics pending the nations first national multiparty 
elections in 41 years 
todays session also revealed differences on a key aspect of the 
countrys democratic strivings when and how to choose the 
nations president 
the government wants the election this year but opposition 
parties seek a postponement asserting they have no time or 
resources to organize against socialist party candidate imre 
pozsgay 
the opposition league of free democrats called for a plebiscite 
on a postponement and they want parliament to elect the president 
after a new legislature is chosen 
legislators today overwhelmingly approved a suggestion by 
premier miklos nemeth that parliament should not put the referendum 
issue to the vote but that separate committees deal with the topic 
later 
parliamentary elections to be scheduled by june would be the 
first instance of free multiparty voting on the national level 
since the communists consolidated power in 1948

toilet paper abandoned production of it wednesday with a ceremonial 
final flush down an 1890 toilet at londons science museum 
todays consumers simply prefer a softer option said david 
driver de valle general marketing manager of british tissues

as bronco after a major customer british rail switched to softer 
tissues for train bathrooms last year 
ron day former managing director of bronco carried out the 
final flushing of the last sheet of paper at the science museum 
another brand of hard toilet paper izal is still available 
soft tissue arrived from the united states in the 1930s but 
wartime rationing halted imports to britain so the rougher brands 
survived but customers over the years began opting for the softer 
tissue 
de valle said the brand name bronco will survive but he refused 
to reveal details of the new product we couldnt let a name as 
famous as bronco die out after 100 years he said

only about one in five california 
homeowners has earthquake insurance because of its high cost but 
insurers today said they expect more than 1 billion in claims from 
northern california 
the footage from television looks very serious a quake like 
this could wipe out an insurance company said david crocker 
area manager for western insurance information service in tustin 
i think it will be very bad said michael hesketh a 
director of the london investment firm warburg securities there 
are going to be some losses and certainly in excess of the 1 
billion figure we had suggested by the industry this morning 
tuesdays quake cut a swath of devastation through the san 
francisco bay area destroying buildings and bridges and sparking a 
fire that destroyed a square block in san francisco more than 270 
people were killed and hundreds more were injured 
the area is more densely populated than the whittier area of los 
angeles county that suffered a quake in october 1987 that 
registered 59 on the richter scale 
that means insurers will likely wind up with a bigger bill than 
the 350 million paid out for that quake crocker said 
insurance companies are required to offer quake coverage to 
customers buying comprehensive home coverage in san francisco but 
only about 20 percent of california homeowners have earthquake 
insurance crocker said 
earthquake insurance is expensive and homeowners often face a 10 
percent deductible 
farmers insurance group charges 2 per 1000 of value for 
earthquake coverage meaning that to insure a 100000 home an 
owner would pay 200 a year said company spokesman jeffrey beyer 
in los angeles 
the earthquake comes at a particularly bad time for insurers 
just three weeks after hurricane hugo caused about 4 billion in 
damage in south carolina 
the twin disasters will certainly have an impact on the 
industry said pat mihm senior vice president for claims at 
transamerica insurance group i cant recall anything like this 
in the last 15 or 20 years 
early indications were that the damage wouldnt be as bad as the 
damage caused by hugo said a spokesman for lloyds of london who 
requested anonymity he said it would take weeks to assess the 
damage in california 
information suggests that the cost to insurers quite serious 
as it is might not be too bad he said its not the big quake 
that people have been predicting but its bad enough

the advertisement on more than 60 billboards in the area invites 
people to call julie and gives her telephone number 
but the ad doesnt include julies area code the sprawling 
urban region has five area codes and callers have been trying each 
one 
callers using the 213 area code can hear julie say i was just 
thinking how much i love athletic men 
but calls to the same number in the 805 area code get a 
physician who asked that he be identified only as george 
its a nuisance he said its irresponsible and its a 
waste of time 
a call to the same number with the 714 area code is answered by 
the electronic whistles of a facsimile machine 
an 818 area code call gets a phone company recording saying the 
call cannot be completed as dialed 
in the 619 area code the number reaches the answering machine 
of a guy named rich who tells callers thanks a lot and have a

dispatcher cheryl ann heck says the 
incoming call to the citys 911 emergency number sounded like it 
could be the work of a prankster but she wasnt about to take any 
chances 
we could hear some clunking and clicking on the phone and 
every once in a while you would hear the tones like someone was 
depressing the push buttons she said 
she traced the call and sent police medical and fire department 
personnel rushing to the address 
rescue workers broke into the locked house but found nobody home 
except the apparent emergency caller a 1yearold basset hound 
named mandy 
weve played back the tape several times ms heck said 
once you know its a dog you can hear it gnawing on the phone 
and running down a hallway 
jim jermain manager of product marketing for wisconsin bell 
said the dog apparently had been carrying and chewing on a cordless 
phone 
it appears that with some cordless phones as the battery gets 
low they send out clicking sounds that are interpreted by our 
electronic switcher as a 911 call he said 
lisa booz mandys owner said she was gone only about 45 
minutes to take her cat to the veterinarian about five blocks away 
by the time i got home all the trucks were gone my neighbors 
told me what happened she said adding that she called 
authorities to apologize

the scene and seven other bodies had been taken to the coroners 
office early today 
you could hear it crunching down but you couldnt see 
anything it was just a big white cloud leroy fitzgerald said 
after tuesdays earthquake knocked a milelong section of the 
highways upper level onto the bottom lanes 
you could hear people screaming for help said fitzgerald 
who works at a nearby auto parts shop 
late tuesday high on the upper deck of the nimitz freeway 
rescuers walked their flashlights shining in the darkness as they 
worked amid the wreckage that became a vast grave for motorists 
caught in the collapse 
when the 18block stretch of highway caved in workers from 
businesses in the heavy industrial area ran to help many bringing 
tall ladders and forklifts 
a passerby patrick macintyre said rescuers were able to pull 
one man alive from a car that was crushed to a height of 18 inches 
emergency workers pulled a girl from the wreckage of an 
automobile the fate of her parents was not known late tuesday 
rescuers worked to save the unidentified girls brother 
a threemember surgical team was forced to amputate the right 
leg of the 7yearold boy who was trapped in a car for seven hours 
at 1215 am he finally was carried down a 20foot ladder an 
taken to an ambulance 
darius brewer a 26yearold cook joined an impromptu rescue 
party the group crawled as far as possible under the crushed road 
to help injured motorists they used crowbars to pry open one auto 
and tied ropes around an elderly man to lower him 20 feet to safety 
then we went on top of the second deck and just mostly got 
everybody down we could people were yelling and screaming he 
said some people were yelling im hurt im hurt

hundreds of workers tried to pry survivors from a tiny gap left 
between the levels 
theres a 1foot crawlspace where theyre trying to extricate 
them rice said i guess theres 20 cars trapped in there 
parts of the buckled structure resembled a roller coaster with 
huge slabs of concrete skewed at all angles chunks of pulverized 
concrete littered the streets for blocks dusting warehouses 
the thud of helicopter blades mingled with the whine of sirens 
from other parts of the earthquakedamaged city 
police and emergency vehicles cordoned off the area for at least 
a dozen blocks around the highway 
people stood on street corners trying to get a glimpse of the 
disaster but darkness hid the carnage between the collapsed 
sections 
victims on stretchers lay in a makeshift medical center on a 
floodlit street corner 
two women died in my arms said an exhausted robert majors 
who lives a block from the freeway there was a man who died with 
all of us watching there was nothing we could do he was stuck

south korean president roh taewoo appealed to 
congress today for patience in meeting us demands for the opening 
of markets in his country to more american meat and other farm 
products 
roh told a joint meeting of the house and senate all ussouth 
korean trade issues eventually will be resolved to mutual 
satisfaction 
but only with the passage of time can korea ultimately adjust 
and achieve openness in the agricultural market without causing 
political and social trauma he said 
roh told the lawmakers his people want the same things as 
americans ask from their legislators to protect workers and save 
jobs and since nearly 20 percent of all koreans work on small 
traditional family farms our efforts to expand agricultural 
imports have important political and social consequemnces for 
nearly onefifth of our population he added 
south korea is already second to japan as the largest overseas 
customer for us farm products as in japan the political power 
of its rural sector has slowed opening of its market to food 
imports behind that of other products 
rohs aides said an agricultural trade liberalization program 
being launched next year would reduce import controls from the 
current level of 30 percent to 15 percent by 1991 
on another topic roh said the vast majority of south koreans 
support supports the presence of the 43000 us troops in their 
country and antiamerican demonstrators represent only a tiny 
band of extremists 
roh who spoke in english began by expressing the deep 
sympathy of the korean people to americans who are suffering a 
national disaster in the earthquakestricken san francisco bay 
area of california 
applauded frequently roh used his speech to renew a proposal he 
made a year ago at the un general assembly to convene a meeting 
of northeast asian countries to discuss how to lay a solid 
foundation for leasting peace and properity in the area 
referring to unnamed dissidents roh said regrettably 
certain radicals have resorted to force and committed unlawful acts 
to pursue their aims under the guise of democratic reform here 
are also the tiny band of extremists who parade antiamerican 
slogans and perpetrate attacks on us facilities 
in the latest such incident six militant students invaded an 
vandalized the us ambassadors residence in seoul last week 
roh said his own party and the political opposition are united 
in backing the american military presence that he and president 
bush agreed in talks tuesday continues to be vital for deterring 
attack by communist north korea 
in the population as a whole he said a very recent poll has 
shown that 94 percent strongly support the presence of us 
troops 
any hint of weakening in the us defense commitment or 
sudden lessening of the us military presence might cause north 
korea to misjudge the us commitment he said 
roh said his government is exerting every possible effort to 
convince north korea that nothing will be achieved by force 
he voiced hope that south koreas expanding relations with the 
soviet union china and other communist countries would help ease 
north korean hostility 
roh was the second korean president in history to address 
congress the first was syngman rhee founder of the republic of 
korea who in 1954 thanked the american people for saving his 
country from communism in the 195053 korean war 
roh recalled that he fought beside americans not only in korea 
but also vietnam where he said some of the us senators and 
representatives in his audience also served 
south korea has emerged from the authoritarianism of the past 
democracy has already become an unstoppable force which no one 
can divert said roh who became president after a surprise 
decision accepting opposition demands for a popular election that 
he ultimately won 
changes in his country he said are so diverse rapid and 
farreaching that they can be truly be called revolutionary 
he made no mention of his nations internal security act that 
human rights organizations claim has been misued by his government 
to arrest 2000 dissidents since roh took office in february 1988 
later in a speech to the national press club roh said todays 
demonstrations in korea differ from mass rallies of 1987 waged 
mostly to demand democratization 
today he said our fledgling democracy is challenged by the 
small radical fringe extremists who have by their 
inflammatory words and violent actions clearly revealed themselves 
to be enemies of democracy intent on subverting our system and 
bringing about a class revolution 
they do not hesitate to firebomb or seize government buildings 
and foreign diplomatic installations he said adding that public 
opinion condemns such radicals 
he and his wife were flying to los angeles later to greet former 
president reagan and to address the los angeles world affairs 
council on thursday

prime minister margaret thatcher 
of britain waging a lone war on sanctions against south africa 
told the commonwealth summit wednesday the measures were utterly 
irresponsible officials said 
other nations in the 49member grouping of britain and its 
former colonies including canada and host malaysia pressed for 
continued or stronger embargoes proponents said sanctions forced 
president fw de klerk to promise reforms and release black 
nationalist leaders 
the exchanges on the weeklong summits opening day heralded a 
new confrontation over south africa which quit the commonwealth in 
1961 
we are much more likely to achieve our aim by giving 
encouragement than by trying to behave as if nothing significant 
has happened mrs thatcher told a closed session of the summit 
her comments were reported by a british official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
he quoted her as saying de klerk took a major step forward 
by releasing eight black leaders this week allowing peaceful 
demonstrations and being prepared to consult all shades of 
opinion 
britain a major trading partner of south africa argues that 
sanctions hurt blacks and increase white resistance to change 
prime minister mahathir mohamad of malaysia said sanctions 
must not only continue but must be escalated to force an end to 
apartheid the official policy of racial segregation that allows 
south africas 5 million whites to maintain control over 28 million 
blacks 
sanctions work mahathir declared concern for the effect 
of sanctions on the blacks is misplaced investments and 
financial flows to racist south africa must be completely stopped 
in a blunt opening address he also blamed industrialized 
countries for pollution and accused them of manipulating the 
world economy 
it is the developed countries which have most assailed our 
environment he said nuclear testing excessive use of fossil 
fuels private transportation release of cfc into the atmosphere 
massive wastage of paper toxic chemical disposal all these and 
more are the direct result of the lifestyle of the rich 
mahathir said rich nations have ganged up against the poor 
they have arrogated to themselves the right to direct world trade 
and to manipulate currencies to their advantage 
queen elizabeth ii of britain titular head of the commonwealth 
acknowledged wednesday night that the organization has family 
disagreements 
like all the best families we have our share of 
eccentricities of impetuous and wayward youngsters and of 
disagreements she told the heads of government at a banquet on 
the royal yacht britannia but added you have shown that it is 
possible to make advances even on the most difficult problems 
canada wants the commonwealth to maintain current embargoes on 
south africa and oppose rescheduling of the foreign debt but it 
also supports holding off on any new punitive measures for six 
months to give de klerk an opportunity for reform 
debate on the issue was scheduled for thursday

federal officials moved quickly today to 
assess the damage from tuesdays disastrous california earthquake 
and speed aid to the region as president bush declared the 
machinery is working 
the president whose administrations response to hurricane hugo 
last month was criticized by some lawmakers as slow and 
bureaucratic signed a declaration triggering a flow of federal 
financial aid to the quakestricken san francisco bay area 
bush then went to the headquarters of the federal emergency 
management agency and met with officials for about 25 minutes on 
his way out he told reporters what i have seen is a highly 
coordinated effective federal effort 
in the sense that if theres anything good its that the 
agency is wellprepared he said the machinery is 
working 
he said officials were continuing to assess the damage estimates 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said there is 273 
million in unallocated funds from a 11 billion appropriation for 
the hurricane hugo cleanup which can be used for immediate 
assistance in san francisco 
that obviously means that we wont have enough for all of the 
emergencies that are now facing us and we will have to consider 
appropriate requests for followon funding said the presidential 
spokesman 
asked whether the federal response to the earthquake will be 
faster than it was to hugo bush said i hope there will be less 
carping i think they took a hit on that 
i guess you can never avoid all criticism fema then responded 
very promptly and theyre responding very very promptly now he 
said 
fema has an emergency fund that can be used for a variety of 
purposes including hotel accomodations for homeless people and as 
much as 10000 per family for recovery assistance said the 
agencys associate director grant peterson 
shortly after the quake occurred fema set up a disaster field 
office in the presidio an army post in san francisco headed by 
regional director robert vickers 
peterson said about 100 fema employees were on the scene 
coordinating with state energency workers and the agency has told 
its staff in areas as far away as seattle wash to remain on 
alert indefinitely 
peterson said the agency was making a concerted effort to avoid 
the kind of criticism it faced after hurricane hugo devastated 
south carolina last month 
during that emergency sen ernest hollings dsc referred to 
the agency as a bunch of bureaucratic jackasses for its alleged 
slowness in responding to to needs of victims 
this time peterson said fema is taking steps to fully inform 
the news media about its actions and avoid misunderstandings 
were not waiting to respond were responding right now he 
said tuesday night 
peterson said the agency had found itself severely strained in 
south carolina because hugo already had hit the us virgin islands 
and puerto rico 
in california disaster officials had been preparng for years 
for an expected major earthquake by holding dress reheasrsals 
peterson said the agency has a 118 billion pool that was set 
up to deal with damage from hurricane hugo last month and some of 
that money can be used to help victims of the earthquake 
the agencys first action was to shuffle officials from one 
place to another to be in position to respond quickly to requests 
when they come in from california for example fema officials were 
being flown from denton texas to sacramento to help with the 
paperwork peterson said 
after hugo swept across the virgin islands a fema official said 
no aid was being sent right away because the territorys governor 
had not asked for it the official acknowledged at the time that 
one reason the request may have been slow in coming was that the 
hurricane knocked out telephone lines 
theres not going to be a problem with california asking the 
right questions peterson said tuesday night

a senior hud official has decided a real estate 
partnership that includes a former lawyer of president reagan must 
repay 700000 in government grant money a published report said 
the decision by c austin fitts the newly confirmed assistant 
secretary for housing at hud reversed an earlier judgment by a 
ranking official of the department of housing and urban 
development the new york times reported in todays editions 
hud investigators say federal funds were spent inappropriately 
and that the partners including washington lawyer edward 
weidenfeld failed to invest sufficiently from their own funds in 
the federally subsidized housing project in brunswick ga 
part of the 700000 that weidenfeld and his two partners must 
repay will go to the government and the remainder will be 
reinvested in the cypress mill plantation apartment complex 
the chief hud housing official in atlanta neil zittrauer said 
he understood the partners invested as little as 100 in the 
complex which received mortgage assistance from two hud programs 
it was a very negligible investment on their part zittrauer 
said 
in the earlier ruling hud deputy assistant secretary r hunter 
cushing overrode regional housing officials in atlanta and said 
the partnership should repay only 88000 cushing resigned earlier 
this year and since has become a focus of congressional 
investigations into political abuses at hud 
weidenfeld was deputy general counsel and later general counsel 
in reagans 1980 campaign he was chairman of the legal advisory 
committee to the 1984 campaign committee

east german leader erich honecker was stripped of 
power today ending 18 years of ironfisted rule as the government 
grapples ith growing public demands for a freer society 
state news media said the communist party hierarchy replaced its 
77yearold leader with egon krenz a honecker protege and the 
youngest member of the ruling politburo 
honecker who directed the building of the berlin wall in 1961 
also will be relieved of his largely ceremonial post as head of 
state and as chief of the military the governmentrun news agency 
adn said 
adn said krenz 52 in charge of security issues and 
governmentrun youth groups already had taken over as the party 
chief and would be recommended for the posts as military chief and 
head of state 
the latter two require the approval of the nations parliament 
and that is guaranteed by the strong central control of the 
government 
krenz like honecker is considered a communist hardliner 
however he signaled a softer stance when he reportedly urged 
police to stop their harsh crackdown on the thousands of people who 
have been staging protests in recent weeks 
west germanys ard television network carried a brief interview 
krenz gave to east german television immediately after his 
appointment in which the new leader referred to the national 
situation as a very complicated time 
i told the central committee that i realize this is a 
difficult task that i have taken over said krenz smiling and 
appearing congenial in this very complicated time there is much 
work before us 
two other key members of the ruling politburo lost their 
positions 
politburo member joachim herrmann 60 who was in charge of the 
nations media and guenter mittag 63 the architect of east 
germanys economic policy were relieved of their functions 
adn reported 
adn said both men had also lost their posts on the communist 
partys 163member central committee and 21member politburo and 
mittag will be relieved of his duties as deputy head of state 
the move was an apparent attempt to placate growing public 
demands for a freer press and economic reforms 
the change in leadership comes as east germany is still reeling 
from the exodus in recent months of tens of thousands of its 
citizens seeking better wages and more freedoms in the west the 
flight has been followed by public dissent unprecedented under in 
this communist country 
in washington president bush said krenz rise to power was 
unlikely to signal fundamental change 
whether that reflects a change in eastwest relations i dont 
think so he said mr krentz has been very much in accord with 
the policies of honecker so its too early to say 
in bonn west german chancellor helmut kohl welcomed the 
leadership change and said he hoped krenz would make the way 
free for a better life for east germans 
we hope that in the interest of our countrymen that the reform 
process that has been so sympathetically received in poland and 
hungary and also in the soviet union will finally get its chance in 
east germany as well kohl told reporters 
adn said that honecker asked to be relieved of his official 
duties for health reasons honecker has reportedly been in ill 
healh following a gall bladder operation in august 
but honecker had been under pressure to resign after a wave of 
protests swept the country 
his ouster came after the politburo began meeting on tuesday 
that meeting was followed today by a gathering of the central 
committee of the party which must approve politburo decisions 
krenz has long been rumored to be the choice to succeed honecker 
and holds many of his hardline views 
however communist party sources also said it was krenz 
decision to ask police to stop attacking demonstrators after 
authorities charged protesters and brutally beat them earlier this 
month in east berlin and dresden 
since early october tens of thousands of people fed up with the 
tightly controlled society have taken to the streets to demand 
reforms including free elections and a free press 
the widespread discontent and an exodus to the west this year of 
more than 123000 people mostly young skilled workers has 
forced the government to express a willingness for dialogue though 
it has made it clear that the communist party has no intention of 
ceding its leading role 
honecker has served as party chief since 1971 taking over the 
additional post as head of state in 1976 he has guided east 
germany to the position as the most economically successful member 
of the soviet bloc 
honecker was born aug 25 1912 in saarland in the southwestern 
corner of what is now west germany 
in 1935 honecker was thrown in prison by the nazi regime for 
his political activities and didnt get out until the invading 
soviet red army arrived a decade later 
he gained his first powerful government posts in 1958 rising to 
membership in the politburo of the east german party and becoming a 
central committee secretary with responsibility for state security 
in 1961 then communist party chief walter ulbricht assigned 
honecker to direct the sovietbacked construction of the berlin 
wall to stop the mass flight of the nations most productive 
citizens to the citys western sector

the devastating earthquake that killed 
hundreds in northern california vividly recalls the catastrophic 
quake and fire that laid waste to san francisco in 1906 
quakes are almost commonplace in california with that state and 
western nevada experiencing 90 percent of the tremors recorded in 
this country according to the us geological survey 
but when the rare major quake comes as it did in the nations 
seconddeadliest quake on tuesday serious damage can result as 
well as death and injury 
and while the west coast feels the earth shake more often 
shocks can strike any part of the nation 
the new quake registered at 69 on the richter scale and was on 
the notorious san andreas fault that reading made it the 
sixthmost powerful quake to strike california this century and 
the mos powerful since a 70 quake centered in eureka in 1980 
such a quake can cause severe damage with each increase of one 
whole number meaning an increase of 10 times in strength 
tuesdays devastating quake still is well short of the 1906 san 
francisco quake however which was estimated at 83 on the scale 
that disaster killed more than 700 people largely in fires which 
swept the city in the wake of the tremor 
california and alaska are subject to many quakes because they 
rest on what is called the ring of fire a region of volcanoes and 
earthquakeprone lands circling the pacific ocean 
this ring is caused by the movement of the giant plates that 
underlie the land and oceans of the earth plates move gradually 
stresses build up over time and then are released in quakes 
san francisco sits astride the san andreas fault a crack in the 
earth where the pacific plate is slowly sliding north compared with 
the rest of california which rests on the north american plate it 
was the same fault that instigated the 1906 tremor 
while the 1906 disaster is burned into american memory this 
country has been relatively fortunate compared to other nations 
in terms of earthquake disasters 
the 25000 deaths reported in armenia a year ago are fresh in 
memory and china had an estimated 650000 deaths in a violent 
quake in 1976 japan too has suffered many deaths in historic 
quakes as have iran turkey nicaragua peru chile and other 
nations 
the 1906 san francisco quake was the largest american death 
toll although at least two other events were stronger in terms of 
the richter scale 
here is a rundown of other major earthquakes in american history 
as recorded by the us geological survey 
new madrid mo was shaken by three quakes in 18111812 
estimated at 84 to 87 on the richter scale but damage and 
casualties were light because the region had a relatively small 
population at the time these quakes were felt as far away as 
boston and new york 
prince william sound alaska was pounded by a quake rated at 
84 on the richter scale on march 27 1964 in this century only 
one quake in chile in 1960 has been stronger there were 131 
deaths and extensive damage in alaska 
on nov 18 1867 the virgin islands were shaken by a magnitude 
75 quake also felt in puerto rico and the dominican republic 
waves as large as 20 feet were generated 
in the same area a 75 temblor shook the mona passage near 
puerto rico on oct 11 1918 some 116 people died many in the 
giant wave generated by the quake 
on aug 17 1959 a quake rated at 73 struck hebgen lake 
mont and was felt from seattle to north dakota to utah extensive 
damage was reported and 28 people died 
olympia wash was struck by a 71 quake on april 13 1949 
killing eight people and causing extensive damage in washington and 
oregon 
there was a quake rated 70 at borah peak idaho on oct 25 
1983 it was widely felt but only two people were killed 
coalinga calif was the focus of a 67 magnitude quake on may 
2 1983 injuring 45 people and causing 31 million in damage 
on aug 31 1886 charleston sc suffered a 66 magnitude 
quake killing 60 people this tremor was felt as far away as 
boston milwaukee and havana cuba 
a quake measured at 66 also did severe damage to the san 
fernando valley of california on feb 9 1971 killing 65 people

president bush said today the turnover in east 
germanys government may not lead to improvements in eastwest 
relations but his administration challenged the new party 
leadership to make an effort in that direction 
bush told reporters he was following with interest the 
replacement of erich honecker as east germanys leader with 
politburo member egon krenz 
but he told reporters whether that reflects a change in 
eastwest relations i dont think so i dont think it does 
because mr krenz has been very much in accord with the policies of 
honecker so its too early to say 
at the same time presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
we hope this change signals movement by the east german 
leadership toward reforms and responds to the hopes and aspirations 
of its people 
the united states is prepared to develop stronger and more 
constructive relations with east germany it is up to the new 
leadership there to demonstrate through its deeds that its ready 
to move in that direction fitzwater said 
honecker 77 was removed as party leaders met to discuss the 
flight of east germans to the west and growing prodemocracy 
protests 
the staterun news service adn reported that krenz 52 in 
charge of security issues as well as governmentrun youth groups 
had taken over as the party chief 
bush was asked about the government turnover by reporters as he 
met with congressional leaders to discuss the san francisco 
earthquake and other issues 
theres dynamic change taking place in eastern europe and now 
it appears the gdr east germmany but whether this step is a 
step toward more openness i think its way too early to say 
bush said 
theres nothing in the record to indicate it is he added 
privately administration officials expressed guarded optimism 
that the change might spell movement on the part of east germany

pacific bell officials said today their 
telephone network survived tuesdays devastating northern 
california earthquake without significant damage but the system 
was being overloaded by a huge increase in calls into and out of 
the san francisco area 
because of the surge in longdistance calls to the region many 
calls were being blocked recorded messages told callers to try 
again later 
the local network around san francisco was unscathed but 
because of the big increase in calls callers were having 
difficulty connecting with the network said mary hallisey a 
washington spokeswoman for pacific bells parent the pacific 
telesis group 
the local network is in fine shape hallisey said there 
is no damage to the central offices or the network itself it is 
operating there is a gridlock problem based on the fact that so 
many people are trying to call in all at once when you pick up 
the phone out there you dont get a dial tone right away the 
system is not out its just a very slow dial tone 
youve got customers trying to get ahold of friends loved 
ones work said sue galloway district manager for pacific 
bells network in southern california 
its extremely heavy and my anticipation is it will get 
heavier as the day goes one galloway said by telephone from los 
angeles 
were asking people not to call in for a 24hour period 
said lissa zanville a pacific bell spokeswoman 
american telephone amp telegraph co which handles about 70 
percent of the nations longdistance calls appealed to people not 
to try telephoning the earthquake area 
atampt spokesman herb linnen said the company was blocking part of 
a flood of calls into the area so san franciscans could call out 
between 2 am edt and 10 am there were 17 million calling 
attempts in atampts nationwide network that compared with 13 
million longdistance calling attempts during the same 2 am to 10 
am time frame the week before linnen said 
he did not know how many calls were placed to the san francisco 
area 
clearly we have not seen volumes of this kind in the memories 
of veteran network managers and it is clearly the interest in and 
concern for the san francisco bay situation 
we are urging people elsewhere to not call into that area so 
we can devote more of our circuits to what were trying to do 
give priority to calls coming out of that affected area he said 
and this request will apply until further notice

cuba was elected today to the security 
council for the first time since its revolution 30 years ago 
diplomats said cubas election was a sign of increasing 
respectability and importance for the communist nation still 
shunned by the us government and subjected to a trade embargo 
the us government which did not openly oppose cubas seating 
said it hoped the havana government would act constructively on the 
council it called on cuba to respect the central american peace 
accords and not to interfere with military or covert aid in 
regional affairs 
we hope it will recognize that it has a special responsibility 
as a member of the security council to act constructively to end 
regional conflicts not contribute to them according to a 
statement read by a state department spokesman 
washington has accused cuba of subversion and military 
involvement in latin america as well as in africa cuba however 
has been withdrawing its troops from angola as part of an overall 
political agreement in southern africa 
the last time cuba served on the council was in 1956 before its 
1959 revolution the only other time was in 1947 
cuba was elected by the general assembly in a secret ballot 
along with four other nonpermanent members of the council serving 
twoyear terms cuba which replaces brazil received the highest 
number of votes in the balloting 146 out of 156 votes cast 
the other new members are the ivory coast replacing algeria 
zaire replacing senegal romania replacing yugoslavia and 
democratic yemen replacing nepal the other nonpermanent members 
are canada colombia ethiopia finland and malaysia 
the five permanent members are the united states britain 
china france and the soviet union all of whom hold veto power 
the election of cuba and yemen another communist nation 
critical of the west were not expected to significantly alter the 
balance in the council 
the security council has responsibility for maintaining 
international peace and security and its resolutions are considered 
binding although they often are flouted

the battle over whether the united states 
should commemorate an armenian genocide is going to the senate 
floor where the bush administration will try again to defeat the 
measure 
the democratcontrolled senate judiciary committee on an 86 
vote approved the measure tuesday 
the move angered turkey which had waged a fullscale lobbying 
campaign to kill the measure in committee the nato ally which 
receives about 500 million in us aid a year sees the resolution 
as tantamount to a comparison with hitlers regime in germany 
now weve got to concentrate on 100 people said mike 
mcnamara a lobbyist for turkey no date has been set for full 
consideration by the senate 
turkey was aided in its campaign by the administration which 
summoned the american ambassador from ankara to help work against 
the measure publicly however the state department did not 
announce its opposition to the resolution until after the vote 
the bottom line is that we oppose it roman popadiuk a 
white house spokesman said late tuesday 
before the panel passed the measure sen howard metzenbaum 
dohio tried unsuccessfully to soften it by eliminating the word 
genocide 
bushs national security adviser brent scowcroft suggested the 
change metzenbaum said he sought to replace the word genocide 
with a national day of remembrance for armenians 
whether or not it is a genocide is arguable metzenbaum 
said discussing the reported deaths of 15 million armenians in 
the ottoman empire between 1915 and 1923 
armenians the bulk of whom now live within soviet borders have 
a long history of ethnic and religious conflict with turks turkey 
claims hundreds of thousands of people not 15 million died from 
war famine and epidemics during the war years and that many turks 
were among them 
sen joseph biden ddel chairman of the judiciary committee 
said the only debate is whether it was attempted genocide or 
genocide moreover biden said turkeys opposition to the 
resolution was irrelevant 
the fact that the government of turkey opposes it is of no 
consequence he said 
sen paul simon dill argued genocide did occur people 
were massacred because of their ancestry in the ottoman empire 
he said 
the measure sponsored by senate republican leader bob dole of 
kansas aroused strong feelings among americans of turkish and 
armenian descent 
i became the focal point for the greatest lobbying campaign 
ive experience in a long while said sen alan simpson rwyo 
the dole measure would set april 24 1990 to memorialize the 15 
million armenians who were killed between 1915 and 1923 during the 
days of the ottoman empire 
although the bush administration opposes it president bush 
voiced support for language marking the armenian genocide 
during the 1988 campaign 
the reagan administration opposed similiar resolutions when they 
came before the house in past years none of those passed

senate democratic leader george mitchell 
gaining confidence that a constitutional amendment to ban burning 
the american flag will be defeated said tuesday it is tragic 
that president bush had championed the measure 
the bill of rights has never been amended or tampered with in 
200 years of our nations history and now tragically the 
president of the united states himself is leading the effort to 
change the bill of rights mitchell the senate majority leader 
from maine told a group of reporters 
just a minute im just getting warmed up a broadly 
grinning mitchell declared when a reporter tried to ask a question 
about an unrelated issue 
mitchell said it was most unfortunate that bush had 
campaigned for the amendment and said the measure sought to force 
americans to choose between the flag and the constitution 
americans do revere the flag and they do revere the 
constitution and they can do both mitchell said 
the senate planned to vote on the amendment thursday morning 
critics say it would curb freedom of speech proponents call it 
the only way to prevent recurrence of the supreme court ruling in 
june that held existing law against flag burning unconstitutional 
bush has been the most visible champion of the measure while 
senate democrats have provided the bulk of the opposition but two 
former republican sponsors sens john danforth rmo and warren 
rudman rnh dropped their support on tuesday because of the 
measures impact on the bill of rights 
the house last week approved and sent to bushs desk a new 
approach to ban flag burning by simple statute it was carefully 
worded in an effort to bring it into line with the supreme courts 
ruling 
bush said that he would allow it to become law while continuing 
to press for the amendment 
growing surer that they would prevail against the amendment 
democratic senators trooped to the floor to denounce it 
sen howard m metzenbaum dohio said that americans are not 
clamoring at us to amend the constitution

john e frohnmayer new chairman of the 
national endowment for the arts vowed wednesday to calm a 
congressional uproar over obscenity and to seek greater financial 
support for the arts including a possible appeal to millionaire 
rock stars for donations 
frohnmayer told reporters he had met twice recently with sen 
jesse helms rnc the endowments harshest critic and was 
assured that helms had no intention of trying to abolish the 
grantmaking federal agency 
at helms urging congress recently banned federal spending on 
materials the endowment chairman determines may be considered 
obscene and lacking in serious artistic literary political or 
scientific value 
the ban was prompted by conservative legislators complaints 
that nea funds were used by contemporary art institutes in 
philadelphia and winstonsalem nc to support exhibitions of 
controversial works by photographer robert mapplethorpe and artist 
andres serrano 
frohnmayer said he told helms that the antiobscenity law will 
be terribly difficult to administer because of longstanding 
differences over what constitutes obscenity and the need to protect 
first amendment guarantees of free speech 
but frohnmayer promised to keep the lines of communication 
open with nea critics and to erase their perception that the 
endowment has been arrogant and elitist 
frohnmayer said he would seek a significant increase in the 
endowments 1713 million budget to help bolster arts education in 
public schools expand access to cultural events by minority groups 
and underwrite the mounting expenses of highquality arts 
institutions 
but were not going to get any more money if we dont make our 
case he said 
frohnmayer who succeeded frank hodsoll as endowment chairman 
oct 3 said he will seek greater private support for the arts 
including a possible appeal to rock stars and other bigname 
performers to donate part of their multimilliondollar profits to 
support arts education 
the endowment an independent federal agency spent 156 million 
in taxpaid matching grants last year to underwrite about 800 
artists and 3800 arts institutions from opera and theater 
companies to poets and folk artists 
the endowments budget has grown by less than 8 percent since 
1981 when president reagan took office and tried unsuccessfully to 
slash its 1588 million budget in half

as the sun rose wednesday in san francisco 
residents went to the top of the scenic 900foot twin peaks area to 
see the city for themselves 
what they saw underneath the haze smog and dust shocked them 
perfect stillness and practically no traffic 
its so quiet said an awestruck marianne wong as she gazed 
toward downtown and the golden gate bridge 
wong arrived at the twin peaks vista point called the 
natural dividing point of the city with a friend about 9 
am skipping the normal routine of school and work to see the 
city firsthand the morning after a catastrophic earthquake rumbled 
through a wide area of northern california 
the chance to see the san franciscooakland bay bridge without 
traffic was also what brought paul brager to the mountain 
i think we are very lucky it wasnt like the 1906 quake but i 
didnt think a magnitude seven would cause this much damage he 
said 
looking from the vista point toward the marin headlands bridges 
and city neighborhoods had only light traffic above only the 
goodyear blimp could be seen floating over the city 
sirens continually pierced the otherwise quiet morning beyond 
that the only noise to be heard came from chirping birds 
john brown and tim tanner showed up at the twin peaks site 
which is near their apartment carrying cups of coffee and 
marveling at the scene 
ive been in other earthquakes but nothing like this said 
tanner 
tanner told brown who runs a travel agency that he will be 
busy for the next few days 
people will want to be getting out of here tanner said

housing construction buffeted by rising 
mortgage rates fell for a second straight month in september 
declining to the weakest pace in seven years the government 
reported wednesday 
the commerce department said that construction of new homes and 
apartments dropped 52 percent following a 62 percent august 
decline 
the backtoback drops pushed construction starts down to a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 126 million units the slowest 
pace since october 1982 
many analysts blamed the september decline on builders concerns 
about high levels of unsold homes and worries that rising mortgage 
rates during the month might further crimp new home sales 
because much of the falloff was concentrated in the south some 
analysts suggested that hurricane hugo affected construction in 
that area 
david seiders chief economist for the national association of 
home builders said that the housing weakness highlighted the 
urgent need for the federal reserve to lower interest rates to keep 
the economy from toppling into a recession 
many analysts said they believed that the central bank has begun 
a series of small crediteasing moves they noted that a closely 
watched indicator of fed intentions the overnight federal funds 
rate has dropped about 025 percentage point to 875 percent since 
the friday the 13th stock market crash 
the fed pumped an additional 15 billion into the banking 
system wednesday the third consecutive daily cash infusion since 
fridays market turmoil 
while the feds efforts were aimed at reassuring skittish 
financial markets about plentiful reserves for emergency loans 
analysts said that the fed was likely to keep interest rates at 
lower levels because of the weak housing construction and other 
signs of a slowing economy 
fixedrate mortgages which climbed as high as 1022 percent in 
early september have fallen slightly in october and now stand at 
995 percent according to a weekly survey by the federal home loan 
mortgage corp 
so far this year housing construction is running 62 percent 
below a year ago with housing starts down in six of the last nine 
months 
for september construction of singlefamily homes fell by 21 
percent to an annual rate of 971000 units the second consecutive 
month that singlefamily homes have been below the 1 million mark 
construction of multifamily units was down 141 percent to an 
annual rate of 292000 units 
in a disturbing sign for the future permits for new units 
dropped as well in september falling 24 percent to 130 million 
units

commerce secretary robert mosbacher said 
wednesday he can foresee the day when the united states and mexico 
will have a free trade treaty similar to the uscanadian 
arrangement 
looking even further into the future perhaps 20 years or so 
mosbacher told a senate banking panel the united states should set 
a goal of having free trade among all countries in the western 
hemisphere 
mosbacher said informal talks have already been held with 
mexican trade officials about removing trade barriers separating 
the two countries 
they are cautious he said we should not push them too 
hard too fast but they are interested very interested 
earlier mosbacher had told the international finance and 
monetary policy subcommittee that the bush administration hopes 
mexico will be the first olive out of the jar among latin 
american nations able to shore up their economies and provide 
expanded markets for us exporters 
he noted mexico is the first of those nations to work out 
agreements on handling its huge foreign debt and under the 
nations new leadership has reduced its inflation rate below 20 
percent 
responding to skepticism from several democratic committee 
members about the merits of the socalled brady plan for third 
world debt relief mosbacher said i agree the plan will not 
work by itself but its part of the puzzle 
continuing his focus on mexico as an early barometer for overall 
administration policy mosbacher said that countrys ability to 
reduce some of its big interest payments has freed money for 
investment 
mosbacher said a key to developing export markets in latin 
american countries will be for us businesses to take a long view 
of their investments rather than shortterm profits

space shuttle atlantis darted 
between two storm systems and thundered flawlessly into orbit 
today starting the plutoniumpowered galileo probe on a 
twicedelayed roundabout journey to jupiter 
the 132ton winged atlantis with a crew of five lifted off at 
1253 pm riding a 700foot column of flame out over the atlantic 
on a fiveday mission that antinuclear activists fearful of a 
challengerlike accident were unable to stop 
two minutes after liftoff the two solid fuel booster rockets 
burned out and fell away as planned mission control reported 8 
minutes after blastoff that the shuttle had reached orbit more than 
100 miles above the earth 
you looked marvelous going up mission control said 
i feel a lot better replied atlantis commander don williams 
also feeling better were scientists who have worked since 1978 
on the galileo project surviving money problems that delayed the 
original 1982 launch date and the 1986 challenger explosion that 
pushed the launch off three more years 
it feels great its been a long time said lennard fisk 
nasas chief scientist each of these missions opens up a new 
science door 
during the first hour of flight the astronauts encountered 
minor problems with a cooling system and with an electronic part on 
one of the ships maneuvering engines both were corrected quickly 
atlantis was grounded tuesday by rain and last week by a faulty 
engine computer its launch was in doubt up to a few minutes before 
liftoff today because of a cold front to one side and offshore rain 
clouds to the other 
thousands were at the kennedy space center and nearby vantage 
points to watch the start of the 31st space shuttle mission during 
which the astronauts will deploy galileo and also conduct medical 
and other scientific experiments 
about 200 armed security guards on land in boats and in the 
air were alert for antinuclear trespassers who had threatened to 
sit on the pad if necessary to halt the launch but liftoff took 
place without incident 
the astronauts were to release the 6700pound galileo from 
atlantis cargo bay about 6 hours after liftoff for a looping 
sixyear 24billionmile journey to jupiter the colossus of the 
solar system with a radius 11 times that of earth 
the 15 billion galileo the most expensive unmanned space 
vehicle ever built is expected to give the best look yet at the 
mysteries of another planet it is the rollsroyce of 
spacecraft said clayne yeates a mission manager 
the mission ends monday in the mojave desert at edwards air 
force base calif besides williams the crew members are pilot 
mike mcculley and mission specialists ellen baker franklin 
changdiaz and shannon lucid 
antinuclear activists last week lost a lawsuit to block the 
launch they charged that the 50 pounds of plutonium that supply 
electricity to galileo could scatter radiation over florida in the 
event of an accident 
nasa says the chances of a plutonium release are 1in25000 
and even if there were a release there would be no appreciable harm 
to the public 
demonstrators had said they might try to halt liftoff by 
infiltrating the launch area but bruce gagnon a protest leader 
said his group had made its point monday when eight members got 
arrested for trespassing at the space center 
two more people were arrested tuesday one for crossing a space 
center boundary and another for releasing a helium balloon shaped 
like a person less than an hour before launch time 
once it reaches jupiter galileo will fire a probe into its 
atmosphere and orbit the planet for 22 months for clues to the 
formation of the universe 
scientists believe the planet still holds much of the material 
in its original state from which the universe formed more than 15 
billion years ago 
nasa had been concerned whether an air force control center in 
sunnyvale calif inside tuesdays earthquake zone would be 
operating to command the rocket that sends galileo into deep space 
once it leaves the shuttle 
but the space agency received assurances at an early morning 
meeting that the consolidated space test center at onizuka air 
force base would be ready 
under launchteam rules a second straight postponement today 
would have triggered an automatic 48hour delay meaning atlantis 
would be grounded until at least friday the rule is designed to 
prevent launch team fatigue 
nasa had to launch the galileo by nov 21 or else wait until 
july 1991 for the earth and jupiter to come back into proper 
alignment 
the delays worried nasa because of the cost of keeping the 
spacecraft on standby and because galileos nuclear power pack was 
running down

an art restorer has no claim of ownership of a 
depressionera mural that the city of stamford conn mistakenly 
threw in the garbage in 1970 a judge ruled 
the 8by100foot mural painted in 1934 by artist james 
daughtery as part of the federal works progress administration has 
been appraised at 125 million by sothebys 
the discarded mural was obtained by an official of the federal 
general services administration who oversaw the restoration of wpa 
artwork and sent to restorer hiram h hoelzer to keep until 
federal funding was found to restore it according to court records 
in 1986 when the city planned to apply for its own grant for 
restoration hoelzer claimed the city had given up its rights to 
the mural and he claimed ownership 
us district judge louis stanton ruled tuesday that it was 
reasonable for city officials to believe that as long as mr 
hoelzer did not assert ownership of the mural he continued to 
possess it as a custodian or bailee a person who holds something 
temporarily in trust

president bush today signed a disasterrelief 
declaration for the earthquakeravaged san francisco bay area and 
said we will take every step and make every effort to help spur 
recovery from the devastation 
bush said he probably will fly to the area for a personal 
inspection but left open when that might happen i dont want to 
get in the way he said adding that the last thing we want to 
do is clutter things up 
his press secretary marlin fitzwater said later that the trip 
wont be for a few days but an official said it could be 
saturday 
fitzwater said there is 273 million in unallocated funds from a 
11 billion appropriation for the hurricane hugo cleanup which 
can be used for immediate assistance in san francisco 
that obviously means that we wont have enough for all of the 
emergencies that are now facing us and we will have to consider 
appropriate requests for followon funding said the presidential 
spokesman 
fitzwater said the earthquake relief would cost more than 
the 11 billion hugo cleanup but he declined to estimate how much 
numerous world leaders have sent bush messages of sympathy and 
offers of support including soviet president mikhail gorbachev 
who received us help after last decembers devastating earthquake 
in armenia 
if these countries can help we certainly welcome their 
assistance said fitzwater 
bush announced his action during a morning meeting with 
republican congressional leaders 
as daylight breaks there in california i want the citizens of 
the san francisco bay area and its neighbors first to know that our 
hearts are with them as they face this terrible tragedy the 
president said words cant adequately convey our sadness 
bush said we will take every step and make every effort to 
help the bay area in its hour of need 
he said he received an update by telephone from vice president 
dan quayle who was preparing to take a helicopter tour of the 
ravaged area 
asked about the extent of the damage bush said the death toll 
seems to be mounting and we are concerned but its hard to put a 
total number on it at this point ive seen none authorities in 
california say more than 270 people were killed and hundreds were 
injured 
were working with state and local officials to assure the 
relief effort is coordinated and effective as possible bush said 
he praised the efforts of private relief agencies such as the 
red cross and called on americans to support those organizations 
the disasterrelief declaration will authorize use of federal 
funds in the recovery effort bush said his chief of staff john 
sununu was trying to ensure that the relief effort is 
coordinated and effective as possible 
he said the federal emergency management agency fema which 
was criticized for its response to hurricane hugo is doing a 
good job theyre out front and theyre trying to respond 
later bush left the white house to tour femas emergency 
information and coordination center and defended the agency i 
hope there will be less carping i think they took a hit on the 
other one hurricane hugo he said 
in an operations room bush talked by telephone with jeff rubin 
director of californias emergency medical services who had just 
called federal officials 
jeff this is the president hows it doing out there are you 
getting a lot of requests for emergency medical service bush 
said 
he ended the conversation saying well thats good bush 
then told aides he says not so many requests 
bushs declaration said a major disaster exists in a 
sevencounty area in northern california the federal government 
normally pays at least 75 percent of the cost of rebuilding bridges 
and other public facilities that are destroyed and provides 
lowcost loans for individuals and businesses 
the areas covered by bushs order include the city and county of 
san francisco and the counties of alameda monterey san benito 
san mateo santa clara and santa cruz 
fema said damage surveys are continuing in other areas and 
additional counties may be added later 
bush met during the morning with a group of elementary school 
principals and singled out ray e tolcacher superintendent of the 
windsor school district in the bay area we just hope that your 
kids and your schools and all the families are safe and sound 
bush said 
he said the damage was a matter of grave national concern 
within a few hours of the quake the bureaucracy was in motion 
from bushs decision to send transportation secretary sam skinner 
flying overnight to california to the establishment of a command 
center at the federal emergency management agency fema a few 
blocks from the white house 
the administration which was criticized for its response to 
hurricane hugo made a determined effort to demonstrate that the 
government was moving quickly now 
fitzwater during an earlymorning appearance at fema said 
at the moment it is very reassuring to see that the 
responseorganization at the local state and federal levels is 
performing so well people in san francisco are responding in 
heroic fashion in many cases 
people are staying calm but it looks like in this major 
disaster that the people and organizations involved are performing 
with distinction fitzwater said 
obviously weve already started moving said femas grant 
peterson were not waiting to respond were responding right 
now he added as the agency strove to avoid the criticism it 
reaped for its response to hurricane hugo last month

president bush held out the prospect of 
improved relations with east germany on wednesday but suggested it 
was way too early to say whether wednesdays power shuffle 
could pave the way 
us officials reacted to the ouster of longtime communist party 
leader erich honecker by challenging his successor politburo 
member egon krenz to embrace reforms sweeping other eastern bloc 
nations 
the united states is prepared to develop stronger and more 
constructive relations with the german democratic republic east 
germany said presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater 
it is up to the new leadership there to demonstrate through 
its deeds that its ready to move in that direction the 
spokesman said 
still bush himself voiced skepticism over the prospects of any 
major policy turnabouts as a result of wednesdays upheaval 
theres dynamic change taking place in eastern europe and now 
it appears in east germany but whether this step is a step 
toward more openness or not i think its way too early to say 
the president said 
theres nothing in the record to indicate that it is he 
added 
speaking with reporters during a picturetaking session with 
republican leaders bush said krenz had been very much in 
accord with the hardline policies of honecker who was stripped 
of power after 18 years of rule 
honecker 77 was removed as party leaders met to discuss the 
flight of east germans to the west and growing prodemocracy 
protests he was replaced by the younger krenz 52 who had been in 
charge of security issues and governmentrun youth groups 
whether the selection of a new party chief reflects a change 
in eastwest relations i dont think so i dont think it does 
bush said 
fitzwater called honeckers removal by communist party leaders 
obviously a response to the mass exodus of tens of thousands of 
east germans who have sought freedom and a better life in the 
west 
we hope thus change signals movement by east germany toward 
reforms and repsonds to the hopes and aspirations of its people 
fitzwater said 
at the state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said the 
united states will be watching to see if the new east german 
leadership is prepared to bring perestroika to east germany

an air force officer whose activities in west 
berlin are under investigation because of espionage allegations has 
been released from restriction to kelly air force base authorities 
said 
capt john vladimir hirsch 34 an electronic security officer 
has been at kelly since aug 30 after he was taken into custody by 
the air force office of special investigations since arriving at 
the base he has been accompanied everywhere by an escort 
a search of his west berlin apartment turned up records of 
120000 in bank accounts photographs of nato military 
installations and classified documents 
hirsch has not been charged with any crime but he has been 
under suspicion of selling secrets to the soviet bloc 
he was released from restriction to base tuesday because 
military law limits the amount of time someone can be restricted 
without charges being filed said lt col john worthington a 
spokesman for the electronic security command headquartered at 
kelly 
hirsch does not have to stay on the base but must tell his 
commander if he plans to leave san antonio and his topsecret 
security clearance remains revoked officials said 
the investigation began in july when polygraph examiners decided 
hirsch was not telling the truth during a routine security update 
he had been assigned to west berlin at a communications unit 
belonging to the secretive electronic security command which 
collects intelligence on warsaw pact radar and communications 
his current duties as an electronic engineer do not involve 
classified projects worthington said

congress needs to wrestle with the vague 
federal law that led to the revocation of oliver norths retirement 
pay after he was convicted on irancontra charges a panel of legal 
experts said wednesday 
senate judiciary committee chairman joseph biden ddel said 
he will draft a report outlining arguments on both sides of what 
has become a politically divisive issue 
weve got to solve this thing weve got to make this thing 
square for everybody biden said suggesting lawmakers should 
deal not just with norths case but with the situation of any 
federal official including members of congress convicted of a 
felony 
norths retirement pay as a marine lieutenant colonel was 
23000 a year less than he reportedly now makes for a single 
speech on the lecture circuit 
the pay was suspended july 5 after he was convicted of three 
felony counts the law provides that anyone convicted of one of the 
counts shredding government documents shall forfeit his 
office north is appealing the convictions 
the general accounting office which has jurisdiction over 
federal pay matters ruled norths status as a retired military 
officer came under that provision of the law and that forfeiting 
his office meant he no longer qualified for military retirement pay 
sen jesse helms rnc has forced the senate to schedule a 
vote nov 3 on a bill that would restore norths pension without 
changing the underlying law 
legal scholars said at wednesdays hearing that might be 
unconstitutional since only the courts have the power to sentence 
and only the president has the power to pardon but they said 
congress may want to address the issue of whether the law meant for 
office to include military positions 
technically military retirement pay is not a pension based on 
past service but a reduced salary based on an officer continuing to 
hold a commission and remaining subject to reactivation to duty 
peter m shane a constitutional law scholar at the university 
of iowa argued that singling out north for special treatment 
instead of changing the underlying law would amount to trial 
under the rule of politics and not under the rule of law 
eugene hickok a political science professor at dickinson 
college in pennsylvania urged congress to pass legislation that 
would make it clear the documentshredding law was not intended to 
force forfeiture of military retirement pay

man sought by west germany on charges he murdered prisoners while a 
nazi concentration camp guard during world war ii the justice 
department announced wednesday

april 1987 ruling as well as the german extradition warrant 
blach was denied bail at a bond hearing in los angeles on 
wednesday but he will get a chance to challenge the extradition at 
another hearing monday in us district court there officials 
said the justice department will represent west germanys claim 
we are very encouraged by west germany having taken this case 
very seriously in fulfilling its responsibilities of prosecuting 
nazi crimes said neal sher who heads the departments office of 
special investigations 
the us immigration court found in 1987 that blach who 
immigrated here in 1956 from austria served as a guard and 
doghandler at the dachau concentration camp in germany from 1940 
to 1943 and later at the wiener neudorf camp in austria

the white house on wednesday denied any 
internal rift on us policy toward the soviets despite seemingly 
divergent tones in recent comments by secretary of state james a 
baker iii and vice president dan quayle 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater acknowledged 
however that we sing from the same song sheet but there are 
several verses 
while quayle appeared to hew to a harder line citing the 
potential source of serious problems in sovietamerican 
relations baker in a monday speech seemed to take a more open 
and expansive approach he said the prospects for a lasting 
improvement in ussoviet relations are better than ever before 
baker announced that the united states stands ready to give the 
soviets technical assistance to help in certain areas of soviet 
economic reform 
the washington times quoted quayle as telling reporters tuesday 
in san francisco let them reform themselves meaning the 
soviets 
quayle spoke later tuesday in los angeles to a town hall of 
california meeting a day after baker spoke in new york to the 
foreign policy association 
asked if their comments indicated a rift within the 
administration over how to deal with the soviets fitzwater said 
there are no differences between vice president quayle and 
secretary baker on ussoviet relations 
we all agree that glastnost and perestroika are encouraging 
trends that america supports it is in the western interest for 
these reforms to succeed we offer democracy as an example to the 
world and we have continually said the soviets must solve their 
internal structural problems themselves but we are always ready to 
provide advice and counsel 
bakers comments appeared to indicate a more openarms approach 
for the bush administration in the face of criticism from some 
quarters that it has been too reticent to take advantage of the 
opportunities to urge on reform movements in the east bloc 
governments 
he did however mix praise with criticism stating that the 
soviets were reluctant to withdraw from regional conflicts 
quayle did not mention offers of technical assistance in his 
speech on tuesday 
he also mentioned soviet involvement in regional conflicts in 
nicaragua north korea afghanistan and cambodia that have been a 
sore spot for the united states and said they showed the darker 
side of soviet foreign policy

the salvation army had the food cooking almost 
before the earth quit shaking in northern california nearly as 
quickly the red cross opened the doors and unfolded cots in 25 
shelters the federal government called a meeting 
once again the nations volunteer agencies were the quickest to 
assist local authorities when disaster struck even as the white 
house and other federal institutions stung by complaints of a 
sorry tardy effort in the wake of hurricane hugo burned the 
midnight oil this time 
hugos devastation last month in puerto rico the virgin islands 
and the carolinas extended into the treasuries of the private 
relief agencies even so they were ready for the san francisco 
shaker 
the red cross the salvation army church groups and other 
organizations like react the citizensband radio volunteers all 
work with the federal emergency management agency as well as local 
officials in planning for disasters but none awaits orders from 
the washington bureaucracy which still took hours getting into 
gear 
we dont wait for anybody said col leon ferraez 
communications director of the salvation army were there the 
minute the news is on 
according to ferraez the salvation army had 12 mobile canteens 
on their way to the hardesthit earthquake areas within minutes 
all salvation army facilities in the bay area including 34 
community service centers and scores of other units have been 
turned over to the relief effort thousands of meals had been 
served and hundreds if not thousands housed in those facilities 
by noon wednesday ferraez said 
in the first hours the canteens provided beverages sandwiches 
and donuts to victims of the quake as well as police firefighters 
and volunteer relief workers longer term services range from 
providing housing and clothing to counseling if somebody just 
needs to talk were prepared to do that ferraez added 
nationwide the salvation army relies upon 12 million 
volunteers as measured against just 5000 paid workers low pay 
at that the organization has long had the reputation of directing 
the most of every donated dollar into services as opposed to 
administrative and fundraising costs 
the red cross mobilized hundreds of disaster workers and opened 
25 shelters when the quake struck distribution centers in los 
angeles sacramento and portland ore began shipping cots 
blankets and other supplies by wednesday morning 
in san francisco a downtown convention center housed more than 
1000 evacuees under red cross auspices more than 500 residents of 
the fireravaged marina area took refuge in a local middle school 
the red cross also transformed an airport terminal into a 
shelter and three nearby hotels the sheraton ramada and embassy 
suites turned over their lodgings to the agency other red cross 
shelters included one at san andreas high school bearing the name 
of the fault which triggered the calamity 
the red cross began its fiscal year july 1 with 185 million in 
its disaster budget and had spent 40 percent by september mostly 
on flood relief in texas then hugo came along triggering an 
effort the agency estimates will cost 42 million the most ever 
when a major earthquake and a major hurricane hit 
backtoback you can bet it will stretch red cross disaster 
resources and manpower said bob vessey director of disaster 
services

rebel leader jonas savimbi said wednesday he 
is optimistic that a ceasefire agreement with angolas marxist 
government can be revived before the end of the month 
savimbi speaking in a telephone interview with the associated 
press from the ivory coast also said there was a good possibility 
for a mutual release of war prisoners with the government 
the angolan peace process had been stalled following what 
appeared to be a breakthrough last june between savimbis unita 
rebel who receive us backing and the sovietsupported 
government among other measures the two sides reached agreement 
on a ceasefire to end their 14year conflict 
but fighting resumed within weeks and savimbi felt that the 
chief peace mediator president mobutu sese seko of zaire was 
taking sides with the mpla government there also were 
recriminations about whether savimbi had agreed to go into exile 
and to integrate his forces into the angolan army 
savimbi patched up his differences with mobutu during weekend 
meetings in paris following discussions in washington and he 
sounded more upbeat wednesday than he has at any time since the 
breakthrough in june 
he said he was optimistic the ceasefire could be back on track 
during this month of october he raised the possibility that 
some african nations might contribute troops to monitor the 
ceasefire if it is revived 
but even if a truce is agreed to the mpla and unita face the 
challenging task of reaching a political settlement with us 
support unita is calling for free and fair elections to be a key 
ingredient of the peace process 
the angolan government has a much narrower view of national 
reconciliation insisting that the existing constitution remain 
unchanged 
but savimbi said recent statements by senior angolan officials 
suggest a more flexible attitude on reconciliation 
they are not so intransigent as they were before said 
savimbi who stopped off in the ivory coast while en route to his 
home base in rebelheld southeast angola 
savimbi said there are between 3000 and 5000 mpla prisoners in 
unita hands he said the government has refused to disclose the 
number of rebel prisoners it holds 
the united states provides about 40 million to unita and bush 
administration officials were angry when savimbi declined to attend 
talks last month designed to reinstate the ceasefire 
savimbi agreed to resume his role in the peace process after 
talks with president bush on oct 5 in washington

boris n yeltsin the communist partys traveling 
maverick accused president mikhail s gorbachev on wednesday of 
directing a campaign of provocative tendentious lying 
statements to drive him out of politics 
in the past month yeltsin has been accused in print and on 
television of turning a us speaking tour into a drinking and 
spending spree and of showing up at a police station late at night 
dripping wet with an elaborate and false tale of an attempt to 
drown him 
yeltsin once was gorbachevs man at the helm of the moscow 
communist party but he was fired from there and the ruling 
politburo in 1987 after demanding faster reform and saying a 
personality cult could develop around his mentor 
he made a unique political comeback by winning 89 percent of the 
vote to represent moscow in the congress of peoples deputies 
a statement signed by yeltsin and distributed wednesday by his 
aides said of gorbachev at his command a whole series of 
provocative tendentious lying statements have been published in 
the soviet press and broadcast on television 
in may yeltsin said he spoke with gorbachev often by telephone 
at a closed party meeting friday gorbachev accused yeltsin and 
several other legislators who favor rapid change of forming a 
fascist clique striving for power said editors who attended 
yeltsins statement wednesday accused gorbachev of a political 
farce a new attempt to ruin my health and to knock me out of 
the sphere of political struggle 
i consider it unacceptable and dangerous to shift from 
political struggle to immoral and unscrupulous methods of moral and 
psychological elimination of opponents the statement said 
this will result in a complete breakup of moral and ethical 
principles curtailment of democratic principles of perestroika and 
finally to establishment of a cruel totalitarian regime 
it cited mondays report in the supreme soviet legislature 
broadcast on television of a police investigation of an alleged 
attack on yeltsins life 
interior minister vadim bakatin told the deputies yeltsin 
appeared at the police station late the night of sept 28 and said 
unidentified men had assaulted him and thrown him off a bridge into 
the moscow river 
bakatin said yeltsin then asked officers to tell no one about 
the incident but that they were dutybound to report it 
especially since they had a waterlogged man as evidence 
an investigation determined yeltsin could not have fallen 50 
feet into shallow water without injury bakatin said and yeltsin 
said sept 30 that no attack occurred 
in the supreme soviet the working legislature within the 
congress of peoples deputies yeltsin said he had not filed a 
written complaint and there had been no attempt on his life he did 
not address whether he had appeared at a police post soaking wet 
gorbachev summed up the discussion by saying yeltsin told the 
supreme soviet presidium he had been joking and the police 
misunderstood him 
adding to the mystery is the fact that yeltsin disappeared from 
both legislative and public view for two weeks he reappeared at a 
rally sunday and said he had been suffering from a cold

by smell and sound dogs and technicians 
searched wednesday for the last possible survivors of the killer 
bay quake and californians by the thousands picked their way 
through glassstrewn streets in search of a semblance of normal 
life 
across san francisco bay in oakland hopes faded for finding 
anyone alive within the tons of steel and concrete left when 
tuesdays earthquake brought one level of interstate 880 down atop 
another 
more than 250 people were feared entombed in that twisted 
wreckage and at least 18 others were dead elsewhere in the quake 
area some 650 people were injured said state emergency services 
spokesman john peterson 
to the best of our knowledge now there are not any people 
still alive on this freeway said oakland mayor lionel wilson 
said of the collapsed roadway 
searchers had been hindered by darkness and the condition of the 
wrecked freeway which acting oakland city manager craig kocian 
described as a house of cards that could collapse further at 
any time unless rescuers work carefully 
the 1 miles of the nimitz freeway that collapsed was one of 
oldest in the area built in 1950s and apparently was not included 
in a program to make spans earthquakeproof said state 
transportation department spokesman kyle nelson 
in just 15 seconds the earthquake destroyed or damaged hundreds 
of buildings along 100 miles of the san andreas fault collapsed a 
section of the san franciscooakland bay bridge and two spans near 
santa cruz cracked roads and severed gas and power lines 
sparking fires 
the temblor the nations seconddeadliest surpassed only by 
the san francisco earthquake of 1906 measured 69 on the richter 
scale and was felt 350 miles away 
even as residents and officials tried to evaluate the damage 
president bush signed a disaster declaration making federal funds 
available for recovery and said we will take every step and make 
every effort to help 
the president said he probably would fly to the area for a 
personal inspection but left open when that might happen vice 
president dan quayle and transportation secretary samuel skinner 
toured the quakeravaged area by helicopter wednesday 
the federal government normally pays at least 75 percent of the 
cost of rebuilding bridges and public facilities that are 
destroyed and provides lowcost loans the order covered seven 
counties 
the federal emergency management agency set up a center in 
washington and was trying to determine whether the relief order 
should be expanded 
lt gov leo mccarthy said damage was the better part of 1 
billion other estimates were in the billions in san francisco 
alone 
gov george deukmejian headed home from a trade mission to west 
germany 
in san franciscos marina district where a fire fueled by gas 
destroyed a block of 12 apartment buildings about 500 people 
packed a cafeteria at marina middle school for breakfast after 
spending the night on cots and mats 
deputy fire chief mike k farrell said he strongly suspected 
people were trapped in collapsed buildings were going to bring 
in dogs to see if people are trapped in there i saw three and 
fourstory buildings that are now onestory buildings 
los angeles donated sonic equipment to help detect any sounds of 
people trapped alive in rubble said scott shafer a spokesman for 
mayor art agnos nine people are known dead and i expect well 
find more bodies he said 
state sen milton marks of san francisco estimated damage in the 
marina area alone at 1 billion shafer said damage throughout the 
city would run into the billions 
the transportation system was crippled by the closing of the san 
franciscooakland bay bridge and agnos urged commuters to stay 
home wednesday 
tourist ferries that helped tuesday by giving commuters free 
rides to oakland charged the normal 4 on wednesday the oakland 
and san francisco international airports reopened and bart the 
rapid transit system was open 
virginia rose one of about 400 people who spent the night at an 
emergency red cross center said i have antiques silver and 
nice things but when you really get down to it and i never 
thought id feel this way these things dont matter the material 
things do not make life 
about 50 volunteers worked at the shelter and more walked in to 
offer their services wednesday morning people have been 
wonderful we had an incredible community response said marian 
richie a volunteer red cross nurse 
students from the university of san francisco visited the 
shelter tuesday night to ask what was needed went back to campus 
and returned with food cots and blankets richie said its an 
absolute grassroots response ive never seen anything like it 
people come up and say how can i help 
it looked like a sunday afternoon in san franciscos financial 
district with little visible damage though many buildings were 
closed a sign on the international building on california street 
the equivalent of new yorks wall street said building closed 
no power no exceptions 
more than 1 million people lost electricity including the 
financial district office of merrill lynch where operations 
manager joe centis said he arrived at 530 am and found wire room 
operator tom begley using a powersafe phone to call in orders that 
came in tuesday after the new york market closed 
officials said power in san francisco would be restored 
wednesday 
in oakland people picked their way to work through broken glass 
and broken buildings wednesday employees of american telephone amp 
telegraph like others waited outside their office while engineers 
inspected it 
if they let us in well be lucky said judy colwell who 
suffered a bone bruise on her arm during the quake water from a 
broken main still dripped from light fixtures on a third floor 
overhang of the buildings facade 
ironworkers at a highrise under construction near i880 were on 
standby to help untangle the wreckage of the highway the 
buildings temporary floors were askew and the workers elevator 
had fallen and lay embedded in the pavement 
we put it up so were going to have to go up and straighten 
it up jim osburn said of the building its always more 
dangerous to take it down than it is to take it up but somebody 
will have to go up there and make it safe 
while some people arrived for work others were finishing a long 
night 
ive been out here since 7 oclock said randy rogers one 
of three men shoveling fistsized chunks of fallen masonry into a 
pickup truck 
red cross volunteers began househunting for evacuees who spent 
the night in cafeterias and gymnasiums hopefully well have them 
all out in a couple of days said tekoa king a red cross nurse

the administration said wednesday its 
opposition to a senate proposal to mark the turkish mass killing of 
armenians earlier this century did not contradict president bushs 
campaign pledge to acknowledge the attempted genocide 
it isnt causing me any trouble state department 
spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said when asked about the apparent 
contradiction 
she said the administration hopes congress can respond to the 
concerns of the armenian people in a manner that does not gravely 
offend our vital ally and friend the republic of turkey 
the measure sponsored by senate republican leader bob dole of 
kansas would designate april 24 1990 as a day to mark the 
armenian genocide it has angered turkey because of its 
reference to genocide which turkey says falsely compares it 
with nazi germany 
turkey claims hundreds of thousands of armenians not 15 
million died from war famine and epidemics from 1915 to 1923 
in october 1988 bush used the term attempted genocide in 
response to a questionnaire from an armenian group 
the united states must acknowledge the attempted genocide of 
the armenian people in the last years of the ottoman empire based 
on the testimony of survivors scholars and indeed our own 
representatives at the time he said 
tutwiler said that despite the tragic suffering of the 
armenian people and the need to commemorate the victims of the 
period 1915 to 1923 we are equally mindful of our close 
relationship and strong friendship with turkey and of the differing 
views of how the terrible events of that period should properly be 
characterized 
the resolution cleared the senate judiciary committee on tuesday 
and has gone to the senate floor

the science of predicting earthquakes is 
still largely an exercise in probabilities with little warning 
possible when disaster is actually about to strike 
its difficult to make shortterm predictions said robert 
wesson chief of the office of earthquakes volcanoes and 
engineering at the us geological survey when asked if there were 
warning signs of tuesdays disastrous earthquake in northern 
california 
i would say there was a successful longterm prediction he 
said pointing out that a usgs report last year listed the region 
as a likely site for a major tremor unfortunately we didnt have 
any warning of this earthquake last night 
sometimes smaller shocks foreshadow a major quake and that may 
have happened in this case too although too far removed to make 
any shortterm prediction a quake estimated at 51 on the richter 
scale occurred on june 27 1988 and another rated at 52 struck on 
aug 8 of this year 
those events prompted the agency to pay increased attention to 
the loma prieta region and notify california officials but little 
could be done beyond that because there was no way to tell if the 
tremors were foreshocks or just individual quakes on their own 
using historical records measurements of ground motion and 
other analyses scientists are able to single out places where they 
believe tremors will strike 
such predictions are not useful in evacuating dangerous 
buildings but they are useful in land use planning and resource 
allocation in anticipation of future events said wesson 
in addition to the region that was struck on tuesday the nearby 
hayward fault has been identified as a likely site for a serious 
quake and an even stronger tremor seems probable for the southern 
california portion of the san andreas fault the same one that 
moved this time 
whether this quake will trigger other major ones remains to be 
seen however 
dave russ assistant chief geologist at the survey explained 
that quakes occurring along faults in the earth release stress that 
builds up over time when this movement releases stress in one area 
the strain can be increased elsewhere 
in california the san andreas fault is the major problem region 
marking the spot where two of the giant plates that make up the 
earths crust are moving alongside one another 
several miles below the surface the pressure and heat make the 
rocks like plastic and they can slip past one another russ 
explained but the cooler surface rocks grind and lock together 
over time strain builds up until the surface rocks slip in an 
earthquake moving to catch up with the deep layers below russ 
said 
such a movement always triggers thousands of smaller aftershocks 
as the many rocks along the fault line adjust themselves and there 
remains the chance of strong aftershocks he said

the wests efforts to withhold 
sensitive technology from the soviet union have hurt the countrys 
economy the soviet ambassador to the european community said 
wednesday 
vladimir shemiatenkov the kremlins first ambassador to the 
trading bloc said the western panel that screens hightech sales 
to the soviet union is obsolete nowadays it is very clear 
shemiatenkov said the restrictions hinder the soviet unions 
efforts to reach a trade agreement with the 12nation european 
economic community 
the united states and 15 of its allies belong to the 
coordinating committee on multilateral export controls which 
controls products that could contribute to the military might of 
the wests adversaries 
some western nations believe the restrictions should be eased 
with the warming of relations between east and west 
shemiatenkov said the hightech restrictions have not 
prevented us from developing advanced military techniques but in 
order to achieve that level we had to allocate much greater 
resources to defense than otherwise 
but at the same time it was a very powerful factor in 
disfiguring our internal development and i think in constraining 
the development of international trade he said 
because of the barriers he said some western companies have 
been unable to sell telecommunications equipment to the soviet 
union to help improve the exceptionally weak phone system 
however shemiatenkov said moscow was very satisfied with 
progress overall in negotiating the trade agreement with the 
european trading bloc 
the accord would be the fourth between the community and an east 
bloc country since a thaw in relations a little more than a year 
ago the trading bloc recently signed a pact with poland after 
earlier arrangements with hungary and czechoslovakia 
for many years we have more or less underestimated the impact 
of the west european integration said shemiatenkov 
community officials have suggested the negotiations with moscow 
could be wrapped up by years end but shemiatenkov would not make a 
prediction 
he confirmed the sides were at odds over the communitys 
insistence on considering the soviet union a state trading country 
rather than a market the european community is able to impose 
price restrictions on imports of state trading countries 
shemiatenkov said the description was a major problem for 
our integration to the world economy he said it could require 
the government to set export prices at artificially low levels so 
they would not create disadvantages for other community trading 
partners 
the situation with the soviet union today is such that the 
government does not control prices in foreign transactions 
he said 
to do so now officials would have to reverse the situation 
and reinstitute the government control over prices he said 
this is outright fantasy it would be contrary to the very 
spirit of our reform because we want to have decentralization he 
said

united nations cuba was elected to the security council on 
wednesday for the first time since fidel castros guerrillas from 
the sierra maestra took over the country in 1959 
diplomats said election to the most powerful un body was a 
sign of the increasing respectability and importance of the 
caribbean communist nation which still is subject to a us trade 
embargo 
the united states did not openly oppose the choice of cuba as 
the latin american council delegate it expressed hope the cubans 
would act constructively on the council and called on them to 
respect the central american peace accords and not interfere in 
regional affairs 
castros cuba tried for membership on the 15nation security 
council once before in 1979 but was blocked by the united states 
when cuba was elected in 1956 dictator fulgencio batista ruled the 
island 
cuba and four other nonpermanent council members were elected 
for twoyear terms in a secret general assembly ballot cuba 
replaces brazil the other new members are the ivory coast 
replacing algeria zaire replacing senegal romania replacing 
yugoslavia and south yemen replacing nepal 
all were chosen by consensus of their regional groups 
canada colombia ethiopia finland and malaysia whose terms 
expire next year are the other nonpermanant council members the 
permanent members who have veto power are the united states 
soviet union britain china and france 
washington consistently has opposed cuba in international 
forums criticized its human rights record and accused it of 
subversion and military involvement in latin america 
the state department said in a statement about cubas election 
we hope it will recognize that it has a special responsibility 
as a member of the security council to act constructively to end 
regional conflicts not contribute to them 
cuba should bear in mind that the central american presidents 
have asked the un to create a force to ensure that no state 
provides support to irregular forces which includes the 
farabundo marti liberation front known as fmln 
we call upon its government to behave in a manner consistent 
with the un charter and a resolution which calls on member 
states to comply with the provisions of the guatemala agreement 
and of the joint declaration particularly that regional and 
extraregional governments which either openly or covertly supply 
aid to irregular forces or insurrectional movements in the area 
immediately halt such aid 
cuba had competed with guatemala for the latin american council 
seat but guatemala withdrew in may

development is seeking to recover about 700000 from a former 
reagan campaign adviser and his partners in a georgia project and 
also has a dispute with the group over another development a hud 
official said wednesday 
the decision to ask the partnership to forfeit about 700000 is 
a reversal of an unusual decision made earlier this year at hud 
headquarters that has piqued the interest of congressional 
investigators reviewing allegations of political favoritism at hud 
during the reagan administration 
the department now will seek repayment from the owners of the 
cypress mill plantation in brunswick ga including edward 
weidenfeld legal counsel to reagans 1980 campaign and an adviser 
to his 1984 reelection effort

hud auditors questioned more than 750000 of the projects 
costs alleging that a construction company in which two of the 
partners were principals was not entitled to some profits and 
overhead it received and that the partners had not invested enough 
of their own money 
but r hunter cushing a deputy undersecretary at hud 
headquarters earlier this year reduced the amount to 88000 
it just came out of nowhere zittrauer said of cushings 
decision it obviously was the result of some meeting between the 
developers and people at headquarters 
cushing left hud when the bush administration took office and 
was named to a commerce department post but he resigned that job 
after he refused to testify before the congressional review three 
other former agency officials including former hud secretary 
samuel pierce also have refused to testify 
zittrauer said he was informed by c austin fitts the 
departments new assistant secretary for housing that she 
supported the results of the audit and that the money should be 
recovered they apparently realized that what we had done was 
consistent with department guidelines and policies he said 
if recovered some of the money will be returned to the federal 
government some to the project for operating expenses and some to 
the city of brunswick which gave the developers a grant zittrauer 
said 
the second dispute with the partnership involves a savannah 
project plantation oaks and also involves among other things 
questionable costs submitted by the construction company involving 
the partners zittrauer said he said a hud has not made a final 
decision on how much to contest in this case and said the dispute 
would be easier to resolve because there are reserve and other 
accounts from which hud could recover money

faced with a mounting budget deficit the 
new solidarityled government wednesday announced plans to cut 
military spending and reduce subsidies to the coal industry 
deputy finance minister wojciech misiag said the government also 
planned to begin selling state treasury bonds which in the future 
could be converted into ownership shares of staterun industries 
that become private 
the government is considering shifting resources such as food 
and medicine currently allocated to the military and interior 
ministries to the civilian sector misiag said direct cuts would 
also be made in both ministries 
however the deputy finance minster speaking at a news 
conference said he could not immediately specify the size of the 
military cutbacks last year the defense ministry budget was about 
365 million 
misiag said the changes in coal subsidies alone effective nov 
1 could result in an annual savings to the government of up to 
571 million the sales of bonds could raise 380 million 
because coal subsidies are to be reduced misiag said the price 
of energy including hot water and central heating will have to be 
increased for consumers 
the government has taken no final decisions yet but misiag said 
that the increases in energy prices would be in the range of 140 
percent 
without being specific misiag said the level of subsidies to 
the coal industry until the end of the year would be maintained at 
a level that covers the cost of coal extraction and allows a 
certain profitability 
he said radical transformations in the organization of the coal 
mining sectors were planned in the future 
the budget deficit currently is 232 billion and the government 
said it would reach 438 billion by the end of the year if it did 
nothing to save money and meet the current level of obligations 
the goal of the cutbacks is to reduce the deficit to 22 
billion by the end of the year 
the solidarity government inherited the unbalanced budget sept 
12 when it assumed responsibility as the first noncommunist 
government in the east bloc it has been seeking ways to control 
spending ever since 
the budget gap is considered one of the main engines fueling 
rocketing inflation which was running at an annual rate of 600 
percent in august 
on monday in an attempt to slow the flow of money parliament 
passed curbs on automatic wage increases 
the government said some limit on pay increases was needed to 
reign in soaring inflation

an agriculture department report said 
wednesday that the share of commodity marketings by farm 
cooperatives has declined from levels of the early 1980s 
in 1987 the most recent year examined coops accounted for 25 
percent of farm marketings down from 27 percent in 1985 and 28 
percent in 1982 
grain marketings by cooperatives were reported at 29 percent of 
the total down from 33 percent in 1985 and 36 percent in 1982 
that includes sales of oilseeds except cottonseed 
much of the decline has been the result of less cooperative 
involvement in grain and oilseeds marketing said the report by 
the departments agricultural cooperative service 
the coop share of milk marketed was 76 percent in 1987 
compared with 78 percent in 1985 and 77 percent in 1982 cotton 
marketings were 38 percent 33 percent and 36 percent 
respectively and livestock 7 percent 8 percent and 11 percent 
fruit and vegetable marketings by coops accounted for 23 
percent of the total in 1987 up from 8 percent in 1985 and 11 
percent in 1982 
cooperative shares of production supplies sold to farmers also 
dropped by similar percentages to 25 percent in 1987 from 27 
percent in 1985 and 28 percent in 1982 the report said however 
not all items declined accordingly 
supplies included fertilizer 43 percent of the total in 1987 
44 percent in 1985 and 42 percent in 1982 petroleum 37 percent 
44 percent and 36 percent farm chemicals 28 percent 29 percent

federal agencies should do more to alleviate 
the nonmonetary reasons that senior executives cite when 
explaining why they left government work the merit systems 
protection board said wednesday 
at the same time it said lack of adequate pay remains the most 
commonly cited reason why members of the senior executive service 
decide to leave government work 
the board released the results of a questionnaire survey of 956 
senior executives who left government over a 5 year period ending 
june 30 1988 
the ceiling on senior executive service salaries currently 
80700 a year was among reasons for leaving given by 57 percent 
of those responding to the survey according to a summary of the 
findings 
it said the average privatesector salary of former senior 
executives who continued to work either part time or full time 
was 101152 
but the report said nonmonetary reasons also were frequently 
cited by the executives who decided to leave government among them 
48 percent left in part because they believe the ses is not 
being administered in a fashion which protects senior executives 
from improper political interference 
46 percent left in part because they no longer enjoyed their 
jobs 
42 percent left in part because their knowledge and skills 
had not been used appropriately and 
38 percent left in part because of the incompetence of their 
immediate supervisors 
the boards report noted that agencies expend considerable 
effort in selecting the most qualified candidates for career 
positions in the senior executive service they should expend more 
effort in attempting to retain them 
agencies cannot force the political process to establish 
adequate ses compensation it said nor can agencies prevent 
executives who have earned the right to retire from doing so 
however agencies can work to reduce ses turnover by attempting to 
alleviate nonmonetary causes of ses dissatisfaction 
the merit systems protection board is an independent 
quasijudicial agency with responsibility for deciding federal 
employee appeals from personnel actions taken against them 
as a part of its mission the board is responsible for 
conducting studies of the civil service and other merit systems and 
for reviewing actions of the office of personnel management

the state department condemned on wednesday 
the slaying in el salvador of the 23year old daughter of a 
military officer suggesting that leftist rebels were responsible 
this was not a political act but murder pure and simple 
said department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
while not directly accusing the fmln guerrillas ms tutwiler 
said the rebel group has become known for this type of crime 
she blamed the fmln for the recent slaying of the wife and son 
of a conservative newspaper editor and for killing eight salvadoran 
army recruits three weeks ago 
the governments of nicaragua and cuba have supplied the fmln 
with the weapons and training to conduct this continuing reign of 
terror and they bear responsibility for these crimes ms tutwiler 
said 
the fmln tells the press that such barbarities are 
unauthorized by the guerrilla command in fact the assassination 
teams are trained equipped and directed by the fmln command

earthquake victims in california 
i know we still have and will have great needs here and 
charity certainly begins at home mayor joseph p riley jr said

several of his officers to northern california to help with 
emergency operations 
in addition the city has set up a california earthquake

soviet legislators were barred on wednesday from 
defending a daring newspaper editor president mikhail s gorbachev 
wants dismissed one deputy reported 
nikolai a kutsenko a lawmaker from the ukraine said the group 
will submit a petition signed by 34 legislators charging gorbachev 
with using pressure tactics that contradict his own reforms 
kutsenko said supreme soviet leaders would not permit the 
defense of vladislav a starkov editor of the weekly arguments and 
facts because they viewed his case as a matter for the communist 
party rather than the government 
starkovs tabloid has been at the forefront of gorbachevs 
policy of glasnost or openness 
kutsenko said he wanted to speak for starkov on wednesday but 
was told he could not have the floor by gorbachevs handpicked 
vice president anatoly i lukyanov and the chairmen of the 
legislatures two houses rafik n nishanov and yevgeny m primakov 
the petition he hoped to read accuses gorbachev of trying to 
discredit arguments and facts kutsenko said lukyanov also refused 
to recognize him on tuesday 
gorbachev lashed out at selected editors at a closed communist 
party meeting friday he apparently was trying to regain some 
control over the press which has carried daily reports criticizing 
the system and sometimes its leaders 
journalists quoting their bosses who attended and asking not to 
be identified said gorbachev accused starkov and others of seeking 
his political downfall 
yegor yakovlev chief editor of the weekly moscow news wrote in 
the current issue wednesday that gorbachev said the country was 
at the peak of tension with passions flaring over economic 
crisis and ethnic strife 
he blamed the press for warning of famine a coup or plot and 
accused it of offering anticommunist views demanding instead that 
the press make a sober analysis of events yakovlevs article said 
human rights activist andrei d sakharov called wednesday for 
journalists around the world to stand up for starkov 
in an interview wednesday the 1975 nobel peace prize laureate 
also urged the supreme soviet to strip the communist party of its 
constitutional monopoly on power he called it an anachronism 
most lawmakers appeared to dismiss the idea 
journalists speaking on condition of anonymity said top 
broadcast officials barred sakharov at the last minute from 
appearing live on last fridays popular television show vzglyad 
also on wednesday the supreme soviet gave preliminary approval 
to a bill that would give local governing councils more power to 
control the economies in their areas it would also give the 
councils known as soviets the power to levy local income taxes

the house refused wednesday to endorse a 
slimmeddown deficitreduction bill that includes a cut in the 
capitalgains tax but no improvement in childcare benefits 
the nonbinding 228181 vote was against a republican motion 
that would have instructed house negotiators to strip from the 
deficit bill virtually all spending increases and tax reductions 
however the bill would have retained provisions repealing 
catastrophic medical protection for retirees and wiping out a law 
requiring that employerpaid health insurance not discriminate 
against lowerpaid workers 
it is hard for us to conceive of a budget bill fatter than 
this one said rep bill frenzel of minnesota senior republican 
on the house budget committee in arguing for the motion to trim 
the measure 
rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of the house ways and 
means committee accused republicans of talking from both sides of 
their mouths by arguing for a leaner bill while insisting on repeal 
of the two healthinsurance provisions 
rostenkowski accused president bush of sitting on the sidelines 
in the budget fight content to provide absolutely no leadership 
on real deficit reduction leaving his top advisers to the 
collective pursuit of shortterm gratification and pursuing 
shallow political victories and bankrupt budget policies 
rostenkowskis remarks were aimed at bushs insistence that 
taxes on capital gains be cut the house voted last month for such 
a cut over opposition from democratic leaders 
negotiators from the senate and house will work out a compromise 
between the competing deficitreduction plans passed by the two 
chambers 
the senate bill is a lean version that contains neither the 
capitalgains reduction nor repeal of the health provisions 
the house approved those three items in the bill by lopsided 
margins thus it would be difficult for house negotiators to drop 
them from the final compromise unless given assurances that they 
could be added to some other bill later this year

a lawmaker active in the civil rights movement 
urged the senate on wednesday to remove judge alcee l hastings 
from the bench saying floridas first black federal judge 
betrayed his position of leadership 
there have been a lot or cases in our judicial system in which 
race has been a problem said rep john conyers dmich as 
final arguments began in the senate impeachment trial this isnt 
one of them or i would be the first to tell you so 
we did not wage the civil rights struggle in order to trade 
one form of judicial corruption for another conyers said he 
said a federal judgeship entailed trust and hastings had betrayed 
that strust and betrayed those who looked to him for leadership 
house members act as prosecutors in such proceedings if the 
senate votes to remove hastings from office he would be the sixth 
federal official to be removed in such a fashion 
hastings 53 is accused of conspiring to obtain a 150000 
payoff and lying to a federal jury that acquitted him of it five 
years ago the senate heard closing arguments in the case on 
wednesday 
the senate plans to deliberate the evidence behind closed doors 
on thursday and later vote on whether to remove him from the bench 
hastings taking the senate floor once again denied that he had 
taken part in a payoff plot 
i am not guilty of having committed any crime that is my 
defense hastings said please act fairly 
hastings disputed a statement by conyers that race would be at 
the core of his defense hastings had however told a news 
conference only a day earlier that he would not have been awaiting 
removal from office if he had been white 
the house prosecutors urged the senate to ignore hastings 
acquittal in 1983 saying he lied they also dismissed defense 
complaints that the impeachment trial is a second trial for 
hastings violating the prohibition against double jeopardy 
hastings would be removed as a judge immediately upon conviction 
by the senate on any one of the 17 articles of impeachment approved 
by the house 
conviction would not only remove hastings from the federal bench 
but also halt payment of the 89500 judicial salary that he 
continues to collect

a new drug believed 50 to 100 times more 
powerful in preventing organ rejection might cut transplant costs 
and ease critical shortages of donor organs doctors said wednesday 
the biggest bonus is better survival said dr thomas e 
starzl head of the university of pittsburghs transplant program 
starzl heads the worlds only clinical trials of the japanese 
drug fk506 as of wednesday 111 transplant patients had received 
the experimental medication including a few children 
fk506 is far more effective and safer than cyclosporine the 
major antirejection drug now being used starzl said he estimated 
it to be 50 to 100 times more potent 
although we are idolaters of cyclosporine and have been in 
fact one of the prime developers of cyclosporine weve always 
realized its limitations practically from week two onward starzl 
said at a news conference 
theres a prospect now of doing things that couldnt be done 
previously such as intestinal transplants and ultimately 
crossspecies transplants starzl said 
the new drug shows promise in treating certain liver diseases 
thus eliminating the need for a transplant said dr david van 
thiel medical director of transplantation at the university of 
pittsburgh it also holds promise for treating rheumatoid 
arthritis multiple sclerosis and other disorders impairing the 
immune system 
dr robert corry president of the united network for organ 
sharing said he has not yet reviewed the findings but has every 
reason to believe that dr starzl is correct 
the drugs potential became apparent within only eight months of 
use on humans 
were shocked by it because it went so fast it was like 
throwing a gasoline bomb said starzl who will report his 
findings in an upcoming edition of the british medical journal 
lancet and at a scientific meeting oct 31 in spain 
starzl performed the worlds first liver transplant in 1963 and 
pioneered the use of cyclosporine in the early 1980s he first 
tried fk506 on a patient in february 
of the 111 patients 102 have been liver recipients said dr 
john fung a starzl colleague the rest have been heart kidney 
pancreas and lung recipients 
with cyclosporine the oneyear success rate of liver 
transplants has been 75 percent to 80 percent a rate that could 
rise to nearly 100 percent with fk506 starzl said the new drug 
also might lessen the need for two or more transplants in a single 
patient freeing organs for other recipients 
it really wasnt much of a decision to try fk506 said 
henry weber 37 of watertown ny one of the patients who used 
the drug i knew what the effects of cyclosporine were for the 
long run 
of the approximately 40 patients who started immediately on 
fk506 without having received cyclosporine none needed a second 
transplant or had kidney failure a leading side effect of 
cyclosporine 
fk506 could reduce the cost of a liver transplant which now 
exceeds 200000 by more than onethird because of speedier 
recovery and less need for blood tests to monitor the drugs 
effectiveness 
theoretically it should improve the donor supply in that 
people might be more accepting of transplantation with much better 
results corry said 
as of monday 18453 people were awaiting organ transplants in 
the united states the network said there were 12798 organ 
transplants performed in the nation last year 
researchers assume fk506 like other antirejection drugs will 
increase patients risk of getting cancer that risk however 
probably will not be enough to cancel the effect and usefulness 
of this drug starzl said 
while fk506 causes nausea stomach pains and headaches during 
the first few days when the drug is administered intravenously 
those side effects virtually disappear once oral treatment begins 
most patients take the drug daily but a few need it just once 
every three days and one person only once a week most 
antirejection drugs must be taken for life 
the us food and drug administration wants to consider the drug 
further before determining whether to allow wider use of it 
fk506 derived from a fungus found in japan is made by fujisawa 
pharmaceutical co ltd of osaka 
starzl is cautious about proceeding too quickly 
our fear is weve been so close to the drug and fueled by 
hope he said we dont want to be snowballed into this

the center for population options on wednesday 
called for massive public education and prevention programs to stem 
the rapid spread of aids among teenagers 
the center said schools churches community organizations and 
parents must do a better job correcting misinformation about aids 
helping teenagers delay sexual intercourse ensuring that those 
who do have sex use condoms and warning teenagers about the 
dangers of drug use 
our children have a right to straightforward accurate 
information about hiv infection and how to prevent it said a 
report issued by the nonprofit educational center and partially 
funded by the centers for disease control 
the number of aids cases among teenagers jumped by 43 percent 
to 398 between july 1988 and july 1989 according to the cdc 
but because the time between infection and the onset of aids can 
be as long as 10 years public health officials believe that many 
people with aids who are now in their 20s may have picked up the 
virus when they were teenagers 
the report also says cdcs figures also show that a greater 
proportion of adolescents than adults with aids is female 19 
percent for teenagers compared with 9 percent among adults 
wanda wigfallwilliams director of the centers aids programs 
said the figures show that the projected spread of the virus among 
heterosexuals is becoming a reality among adolescents 
the centers report says hiv programs should vary in content and 
format depending on the audience intended to be reached but each 
program should emphasize certain basic information including how 
the human immunodeficiency virus or hiv is transmitted how it is 
not transmitted and how to protect against infection including 
abstaining from sexual intercourse and use of condoms by those who 
do have sex 
but the report advises simply providing young people with 
facts is not enough correct and precise language should be used 
to describe everything from risky sexual practices to proper use of 
condoms the report said 
the report also suggests that health clinics make condoms 
available to young people and that hiv prevention programs 
encourage effective condom use by getting teenagers comfortable 
talking about and buying condoms 
the report emphasizing the risk of aids to teenagers cites 
studies showing that teenagers on average begin sexual intercourse 
at about age 16 and that each year one in six teenagers contracts 
a sexuallytransmitted disease and more than 1 million teenage 
girls become pregnant 
drug and alcohol use is also implicated in the spread because 
they make it less likely a young person will protect themselves 
during sex and through addiction often lead to sex in exchange 
for money or drugs the report said

walter sisulu was mocked by guards 
stripsearched and forced to break rocks in a quarry during 26 
years in prison but news of the struggle against apartheid kept 
him from despair 
i never had the feeling i was at the lowest the 77yearold 
african national congress leader said wednesday there were 
moments i felt very much in high spirits every time there was a 
movement a strike on the outside 
sisulu and two anc colleagues elias motsoaledi and ahmed 
kathrada recalled prison life during an interview at a soweto 
church with american journalists 
they and senior anc leader nelson mandela were convicted of 
planning antigovernment sabotage and sentenced to life terms in 
1964 mandela remains in prison but sisulu motsoaledi kathrada 
and two others sentenced with them were among eight longterm 
political prisoners freed unconditionally sunday 
the anc is the biggest group fighting white domination in south 
africa 
after their convictions the anc leaders were sent to a 
maximumsecurity prison on robben island off cape town 
at the early stages they guards went out of their way as 
they openly stated to us to crush us to break our morale said 
kathrada 60 they tried to instill into our minds that we would 
be forgotten factors in a few years time 
he recalled a jailer with a swastika tattoo who said ive 
come to fight a war 
we started off chopping stones breaking big stones into small 
stones and small stones into smaller stones kathrada said in 
1965 we started working at a lime quarry with picks and shovels 
that continued for 10 years 
he and other prisoners of indian descent and those of mixed 
race initially were treated better than black prisoners kathrada 
said sisulu and other blacks were forced to wear short pants even 
in winter were not provided with socks and were not given bread 
he told reporters 
sisulu said we used to come back from work on very cold days 
no hot water we stripped naked outside then passed through a 
cold shower of sea water 
at one stage sisulu was deprived of solid food for three days 
and mandela for six because prison authorities decided they had not 
worked hard enough 
in may 1971 proindependence guerrillas from namibia were 
transferred to robben island and clashed with guards kathrada said 
we embarked on a hunger strike and they decided to punish us 
further he said they came one night many of them very drunk 
and they stripped us all naked we faced the wall this was a 
simple question of wanting to humiliate and punish us 
an older prisoner govan mbeki almost suffered a heart attack 
kathrada said but the hunger strike continued 
we were meeting the oppressor at close hand he said it 
helped to keep us united what kept our morale up was our 
confidence in our beliefs confidence that we are going to 
triumph sooner or later of that we had no doubt at any stage 
pressure by prisoners eventually ended the discrimination 
between racial groups and won other concessions including 
permission to study and engage in sports kathrada said they were 
allowed newspapers in 1980 and radio and television in 1986 
he expressed gratitude to the international red cross and to 
helen suzman an opposition member of parliament who is now 
retired for campaigning on behalf of the prisoners 
before the liberalization kathrada said political prisoners 
gave top priority to keeping themselves informed in one way or 
another begging stealing buying bribing we tried to 
smuggle in things too letters visits just about everything 
news often was months late in 1976 prisoners who arrived in 
august told them of the uprising by soweto schoolchildren in june 
that started nationwide unrest 
sisulu cited that uprising as one of the most dramatic events of 
his imprisonment 
it was inspiring to see the children taking a position to say 
thus far and no further were tired of your oppression he 
said it boosted our spirits 
motsoaledi 65 said he learned with shock that three friends of 
his children were killed in the aftermath of the june 1976 
uprising he said three of his six children went into exile like 
thousands of other young blacks who supported the african national 
congress 
sisulus family has been hit particularly hard by political 
turmoil his wife albertina is under restrictions one son is in 
jail another was detained for two years and two children are in 
exile

a maverick democrats victory in a 
mississippi congressional race gave the states house delegation a 
oneparty look and saddled republicans with their fifth loss in 
seven special elections this year 
state sen gene taylors victory tuesday over republican tom 
anderson gave the state its first alldemocrat house delegation in 
17 years 
gene was just an excellent candidate for this time state 
democratic chairman ed cole said wednesday but the lesson to the 
party is that if youve got a process thats open and fair the 
people will tell you who they want 
taylor 36 garnered 65 percent of the vote and carried 11 of 
the 12 counties in the 5th district which includes the gulf coast 
anderson a top aide to republican us sen trent lott was making 
his first bid for public office 
taylor won 82855 votes to andersons 44377 in unofficial 
totals 
taylor who is to be sworn in next week will serve 14 months 
succeeding republican freshman rep larkin smith who was killed in 
an aug 13 plane crash 
national democratic party chairman ron brown said taylors 
election was yet another signal that the supposed republican 
realignment in the south does not exist 
this is a district that the republican party wanted so 
desperately that george bush personally campaigned for trent lotts 
handpicked candidate brown said 
democrats had accused lott of forcing smiths widow from the 
race after she had made public her intention to run she eventually 
backed anderson 
i think realistically something very american happened 
taylor said the citizens chose a candidate rather than the big 
power brokers in washington and the big money interests 
the seat had been in gop hands since lott won it in 1972 he was 
elected to the senate in 1988 
republicans were assessing the loss wednesday 
i think the longterm ramifications of it are neglible said 
haley barbour republican national committeeman for mississippi 
voters vote for who they think is the best candidate from a 
party point of view its no surprise he said from washington 
rep guy vander jagt rmich chairman of the republican 
congressional campaign committee said the gops special election 
losses this year showed that voters choose democratic candidates 
who reject the liberalism of the national democratic party 
the candidate who best captures the local agenda is the one 
who will win he said

the us fish and wildlife service has 
proposed opening the forests surrounding yellowstone national park 
to limited hunting of grizzly bears that pose threats to people or 
livestock 
the proposal appeared in the federal register tuesday opening a 
60day public comment period 
grizzly bears a threatened species in the lower 48 states are 
now protected under the federal endangered species act though 
limited hunting is allowed in northwest montana 
the fish and wildlife proposal if approved would allow hunting 
of nuisance grizzlies including those that leave yellowstone and 
grand teton national parks in an area of more than 10 million 
acres in the forests of southwest montana northwest wyoming and 
eastern idaho 
nuisance grizzlies are defined as those that threaten human 
safety have killed or injured livestock or that cant reasonably 
be controlled by trapping or removal from a location said a us 
fish and wildlife spokeswoman in washington 
a wyoming game and fish official who helped originate the 
proposal said it would merely extend to wyoming and idaho the 
option granted years ago to montana in the area around glacier 
national park 
nuisance grizzlies near yellowstone are now killed by state game 
wardens said john talbott of the wyoming game and fish department 
talbott is chairman of the yellowstone ecosystem grizzly bear 
subcommittee of the interagency grizzly bear committee made up of 
state and federal wildlife officials 
what were looking at is rather than the agency doing that 
well just provide an opportunity for the sportsman to harvest that 
bear talbott said 
but michael scott a wilderness society official in bozeman 
said the hunt could pose a conflict of interest for wildlife 
managers 
this would be an opportunity for the state to make some 
money scott said he feared biologists could unconsciously 
declare a difficult grizzly a nuisance bear so that it could be 
hunted and the state would profit 
the whole rationale for allowing a hunt of this type is to 
give people the thrill of hunting scott said tuesday 
talbott said he knew of only one case in the past five years in 
which a problem grizzly was killed in wyoming 
in montana two hunts for nuisance grizzlies have been held in 
the past three years near glacier and one grizzly was killed said 
ron marcoux deputy director of fish wildlife and parks in helena 
montana law allows no more than 25 mancaused grizzly deaths a 
year a limited state hunting season along the northern rocky 
mountain front extends from oct 1 through nov 26 and is closed 
earlier if the bear toll reaches 25 said fish wildlife and parks 
spokesman don bianchi of bozeman

former president ford said wednesday 
his pardon of richard nixon was absolutely the right thing to 
do although the watergate scandal may have cost him the 1976 
election 
questioned by 100 schoolchildren about the pardon ford said it 
was the only way to end national divisions he said the healing 
process after nixons resignation as president will be the legacy 
of fords brief administration 
i was spending 25 percent of my time on the problems of one 
man at a time when i should have been spending 100 percent of my 
time on the problems of 240 million americans ford said 
the only way for me to get rid of the problems of one man was 
to pardon mr nixon he said it was absolutely the right 
decision im more convinced now than i was then it was the right 
thing to do 
the watergate scandal developed well before ford was appointed 
vice president but he said it was costly to him 
it was a tragedy ford said i suspect that people voted 
against me because of the existence of the watergate scandal 
ford was questioning by the iowa children in a quaker meeting 
house on the grounds of the herbert hoover national historic site 
earlier wednesday he spoke at a forum at the herbert hoover 
presidential library on the role former presidents should play in 
american government 
ford argued against a formal role for expresidents ford is one 
of four living former presidents who also include nixon jimmy 
carter and ronald reagan 
frankly i dont see the value in formalizing the role of 
expresidents ford said let expresidents decide what 
interest to pursue what contributions to make on their own 
ford said he spends his time lecturing on the college circuit 
campaigning for republican candidates and pursuing business 
opportunities 
carter and ford sent president bush a variety of recommendations 
in november 1988 before bush took office but ford said they were 
largely ignored the proposals were intended to help with bushs 
transition from vice president to president 
president bush made no comment on it and as far as i know 
none of it has been implemented ford said i felt an adverse 
reaction from his own staff i was somewhat disappointed 
among the proposals from ford and carter were ways to solve the 
nations savings and loan crisis and ways to reduce the federal 
deficit by cutting spending and raising taxes on beer wine 
cigarettes and motor fuel

erich honecker rose to power in east germany after 
sealing a workers exodus to the west by building the berlin wall 
in 1961 but his deaf ear to public cries for more democracy led to 
a second exodus and he was through 
honecker 77 was removed from leadership wednesday after 18 
years as communist party chief 
he oversaw the building of socialisms strongest economy and a 
period of steadily improved relations with both east and west 
but the short bespectacled communist failed to fall in step 
with the new march of communism in eastern europe 
the east berlin government under honecker defended chinas 
bloody crackdown of the prodemocracy movement in june and violent 
clashes between security forces and demonstrators were reported in 
major east german cities during and after soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachevs visit oct 67 to east berlin 
when tens of thousands took to the streets of leipzig to demand 
the kinds of reforms sweeping poland hungary and the soviet union 
honeckers state media branded them hooligans 
more than 53000 others lost faith the system could be changed 
under honecker or his handpicked successor and fled to west 
germany over the past two months 
honeckers health was blamed for his departure he is known to 
have suffered complications from gallbladder surgery this past 
summer west german intelligence reports said he has cancer 
but his outmoded views of socialist dictates probably inflicted 
more damage than any illness 
under honecker east german border guards for years had orders 
to shoot anyone who tried to flee the country at least 91 people 
were shot to death after the berlin wall went up in 1961 to cut off 
an escape route to the west 
honecker born in what is now west germany rejected all 
suggestions that the two germanys be reunited socialism and 
capitalism can be no more united than fire and water he 
commented during his historic visit to west germany in 1987 
after rising to party leadership in 1971 honecker adopted a 
policy of tolerance toward the protestant church and pursued a 
brand of consumer socialism that gave his people the east 
blocs most advanced standard of living however the economy lags 
far behind that of west germany and most western nations 
unlike his stalinist predecessor walter ulbricht honecker 
showed interest in detente and improved relations with west germany 
but his repression of political dissent his role in building 
the berlin wall and his maintenance of fortresslike borders with 
west germany signaled the limits of moderation in east germany 
little is known of honeckers personal life except he divorced 
his first wife to marry margot feist who now is education minister 
honecker was born aug 25 1912 in saarland and joined a 
communist youth group at age 14 
the nazis imprisoned him in 1935 and he didnt get out until the 
invading soviet red army arrived a decade later 
honecker caught ulbrichts eye in the fledgling postwar regime 
created in 1949 in the soviet occupation zone of the defeated third 
reich 
in 1958 he gained his first powerful government posts rising 
to membership in the ruling politburo and becoming a central 
committee secretary with responsibility for state security 
in 1961 ulbricht assigned honecker to direct construction of 
the berlin wall 
as late as this year honecker said the wall would remain as 
long as the reasons for its construction persist the loss of 
crucial labor capacity to the west

neighbors who had feared for each others 
lives embraced cheerfully wednesday as they surveyed their ruined 
homes and tourists swapped stories about how they survived the 
killer earthquake 
neil hancock comforted maryellen sechser his upstairs neighbor 
in what had been a 21unit apartment building in the marina 
district the building toppled and caught fire after tuesdays 
quake and three people were feared dead 
she is the first one ive seen since last night hancock 
said 
the two stood among a crowd at divisadero and beach streets 
watching firefighters hose water over the blackened remains of the 
building 
when i got here the whole building collapsed i could see into 
my apartment sechser said fighting back tears she watched 
helplessly as the flames came up through the floor of her ruined 
living room 
the worst thing was not knowing if her neighbors many of them 
elderly were all right she said 
i thought people were still in the building i couldnt save 
anyone i couldnt save the animals i couldnt save anything 
sechser said i lost everything what you see is all ive got 
sechser went to the red cross shelter several blocks away hoping 
to find neighbors but saw no one until she found hancock who also 
had worried about neighbors 
i was standing here all night he said i didnt know who 
was dead and who was alive 
the destruction brought out hundreds of neighborhood residents 
who crowded outside police lines to view the damage many took 
pictures or continued to talk about where they had been when the 
earth began to move 
balmy weather contributed to a festive atmosphere on some 
streets 
at the embarcadero hyatt regency hotel guests like harley and 
marie brown of denver joked about the snoring that kept them awake 
in the ballroom where hundreds of other guests and stranded office 
workers slept under tablecloths 
it was just walltowall people ms brown said you could 
hardly walk through without stepping on people people were 
laughing because the snoring would get louder and louder 
survivors quickly snatched up local newspapers as souvenirs and 
people on the streets exchanged stories and shared airport 
information 
as hyatt guests lined up for pay phones to change airline 
reservations others enjoyed an impromptu buffet of boxed cereal 
fruit salad and pastries by candlelight in the hotels vast but 
dimlylit lobby 
it was really rocking and rolling it was pretty good juan 
richardson a power company worker said of the quake a lot of 
people from new york were wigging out 
most visitors vowed to return to san francisco despite the 
disaster and some already were planning return trips 
i was looking real forward to eating oriental food last night 
and im still looking forward to coming back for that dinner

aftershocks to tuesdays killer quake 
shook the battered san francisco bay area today as work crews gave 
up hope of finding anyone alive beneath a wrecked freeway and 
stunned californians struggled to put order back in their lives 
at least 272 people were reported killed and 1400 injured in 
the catastrophic earthquake which in 15 seconds wrecked buildings 
across nearly 100 miles a section of the bay bridge and at least 
two spans near santa cruz fell and electric power was cut for as 
many as 1 million residents 
severed gas lines touched off fires including one in san 
francisco that burned a block of buildings but all the blazes were 
out or under control today 
extensive damage was reported in parts of santa cruz and san 
benito counties 70 miles to the south which were closest to the 
epicenter of the earthquake 
the quake 69 on the richter scale was the seconddeadliest in 
us history surpassed only by the great san francisco earthquake 
of 1906 when 2500 or more were killed 
the magnitude of the disaster emerged slowly today as officials 
made contact with hardhit areas outlying suburbs and towns where 
many telephones were cut off 
the devastation is just horrible said gov george 
deukmejian who cut short a trade mission to west germany lt gov 
leo mccarthy said damage would total the better part of 1 
billion 
san francisco mayor art agnos urged commuters to stay home 
rather than tax the transportation system crippled by the closing 
of the bay bridge but as dawn spread over the glassstrewn streets 
of the region people tried to revive a sense of normalcy some 
making their way to work by ferry by foot or over highways not 
blocked by damage the bay area rapid transit system reopened this 
morning as did the oakland and san francisco airports 
many people stayed home however their workplaces shut down in 
the quakes aftermath most schools and many other institutions 
were closed as well 
san franciscos financial district was unusually quiet the 
pacific stock exchange opened but business was slow as traders 
worked by candlelight flashlight and light filtering through 
skylights 
traffic was light on bridges into san francisco and in most city 
neighborhoods 
a san francisco city councilman bill maher said electric power 
had been restored to about twothirds of the city by morning and 
should be fully restored by the end of the day 
the city is in reasonably good shape agnos said weve 
survived this so far 
the mayor estimated 40 buildings in the city were unusable or 
severely damaged 
pacific bell said its telephone network suffered no significant 
damage but the system was being overloaded by a huge increase in 
calls into and out of the region 
in a grimly futile operation near oaklands bayfront crews 
worked to clear concrete debris and searched for victims along a 
milelong portion of interstate 880 the nimitz freeway whose 
upper level collapsed on a lower roadway crowded with rush hour 
traffic 
dave wilson of the state office of emergency services said at 
least 253 people died in the highway disaster authorities declined 
to say how many bodies had been recovered but said they based 
their estimate on the number of cars believed crushed in the 
debris they said seven victims had been identified 
some people were pulled alive from the wreckage after the quake 
but oakland mayor lionel wilson said today searchers believed no 
more survivors remained 
tractors bulldozers and dump trucks were called out this 
morning and trucks and vans took bodies from the site 
you could hear it crunching down but you couldnt see 
anything it was just a big white cloud witness leroy fitzgerald 
said of the collapse you could hear people screaming for help 
a 30foot section of the san franciscooakland bay bridges top 
level also collapsed dropping onto a lower roadway and leaving 
three cars dangling 
state emergency services spokesman tom mullins said at 
midafternoon that at least 272 people had died overall and 1400 
were injured 
the san francisco coroners office said today it had confirmed 
10 earthquakerelated deaths authorities reported five deaths in 
santa clara county and one in san mateo county areas just to the 
south of san francisco 
officials in santa cruz county said five people were killed 
around the coastal city of santa cruz 
in washington president bush signed a disasterrelief 
declaration and said we will take every step and make every 
effort to help vice president dan quayle and transportation 
secretary samuel skinner flew over the area for about an hour today 
to survey the damage 
the president said he would make a personal inspection in a few 
days white house officials said bush probably would go on friday 
or saturday 
the quake hit at 504 pm tuesday along a segment of the huge 
san andreas fault eight miles northeast of santa cruz and 75 miles 
south of san francisco dozens of aftershocks followed including 
one that measured 59 on the richter scale shortly after the main 
shock 
the quake was felt in reno nev 225 miles to the northeast 
and highrises shook in los angeles 350 miles south of san 
francisco 
forty buildings reportedly collapsed in santa cruz and 
watsonville santa cruz county emergency services coordinator dina 
phillips estimated 350 million in damage lori aldrete of the 
california association of hospitals in sacramento said the 
watsonville community hospital was evacuated but no other details 
were available 
in los gatos about 10 miles southwest of san jose police chief 
larry todd said many buildings had collapsed and there were some 
reports of looting 
at least two bridges in the santa cruz area collapsed highways 
leading out of the city were damaged and mountain passes outside 
santa cruz were closed due to landslides and fissures in the road 
the highway patrol said 
the quake sent thousands of terrified office workers rushing 
into the streets of oakland and san francisco 
ive never been through anything like this in my life said 
mary garcia who works in oaklands clorox building i was on the 
17th floor and the building just rocked and rocked i was scared 
out of my mind coming down the 17 floors 
looting and vandalism were reported in san franciscos major 
crack dealing area along third street when the power is off 
opportunists come out said police dispatcher chris curran 
agnos asked the army to help national guardsmen were being 
mobilized including engineers military police and medical workers 
sixtythousand baseball fans were evacuated from candlestick 
park before the start of game three of the world series no major 
injuries were reported at the stadium which sustained structural 
damage baseball commissioner fay vincent said no decision had been 
made on when or where to resume the series 
there were no reports of damage to the states six nuclear 
reactors said greg cook a nuclear regulatory commission spokesman 
the 69 richter reading made this the sixthmost powerful quake 
to strike california this century and the most powerful since a 
70 quake centered in eureka in 1980 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude an earthquake of 6 can cause severe damage a 7 is a 
major quake capable of widespread heavy damage the 1906 
earthquake which occurred before the scale was devised has been 
estimated at 83

soviet psychiatrists living in exile 
condemned the decision by the world world psychiatric association 
on wednesday to restore membership to the soviet union 
members voted overwhelmingly to reinstate the soviet allunion 
society of psychiatrists after a sixyear absence but reserved the 
right to suspend the membership if an investigation showed the 
soviets still used psychiatry for political purposes 
the soviets left the world organization in 1983 to avoid 
expulsion because of allegations that dissidents were being 
certified insane 
delegates of the official soviet association admitted in athens 
that political abuse of psychiatry had occurred 
an unofficial soviet group the independent psychiatric 
association was admitted without conditions wednesday it was 
established seven months ago by psychiatrists who oppose the 
political use of their profession and is not recognized by the 
kremlin 
no members of the independent organization attended the athens 
meeting sources said they were unable to get visas 
anatoly koryagin a psychiatrist who was held in a psychiatric 
hospital for expressing dissident views and now lives in the west 
told a news conference after the meeting it would be difficult for 
a review committee to investigate soviet psychiatric hospitals 
the soviet psychiatrists will do their utmost to keep any 
evidence of impropriety secret he said 
he said it would be almost impossible to get the twothirds 
majority needed to suspend soviet membership the resolution 
adopted provides for an investigation during the next year with 
action to follow if necessary 
algirdas stratkevicius another emigre psychiatrist said the 
soviets should have been given three years of probation before full 
membership was restored and said the world psychiatric 
associations standards has been seriously lowered 
he and koryagin held the news conference on behalf of the 
association against the political use of psychiatry which is based 
in amsterdam and opposed restoration of the soviet membership 
members passed the motion 29145 with 19 abstentions the 
united states supported it 
we wanted a compromise solution said melvin sabshin 
medical director of the american psychiatric association the 
americans had said they would oppose unconditional reinstatement 
a us delegation visited the soviet union in february and found 
that despite improvements in the psychiatric system patients 
still did not enjoy the necessary legal safeguards

the government can bar railroad workers who 
violate rail safety rules from safetysensitive positions under new 
federal rules issued wednesday 
the federal railroad administration has previously had no 
authority to remove private railroad employees it gained the 
authority to assess civil penalties in july 1988 
the new rule to take effect in 30 days follows the rail safety 
improvement act of 1988 
employees who face suspension or permanent disqualification by 
the agency will be notified and may face a hearing the agency 
said any disqualification order would be disseminated throughout 
the rail industry 
fra administrator gil carmichael said the new regulation should 
lead to a new level of respect for the rail safety rules and 
regulations 
our only goal is to improve safety he said and if 
enforcement action against individuals is the best way to deal with 
a serious safety situation we will act fairly but firmly 
the orders apply to supervisors as well as employees who operate 
trains issue orders to trains conduct training or inspect or 
repair locomotives cars tracks or signals

the white house on wednesday belatedly 
revealed that president bush has accepted the resignation of 
william barclay allen as chairman of the us commission on civil 
rights 
allen a california professor had sparked repeated 
controversies during his tenure atop the embattled commission 
the most recent came less than two weeks ago when he gave a 
speech he titled blacks animals homosexuals what is a 
minority to the california coalition for traditional values 
the six other commission members voted to disassociate 
themselves from the speech saying the title was thoughtless 
disgusting and unnecessarily inflammatory 
allen a professor of government at harvey mudd college in 
claremont calif had offered his resignation some time ago but 
bush did not formally accept it until monday 
chase untermeyer the white house personnel director who 
confirmed the action said murray friedman the vice chairman will 
be acting chairman 
allen remains on the commission which is just six weeks away 
from expiring unless bush and congress provide more money to keep 
it going 
two commissioners terms expire at the end of november or in 
early december and untermeyer said bushs aim is to name a new 
chairman when a vacancy occurs 
marlin fitzwater the white house spokesman said bush had 
delayed accepting allens resignation because with a vacancy in 
the offing it was to our advantage to simply have him remain as 
chairman for as long as possible 
allen also stirred controversy earlier this year by personally 
intervening in a child custody suit on an apache indian 
reservation he was briefly arrested for kidnapping

residents of the ridgebound valleys of southern west virginia 
and eastern kentucky cleaned out mud and debris wednesday left by 
flooding from the remnants of hurricane jerry and many of them 
waited for more bad news 
forecasters predicted heavy showers that threatened to boost 
water levels again the national weather service issued a flood 
watch through thursday for 12 west virginia counties and sections 
of virginia with a flash flood watch for eastern kentucky 
west virginia gov gaston caperton toured floodravaged sections 
of his state primarily in logan and mingo counties 
the worst damage appeared to be in matewan where 150 homes were 
evacuated the tug fork river overflowed its banks by 6 feet 
tuesday night in lowlying areas of matewan downstream at 
williamson the river crested about 3 feet above flood stage 
this is the 32nd time this has happened in my lifetime 
albert collins sr said from a porch behind a downtown matewan 
store it used to be that it just gave us something to do to come 
down here and watch it 
now however he believes something should be done about it 
donald daugherty a mail carrier from mccarr ky across the 
river from matewan agreed as he surveyed the damage 
its hard enough if you have to go through this once in a 
lifetime but this is over and over and over again 
john perdue an executive assistant to caperton said 
preliminary survey work for a matewan flood wall is being done no 
construction timetable has been set he said williamson already 
has a new flood wall 
in kentucky damage assessment teams from the state division of 
disaster and emergency services toured four counties believed to be 
hardest hit in tuesdays flood which many officials said was the

israeli soldiers raided the main un food 
distribution center in the gaza strip and briefly detained relief 
officers at three west bank refugee camps wednesday arabs and un 
officials reported 
an officer with israels military government of the occupied 
territories who would not let his name be used said the soldiers 
were investigating reports that some employees of unrwa are 
either participating in the uprising themselves or aiding 
activities of the uprising 
the army spokesmans office declined comment 
an uprising among the 17 million palestinian residents began 22 
months ago in the west bank and gaza strip which israel captured 
from jordan and egypt in the 1967 war 
israeli soldiers or civilians have killed 596 palestinians and 
40 israelis have died at least 130 palestinians have been killed 
by fellow arabs most on suspicion of collaborating israel 
claire grimes spokeswoman for the un relief and works agency 
said documents were seized at the distribution center in the gaza 
strips deir elbalah refugee camp and three unrwa staff members 
were taken into custody 
she said christian saunders of britain and declan greenway of 
ireland were released after about an hour but the third an arab 
remained in israeli hands 
ms grimes said the soldiers smashed the windows of a un car 
to get to the arab staff member who was locked inside palestinian 
reporters identified him as abdel rahman aiessa 
in the west bank soldiers and paramilitary border police 
briefly detained at least four staff members for questioning at 
unrwa offices in the dheishe fawwar and jalazoun refugee camps in 
the west bank ms grimes said 
unrwa sponsors aid programs for more than 375000 palestinian 
refugees in the west bank and 450000 in gaza 
brig gen amnon strashnov the armys chief prosecutor told 
the israeli news agency itim on wednesday that 40000 palestinians 
had been detained since the uprising began dec 8 1987 
he said 9000 were held under administrative detention 
rules allowing imprisonment for up to a year without charge or 
trial and about 600 had been detained more than once under those 
provisions 
strashnov said 9600 palestinians currently were in custody 
including nearly 1900 administrative detainees of the others he 
said 2799 had been convicted and sentenced and the rest were in 
the legal process 
the prosecutor said 86 soldiers had been tried in military 
courts for misconduct related to the uprising and 500600 more had 
been investigated he did not give figures for convictions or 
reprimands 
a military court sentenced ossman marahia 23 a palestinian 
from east jerusalem to 27 years in jail after he pleaded guilty 
wednesday to committing dozens of firebombings and arsons over five 
years the court was told a bus driver was slightly injured in one 
incident

the cold fusion laboratory reaction is a 
mystery that unmistakably produces heat and merits more research 
though it is unlikely ever to be a useful energy source scientists 
said wednesday 
john appleby of texas aampm and paul c w chu of the university 
of houston cochairmen of closed conference on cold fusion said 
some new unpublished experiments discussed in private by about 50 
scientists showed that the cold fusion apparatus developed at the 
university of utah can show an unexplained production of heat 
but it still is unclear if the reaction is chemical nuclear or 
some previously unrecognized phenomenon 
we are happy our results are showing that something strange is 
going on said appleby 
he added that there is no evidence that the process would 
ever be useful in energy devices based on present very limited 
knowledge 
the conference sponsors the national science foundation and the 
electric power research institute originally did not plan to 
announce any conclusions but in response to requests from 
reporters chu appleby and three other scientists held a news 
conference 
appleby and chu both both declined to give details of new cold 
fusion experiments conducted by researchers attending the meeting 
because the results have not been published 
but in a prepared statement chu said that new positive 
results in excess heat production and nuclear product generation 
have been presented and reviewed 
based on the information that we have these effects cannot be 
explained as a result of artifacts equipment error or human 
error said chu however he said there are problems in the 
predictable reproduction of the effects and in relating these 
effects to known reactions 
among those attending the conference were stanley pons and 
martin fleischmann the two scientists who first claimed to have 
achieved cold fusion in test tube experiments at the university 
of utah where pons is a chemistry professor fleischmann is on the 
faculty of the university of southampton in the united kingdom 
pons and fleischmann stunned fusion researchers last march when 
they announced at a news conference that they had achieved cold 
fusion with a device composed of a electrodes of platinum and 
palladium immersed in a flask of deuterium oxide or heavy water 
they claimed that electricity applied to the water forced deuterium 
atoms into the crystal lattice of the palladium 
the deuterium atoms in the metal they said eventually became 
so dense that some fused giving off heat equal to four times the 
energy put in 
deuterium is a form of hydrogen the fusion reaction in which 
hydrogen atoms merge to form helium and liberate energy is what 
powers all stars and thermonuclear weapons 
normally an extremely energetic trigger an atomic bomb for a 
thermonuclear weapon collapsing clouds of interstellar gas for 
stars is needed to ignite fusion billions of dollars have been 
spent in the last 40 years trying to find a way to harness fusion 
reactions as practical energy sources that would liberate more 
energy than they consume 
up to now most scientists have dismissed the utah findings as 
somehow erroneous 
appleby said new data from pons and fleischmann and from other 
researchers has rehabilitated the reputation of the utah 
research few scientists however believe the reaction is actually 
fusion 
it is an anomalous phenomeon which cannot be black magic but 
cannot be explained by the normal rules of chemistry said chu 
edward teller a prominent nuclear physicist who helped develop 
the first atomic bomb and pushed development of the first 
thermonuclear weapons attended the cold fusion workshop in a 
statement read at the news conference teller said many cold fusion 
results are in disagreement with the solidly established nuclear 
theory of fusion and urged more research

among the lessons demonstrated by the 
catastrophic bay area earthquake is that the most lethal damage 
isnt always closest to the epicenter experts said wednesday 
the oakland freeway that collapsed killing an estimated 250 
people was 50 miles from the center of the quake by contrast 
some places just a few miles from the epicenter were hardly scathed 
soft waterfront soils construction practices landuse patterns 
and changes in seismic waves as they move away from an epicenter 
can conspire to create hopscotch patterns of earthquake damage 
experts said 
the collapse of interstate 880 the nimitz freeway was the most 
deadly disaster caused by the jolt which measured 69 on the 
richter scale directly across the bay there was extensive damage 
in some sections of san francisco 
far fewer casualties were reported in extensively damaged santa 
cruz just 10 miles south of the epicenter in san jose 18 miles 
north of the epicenter damage was relatively mild 
that seems to mainly be a function of ground conditions 
either artificially filled ground or not very stable natural 
deposits around the margins of the bay said geologist douglas 
hamilton president of earth sciences associates a palo alto 
consulting firm 
the nimitz freeway apparently rests on soft fill and bay mud 
and that was probably a factor said bob streitz a supervising 
geologist at the california division of mines and geology in 
sacramento 
hamilton said san jose may have escaped catastrophic damage 
because much of the city sits on stream deposits somewhat firmer 
than bayfront mud and fill 
in general the intensity of ground shaking is strongest near 
the epicenter which explains why many buildings and roads 
collapsed in santa cruz watsonville los gatos and hollister 
ronald scott a civil engineering professor at the california 
institute of technology in pasadena said bedrock tends to shake at 
high frequencies short sharp jolts while soft fill and mud 
produce more of a rolling effect that goes on longer the motion 
may be magnified on top of such deposits 
that was illustrated by catastrophic earthquakes centered on 
mexicos pacific coast in 1985 the worst damage was in mexico 
city which rests on soft sediments of an old lakebed 250 miles 
from the epicenter 
the change in seismic waves as they spread from a fault along 
with softer soils give the waves longer vibration periods scott 
said that can make them more damaging to large structures such as 
i880 or the bay bridge than to small ones 
the farther you go there is some tendency for larger 
structures to be affected he said 
another reason for the concentration of deaths far from the 
epicenter of tuesdays quake is simply that the san 
franciscooakland area is more heavily populated 
santa cruz experienced the kind of damage it did because it 
was in the earthquake epicentral area scott said but there 
isnt a big nimitz freeway running through santa cruz the biggest 
concentration of large structures is around san francisco

egon krenz east germanys new communist party 
leader grew to political maturity under the tutelage of his 
hardline predecessor erich honecker 
convivial and articulate krenzs outgoing nature offers a 
personal contrast to the aging ailing honecker but politically he 
adhers to the same orthodox brand of party doctrine as his ousted 
77yearold mentor 
the state news agency adn announced wednesday that the 
52yearold krenz succeeded honecker as head of the party the 
government and the military honecker came under increasing fire at 
home as opposition mounted and a refugee exodus continued 
career politician krenz is by far the youngest official on the 
21member politburo dominated by aging communists many of them in 
their 70s but he has a reputation for following honeckers hard 
line 
a burly bushyhaired man krenz long has been plagued by rumors 
he was an alcoholic although there has been virtually nothing to 
substantiate that 
he is known for his spontaneous visits to local bars and 
restaurants that give his bodyguards the jitters communist party 
sources say he enjoys striking up conversations with patrons 
krenz was born the son of a tailor in kolberg a coastal town in 
what is now northwestern poland on march 19 1937 
he joined east germanys communist youth organization in 1953 
while he was still in high school and the east german nation was 
four years old 
krenz studied to become a teacher but joined the east german 
army and rose to the rank of lieutenant before being discharged in 
1959 
after studying in moscow from 1964 to 1967 krenz returned to 
party work beginning with the youth organization 
he has been a member of the communist partys central committee 
since 1973 and joined the ruling politburo 10 years later 
in recent years he has been in charge of official youth 
organizations and internal security matters while many 
acknowledged he was being groomed to take over from honecker 
krenz lives in a heavily guarded compound reserved for 
highranking communist party officials at lake wandlitz about nine 
miles north of berlin 
he has long mirrored honeckers line on various issues 
repeating for example the longheld assertion that the 
imperialist west poses a threat to communist east germany 
in a profile on oct 8 west germanys bild am sonntag newspaper 
said krenz is married and has two children

a northwest airlines jet with 104 
people aboard made an emergency landing at a small unattended 
airport wednesday after losing electrical power sliding off a 
short runway and into the mud officials said 
the dc9 filled with smoke after landing and the captain had to 
use an ax stored above an emergency exit to release cabin pressure 
and allow the doors open a passenger said 
one of the 99 passengers was treated for shock and minor 
injuries at a hospital in alamosa nearly 20 miles from this 
southern colorado city and released hospital officials said the 
pilot suffered minor cuts and bruises 
the plane which had been flying from minneapolis to phoenix 
went dark about 11 pm said passenger judy sciola 49 of edina 
minn 
we started shaking a little bit she said we circled and 
circled then we hit the runway there was a lot of scraping and 
flames im sure the tires exploded 
i could hear the landing gear go down sciola said the 
pressure was just awful the little baby next to me was just 
screaming 
the plane slid about 1000 feet off the end of the runway at 
monte vista municipal airport at 1220 am said bob johnson 
regional director of the national transportation safety board in 
denver 
the crew seemed as confused as the passengers were they 
couldnt get a door open sciola said then it got even more 
frightening because we thought we were going to blow up 
the only apparent damage to the jet was flat tires johnson said 
compliment that captain said passenger todd curtis of 
thatcher ariz passengers said they could smell the tires burning 
during the landing but said there was no panic on the jet even 
though the captain was unable to talk them over the intercom 
when the plane landed the crew had difficulty opening the doors 
because the cabin pressure was wrong tina borgmann 24 of waseca 
minn told wcco radio in minneapolis 
the plane filled up with smoke and the captain came running 
back to try to get the doors open she said the captain had to 
take an ax to the door he finally got the doors to open the 
slides came out and all aboard the aircraft went down the 
slides 
the airport was unattended and the pilot apparently called the 
rio grande county sheriffs office from a pay phone there johnson 
said 
northwest did not release the captains name saying its policy 
was that it not release names of pilots involved in accidents 
unless a death was involved 
the jets left generator apparently failed in flight and the 
pilot tried unsuccessfully to start an auxiliary power unit the 
ntsb official said the right generator failed soon after and the 
plane was left with battery backup power which would have lasted 
about 25 minutes 
airline officials said the cause of the malfunction was not 
immediately known investigators from the ntsb the federal 
aviation administration and the northwest went to monte vista 
the passengers and crew spent the night in alamosa and were to 
take another plane to phoenix northwest spokesman kevin whalen 
said in minneapolis 
the monte vista airport has a runway 6000 feet long and 60 feet 
wide johnson said 
under ideal conditions that would be acceptable but in an 
emergency situation its marginal he said

two hill air force base security policemen 
pleaded guilty wednesday to federal charges in the theft of three 
f16 jet engines they sold to undercover federal agents 
airman 1st class brian david roth of chesterland ohio pleaded 
guilty to five of 22 counts in an indictment charging theft of the 
engines and other military equipment from the northern utah base 
senior airman danny joe stroud of newton kan pleaded guilty to 
one count of stealing the engines 
the pleas were entered as part of an agreement in which another 
count charging stroud with the theft of 64000 worth of computers 
and the remaining 17 charges against roth will be dropped when us 
district judge david sam sentences the men dec 12 
prosecutors said the airmen agreed to sell the pratt amp whitney 
f100pw200 engines to fbi agents posing as operators of a mock 
military surplus store as part of operation punchout a threeyear 
undercover operation that netted an assortment of government 
munitions and equipment 
assistant us attorney bruce lubeck said roth 22 began 
selling stolen equipment in october 1987 and that in july 1988 
sold 40000 worth of aviation instruments from a disabled f4 jet 
fighter 
in december of that year roth sold the undercover agents a 
portable radio valued at about 6000 and six jackets and two 
bayonets worth 500 lubeck said 
he said roth sold the agents 11 night vision devices valued at 
40000 last march and began discussing the theft of the f16 
engines at that time 
lubeck said stroud 24 drove the trailer and engines off the 
base during the july fourth holiday weekend while roth monitored 
base radio traffic to ensure the operation would go undetected 
the engines which with a trailer and tow tractor were valued at 
8 million were turned over to the agents and stored in a 
warehouse by the fbi the purchase price was to be 300000 
authorities have said 
stroud and roth were arrested july 10 
the penalty for each of the theft counts is up to 10 years in 
prison and a 250000 fine 
federal grand juries have returned about 20 indictments since 
operation punchout began said us attorney dee benson

dan rather peter jennings and tom brokaw flew 
west to anchor their wednesday newscasts from quakebattered san 
francisco while nbc officials explained nbcs slow initial 
reportage of the quake 
nbc news president michael gartner said the delay nbc was the 
last to air pictures from the scene was because tuesdays killer 
earthquake had temporarily knocked nbcs san francisco affiliate 
krontv off the air 
that in turn delayed nbcs ability to immediately broadcast from 
san francisco he said in contrast he added the affiliated 
stations of cbs and abc still could function thus competitively 
helping their networks 
once it got rolling after 9 pm tuesday nbc offered nonstop 
quake coverage including that on a fivehour today show 
until noon wednesday 
although cbs coverage continued past midnight and nightline 
aired a special update at 230 am wednesday we were the only 
guy on all night long gartner said referring only to the major 
broadcast networks 
cable news network a 24hour operation also stayed on the 
earthquake story throughout the night relying in part on reports 
from one of the bayarea stations with which it has an affiliate 
agreement ktvutv in oakland 
gartner described as bad luck nbcs initial delay in 
reporting the earthquake 
in a crisis your first line of defense is that you go to your 
affiliate where the crisis has happened he said and they 
kron were knocked out of the box 
abc in san francisco to broadcast game three of the world 
series actually was on the air with a pregame sports report from 
candlestick park when the quake hit at 804 pm edt tuesday 
four minutes later cable news network aired the first bulletin 
about the quake cbs bulletin by anchorman dan rather was at 821 
pm followed two minutes later by a 60second news report by ted 
koppel anchor of abcs nightline 
in contrast nbcs first quake bulletin read from washington by 
correspondent katherine couric didnt air until 831 pm it 
wasnt until after 9 pm that nbc joined its rivals in airing 
pictures from the scene 
it wasnt the happiest night for nbc anchor tom brokaw early in 
his reports when quake casualty figures were rising he said 40 
people had been reported killed in one freeway collapse and more 
than 50 in another 
the latter report proved erroneous brokaw subsquently corrected 
himself on the air an nbc spokeswoman said 
in an action reminiscent of september 1985 when brokaw rather 
and world news tonight anchor peter jennings of abc anchored 
their broadcasts from quakestricken mexico city all three flew to 
san francisco to anchor their programs there 
each of the three men also anchored a onehour primetime 
special on the san francisco earthquake wednesday 
rather also will anchor a 48 hours earthquake special 
thursday night abcs sam donaldson will also be in san francisco 
that night coanchoring his half of the primetime live news 
series abc said 
nbcs today starting a threeday visit in chicago when the 
quake hit will broadcast from san francisco on thursday and friday 
with the second quakecaused postponement of game three of the 
world series announced wednesday abcs schedule for that night 
shifted from baseball to four sitcoms normally shown on wednesday 
jennings earthquake special bumped a series on abc china 
beach 
abc had no comment on how much it might lose in advertising 
revenue because of postponements of the world series 
one madison avenue executive richard kostrya estimated that it 
could total 10 million a night for each night the series is 
postponed he said his figures represent the amount he estimates 
regular programming earns 
a postponed series game when finally broadcast displaces a 
night of regular programming and thus its advertising revenue 
explained kostrya an executive vice president at the j walter 
thompson advertising agency 
abc which he said got from 250000 to 325000 for each 
30second commercial to be shown during world series telecasts 
wont lose that money he said the commercials will simply appear 
when the next game does 
abc he said didnt lose the world series money thatll move 
with the game

the head of the opposition christian 
democrats said wednesday the party vice president was tortured in 
prison and other party members were mistreated while under arrest 
by the government controlled by gen manuel antonio noriega 
party president ricardo arias calderon said raul ossa was 
submitted to cruel physical and psychological torture after being 
arrested oct 3 ossa was held for six days in la chorrera jail in 
the western part of the city 
military rebels tried unsuccessfully on oct 3 to oust noriega 
who as head of the defense forces also controls the government 
arias calderon said ossa could see five members of the party 
manacled to a water pipe and was told he also would be so they 
would be the first to fall when the gringo invaders took the 
barracks 
on more than one occasion they put a gun to his temple he 
said for 11 hours he was blindfolded with gauze left standing 
up interrogated and beaten hard in the stomach 
guards took turns to keep ossa from sleeping arias calderon 
reported 
the party said it was creating a special human rights commission 
to be headed by ossa that will denounce violations of its members 
rights assist victims and relatives and educate the public 
arias calderon said the oct 3 rebels were interrogated about 
a supposed link between the christian democratic party and an 
american invasion 
the us government has been using economic and political 
pressure trying to force noriega out after he was indicted on us 
drug trafficking charges in february 1988 
noriega denies the charges and says the campaign against him is 
part of a us effort to avoid giving up the panama canal at the 
end of 1999 under the 1977 canal treaties 
arias calderon said the christian democrats publicity director 
was arrested on sept 28 accused of attacking the state but has 
not been mistreated 
five other party members were jailed on oct 2 for carrying 
posters bearing slogans including those demanding arias calderons 
freedom when he was briefly under arrest 
arias calderon said an arrest warrant is out for party official 
ramon aizpurua now abroad on charges of financing an armed 
movement aimed at overthrowing the government

lots of youthful feminine clothes were shown in 
early openings wednesday as readytowear shows for summer 1990 got 
underway 
great fabrics curvy silhouettes and soft color palettes were 
about the only things designers had in common as everybody did his 
or her own thing 
also on the opening day lanvin announced at a press conference 
that claude montana known as one of the most creative 
readytowear talents in paris would be the new creator of 
lanvins couture montana is a maverick whose strong fashions and 
silhouettes have often rocked the fashion world 
montanas first couture collection will be shown in january for 
next summer 
in her tent show in a courtyard of the louvre lolita lempicka 
showed clothes with just enough chic to keep the sweet fashions 
from cloying her bicolored fitted linen suits either short to the 
knee or maxilength often had fitted jackets with scalloped 
necklines 
one of her main silhouettes was formed by goldbuttoned long 
redingotes giving a funnel shape to the linens or textured 
beehive ivory silks 
other flowingly feminine shapes came out under billowytopped 
dusters with long wrapped skirts 
lempickas gardenparty clothes had fresh allure with appliqued 
daisies or fitted jackets in daisy prints dressy looks for wedding 
parties are lempickas forte but she also brought out some fun 
fringed clinging outfits in raffia a big new fabric for next 
summer 
doby brodas idea of the 1990s harks to the 1930s with lots of 
flowing pyjamas and long skirts some in the audience liked her 
flowersprigged farmers daughter dresses in soft or murky 
colors 
more fun were her easy pants or skirts outfits based on 
dishcloth linens the little loose dishclothplaid boleros 
paired with solid blue full pants skirts or occasionally shorts 
for evening her gold lame biascut dresses and flared pants 
looked slinky enough to steal applause at parties though perhaps 
not quite luxurious enough for marlene dietrich 
emmanuelle khanh brought out a lot of long and slinky suits for 
cruise wear as well as some modest onepiece maillot bathing suits 
with little flounces at the hip 
her sailor looks ranged from pants to shorts to skirts in 
crisp navy and white or more original rusty brown cottons and 
linens for lateday her best lines were easily fitted outfits 
with strong black and white arabesque embroideries around collars 
and shoulders 
the japanese are out in force as usual hanae mori will show 
later in the week but tuesday night was awarded the legion of 
honor for her contribution to paris fashion in the couture and 
readytowear shows she has shown and sold here for over 20 years 
junko shimadas bouncy young styles were always figurehugging 
featuring bright turquoise beach minidresses with pointed hems 
printed in seashell patterns topped with fishnet stoles 
there was lots of creativity here from scalloped pique fitted 
suits with very short skirts to a whole range of clinging broadly 
striped sailor suits teaming pullovers with bellbottomed jerseys 
or tight bermudas like turnofthecentury bathing costumes 
the neat linen suits with decollete smallwaisted jackets in 
shades of sand turquoise pale pink and chocolate had details like 
big bucket pockets tab pockets or perky pointed peplums 
and shimadas combinations of dark plaids and insets sleeves 
and double collars or tobaccobrown organza looked original if not 
for everyone 
party girls with good figures will probably love the khaki green 
clinging jersey and gold lame outfits with their gold latticework 
hemlines and mousseline stoles 
hiroko koshinos collection was based on a cruise down the nile 
from safari suits to outfits with asymmetrical details folding and 
pleating that could have come right from an egyptian fresco or the 
wardrobe of cleopatra herself 
in patterned silks and textured linens the inspiration may have 
been ancient but the lines were modern with lots of highwaisted 
pants some bare midriffs original jackets with one side covered 
in a pleated scarf effect over wraparound skirts 
there were lots of long jackets over pleated skirts or vests 
sewn onto the skirt in a dress and whether worn with shorts 
pleated or draped long skirts the effect of these combinations was 
never heavy 
the colors sandy beige or grey nile green deep fresco blue 
terracotta and mustard or gold gave the silk and linen outfits 
an original cachet for next summer 
transparency was rife in the shows but nowhere was it more 
obvious than at kimijima he concentrated on mousselines and 
fishnets topped with enough sparkly sequins to cause a few 
shipwrecks with sailors spotting his revealing mermaid minis

south korean president roh tae woo completed 
an official washington visit wednesday defending his governments 
performance on democracy human rights and opening of its markets 
to imports 
the president his wife and members of his cabinet later flew to 
los angeles for a meeting wednesday night with former president 
reagan and a thursday address 
in wednesday speeches to members of congress and later to the 
national press club the roh sought to assure his listeners that 
democracy revived under his 1yearold administration is in south 
korea to stay an unstoppable force which no one can divert 
he said 
roh said that since 1985 south korea has lowered trade barriers 
faster than most countries and all trade issues with the united 
states eventually will be resolved to mutual satisfaction 
answering questions at the press club roh said it was unfair to 
accuse korea of backsliding on trade liberalization and specific 
issues would be solved one by one 
roh also predicted south korea and china eventually will have 
normal relations contacts rapidly expanded from the time of the 
1988 seoul olympics until slowed by chinas crackdown last june on 
prodemocracy demonstrators he said but i am sure they will 
pick up again and sure that we will have normal relations with 
china 
seeking the offensive against human rights critics who say his 
government is reverting to repression roh said in his speech to 
congress i will confront squarely every challenge to our young 
democracy whether from within or without 
he said regrettably certain radicals have resorted to force 
and committed unlawful acts to pursue their aims under the guise of 
democratic reform here are also the tiny band of extremists who 
parade antiamerican slogans and perpetrate attacks on us 
facilities 
that was the closest he came to mentioning the invasion and 
vandalism of the us ambassadors residence in seoul last week by 
six young militants

in the glare of tv lights parliament 
changed the countrys communist name and created a democratic 
system wednesday by adopting key constitutional amendments 
amendments formally ending oneparty domination in hungary 
regulating free elections by next summer and creating the office of 
state president won overwhelming approval at the nationally 
televised session of parliament 
the country was renamed the republic of hungary like other 
soviet bloc nations it had been known as a peoples republic 
since 1949 
but the chamber stalled on one key move toward democracy 
postponing a decision on opposition calls for a referendum on when 
to elect the head of state government leaders want the election 
next month but opposition leaders say its too soon 
nonetheless speaker of parliament matyas szueros who takes 
over as acting president until a new head of state is elected 
proclaimed wednesday a historic day for hungary 
a parliamentary democracy and a legal state is being built in 
hungary on the ruins of a dictatorship of sorts szueros 
reportedly told the yugoslav news agency tanjug 
the voting followed dissolution of the communist party and its 
replacement by the hungarian socialist party which vows commitment 
to a democratic system while continuing for the moment to dominate 
national politics 
the state department said wednesday in a statement in 
washington today the hungarian parliament voted overwhelmingly 
in favor of an amended constitution which leaves only about 10 
percent of the 1949 stalinist document in place the amended 
constitution contains democratic principles and many of the 
elements of our own bill of rights the constitution provides that 
hungary will be declared a republic not a peoples republic 
the word peoples was a legacy from the stalin era 
parliament also began discussion of a law that will regulate the 
operation and finances of political parties in the first multiparty 
elections since 1947 
among the 94 modifications were amendments eliminating all 
references to the leading role of the dissolved communist party 
political partiess may be freely established and may freely 
function the amendment declared 
an entirely new constitution is to be drawn up and adopted by 
the new parliament after the national elections but justice 
minister kalman kulcsar has said the amendments were necessary to 
make next years elections legal 
the new post of president of the republic replaces the 21man 
collective presidency that had broad powers including acting for 
parliament when it was not sitting as well as overruling 
parliamentary decisions 
once the amendments take effect this month the presidential 
council will be dissolved and szueros will assume its powers until 
a president is elected 
the new president will be the commanderinchief of the armed 
forces is authorized to call national and regional elections and 
may initiate a referendum 
the president may also dissolve parliament if it fails to 
approve a new government or votes for noconfidence in the 
government four times in one year 
the new president may be stripped of his office if he knowingly 
violates the constitution or other laws and may not be a leader of 
any political party 
before the key votes premier miklos nemeth called an emergency 
cabinet meeting to discuss an opposition petition to postpone the 
election to the new state presidency tentatively scheduled for 
nov 26 until after next years parliamentary elections 
some opposition parties assert they have no time or resources to 
organize against socialist party candidate imre pozsgay 
the premier and all but one of his ministers were ranking 
members of the communist party and most remain in the top levels 
of the new socialist party however the ministries of the 
interior finance and trade and commerce now are formally 
depoliticized

bodies were found monday night and removed tuesday from a barn

we get good leads and bad leads coon said

barn and a farmhouse two other sites in the area were searched 
wednesday but investigators would not say where they were

neil bryan who owns the barn where the bodies were discovered 
said copeland worked for him doing odd jobs over the last 20 years 
john hovey who said he rented the farm from bryan said copeland 
had warned him and his four children to stay out of the barn 
it stunk in the barn i thought an animal had crawled in there 
and died hovey said 
bryan is not a suspect authorities said 
livingston county sheriff leland odell has been secretive about 
what investigators are seeking the major case squad a task force 
formed friday said in its first statement that investigators were 
trying to locate an unspecified number of transients who had stayed 
with the copelands 
the copeland farm has already been searched

prime minister yitzhak shamir said wednesday 
his government will never compromise on its opposition to talks 
with the plo or on its refusal to trade land for peace two main 
points of disagreement between israel and the united states 
this is our land from the dawn of history and it will be so 
always we will not be pushed or pressured he told a convention 
of fundamentalist christians 
still israeli leaders appeared to be trying to dampen a 
smoldering conflict with the united states following shamirs 
remarks tuesday that israel would rather face conflict with 
washington than accept a usbacked plan that could lead to talks 
with the palestine liberation organization 
foreign minister moshe arens telephoned secretary of state james 
a baker iii and they spoke for 45 minutes on bakers efforts to 
restart the middle east peace process israel radio said it gave 
no details and arens spokesman declined comment 
on tuesday night shamir called president bush about shamirs 
planned midnovember visit to washington 
they talked about the peace initiative and how they can 
advance it shamirs office said both think it is very 
important to meet in order to get a better understanding between 
the united states and israel about the peace initiative 
israel radio said the issue of shamirs statements tuesday did 
not come up 
before calling bush shamir told members of his rightwing likud 
bloc we must accept the assumption that we may be entering a 
tense period with the united states 
this time the battle is hard its a miracle that thus far 
we have held our own against the world where no element supports 
our position 
later he told a likud rally in ramle that the stonethrowers 
the firebombers have not succeeded in driving us into the arms of 
the plo it is not possible that when they fail to do this others 
by diplomatic means would try to bring us to meetings with the 
plo 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutweiller called shamirs 
statements unhelpful and said the united states is not 
looking for a fight with israel 
but shamir made it clear in his speech to the christian 
convention wednesday night that israel will not budge in opposing 
direct or indirect talks with the plo or withdrawal from the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip 
he accused the plo of striving toward the creation of a 
palestinian state in place of israel let me make it very 
clear there will be no second arab state in the land of israel 
the biblical names of judea and samaria embrace what is now the 
west bank 
the united states advocates trading land for peace baker 
proposed consultations among israel egypt and the united states 
aimed at convening a meeting between israel and palestinians 
shamirs likud bloc sees the israelipalestinian meeting as 
bringing the plo into talks through the back door

publish the american equivalent of a soviet math and physics 
magazine to counter what they say is the poor state of high school 
education in the united states 
the magazine called quantum will be aimed at gifted high 
school students organizers at harvard university said it will 
begin by publishing material translated from the original soviet 
magazine kvant but may eventually expand to include articles by 
american scientists 
kvants articles are written by leading soviet scientists and 
address current issues in math and physics and include sets of 
problems for students to solve 
sheldon glashow a nobel laureate and professor of physics at 
harvard will serve as quantums physics editor 
glashow said he hopes the magazine will improve american science 
education 
he said test results have placed us students at a level of 
general science knowledge roughly equivalent to that of 
underdeveloped countries 
american math education is in terrible shape added william 
thurston a faculty member at princeton university who will be 
quantums math editor 
the first copies of quantum will be distributed in november the 
magazines organizers said they have received a grant from the 
national science foundation and plan to support the publication

a bronx tale written and acted by chazz 
palminteri tells the story of a boy growing up with two father 
figures one of them a mobster 
its an interesting large anecdote stuffed full of small 
fascinating wellrounded anecdotes containing both gritty 
unpleasantness and light humor plus some moral points 
the play in which palminteri takes a boy he calls colognio from 
age 9 through adolescence opened wednesday night at playhouse 91 
offbroadway 
palminteri who also plays 17 other parts has learned well the 
writers lessons embroider on material you know and give your 
story a beginning middle and end his ending wraps up every thread 
in the story and is lavishly sentimental and it works 
in this vividly populated italian neighborhood in the bronx 
nearly everybody has a nickname in little johnnys bar theres 
rudy ice who walks so smoothly its like he skates on ice and 
eddie mush a hardluck gambler everything he touches turns to 
mush 
little johnny the top local mobster makes young colognio his 
surrogate son and nicknames him c little johnny tells c that the 
working man is a sucker the boys father an honest man who drives 
a bus says that little johnny is a bad man and that the working 
man who has a hard time getting up every day for work is the real 
tough guy 
there are some surprises when c complains to little johnny that 
an acquaintance owes him 20 and is avoiding him instead of little 
johnny saying hell rub him out he says it cost you 20 to get 
rid of him you got off cheap 
and there are some acting moments to be especially relished as 
cs youthfully awkward pompous imitation of toughness and visiting 
mobsters sudden deference when they realize he is little johnnys 
boy 
in a bronx tale c grows up learning from both men without 
turning his back on either the apartment house and barfront set 
and little johnny may be a little sugarcoated but there is murder 
fear and racial violence in a bronx tale

leftist guerrillas and the rightist 
government of el salvador failed at an extra day of peace talks 
wednesday to reach a truce in their 10yearold civil war 
salvadoran bishop gregorio rosa chavez an observer at the 
talks said the the farabundo marti national liberation front and 
the government delegates could not agree on details for a 
ceasefire but he said they agreed to continue trying at a meeting 
nov 2021 in caracas venezuela 
the two sides have agreed to continue negotiating an end to 
hostilities with both undertaking to include all specific proposal 
each sides presents in the agenda at the next round he said 
rosa chavez said the only agreement reached at the threeday 
meeting in the town of moravia just north of san jose was that a 
mechanism should be set up to verify future accords are honored 
the talks which began monday with a twoday schedule had been 
extended to wednesday but rosa chavez said the two sides recessed 
the talks after it became apparent there was no way out of the 
deadlock 
oscar santamaria who heads the government delegation said the 
guerrillas had created an obstacle to advancement by expanding 
their proposal 
the rebels divert the discussion from the main theme to other 
elements and that number of points make it impossible to go into 
the theme of an end to hostilities santamaria said 
the guerrillas have proposed a ceasefire a purge of the armed 
forces respect for human rights and democratic freedoms to lay the 
groundwork for their formation of a legal political party 
president alfredo cristianis government has proposed an 
immediate end to fighting and disbanding of rebel forces as a first 
step 
salvador samayoa a rebel representative accused the government 
of inflexibility in the talks 
substantial agreements appear to be far away the government 
is not prepared to negotiate samayoa said 
the first round of talks since cristiani took office june 1 was 
held in september in mexico city 
about 70000 people have been killed in the war the majority of 
them civilians

more than two days after a doctor asked 
jennifer keoughs parents to donate the teenagers organs after a 
car accident the girl scratched out a message 
i wat to tak to my mom 
barbara keough had never read a sweeter message 
shes still on the respirator but thats ok shes coming 
back to me mrs keough said moments after her 15yearold 
daughter waved and wrote notes to her in the girls room at 
memorial hospital 
it was surprising enough that jennifer survived saturday nights 
crash after police said she was already dead but it was even 
better news that she began moving her toes and fingers on monday 
at 455 pm tuesday intensive care nurse ron brezicki called 
mrs keough at home with more news 
she did what she wrote holy cow mrs keough gasped 
clenching the telephone her friends turned 
screaming hugging and handslapping erupted in the small 
apartment 
minutes before he called brezicki noticed jennifer stirring 
apparently pointing he asked if she would be able to write if he 
brought her paper and pencil 
brezicki asked jennifer where she lived what year it was the 
name of the president each time she wrote down a correct answer 
except she wrote regan she was reminded there had been an 
election and then she wrote bush 
jennifer a student at hollywood hills high school also asked 
why she was in the hospital and then repeatedly asked about her 
friend jane valaziotis 17 who was driving when the car was hit by 
another 
miss valaziotis was in stable condition with a broken jaw and 
bruises 
on saturday jennifers eyes were fixed and dilated when she was 
brought to the emergency room the first sign of possible brain 
damage said dr francisco pons who saw her at the hospital 
another doctor helping to work on the girl asked the teenagers 
parents to consider donating organs 
things were looking so bad we didnt want to give the mother 
any hope pons said adding that it appeared at the time that the 
girl would either die or be brain dead 
however pons said the girl had a strong pulse and pretty good 
blood pressure and he wasnt going to give up on her 
on wednesday jennifers condition was upgraded from serious to 
stable condition hospital spokeswoman linda hamlin said 
when he learned of the girls progress pons was visibly shocked 
thats a miracle he said sometimes there are happy 
endings here

a terrorist was killed on wednesday when 
a grenade he was carrying exploded near congress hours after a 
guerrilla amnesty bill was introduced which excludes pardons for 
drug traffickers 
police said four people were wounded in the midday blast at 
bolivar plaza in the heart of this capital about 50 yards from the 
congress building 
security forces suspect that scores of bombings in the last two 
months were performed by hirelings of the drug traffickers who are 
trying to force colombia to stop extraditing people wanted as 
traffickers in the united states 
the blast occurred on the first full day of a nationwide strike 
by judges who demanded added protection from attacks mounted by 
drug traffickers 
the fragmentation grenade apparently exploded by accident 
wednesday witnesses told the colombian radio networks rcn and 
caracol 
people at the scene told rcn the man killed was walking rapidly 
toward the congress building when the grenade exploded 
rcn quoted police as saying the man was also carrying a 
submachine gun 
nearby is the presidential palace which serves as the official 
residence of president virgilio barco 
it was barco who rejected appeals by drug traffickers to be 
included in the bill that would grant amnesty to leftist guerrillas 
of the april 19 movement 
the amnesty is part of a negotiated settlement with the rebels 
who take their name from the date of a 1970 presidential election 
opponents say was fraudulent 
the 72hour judges strike was declared at noon tuesday hours 
after a federal judge was shot and killed in medellin he was the 
42nd judge to be murdered in colombia in 12 years 
drug traffickers in a telephone call to a medellin radio 
station said they killed the judge to retaliate for the 
extradition of four colombians to the united states to face charges 
related to drug trafficking 
also tuesday gunmen killed a medellin radio station news 
director no one claimed responsibility for the slaying the eighth 
news media employee killed since drugrunners started a major 
terrorist campaign in midaugust 
the judges strike which crippled colombias courts was 
declared by the national association of court workers with 14000 
members including judges 
the union president federal judge helmut romero said in a 
broadcast interview wednesday he met the day before with justice 
minister roberto salazar 
romero said he was told the government doesnt have money to 
fund a special program created two months ago to protect judges 
judges who were working had no bulletproof vests even though 
the us justice department said two weeks ago it delivered vests 
as part of a 19 million program to help protect the judges 
a union administrator yolanda parra told the associated press 
the justice ministry had received only 15 vests and even those had 
not been turned over to judges yet

ive felt all the earthquakes since i lived here and this was 
the best one my best neardeath experience said ray blair an

reporters you can never avoid all criticism 
one difference between hugo which resulted in disaster 
declarations in the us virgin islands puerto rico south 
carolina and north carolina and the earthquake was planning 
according to grant peterson femas associate director 
as recently as last august the agency along with state and 
local officials staged a dress rehearsal for an earthquake in 
northern california 
we were ready we practiced for this event we came on line 
very quickly he said 
but he acknowledged the earthquake came at a bad time for fema 
a month after the devastation wreaked by hugo 
we do have the resources but we are stressed he said 
peterson said the agency intends to use some of the 11 billion 
appropriated by congress for hugo to cover earthquakerelated 
losses 
lawmakers will have to replenish the disaster pool when money 
runs shorts as it is expected to do peterson said 
asked how much will to needed for the earthquake peterson said 
i dont know the cost of this disaster and no one else does 
vice president dan quayle said he discussed the importance of 
preparation with president bush by telephone from air force two on 
his way back to washington from inspecting the damage in san 
francisco 
it could have been much worse if we had not had that 
preparation quayle told reporters at andrews air force base near 
washington 
i do believe its under control and we are making progress 
quayle said 
he said he also told the president about the importance of 
volunteers who swarmed to help the injured and homeless 
shortly after the earthquake struck fema personnel set up an 
office in san franciscos presidio area to supervise federal relief 
efforts 
other federal disaster offices will open soon to handle requests 
from the public federal assistance can include temporary housing 
grants of up to 10000 a family and lowcost loans to cover 
uninsured private and business property losses red cross officials 
said hundreds of people stayed in federal shelters overnight 
local governments can receive money to pay part of the cost of 
debris removal and for the replacement of damaged public property 
california gov george deukmajian activated the national guard 
and defense secretary dick cheney ordered military hospitals to 
treat civilian casualties 
among the other federal relief efforts 
the environmental protection agency took steps to contain oil 
spillage in richmond calif epa spokesman jim makris said no 
environmental contamination had been found and workers at nuclear 
plants were confident reactors had not been damaged 
the fbi was on call to help identify bodies 
the us geological survey sent teams to determine the exact 
nature of the quake 
the department of health and human services put a team on 
standby alert even though health facilities were thought to be 
sufficient

the youngest national park has barely taken 
its first steps and already visitors are worrying like 
overprotective parents about the future of its soaring mountains 
4000yearold trees and mysterious caves 
more than 600 people have commented on a proposed 10year 
management plan for great basin national park said supervisor al 
hendricks the comments we received tended quite heavily toward 
protection and preservation for the most part people are not 
looking to build water slides pave things over they didnt 
want great basin to turn into a yosemite which is overdeveloped 
theres even a bank in yosemite its practically a small city 
the plan was to go to congress this month three years after the 
77109acre parks oct 27 1986 dedication it probably wont be 
done for six months or more though congress will be informed of 
the status he said 
attendance is still low at the park in eastern nevada its 
75000 visitors in 1988 was up 83 percent from 41000 in 1986 
hendricks expects 75000 this year more than 33 million saw 
761757acre yosemite national park in 1988 
we are remote hendricks explained you kind of have to 
think twice about getting in the car and driving out here but its 
worth it its one of the last preserved places in the great 
basin 
most of those who commented agreed with hendricks 
great basin is a gem a small glimpse into the past that 
hasnt been trampled by the hand of man said one visitor i 
believe we should make every effort to preserve it as a testament 
to the old american west 
please do not go on a building spree paving over paradise to 
put up parking lots said another 
if its not broken dont fix it implored a third 
amid the antidevelopment comments collected in 1987 were 
statements from recreational vehicle enthusiasts and urban dwellers 
who want creature comfort more than backwoods hardship when they 
commune with nature 
if you make wheeler peak campground inaccessible to us we will 
lose all interest in great basin national park said the operator 
of a mobile home 
our rv was dirtier after a short visit to the park in june 
than in the rest of our 6000mile trip complained a visitor 
please pave major roads and camp areas you have so much land 
that more should be developed 
hendricks said the plan would emphasize preservation of the 
park but also would include some new campgrounds and access for 
visitors you have to try and accommodate as many people as you 
can 
ranchers will be included in the plan despite numerous negative 
comments that cattle and other livestock should be run out 
congress put into the law that grazing would be allowed and 
unless they change the law theres nothing we can do about it 
hendricks said 
great basin was the 49th national park dedicated in the united 
states and the first one to receive the designation in 15 years 
highlights include 13063foot wheeler peak second in nevada 
only to 13140foot boundary peak lehman caves national monuments 
square mile of limestone formations and acres of 
4000plusyearold bristlecone pine trees grotesquely contorted 
from battling wind sand and ice over the ages to become the oldest 
known living things on earth 
steepwalled glacial lakes and narrow canyons also are among 
park features that include lexington arch a 70foot high 
83footwide stretch on which american indians left primitive 
pictrographs 
the tiny town of baker is the closest residential area to the 
park and has two small motels with about a dozen rooms the larger 
town of ely some 70 miles away has more amenities such as shopping 
and more motel rooms 
park operators offered four 10year plans ranging from leaving 
most of the park alone to developing miles of new roads shuttle 
services and parking lots 
nearly threefourths of the people who commented said they 
preferred two proposals that didnt include much new development 
those two alternatives call for construction of a great basin 
interpretive center at baker ridge access roads to the center and 
a 100car parking lot for those visiting lehman caves 
but the proposals dont include new developments or maintained 
roads for vehicles further into the parks unspoiled areas 
two other alternatives propose more deeppark vehicle access 
including public roads leading to 11658foot mount washington and 
generally prefer much more modern and rural zoning to primitive and 
semiprimitive designations 
most of the facilities we have now were built back when lehman 
caves became a national monument in 1922 so we do actually need 
some updated facilities hendricks said 
nonetheless a third of the comments urged relocating housing 
maintenance and administration facilities to baker to better 
preserve great basin 
we got comments on the far side of preservation and 
development hendricks said we just have to find a middle 
ground 
most respondents want more access to some areas that already 
have some roads but dont want maintained roads to areas where 
people usually hike most want limited service camping in areas 
that already have some campgrounds but not in others we want 
another four campgrounds in the park because now we dont have 
enough space hendricks said 
on other issues twothirds of the respondents opposed 
hanggliding and snowmobiling in the park and a third said 
crosscountry skiing routes shouldnt be maintained most said 
fishing should be allowed but only on a catchandrelease basis 
and that hunting should be strictly forbidden 
they encouraged reintroduction of elk and restoration of 
endangered bald eagle and peregrine falcon populations and leaving 
predator populations alone to control mule deer and other wild 
herds 
whatever improvements we make a lot of the park is going 
to remain mountainous territory available for hiking hendricks 
said i wouldnt say the park is exactly like it was in 1922 but 
its close pretty preserved

scenes of alaskas oiled beaches and the 
cleanup of prince william sound have been telecast into millions of 
homes worldwide via gov steve cowpers statefunded news service 
in the six months since the exxon valdez oil spill cowper has 
expanded his videoproduction staff and provided hundreds of 
television stations with raw footage and edited stories about the 
spill and its effects 
during the departure of exxons cleanup crews from valdez 
cowpers staff offered via satellite a series of free news 
packages known in the tv news business as video news releases 
or vnrs 
critics say vnrs distort the newsselection process and often 
give viewers a biased view of an event 
the states videos have become one of cowpers most powerful 
tools to sway public opinion alaska has sued exxon over the march 
24 spill and is lobbying congress to pass stronger spillliability 
legislation 
the only way we can get decisions made that we believe are 
necessary is through public pressure and thats how we get public 
pressure cowper said recently its unfortunate thats the way 
we have to do business but its also effective it works 
when cowper arrived in valdez to announce the states winter 
cleanup plan on the final day of exxons pullout he displayed an 
impressive video with aerial shots of oiled beaches 
that nights nbc nightly news led its story on the pullout 
with scenes and narration from the video the narrator cowper 
spokesman terence omalley was ecstatic 
the network noted the beach scenes were shot just days before 
and it picked up on the term dirty dozen the 12 beaches that 
represent why exxon needs to come back omalley said 
you just cant get any better than that 
nbc clearly identified the source of the video and followed it 
with a report by its correspondent in valdez 
its on costconscious local stations however where the 
states footage is most likely to be seen sometimes without 
attribution 
at least 29 stations and newsdistribution networks from san 
francisco to new york used the states vnrs during a threeday 
period in september according to a statecommissioned survey 
of course some of them had ethical problems with statefunded 
video said steve nelson who helped produce the vnrs but i 
would say that was a very small minority once they saw the quality 
and content of the product most of them were very happy to utilize 
it 
nine twominute stories have been produced on topics such as 
spill stress exxons beachcleaning techniques and the 
effects of the spill on fishermen and natives each package 
includes raw footage and edited stories duplicated with and 
without narration 
omalley narrates most of the stories but does not appear on 
camera he identifies himself by name but not as cowpers press 
aide that he said allows the stations to present him as their 
own correspondent 
the reports are not overtly slanted against exxon which hired 
a new york firm to produce its own spill vnrs 
a state video on an exxon dispersant was largely positive and 
in some reports exxon officials were interviewed 
thats why we think that theyve been so successful 
omalley said the reporting is basically pretty unbiased 
biased or not vnrs affect news selection said ben bagdikian a 
professor of the graduate school of journalism at the university of 
california at berkeley 
if you get on a news program because you happen to provide 
free technically highquality footage you have displaced 
something else that an independent editor might have thought more 
important he said 
when stations fail to identify the source of vnr material he 
added its clearly unethical and very close to corruption of the 
news 
few news producers flatly reject using vnrs 
if its quality and not a blatant ad we sometimes will use 
it said kathryn scott assignment manager for usa today on 
tv a nationally syndicated news show 
most of the stations contacted by the associated press said they 
used the states footage to illustrate their own stories for some 
the subject of vnrs was too sensitive to discuss 
wayne brown executive news producer at kgtv in san diego said 
he used a few of the stories but edited them down and 
identified the source it enabled us to continue to update the 
story that we had covered he said 
what i really used them for was intellegence to find out what 
was newsworthy from an alaskan point of view said john davidow 
a producer at wcvb in boston 
still he said his station is unlikely to use them when alls 
said and done these werent news stories they were press 
releases

so the budget ax has fallen on the government 
in an act of selfpunishment required by law but it is more 
likely to bounce than to inflict real and lasting cuts in spending 
thats the way it has worked before under the system of 
deadlines and scaleddown deficit ceilings that is supposed to lead 
to a balanced budget in 1993 a combination of cuts revenue 
increases and adroit bookkeeping got the numbers within deficit 
limits in senate and house budget bills required by midmonth but 
congress couldnt settle on a final version in time to meet the 
deadline 
as a result president bush ordered sequestration the fancy 
name for 161 billion in automatic spending cuts under the 
grammrudman act congress passed in 1985 as a way to try to force 
itself and the administration to deal with the deficit congress is 
trying to agree on a budget bill that will squeeze the projected 
deficit under the limit and supplant the automatic cuts 
since the grammrudman system was enacted the annual deficit 
ceilings it sets have been eased and some costly programs 
including part of the savings and loan bailout have been designed 
to avoid even those limits one sponsor of the plan sen ernest f 
hollings dsc thinks it has become a sham 
but the rebuttal is that it beats nothing 
if that law were not in place federal spending would be 
higher today and deficits would be higher today said sen warren 
rudman rnh his coauthor sen phil gramm rtex said 
complaints about the measure are like the drunk criticizing the 
wrench because he cant fix the faucet 
that lessthanelegant image is apt for a system devised to 
substitute for the political discipline neither democrats nor 
republicans neither congress nor the administration were imposing 
on themselves 
president bush like ronald reagan before him forbids new 
taxes the administration ruled out sharp cuts in defense spending 
democrats are equally determined to protect domestic program 
budgets notably for the entitlement programs that pay benefits to 
individual americans 
that adds up to the standoff that led to the grammrudman 
measure to squeeze down the deficits with progressively lower 
ceilings the target for the government year that began oct 1 is a 
deficit no higher than 110 billion it gets a lot tougher next 
year when the target is 64 billion if it sticks 
there already is talk of change 
one way out would be to alter the scorekeeping system so as to 
exclude from the deficit arithmetic a growing surplus in the social 
security trust fund 68 billion this year that covers more than 
half the deficit in the governments operating budget 
the amendment now favored by democratic congressional leaders 
would stop counting that surplus which means operating deficits 
would be far higher and at the same time raise the annual deficit 
limits and set 1997 as the target year for a balanced budget 
but first the government has to cope with the current situation 
the automatic cuts were supposed to be a sort of doomsday mechanism 
that would prod the two branches of government into cooperating to 
reduce deficits but this is the third time the sequester sanction 
has been imposed even with the gimmicks that have been used to get 
budgets under the grammrudman limits 
has the congress cheated has the president in the best 
spirit of bipartisanship worked with the congress to cheat 
gramm asked the answer is yes 
but are we better off with grammrudman than we would be 
without it i think the answer is yes clearly yes he said 
sunday on nbcs meet the press 
richard g darman the budget director says congress has made 
past sequester orders into phonies by rescinding them and putting 
all the money back hes talking about spending cuts that would 
stick even after congress and the administration settle on a 
permanent budget measure rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman 
of the ways and means committee agrees saying that spending cuts 
should be permanent and painful 
at the white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said 
automatic cuts arent all bad there would be sizeable cuts and 
they would be real he said there wouldnt be any accounting 
changes theyd be real money that wouldnt be spent 
but the grammrudman formula would hit programs the 
administration doesnt want cut along with some it would like 
reduced social security aid to the needy and other major federal 
spending items are exempt from the cuts and some other 
expenditures including medicare cant be cut by more than 2 
percent whats left is a 43 percent cut in defense spending and a 
53 percent reduction in other domestic programs 
that gives everybody a stake in a settlement that undoes most if 
not all of the automatic cuts until next time

as the financial markets gyrate amid worries 
about highrisk takeover debt small savers and investors need not 
feel left out of the action 
they can get in on the game simply by putting their money in a 
mutual fund that owns a portfolio of highyield or junk bonds 
of the type used to finance many corporate buyouts in recent years 
whether anyone would want to get involved in such a chancy 
proposition of course is another question entirely 
the market for junk bonds has been unsettled for months now and 
lately it has suffered a series of setbacks the most recent came 
just a few days ago when a group planning to buy ual corp said 
bankers had balked at financing the deal 
even in the best of times junk bonds must offer higher yields 
than other higherquality securities in order to attract 
investors in periods like now of heightened uncertainty the yield 
differential naturally tends to widen 
thus junk bond mutual funds today sport yields in the 13 
percent to 145 percent range compared to roughly 75 percent to 
85 percent for funds that concentrate on safer investments like 
us treasury bonds which are guaranteed against default by the 
federal government 
on a 10000 investment thats a difference in interest 
payments technically called dividends when they are distributed by 
a mutual fund of some 550 to 600 a year 
is that disparity enough to justify taking the risks that come 
with junk bonds it all depends financial advisers say on your 
ability to withstand losses and your view of the economic outlook 
just about everybody agrees that junk bond funds are a bad 
choice for conservative investors who depend on reliable income 
and safety of principal to cover their costs of living 
even willing risktakers have to be wary of some potentially 
misleading impressions before they can make a sensible appraisal of 
the risks and rewards in the junk market 
first of all points out norman fosback editor of the 
newsletter income amp safety the nominal yield cited at any given 
time for a portfolio of junk bonds must be considered an 
exaggeration 
many of the highyield issues are bound to default he says 
indeed their ultrahigh yield is both a recognition of that 
inevitability and a compensation for the corresponding risk 
as a rule of thumb a prospective buyer might subtract 3 
percentage points from the stated annual yield to allow for 
defaults 
another variable that can hurt the return on a junk bond 
portfolio is a decline in prices this can occur even in a period 
when interest rates are steady or falling if confidence in the 
market suffers as it has this year 
according to donoghues moneyletter three of the biggest junk 
bond funds carrying stated yields of 128 percent to 145 percent 
actually managed to post total returns of only 54 percent to 
56 percent for the first nine months of 1989 
you could have done better than that in any one of numerous 
other much less risky investments 
donoghues concludes the premiums the funds are now paying 
over treasury yields are large but they should be the funds are 
no bargain now 
fosback by contrast argues that junkbond funds have fallen so 
deeply into disfavor that they have some appeal for venturesome 
investors of a contrarian bent 
he contends that it may be a good time to buy them if you can 
stand the fluctuations and the excitement 
one longtime bear on junk bonds james grant argues that the 
very expression high yield embodies much that is wrong with the 
financial world right now 
what investors have chased in the 1980s is yield not total 
return but promised rates of interest he observes in his 
grants interest rate observer promoters have sold it and 
investors have bought it

when 1700 mutual funds and an array of pension 
funds trusts foundations endowments and other institutions seek 
to buy or sell from a list of perhaps 3500 listed stocks you can 
have problems 
one of those problems is illiquidity or the inability to match 
buyers with sellers within a limited time and without allowing 
prices to surge or plunge liquidity is fluid orderly illiquidity 
is spastic volatile 
liquidity depends on a randomness of opinion on a mixture of 
buyers and sellers with differing ideas about what to buy or sell 
at any particuular time 
it is the very basis of successful securities markets bringing 
buyers and sellers together and officials of the big exchanges 
have made many speeches lauding the ability of their outfits to do 
just that 
but in recent years its occasional and dramatic absences have 
created financial earthquakes with prices plunging or surging 
because everyone wanted to sell or everyone wanted to buy at the 
same time 
while the number of institutional investors has grown the 
growth of individuals who invest directly has not a trend not 
helped by the big crash two years ago institutions have changed 
their personality too they have become more active traders rather 
than investors 
as a result the overwhelming volume of buying and selling on 
almost any day now is institutional rather than individual 
individuals havent deserted the securities markets altogether but 
many prefer to invest through funds 
federal reserve records show that since 1968 households have 
been net sellers of stocks in all but one year in that time 
household financial assets held as common stocks have shrunk to 
196 percent from 434 percent 
in 1984 households reduced their direct ownership by 756 
billion in 1985 by 1034 billion in 1986 by 1216 billion in 
1987 by 993 billion and in 1988 by 1055 billion the annual 
rate this year is higher 
who has been buying foreigners for one though they lost some 
enthusiasm last year and this mutual funds of course although 
they too lightened up last year but most of all statelocal 
government retirement funds 
why the latter are such eager buyers isnt quite clear but they 
have been consistent from 1984 through 1988 they added 1115 
billion to their holdings and they have continued their buying 
into 1989 
what these numbers add up to is a trend toward less randomness 
of opinion in the marketplace offsetting the potentially volatile 
effects of this concentration at least to some unmeasurable 
extent has been technology 
seeking to maintain liquidity major exchanges have greatly 
expanded their capacity to handle not just higher volume but 
explosions of volume and sudden turns exchanges have vastly more 
capacity than just a few years ago 
technology however has opposite impacts too one of them being 
the speed with which huge sellers or combinations of them can 
suddenly dump stocks onto the market often by the automatic 
trigger of a computer program 
defenders of the marketplace cite what they say has been a 
relatively low average level of illiquidity regardless of 
outbursts and that big markets naturally tend to produce big 
numbers of every sort gains and losses included 
but until those outbursts of illiquidity are tamed to a greater 
degree it seems unlikely that individuals will reverse their 
longterm trend and return to direct ownership of stocks 
and that leaves the markets to deal with the question of how to 
tame the bursts of illiquidity when so many powerful buyers and 
sellers think alike about the same small list of stocks

when school officials told 10yearold 
audrey pearson she couldnt read the bible on the school bus the 
girls mother turned for help to the rutherford institute 
within days audrey was back reading her bible on the bus 
the rutherford institute is devoted to religious free speech 
i want this group to be a beacon of light for people who give 
up said john w whitehead who founded the institute in his 
basement here in 1982 theres just a myth out there if its on 
public property it cant be religious 
although audreys case took only a few telephone calls the 
rutherford institute has successfully defended cases to the us 
supreme court 
in seven years the institute has grown to 21 state chapters 
across the country and has an annual budget of 800000 forty 
staff attorneys handled 75 cases last year up from 40 cases the 
year before whitehead said 
the institute which has helped people recently in nigeria 
canada and india plans to open offices overseas whitehead said 
the institute recently moved to charlottesville 
michael patrick executive director of the institute said it 
averages 25 calls for help a day and is defending 600 people now 
that does not include calls seeking information and educational 
materials he said 
ellen pearson said she heard about the institute after reading 
an essay by whitehead in a book biblical principles for godly 
living and remembered it when her daughter was forbidden to read 
the bible 
she said she first tried to send audrey to school with a lap 
desk dolls and other items to entertain herself on the onehour 
ride and was told they were unsafe 
i said i am going to let her bring books to school and i said 
because she loves gods word she probably will bring gods word 
mrs pearson said the teacher got quiet and she called me back 
in five minutes and said the principal said she couldnt bring 
that 
mrs pearson said she called the principal of dumfries 
elementary school nicolette rinaldo who said she knew that a rule 
somewhere said children could not bring bibles to school 
an institute attorney called school officials to straighten out 
the matter 
i didnt think it was handled any differently than any other 
formal request to the principal mrs rinaldo said youre 
talking about religious material and normally children dont bring 
religious material to school 
the root of it is fear and a lack of knowledge patrick 
said it the book could have been a stephen king novel 
the group operates largely on donations from people who have 
heard about the institute patrick said 90 percent of donations are 
less than 100 and most are for 10 or 15 
none of the institutes 40 staff attorneys is salaried their 
expenses are paid by grants from the national group patrick said 
one case the institute took successfully to the supreme court 
involved an illinois man who refused a job because religious 
beliefs prevented him from working sundays in march the high 
court ruled in william frazees favor overturning a ruling from 
the appellate court of illinois the lower court had ruled that 
frazees personal religious convictions did not constitute good 
cause for declining a job frazee had been denied unemployment 
benefits 
the sad part is for every one of these theres a dozen that 
go unreported patrick said he said the institute is trying to 
dispel a notion that religious speech is less free than other 
speech 
if its really a freespeech position why should i be 
concerned about what kind of free speech patrick said were 
only as free as the rights of the least free religious people 
with that idea in mind the institute has defended points of 
view that might seem surprising 
whitehead said the institute once assisted a virginia man who 
wanted to put atheist on his license tag the state 
transportation department told the man he could not 
its a churchstate issue whitehead said if you cant 
put atheist on a license plate you cant put theist 
barry lynn legislative counsel for the american civil liberties 
union said the rutherford institute is much more willing than 
the constitution is to allow government support for religious 
activity such as allowing religious clubs to meet in public 
schools 
they obviously have a right to promote their view of the 
constitution lynn said in many instances it is fundamentally 
different from ours and fundamentally wrong 
what they like to say is all speech is the same lynn said 
its not you have to be more careful of any appearance of 
government sponsorship for religious activities 
of audrey pearson lynn said thats probably a case where 
were on the same side individual religious experiences in a 
public place do not necessarily violate the constitution 
benton miller manager of marketing and public affairs for 
conservative digest and a former staffer at the christian 
broadcasting network praised the institute for educating people 
about religious liberties 
its hard to be involved in the issues unless you understand 
the issues enough to make a difference miller said

stock markets around the world appeared to be 
stabilizing heading into todays trading after a friday the 13th 
shock that caused the secondbiggest point drop ever in the dow 
jones 30stock industrial average 
the dow jones average lost a moderate 19 points tuesday after 
weathering a latemorning scare that briefly sent it down more than 
60 points 
tuesdays action was relatively calm after the average plummeted 
190 points friday and then bounced back 88 points monday 
stocks lost little ground tuesday in spite of continued 
uncertainty surrounding a proposed buyout of ual corp and a 
government report showing a biggerthanexpected trade deficit in 
august the federal reserve helped by adding a modest amount of 
reserves to the banking system 
the dow average closed with a loss of 1865 points at 263873 
with 22407 million shares traded on the new york stock exchange 
scarcely more than half mondays volume 
in morning trading today in tokyo the key nikkei index rose 
moderately 
still traders said the markets were not fully back to normal 
the markets moving as they are here very emotionally all 
around the world its very difficult really to put any logic 
behind the movements said chung lew chief stock trader at the 
securities firm kleinwort benson inc in new york 
ual which made speculators rich on the way up made a lot of 
them poor on the way back down the stock fell 2487 to close at 
198 a share twothirds of its recent peak of 294 a share 
traders said the drop in ual helped drag down the overall 
market which had been pumped up partly by speculation that a 
seemingly endless round of debtfinanced takeovers would ratchet 
stock prices higher 
the employeemanagement group that wants to buy the parent of 
united airlines was still trying to put together a deal to replace 
the 300ashare buyout proposal that fell apart last week sending 
the market into its friday the 13th swoon 
most traders said the big trade deficit while bad news had 
relatively little effect on the market the commerce department 
said the august deficit rose about 31 percent to 1077 billion 
from a revised july deficit of 824 billion 
the dollar spiked downward but quickly recovered after the trade 
report in a surprising show of strength that helped soothe 
investors in the stock market bonds gave up some early gains to 
finish mixed 
the federal reserve pumped 15 billion into the banking system 
to make sure banks had enough reserves to make emergency loans to 
any traders who lost big in the markets gyrations it had injected 
2 billion in reserves monday 
by adding reserves the federal reserve is cheering up investors 
who say the central bank has endangered the economy by being too 
stingy with the money supply but the fed has acted very cautiously 
and there has been no decisive downward move in the federal funds 
rate which it influences this rate is the interest charged when a 
bank loans money overnight to another bank to enable it to meet 
reserve requirements 
at times it appeared tuesday that the stock market was being 
pulled around by the stockindex futures market in chicago where 
rises and falls tend to be exaggerated because it takes less money 
to bet on the direction of the market the swings in chicago were 
transmitted to the stock market in new york through computerized 
program trading that exploited price discrepancies between them

bankers trust new york corp one of the largest 
us banks said it set aside an additional 16 billion to cover 
possibly bad third world loans drastically reducing its exposure 
to risky debts 
the move tuesday by the nations eighthlargest banking company 
will result in a thirdquarter loss of 142 billion as well as a 
stillundetermined loss for all of 1989 a detailed earnings report 
is scheduled to be released monday 
bankers trusts decision mirrors action taken recently by a 
handful of other big banks which also reported big quarterly 
losses 
bankers trust and the others attributed their protective moves 
to intensifying political and economic problems in debtor nations 
such as argentina and brazil as well as a growing sentiment in 
washington toward forgiving some past debts 
recent events including the outcome of mexican debt 
negotiations and the periodic suspensions of timely payments of 
interest by other countries had the effect of reducing the 
value of ldc loans chairman charles s sanford jr said in a 
statement 
while reduction of interest and principal can allow time for 
adjustment only sound economic policies on the part of debtor 
countries can provide a solution 
the 16 billion special provision brings bankers trusts 
allowance for credit losses to 29 billion or around 85 percent 
of its medium to longterm outstanding third world loans 
thats the secondlargest percentage behind jp morgan amp co 
which said in september it had bolstered reserves cover all 
mediumto longterm loans 
the average percentage of protection among most banks that have 
loaned money to third world countries is 58 percent 
analysts say that many of the major banks that have begun facing 
up to the likelihood of huge losses of loans to developing 
countries known as ldc loans are unlikely to resume largescale 
lending to those nations for many years 
bankers trust said in its statement that it would continue to 
apply its merchant banking skills in ways that are useful to the 
public and private sectors of third world countries however it 
made no mention of lending more money

a computer worm that sends an antinuclear 
message has invaded at least 50 computers on a nonclassified 
worldwide network of more than 15000 scientific computers and is 
spreading security officials said 
the worm a piece of software similar to a computer virus is 
relatively harmless but annoying said ron tencati security 
manager for the space physics analysis network in greenbelt md it 
flashes a message saying 
worms against nuclear killers 
your system has been officially wanked 
the network links a wide range of universities and government 
installations such as nasa and defense department research centers 
but none of the computers on it are involved in topsecret work 
tencati said tuesday 
the worm was spotted early monday soon after the triggering of 
a rare but harmful virus last friday that virus known as 
datacrime or columbus day attacked personal computers not the big 
computers affected by the worm 
the wank worm has not caused damage to any nasa installation 
especially the kennedy space center which is preparing to launch 
the shuttle atlantis on wednesday according to charles redmond a 
nasa spokesman 
no secret data no classified data nothing of a national 
security nature has been violated redmond said 
the worm can only get into computers whose users have neglected 
fairly basic security procedures such as keeping their passwords 
different from their user names tencati said 
security at most computer centers is good enough that the worm 
should not spread too widely he said 
the worm attacks a network of digital equipment corps vax 
computers known as decnet internet that network is similar to but 
separate from the main internet network which was attacked last 
year by a worm created by a cornell university graduate student 
besides flashing its antinuclear message the worm frightens 
computer users by making them think incorrectly that their files 
have been deleted it also scrambles passwords and flashes short 
fortune cookiestyle messages to other uninfected computers 
the main components of the decnet internet are the 
nasaadministered space physics analysis network with about 5500 
computers and its european counterpart the european space physics 
analysis network with about 500 as well as the high energy 
physics network with about 8000 computers and its european 
counterpart european hepnet with about 1000 
the worm gets into the computers through a backdoor opening 
in the software program designed to let users do some tailoring on 
their computers for their own purposes 
the us government previously advised users to close the 
opening but many have not done so because the software change in 
computers takes about two hours to perform redmond said 
several of the 99 messages that the worm can broadcast are 
racially or ethnically offensive said michael alexander a 
reporter for computerworld a weekly newspaper who researched the 
issue

shortly after 10 am monday a stock futures 
contract tracking 20 big corporations shot higher in chicago 
boom 
a wave of computergenerated program trading orders to buy 
stocks kicked in and the broader stock market stampeded upward in 
a stunning 15minute reversal the dow jones industrials average 
moved from 63 points down to 6 points up 
the gyrations from the markets friday the 13th plunge showed 
that big swings in the chicago futures market can translate into 
equally large movements in the stocks in new york via computerized 
program trading which was widely criticized for worsening the 1987 
stock market crash 
they kept pushing as the day went on donald selkin head of 
stockindex futures research at prudentialbache securities inc 
said tuesday the programs id say were a good part of the 
advance 
the practice of moving millions of shares of stock with 
lightning speed was voluntarily limited by stock exchanges and 
brokerage houses in the wake of the oct 19 1987 crash but 
gradually has been revived this year 
after fridays 190point decline some analysts speculated that 
the new york stock exchange over the weekend encouraged firms to 
avoid using computerized sell programs that could spur a 
disastrous plunge but to step in with buy orders if possible that 
could propel the market higher the exchange declined to comment on 
the matter tuesday 
program trading is a strategy involving the stockindex futures 
market in chicago and stock trading in new york stockindex 
futures are contracts to buy or sell baskets of stocks at specified 
prices by a specified date 
in one form called index arbitrage the strategy employs 
computers to buy and sell huge blocks of stocks and index futures 
in an attempt to profit from minute differences in prices on the 
two markets the practice can cause rapid price swings and is 
believed by some to have accelerated the 1987 market collapse 
but defenders complain that the strategy is used as a scapegoat 
for sometimenormal market fluctuations 
theres always fish in a tidal wave because theres always 
fish in the water said r steven wunsch vice president of 
financial futures at kidder peabody amp co one of wall streets 
heaviest program trading firms 
buyers and sellers in an outright fashion move markets he 
said those who are buying and selling simultaneously dont cause 
volatility taken all together its a noninfluence 
wunsch instead blamed market volatility on an overdependence on 
intermediate dealers whose job is to bring together buyers and 
sellers 
a presidential task force known as the brady commission that 
invesigated the 1987 crash concluded that index arbitagers were 
active at times of big price swings but didnt cause the crash 
after the crash some firms reduced their program trading levels 
because of intense criticism by politicians and others dean 
witter reynolds inc abandoned the practice altogether but there 
has been a revival this year officials said 
the sharp price swings friday and monday intensified debate over 
index arbitrage nyse chairman john j phelan jr said program 
trading accounted for 24 million of 100 million shares traded in 
the final 1 hours of trading friday 
we would say that it was abundant but we wouldnt say it was 
something that precipitated the market decline he said 
when the markets opened monday stockindex futures were trading 
at a discount to the underlying stocks stock prices sank in the 
first halfhour of trading buying of major market index futures of 
the 20 stocks soon pulled the futures market higher and buy 
programs kicked in a similar action triggered buying on terrible 
tuesday oct 20 1987 
some players said wall streets major brokerages should step in 
with programs to help stem a decline 
i think they should be in there all the time taking the market 
up said john j cramer president of the new york money 
management firm cramer amp co whenever the big sell programs come 
in i think the powers that be ought to be in there taking it back 
up

workers on wall street are earning more money 
than ever if theyre still working 
a federal report tuesday said 15000 securities industry 
employees here have lost their jobs since the stock market crash of 
october 1987 for those who survived however average pay was 
nearly 79000 last year 
that was a 13 percent salary increase over 1987 and it came to 
more than 25 times the average annual pay for all private 
employees in new york city 
the report by the regional bureau of labor statistics said new 
yorks economy was not devastated by the 1987 crash as some 
feared but employment has been essentially flat since the crash 
after a decade of growth 
the postcrash record has clearly not been the disaster widely 
touted by the forecasts and in the headlines in the early months 
following black monday the report said but it does close out 
a period of unprecedented private sector job expansion marking a 
distinct break with the past 
samuel ehrenhalt regional commissioner of labor statistics 
said the stock markets more recent gyrations were part of an 
ongoing restructuring in the securities industry 
the stock market crash two years ago marked the end of the 
resurgence of the 80s and the beginning of a transition thats 
still taking shape said ehrenhalt what youre seeing now is a 
continuation of structural changes on wall street that process 
hasnt reached its end point 
at the same time wall streets rising salaries indicated a 
good deal of vitality ehrenhalt said average annual pay in the 
securities industry in the city has risen from 19317 in 1975 to 
78625 last year 
the figures indicated that securities workers laid off since the 
crash were the least productive and lowest paid ehrenhalt said 
the securities industry in new york now employs 146000 people 
down from a peak of 163000 in december 1987 hiring momentum 
carried it to its peak two months after the crash of oct 19 1987 
before the crash wall street employment had increased by an 
average of 12000 jobs a year since the early 1980s 
the banking industry also lost jobs as a result of the 1987 
market crash with employment falling by 9500 in the past two 
years the agency said banking jobs had been declining before the 
crash but far more slowly

top officials of the nations four largest 
futures exchanges told a senate committee that some proposed market 
reforms could drive their business overseas 
at the same hearing tuesday the head of the agency that 
oversees the futures markets said the proposed legislation gives 
the markets more power than they want 
wendy l gramm chairwoman of the commodity futures trading 
commission said her agency neither needs nor wants authority to 
conduct undercover operations like the one that resulted in 46 
indictments this summer in chicagos freewheeling commodities 
trading pits 
i believe the current situation with the fbi having the 
authority is sufficient ms gramm told the senate agriculture 
nutrition and forestry committee which is considering legislation 
to reform the futures markets and reauthorize financing for the 
cftc which oversees them 
ms gramm also said 
she believed that 17 of the indicted chicago traders still were 
working in the pits including some handling customer orders she 
expressed concern about it but said the regulatory agency had to 
balance that against the rights of the accused theyre indicted 
they havent been tried and convicted 
temporary trading halts known as circuit breakers and 
other market safeguards implemented since the 1987 stock market 
crash appeared to work as designed during fridays stock market 
plunge she also said she was satisfied with intermarket 
communication during the stock slide 
there was no need to give the cftc power to order crooked 
brokers to pay restitution to customers they have cheated a 
majority of the commission believes current law provides sufficient 
recourse for customers to obtain reimbursement of losses when funds 
are available she said 
at the same hearing officials of the chicago board of trade 
the chicago mercantile exchange the new york mercantile exchange 
and the new yorkbased commodity exchange warned senators that 
tougher recordkeeping standards and service fees mandated by the 
bill could make them uncompetitive with foreign markets 
in addition to undercover probes and broker restitution the 
proposed futures trading practices act of 1989 would require 
stricter recordkeeping by market participants to independently 
precisely and completely record transaction times 
at issue is the audit trail an accurate record of any given 
transaction that would allow investigators to determine if it 
reflected what really happened and if the transaction followed the 
rules 
the general accounting office the investigatory arm of the 
congress has found that current recordkeeping on most exchanges 
is inadequate to prevent fraud because so much of it is orginated 
by traders themselves often by hand 
the bill also calls for financing steppedup floor surveillance 
through service fees which several exchanges have criticized as a 
secret tax 
the worst outcome of this reauthorization process said bot 
chairman karsten mahlmann would be to use the chicago indictments 
as an excuse for imposing audit trail standards utterly 
incompatible with a liquid market or raising costs of access to our 
customers by imposing new and unwarranted taxes on our markets 
he added that new fees could constitute a crushing burden and 
competitive handicap against foreign markets that arent as 
restricted 
the bill is sponsored by sen patrick leahy dvt the 
committee chairman and sen richard g lugar of indiana the 
panels ranking republican 
futures contracts are agreements to deliver a quantity of goods 
at a specified price at a certain time in the future they are used 
by producers of such commodities as soybeans or gold to lock in a 
favorable price while speculators buy and sell those contracts in 
pursuit of a profit 
during this past year said leahy regulation of the 
futures industry has lurched from crisis to crisis 
in addition to the undercover fbi probe that resulted in the 
chicago indictments a separate probe of futures exchanges in new 
york was disclosed in may 
in july the cbot issued an emergency order requiring traders to 
slash their holdings in soybeans futures contracts the order 
touched off wild fluctuations in soybean prices 
a bill also containing futures market reform was passed by the 
house last month both bills seek to limit dual trading the 
controversial but legal practice that allows traders to conduct 
transactions for their own accounts as well as those of their 
customers 
ms gramm said a study by her agency found dual trading does not 
have the impact on futures markets that its supporters have claimed

the international air transport association 
has announced an agreement for a computerbased system officials 
said should increase airline profits and help passengers fly where 
they want with less difficulty 
the system to manage airline seat inventories is already used by 
several us airlines 
iata which represents the worlds scheduled airlines will make 
it available for a fee to both large and small carriers throughout 
the world officials said tuesday 
by keeping track of seat use and passenger demand the system 
developed by control data corp of minneapolis allows airlines to 
make the best use of available seats both in terms of revenue and 
service said gary e campbell of control data 
he said the system enables a large or small airline to project 
how many seats it can sell in various categories for each flight 
and could help the company in making decisions about advertising 
and the number and size of planes to use on its routes 
for passengers it will mean less of a chance of getting bumped 
off of a flight and a better chance of getting a ticket for the 
flight desired campbell said 
the price an airline pays for the service will be determined by 
the number of passengers it carries and the system can be applied 
either to selected flights or to all of the flights the airline 
operates said geoffrey bailey who will manage the system for iata 
in geneva 
information including seats available for each flight would be 
constantly updated by the airlines that participate and made 
available to travel agents throughout the world he said 
what this could lead to is a situation where you could go into 
a travel agent and say ive got 50 and i want to fly from 
washington to miami what can you do for me said bailey while 
such a flight may not be immediately available he said the agent 
might be able to find an airline willing to take the passenger 
bailey said such systems have increased an airlines overall 
revenue by from 5 percent to 11 percent by reducing the number of 
unused seats and helping it to set realistic fares for business and 
personal travel 
the price iata paid for the license to lease the system to its 
member airlines was not disclosed

us trade representative carla hills said 
that new economic talks with japan should produce a plan for 
action but no massive cut by next year in the us trade deficit 
with japan 
the two countries have agreed to make a final report next july 
on their talks to remove structural impediment barriers to 
trade between the united states and japan 
the talks began in tokyo last month and are to continue off and 
on until next summer 
even by then mrs hills cautioned tuesday it will be very 
hard to say that the negotiators have achieved a massive 
reduction in the deficit 
mrs hills was asked at a news conference how she would cope 
with growing sentiment in congress for negotiated market shares or 
managed trade if there is no easing of the us deficit with 
japan that hortfall has been running at more than 50 billion a 
year 
i am against managed trade she said i think you sell 
yourself short when you decree that a group of bureaucrats can 
decide you are entitled to 5 or 10 per cent of a market in almost 
every market where we agreed to a percentage i feel 
shortchanged i think we could do better she added 
echoing president bushs declaration that the talks would be a 
twoway street the japanese are pressing the united states to 
improve its education and competitiveness and raise savings 
deposits and investment 
in tokyo she said the japanese side was impressed with 
facts and figures produced by the united states to bolster 
complaints against traditional japanese systems of distribution 
pricing land use business collusion and bidding all of which the 
united states says discriminate against foreign products 
it is a winwin situation not a question of dictating to 
each other she said because there is little dispute about the 
potential gains of eliminating the shortcomings that have been 
identified in each country 
early action on the japanese side she said could take the form 
of tightening enforcement of laws already on the books at the 
current enforcement level there is little incentive not to engage 
in business collusion she said and the japanese fair trade 
commission needs more funds 
the commission last fined a business in the 1970s and took no 
action at all last year she said in contrast to the us justice 
department which in 1988 filed 200 criminal actions and fined us 
businesses 30 million

a company virtually unknown in north america may 
hold the remedy to the soviet unions severe housing shortage by 
literally building from the ground up 
terra block worldwide which was dirtpoor five years ago has 
hit the motherlode in the soviet union with its simple hydraulic 
compressor that converts regular soil into sturdy adobelike 
construction bricks 
the orlandobased company received soviet orders for 2000 of 
its 75000 terrablock duplex machines following a visit to moscow 
earlier this year by company founder robert gross 
were getting inquiries from the soviet union nearly every 
day said gross a retired national aeronautics and space 
administration engineer we cant make the machines quickly 
enough 
gross said terra block now must divert nearly all its focus 
toward the soviet union where the era of perestroika has eased 
trade restrictions with the west 
the soviets face an incredible housing crunch sometimes there 
are three families sharing a flat no bigger than a studio 
apartment said gross 57 who spends nearly half the year 
traveling abroad this is something that gorbachev has set as a 
priority we just happened to be the right company at the right 
place at the right political time 
gross said the machine was inspired by a trip to arizona in the 
1970s when he studied homes constructed of handmade adobe 
properly built adobe structures offer a natural insulation and are 
extremely durable such as the 900yearold taos pueblo in new 
mexico 
but the weeks needed to dry the adobe bricks in the sun made 
largescale modern projects impractical 
gross then began work on a prototype compression machine that 
used computerized hydraulic rams to squeeze dirt into building 
blocks the productionmodel terrablock duplex churns out up to 600 
30pound blocks an hour using less than a gallon of diesel fuel 
the bricks formed under nearly 500000 poundspersquareinch 
pressure are stacked without mortar and covered with a 
plasterbased coating the structures have passed all international 
seismic and stress tests said gross 
terra block spokesman steve buntell said the bricks can be used 
for buildings up to two stories high 
several other brickmaking machines are in use in the third 
world but buntell said they require additives such as concrete and 
operate more slowly 
in 1985 the company sold just one machine to the west african 
nation of gabon today there are about 50 machines in use mostly 
in africa and asia four machines have been sold in the united 
states including one to the hare krishna sect for its proposed 
headquarters in tennessee 
we havent found any soil yet that wont work said gross 
nicknamed dr dirt by coworkers the sandier the soil the 
more pressure needed but weve made blocks from soil in saudi 
arabia that was almost all sand even in winter we can dig below 
the frozen surface to useable dirt 
the 150 million terrablock deal with the soviet union offers an 
insight into the nations changing economic policies he said 
while the staterun construction ministry acts as a liaison 
individual communitybased cooperatives can put in orders for a 
machine if they come up with hard currency such as dollars 
when an order is placed the money is transferred directly into 
terra blocks account in an amsterdambased bank said gross 
carl mcmillian a soviet trade expert at carlton university in 
ottawa said the soviet government is becoming more aggressive in 
seeking needed goods including housing 
if they want it bad enough then theres a way to come up with 
the hard cash he said 
last year the soviets imported 264 billion worth of western 
goods and exported 229 billion in goods to the west said 
mcmillian 
terra blocks plans call for about 100 machines to be shipped to 
the soviet union by the end of the year 
the deal with the soviets was a breakthrough for us said 
buntell it really gave a push to the dream of becoming the 
worlds largest home builder

strikebound eastern airlines says it is 
rebuilding faster than it had projected last spring and should 
emerge larger than expected from bankruptcy reorganization but two 
of its unions questioned the carriers longterm stability 
frank lorenzo chairman of easterns parent texas air corp and 
phil bakes easterns president said a combination of lower labor 
costs and a level of public acceptance that is enabling the airline 
to fill a very healthy percentage of its seats have helped the 
airline rebuild 
we are well along on our road of rebuilding the airline 
lorenzo told a news conference tuesday 
lorenzo also said the company was continuing to discuss an 
amended plan of reorganization with its creditors and expected to 
file it shortly he said he remained committed to paying creditors 
100 cents on the dollar 
but spokesmen for two of the unions that have been on strike 
against the miamibased airline since march 4 said eastern 
continues to face serious competitive problems 
eastern filed for protection from creditors under chapter 11 of 
the federal bankruptcy laws shortly after being hit by the strike 
by its machinists union pilots and flight attendants 
the company said it would have 85 percent to 90 percent of 
prestrike operations when it emerges from bankruptcy protection 
early next year its earlier target was to emerge at 60 percent to 
65 percent of prestrike operations 
the airline expects to surpass its earlier goal of having about 
820 daily flights in december and should have 1000 flights a day 
by late spring compared with 1050 before the strike 
those figures exclude its northeast shuttle service that eastern 
sold to developer donald trump for 365 million earlier this year 
but wally haber senior general chairman district 100 
machinists which represents all eastern machinists members said 
he had doubts about whether eastern will be able to meet its new 
goals for flights 
we know they are extremely short of aircraft mechanics he 
said we just dont think they can get the machinists to support 
the type of flight levels they are talking about 
the air line pilots association meanwhile said that although 
eastern presnted itself all gussied up in new clothes and fresh 
makeup at the news conference the airline still is facing a 
doubtful future as a survivor in the highly competitive airline 
market 
among easterns continuing problems the pilots group said are 
financial shortfalls chronic shortages and other problems in 
maintenance and pilot training vulnerability to an economic 
downturn and an aging fleet 
bakes declined to comment on how much money eastern was losing 
but said he expects the airline to be profitable in 1990 
bakes said eastern will operate a fleet of 188 planes next 
spring compared with the 157 it projected initially 
the company also said it had a work force of 17300 compared 
with 31200 before the strike eastern has hired replacement pilots 
and some have crossed picket lines 
eastern expects to surpass its projection of 750 daily flights 
by november and fly 775 to 80 cities it expects to fly 835 daily 
flights in december up from an earlier projection of 820 
eastern now is flying about 700 flights a day 
eastern said it intends to maintain a strong international 
presence providing service to south and central america mexico 
and the caribbean 
atlanta has been restored as easterns major hub the company 
said and eastern should again be miamis largest carrier this 
winter

fischer senior trader at manufacturers hanover bank in frankfurt

los angeles financier marvin davis has withdrawn 
his backup 300ashare allcash bid for united airlines parent 
but indicated he might make another offer 
we remain very interested in acquiring ual corp davis said 
in a statement late tuesday 
a proposed 300ashare offer by a pilotmanagement group along 
with british airways plc fell short friday when banks refused to 
finance the deal news of the financing problems helped trigger the 
largest drop in the dow jones industrials average since the crash 
of 1987 but the group and its lenders are attempting to work out a 
revised proposal 
at the time davis said his offer would apply if the 
pilotmanagement deal fell through it was davis who had triggered 
the ual buyout battle when he first submitted a bid for the company 
in august 
but davis said that when the bank financing fell through for the 
pilotmanagement group his agent bank informed him that it was 
exploring the level of financing available for his proposed 
acquisition of ual 
davis said he intended to continue working with his financing 
sources in order to determine at what price a bid can be 
financed 
on tuesday ual stock plunged as investors continued to express 
skepticism over efforts by the pilotmanagement group to put 
together a new buyout proposal shares fell 2487 to close at 
198 in new york stock exchange trading after plummeting nearly 
57 a share on monday 
theres still a significant group on wall street that simply 
does not believe a deal is going to get done for ual said 
stephen dexter an airline industry analyst with kemper financial 
services inc 
citibank and chase manhattan bank were working to line up 
japanese lenders to finance the deal 
terms of the revised ual proposal would lower the bid to 250 a 
share or 562 billion raise the interest rate on the loan and 
give banks bigger fees for participating said akira yokoo a 
citicorp spokesman in tokyo 
the evening standard in london reported that daiichi kangyo 
bank had agreed to participate in the deal partly because the 
japanese government wanted to boost the countrys reputation as an 
aggressive lender 
at mitsubishi trust bank in tokyo a spokesman said the bank 
would probably finance part of the deal 
meanwhile john peterpaul the vice president of the 
international association of machinists and aerospace workers 
reiterated the unions vehement opposition to the takeover and 
called for the resignation of ual chairman stephen m wolf 
your role in the recent effort to take over united airlines 
can only be characterized as greedy and irresponsible 
peterpaul said in a letter to wolf 
wolf would have reaped 767 million and chief financial officer 
john c pope 377 million under the original buyout proposal 
wolf said any resignations were not in the best interest of the 
company he defended his actions and those of the board of 
directors saying it was regrettable and totally unfair 
that the machinists have chosen to make such a divisive and

a dashing banker with a taste for alfa romeos 
rumored military shipments to the middle east a secret plan to 
provide billions of dollars to iraq through italys biggest bank 
with no record on the books 
it could be the stuff of a robert ludlum potboiler but since 
us authorities descended on an italian bank in atlanta last 
august the elements have instead emerged at the center of a 
mystery involving italy iraq and a us government agency 
officials say the banca nazionale del lavoro branch in atlantas 
peachtree center secretly approved 3 billion in loans to iraq in 
198889 in the form of letters of credit for us and european 
firms for exports to iraq 
iraq insists it was unaware the loans were secret it says the 
money was for grain and machinery and other civilian uses like 
making cars 
but several companies that reportedly received secret bnl 
credits were implicated in past middle east arms scandals other 
firms used bnl credits to sell iraq machines with possible military 
applications although they say the sales were legal 
the case has become italys biggest banking scandal since the 
1982 collapse of banco ambrosiano italys largest private bank 
which made huge loans to latin american dummy companies 
it has prompted an investigation by rome magistrates into 
possible illegal arms sales and bribes and probes by the fbi and 
us attorney in atlanta into whether fraud was involved so far 
no one has been charged 
the us department of agriculture also is investigating whether 
its commodity credit corporation was duped in the affair 
meanwhile directors of the governmentowned bnl have been 
forced to resign and italian opposition parties have demanded an 
inquiry 
we want credible answers from the government to the questions 
of traffic of arms the role of the secret service the violation 
of international embargoes regarding iraq declared a leftist 
opposition deputy franco bassanini 
in this case there are disquieting signs and suspicions 
so far the affair has raised many puzzling questions why were 
the huge loans to iraq made how could they slip unnoticed past 
us and italian regulators who in the bank or the various 
governments knew what was going on 
at the center of the scandal is the atlanta branch manager 
40yearold christopher drogoul a blond athletically built 
frenchamerican with a penchant for wellcut suits and alfa romeo 
sports cars drogoul was considered an intelligent aggressive 
banker 
bnl says drogoul was supposed to stick to a credit limit of 
500000 per customer and it thought he did 
but drogoul manipulated the books and hid the iraqi credits in 
secret files some in his redbrick home in suburban decatur us 
and italian authorities say 
the banker and his lawyer have refused comment 
bnl has fired the former manager and suspended nine other 
managers of the 19member atlanta staff on oct 12 the bank sued 
in us federal court charging drogoul and paul von wedel a 
suspended vice president of the atlanta office with providing 
unauthorized credits that cost the bank millions of dollars in 
losses their lawyer denied the bank was harmed 
guido carli minister of italys treasury which owns 74 percent 
of bnl has charged the banks directors missed the atlanta 
arrangements through lax inspection 
but many people doubt that the 3 billion operation could have 
escaped the notice of the home office 
its too odd said a european banker in london speaking on 
condition of anonymity commissions were coming in why the bank 
branch hadnt been inspected for such a long time why 
bnls former us director luigi sardelli told the italian 
weekly europeo that when he was appointed in 1987 the bnl branches 
hadnt been inspected in two years 
he alerted the banks directors of serious problems in atlanta 
the warning was ignored sardelli said 
suspicions of connivance by top bank officials have led to 
speculation that italian politicians were involved a natural leap 
of faith in a country in which 80 percent of the banks are 
governmentowned and most bank directors are political appointees 
former bnl executives have fed the fire by implying 
international skulduggery 
theres something that escapes us something that has to do 
with international politics not of a banking nature the banks 
ousted chairman nerio nesi told the italian weekly lespresso 
aside from escaping detection at bank headquarters the atlanta 
operation also passed unnoticed during inspections by the georgia 
banking and finance department and the us federal reserve which 
did not realize bnl was financing the iraqi credits through loans 
from other banks in italy the central bank of italy picked up no 
trace of the secret loans 
there were two sets of books the set we had looked fine 
said bob moler a spokesman for the georgia department which had 
primary responsibility for regulating the bank 
like the banco ambrosiano case the bnl affair underlines bank 
regulators difficulties in controlling transactions in an 
increasingly international market the problem worries italian 
officials who among other things fear the mafia will easily 
launder its money when the 12nation european community becomes a 
unified market in 1992 
unlike banco ambrosiano bnl will not collapse authorities 
emphasize state companies have issued loans to increase the banks 
capital and the bank of italy would intervene if bnl ran into 
trouble 
iraq has promised to make good on the credits although analysts 
have raised fears about payment because iraqs economy was crippled 
by its war with iran 
bnl isnt the only institution that could get stuck if iraq 
doesnt repay the us commodity credit corporation which 
promotes american farm exports has guaranteed about 700 million 
of the bnl credits granted in 198889 
sure were concerned about what we have learned has happened 
in the bank in atlanta said don street of the agencys 
operations division but that has not changed our looking at 
iraqs ability to pay back 
nonetheless the department of agriculture is examining all its 
bnl operations

textile industry analysts were trying to 
determine whether the proposed 600 million sale of three cluett 
peabody amp co manufacturing divisions to a french company would 
significantly cut debt from farley incs acquisition of west 
pointpepperell inc 
cluett the makers of arrow shirts gold toe socks and 
schoeneman suits is a division of georgiabased pepperell which 
was acquired by chicagobased farley in a 3 billion debtfinanced 
deal earlier this year 
bidermann industries usa a subsidiary of the parisbased 
bidermann group a fashion and apparel firm is acquiring the major 
cluett manufacturing divisions under an agreement announced monday 
farley has for months been expected to sell cluett to pare the 
debt from the pepperell deal farley reportedly sought up to 800 
million for the cluett divisions although some analysts have 
placed their value as low as 450 million 
he farley almost certainly got less than he wanted said 
don hogsett business editor of home textiles today a trade 
publication the question remains how does he pare down his debt 
will he have to sell more 
farley spokesman jack albertine was traveling tuesday and could 
not be reached for comment messages left through his secretary in 
chicago were not returned 
roy bowen executive vice president of the georgia textile 
manufacturing association said it was difficult to predict what 
farley might do next to secure cash for the pepperell deal 
a lot has happened in the debt markets since he acquired west 
point he said 
bowen said the bidermann deal should not have much effect on 
pepperells operations because cluett is in the apparel sector 
rather than in pepperells main textile business 
this doesnt detract at all from west points standing as a 
major textile company he said 
applauding the deal was the amalgamated clothing amp textile 
workers union which itself made a bid for cluett during the summer 
were very pleased said garry ferraris an actwu vice 
president in knoxville tenn it bidermann looks like a company 
thats on a solid financial slate and putting up enough cash so it 
wont be so leveraged 
the sale to bidermann subject to regulatory approval is 
expected to be completed by the end of november

cable television giant telecommunications inc 
has announced it will buy 50 percent of showtime networks inc the 
nations secondlargest pay television service 
telecommunications said tuesday it plans to buy half of 
showtime from new yorkbased viacom international inc for 225 
million 
other investors may participate in the purchase the company 
added 
showtime has been struggling to compete against the larger home 
box office owned by time warner inc and viacom has been looking 
for possible investors from the cable industry to invest in 
showtime 
analysts said the infusion of cash along with 
telecommunications strength in the industry will help showtime 
i think this is terrific said showtimes chairman and chief 
executive winston h tony cox 
having the support of a leading cable company like tci means 
some rather significant subscriber growth secondly the rest of 
the industry will recognize the tci endorsement which will help us 
with other cable operators he said 
home box office operates the hbo and cinemax paytv networks 
that claim about 23 million million subscribers showtime operates 
showtime and the movie channel which have a combined total of 
about 10 million subscribers

it doesnt break out is earnings

that pay television is an important part of the companys 
operations 
telecommunications the nations largest cable company has 
been investing in programming channels in recent years it led a 
bailout of atlantabased turner broadcast systems inc and owns 
chunks of such channels as american movie classics and black 
entertainment network 
showtime runs on most of telecommunications cable systems the 
company also carries home box office on most of its systems 
stewart schley editor of the cable world trade journal in 
denver said the purchase offers a lot of distribution strengths 
for showtime i think strategically it increases the likelihood 
of a strong no 2 for showtime 
without tci our future would be a lot less secure cox 
said i do not want to say we would go out of business but our 
future is a lot more certain with tci

crayola name and having good feelings about it we thought that 
feeling could be widened to different age groups and we were 
right 
binney amp smith plants in winfield and at the subsidiarys 
headquarters in easton pa now turn out about 9 million crayons a 
day in 72 colors 
but with marketing help from hallmark they also make new and 
higherpriced lines of washable felttip markers and paints for 
youngsters and more precise erasable colored mechanical pencils 
for older children they also produce the companys liquitex brand 
of acrylic paints used by art students and professional artists 
last year binney amp smith even began selling coloring books 
our crayon market has always been as stable as any market can 
be said jim wilson manager of the winfield plant but parents 
were looking for other products for their children 
we knew mothers would love this wilson said of the felttip 
markers printed with erasable in large letters they were 
telling us they wanted it to keep markers off the furniture and 
walls 
in addition the company is selling its products in new places 
from hotels to airlines and planning more products targeted toward 
teenagers and the growing adult crafts market 
the teenage and youngadult market is enormous hockaday 
said we feel we can migrate the feelings that a young person has 
toward crayola into other products as they move into the preteen 
years and then beyond 
so far the theory seems to be working hallmark doesnt reveal 
financial figures because it is privately owned but hockaday said 
binney amp smith and its 1300 employees have done slightly better 
than hallmark forecast five years ago its revenues and profits 
have been growing by double digits in the last few years he said 
hallmark itself which had sales of 23 billion in 1988 still 
specializes in greetingcards and the related products in dealers 
stores 
its lines of greeting cards including the hallmark line and the 
massmarket ambassador line sold in grocery and drug stores 
account for 44 percent of all us card sales 
but officials decided they needed to diversify for the future of 
the company owned by descendants of founder joyce hall and some 
employees 
we dont see any serious clouds on the horizon of our core 
business but theoretically technology could eat into the 
greetingcard business a bit in the future hockaday said and 
theoretically rapidly increasing postal rates if they occurred 
could slow our sales 
in 1987 and 1988 hallmark bought 10 spanishlanguage television 
stations and a spanishlanguage tv network based in los angeles 
the company had some experience making greeting cards for 
hispanic customers but felt the market had been mostly overlooked 
by advertisers in the past hockaday said 
the hispanic market is growing faster than any other market 
segment that im aware of hockaday said we think its one of 
those unique niche growth opportunities 
future acquisitions are under consideration hockaday said but 
hallmark officials view the market as overheated right now and 
are acting cautiously 
meanwhile at the winfield plant crayons now share floor space 
with washable markers but its still crayons that most fascinate 
the local schoolchildren who regularly tour the plant said plant 
manager wilson 
their appeal is enduring he said thats our greatest 
strength

media general inc has put up for sale 31 
weekly newspapers in orange county and the san gabriel valley area 
saying the papers are too far from its base in virginia 
the richmond vabased firm announced the planned sale tuesday 
adding that the decision was also prompted by a desire to 
concentrate on its chain of daily newspapers 
the papers it wants to sell constitute golden west publishing 
inc and are to be sold as a unit 
they include nine published by south orange county news in 
mission viejo and 22 run by highlander publications of the city of 
industry all but one are distributed to community residents free 
of charge 
a statement issued by media general said that management 
demands for the west coast operations are no longer prudent and 
that we prefer to concentrate our efforts on daily newspaper 
operations 
media general owns newspapers in richmond and tampa fla and 
television and cable systems elsewhere in the southeast 
golden west chief executive ron redfern said the papers have a 
combined circulation of 487000 and gross annual revenues of about 
15 million 
he would not disclose the asking price but said that weekly 
newspapers usually sell for one to two times their gross revenues 
a number of companies had expressed interest redfern said but 
he declined not identify them 
golden west was formed in 1980 and 1981 with the purchase of 
several small weekly newspaper chains redfern said the company 
initially had planned to convert one or more of the papers to 
dailies but later changed its plans 
media general successfully defended itself against a hostile 
takeover attempt last year by hollywood producer burt sugarman and 
sold its only other west coast operation a paper mill in pomona 
to sugarman after his bid failed

stock prices rallied wednesday to close sharply 
higher after fears subsided over what effect the california 
earthquake would have on wall street 
the financial timesstock exchange 100share index jumped 346 
points or 16 percent to close at 21701 its high for the day 
the key index had been under pressure most of the morning over 
concerns that possible economic effects of the earthquake would 
undermine prices on wall street and translate into sharper declines 
for british stocks 
but londons fortunes turned after dealers reappraised the 
direct impact of the disaster and new york rebounded from its early 
disasterled losses 
wall street didnt collapse so there was no reason for london 
to a dealer with the london investment firm hoare govett ltd 
noted 
the financial times 30share index finished 278 points higher 
at 17585 points the financial times 500share index closed at 
120254 up 208 points 
volume was 4493 million shares traded the lightest this week 
and down from 6434 million shares on tuesday 
british insurance stocks which some equity analysts forecast 
might be heavily hit by the earthquake disaster helped underpin 
london by staging only narrow losses in early dealings 
dealers said the market still has not shaken off its nervousness 
after the sharp declines of recent sessions which resulted from a 
190point drop in the dow jones industrial average on friday 
but technical factors including modest gains in the british 
pound helped draw buying back into the market and at least reverse 
losses posted a day earlier

trinova corp announced wednesday it would 
lay off 1500 employees in its second restructuring in as many 
years 
thomas ainsworth a spokesman for the suburban toledobased 
company said 40 of the companys 170 plants would be closed or 
reduced ainsworth declined comment on which plants would be 
affected 
trinova formerly known as libbeyowens ford co operates 
aeroquip corp and vickers inc which supply power and motion 
control systems components and plastic products to the aerosapce 
and transportation industries 
the layoffs will affect technical and administrative employees 
the company has 20000 employees worldwide including 230 at its 
maumee world headquarters 
i am confident that these actions will improve the performance 
of trinovas companies aeroquip and vickers and accelerate our 
earnings growth said darryl allen trinovas president and chief 
executive officer 
last october the company announced it merged two subsidiaries 
because they shared a variety of customers 
the summer slowdown in automotive production seriously 
affected our automotive plastics operations allen said lower 
us defense sales and inefficiencies in the aeroquip operations 
also contributed to weaker results in power and motion control 
some anaylsts said they were surprised by the size of trinovas 
restructring but that it would benefit the company in the long run 
james mccann an analyst with drexel burnham said the move will 
help the company become more competitive in the face of increasing 
foreign competition 
it doesnt mean it wont be painful in the short term for the 
people who are involved but the us industry is becoming more 
competitive and trinova has taken the bull by the horns mccann 
said 
the restructuring resulted in a charge of 385 million after 
taxes against trinovas 1989 thirdquarter earnings producing a 
loss of 297 million or 87 cents a share 
trinova earned 194 million during the 1988 third quarter or 
57 cents a share 
sales in the third quarter increased 8 percent to 4562 
million up from 1988 thirdquarter sales of 422 million 
sales for the first nine months increased 116 percent to 144 
billion compared with sales in the first nine months of 1988 of 
129 billion 
earnings through the first nine months of the year were 131 
million or 38 cents a share after deducting the restructuring 
provision in the same period in 1988 the company earned 616 
million or 179 a share

amr corp reported wednesday its 
thirdquarter earnings fell nearly 9 percent and chairman robert 
l crandall said the fourthquarter outlook for the parent of 
american airlines was unhappy 
crandall attributed the poor showing which had been expected 
to higher fuel costs and lower revenue per passenger mile 
the announcement came two days after billionaire donald trump 
withdrew his 7 billion buyout proposal for amr as the companys 
stock fell in the overall wall street plunge 
amr said it earned 137 million or 216 per share in the 
threemonth ended sept 30 compared to 1503 million or 250 
per share in the same period last year 
revenue increased to 273 billion from 233 billion in the 
same period last year 
for the nine months amrs earnings were 4159 million or 
659 per share an increase over 1988s 3601 million or 599 
per share revenue in the ninemonth period rose to 789 billion 
from 646 billion 
crandall said in a statement that revenue per passenger mile was 
down slightly during the quarter and fuel prices were up more than 
11 percent from the third quarter of 1988 the two factors took a 
toll on amrs results 
unfortunately we think these trends will continue and will 
produce a very disappointing fourth quarter as well crandall 
said this unhappy outlook underscores the continuing 
volatility of airline earnings and the importance of an adequate 
capital base 
amr never responded directly to trumps proposal beyond saying 
the company was opposed to highly leveraged deals and preferred to 
remain independent 
analysts have suggested trump was unable to get financing to 
back his bid because of growing uncertainties over the future of 
airline performance 
crandall told analysts last month profits through next year 
would be squeezed by competition from a recovering eastern 
airlines higher labor costs expansion of service and purchase of 
new aircraft

consumers recovering from serious debt problems 
dont have to wait years or pay through the nose before 
reentering the world of plastic 
american national bank of new york announced wednesday it can 
provide many of those with tainted credit histories with a new visa 
credit card carrying an annual 125 percent interest rate around 
six percentage points below the national average 
but theres a catch applicants must put a minimum 500 into a 
oneyear certificate of deposit at the bank to be used as 
collateral and enroll in a counseling program with a nonprofit 
credit counseling service the largest such organization is the 
marylandbased national foundation for consumer credit which 
oversees a network of 400 counseling offices nationwide 
one of the biggest of those offices the budget amp credit 
counseling services inc of new york which counsels about 10000 
families and individuals a year helped arrange for the american 
national visa card 
america operates on credit which means that even people with 
past credit problems need a credit card to function effectively 
explained luther r gatling president of the new york credit 
counseling service 
to be without credit undermines an individuals selfesteem 
it makes normal activities like business travel impractical and 
general consumerism in this country impossible 
the new credit card is secured by the cd the line of credit is 
limited to the amount of the deposit minus 250 for desposits 
between 500 and 2500 or 90 percent of a deposit between 2501 
and 10000

a house committee voted wednesday to give the 
transportation department authority to block major airline 
takeovers after backers of the bill said travelers want assurances 
a purchasers heavy debt would not jeopardize safety 
under the legislation the transportation department would be 
obligated to block the purchase of 15 percent of an airlines 
voting stock if the deal would jeopardize safety lead to a breakup 
of the company hinder its ability to compete or leave the carrier 
in the hands of a foreign interest 
this bill does not prevent airline takeovers or significantly 
interfere with an owners property rights it merely gives dot the 
opportunity to review those transactions that might harm the public 
interest said rep john paul hammerschmidt rark 
air travelers expect assurances that the heavy debt load 
incurred during an acquisition will not lead to a deterioration of 
safety hammerschmidt told the house public works and 
transportation committee before it approved the bill by a vote of 
235 
opponents claimed the bill could be the first step toward

quantity of us soybean oil

copper futures prices slipped wednesday to their lowest point 
this month on new yorks commodity exchange and some experts said 
the markets 4monthold rally may be weakening 
on other commodity markets precious metals advanced energy 
futures retreated grains and soybeans were mixed livestock and 
meat futures were mixed and stockindex futures rose 
copper futures settled 40 cent to 285 cents lower with the 
contract for december delivery at 12645 a pound its lowest close 
since sept 29 
some technical analysts interpreted the break below 127 as an 
indicator of further losses to come while fundamental analysts 
cited significant changes in supplyanddemand factors 
chief among them was a report that the mexican government was 
nearing agreements with labor on terms for reopening the cananea 
copper mining and processing center which closed aug 21 due to 
alleged financial mismanagment 
the mine is capable of producing 160000 tons of copper 
annually about 3 percent of the worlds total copper output 
people were expecting it to open in midnovember but now it 
looks like it may open before then said fred demler metals 
economist with drexel burnham lambert inc in new york 
the news came in the aftermath of labor leaders acceptance in 
canada of a contract that could lead to the reopening of the 
highland valley copper mine near logan lake bc if the agreement 
is ratified by the rankandfile 
a reopening of the 180000tonsperyear highland valley mine 
which was shut down by a strike on july 6 would leave the 
bouganville mine in papua new guinea as the only major copper mine 
still out of commission 
meanwhile a government report of a 52 percent drop in us 
housing starts last month provided new evidence of economic 
weakness and prompted speculation that demand for copper may soften

mickey levy chief economist for first fidelity bancorporation of

attention to gyrations in the stock market and focus more on 
prospects for the economy

trading and the prospect of new borrowing by the federal government

the vigorous economy of the san francisco bay 
area should be little affected by the earthquake in the long run a 
top state official said wednesday 
we have a large strong economy and while the personal 
tragedy for many families is great the overall economic picture 
for the bay area and the rest of the state is unclouded by this 
said john sullivan the undersecretary of the state department of 
business transportation and housing 
sullivan who stayed up all night assessing the situation said 
it was still too early to set a damage figure for the earthquakes 
devastation but he said overall the impact will be one the 
state will recover from very quickly 
insurers said the quake might have caused more than 1 billion 
in damages in northern california just three weeks after hurricane 
hugo resulted in an estimated 4 billion in damages in south 
carolina however only a fraction of the damages are covered by 
insurance 
sullivan said he was optimistic about the insurance business 
we dont have huge areas of just massive devastation block 
after block fortunately sullivan said 
while damage appeared extremely heavy in such cities as santa 
cruz and watsonville farmers insurance group inc spokesman 
jeffrey beyer said he tended to agree with sullivan that most 
insurers would have no major problems 
in a sign of investors confidence in the state california 
municipal bond issues were down wednesday but only slightly and in 
line with the overall decline in the market said mark haslinger a 
senior vice president with clayton brown amp associates in new york 
traders at the pacific stock exchanges main floor in san 
francisco worked by candlelight and flashlight taking orders that 
were then executed in los angeles at the exchanges other trading 
floor 
volume was very very low said exchange spokesman navin 
vyas 
security pacific bank spokesman richard warner said his bank had 
contacted the states top 10 banks about setting up a coalition to 
provide disaster recovery loans

most san franciscoarea homeowners may 
have to pay for damage from tuesdays earthquake out of their own 
pockets while insurance companies may reap longterm benefits from 
higher rates industry spokesmen and analysts said wednesday 
only 15 percent to 20 percent of california homeowners have 
earthquake insurance which typically requires a 10 percent 
deductible and costs between 200 to 400 a year for a 100000 
home according to industry spokesmen 
the association of california insurance cos in sacramento said 
that in the san francisco area roughly 25 to 30 percent of the 
homes have earthquake insurance the organization estimated 
residential damages from tuesdays earthquake at 500 million in 
the bay area with between 100 million to 150 million insured 
insured homeowners without earthquake protection will get 
reimbursed only if their homes were ravaged by fire which is 
covered under basic homeowner insurance polices said hugh strawn 
director of catastrophe services at the property loss research 
bureau in schaumburg ill 
insurance companies attempted wednesday to assess the amount of 
quakerelated damages theyre likely to have to pay in addition to 
home damage the companies likely will get claims for automobile 
damage broken glass theft and burglary business interruption due 
to electrical outages water damage and possibly workers 
compensation 
some estimated that insurers might face bills totaling 1 
billion or more from the quake but industry observers said they 
dont expect any company to suffer serious financial damage from 
quakerelated claims 
we dont think any company is going to have problems paying 
claims said elisa siegal public affairs manager for the 
american insurance association a washingtonbased trade group 
the insurers actually could benefit industry analysts predicted 
insurers would be able to reverse three years of declining rates 
and win rate hikes from state regulators due to the quake damages 
and the estimated 4 billion in damages from hurricane hugo which 
hammered south carolina and other parts of the southeastern united 
states earlier this month 
an increase in insurance rates could translate into greater 
profitability in the long term the analysts said 
theres a perception that this could turn the cycle that 
this could be enough to firm pricing said gloria l vogel an 
analyst with bear stearns amp co inc in new york 
despite their predictions for the long run the analysts warned 
that fourthquarter earnings among insurance companies are likely 
to be disappointing 
its going to be a meaningful loss perhaps as big as hugo 
said robert glasspiegel an analyst with hartfordbased langen 
mcalenney 
on the new york stock exchange some insurance company stock 
rose on wednesday aetna life amp casualty co rose 237 to 5950 
a share itt corp parent of the hartford was up 37 cents to 
59 and the travelers cos rose 1 to 4087 
reinsurance companies which absorb risk from policy writers 
did especially well general re corp rose 275 to 8650 and 
marsh amp mclennan cos rose 312 to 7587 
in california earthquake insurance is an emotional and 
politicallycharged issue roughly twothirds of all insurance 
policies written in the united states are sold in california where 
many of the nations most damaging earthquakes have occurred 
under a 1985 california law insurers are required to offer 
earthquake insurance to homebuyers but homebuyers are not required 
to buy the coverage 
insurers arent required to offer earthquake insurance to 
commercial property owners but the percentage of business property 
with the coverage is very high industry spokesmen said they 
estimated that at least 25 percent and probably many more 
business properties are insured 
because of its high costs earthquake insurance has become a 
target of the controversial proposition 103 approved by california 
voters last year the proposition calls for a 20 percent rollback 
in insurance rates insurers and state regulators are battling over 
the rates and how theyre set

fine and withdraw from membership in the chicago mercantile 
exchange to settle charges of improper recordkeeping and violating 
margin requirements exchange officials said wednesday 
the company capcom futures inc withdrew from membership in 
the chicago board of trade last summer and a londonbased

to those alleged by the merc 
the merc said capcom had neither admitted nor denied violating 
exchange rules

customers had been hurt by its actions and that the alleged 
offenses were technical in nature and essentially involved 
recordkeeping matters

margin requirements capcom accepted trades from a customer while 
that customer had a debit balance in another trading account 
on april 27 1987 the merc alleged capcom transferred nine 
positions into a customer account from other unaffiliated 
customers accounts a violation of exchange rules 
the merc also alleged that from april 1987 through october 1988

capcom and individuals and an entity directly or indirectly 
controlled by shareholders of capcom

exchange membership may reapply for membership at any time 
withdrawal from exchange membership means a firm has voluntarily 
left the exchange while expulsion means the firm has been ordered 
out by the exchange said board of trade spokesman michael

general aviation experienced its best quarter since cessna 
aircraft became part of general dynamics four years ago said 
stanley pace chairman and chief executive officer

215 million compared with 124 million for the same period a 
year ago
