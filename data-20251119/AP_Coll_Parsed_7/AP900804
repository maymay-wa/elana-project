the house passed landmark civil rights 
legislation despite president bushs veto threat friday as congress 
juggled a host of bills in the race toward summer recess 
attempting to meet a selfimposed deadline of finishing business 
by weeks end the house pushed the civil rights act of 1990 closer 
to final passage approving the measure by a 272154 vote 
stand up for what you know is right stand up for americas 
values house majority leader richard gephardt dmo told his 
colleagues shortly before the vote the bill now goes to a 
housesenate conference committee where prospects for compromise 
seemed bright the senate approved its own version two weeks ago 
the bill would overturn the effects of five supreme court 
decisions in recent years which reined in affirmative action 
programs 
bush argued that the measure would go too far and would led to 
hiring quotas but he also promised to sign what he called a 
sound practical compromise 
across the capitol the senate labored over a 289 billion 
defense authorization bill the debate was laced with repeated 
references to iraqs occupation of kuwait as staunchly prodefense 
senators argued against steep pentagon cuts 
senators agreed to vote saturday on five amendments dealing with 
star wars 
late friday the house passed a highly contentious bill 
overhauling the campaign finance laws but only after democratic 
leaders eased spending limits in the bill under pressure from 
members concerned about their chances for reelection 
the partisan 255155 vote came after the spending ceiling in the 
bill was raised from 550000 to 715000 and members rejected a 
republican alternative that would have banned leadership pacs 
political action committees run by powerful congressional figures 
to give funds to other members 
the senate by a largely partyline 5940 vote wednesday night 
approved a democratic bill that would limit senate candidates 
campaign spending at 2 million to 10 million depending on their 
states population 
work on those and other bills has kept the both chambers in 
marathon sessions deep into the summer nights 
bush argued in a letter to house republican leader bob michel of 
illinois that the civil rights bill fashioned by the house and 
senate would have the effect of forcing businesses to adopt 
quotas in hiring and promotion 
it will also foster divisiveness and litigation rather than 
conciliation and do more to promote legal fees than civil rights 
bush said 
nevertheless democrats voted 24012 for the bill thirtytwo 
republicans joined the democratic majority bush while 142 supported 
bushs position on the roll call for passage the bill fell 12 
votes short of what would be needed to override a presidential veto 
major provisions range from a ban on racial harassment in the 
workplace to barriers against reopening courtapproved fairhiring 
agreements 
the major clashes however came over provisions making it 
easier to use statistics to win discrimination suits against 
employers and for punitive damages for women and other 
discrimination victims 
the democraticcontrolled house rejected 238188 the bushbacked 
alternative civil rights forces said that version would dilute 
protections against discrimination 
it would rip the heart out of it said rep jack brooks 
dtexas 
lawmakers said there was fierce lastminute lobbying on the 
alternative championed by rep john lafalce dny the 
pressures have been enormous the intimidation has belied the 
vision and hope of civil rights but in the end it is my face in 
that mirror said rep nancy johnson rconn 
the lafalce alternative would have tempered language designed to 
make it easier to win job bias suits against employers based on 
statistics 
it also would have capped at 100000 punitive damages for 
intentional discrimination that courts could award to women 
religious minorities and the disabled the bill limits those 
damages to 150000 or the amount of compensatory damages 
whichever is higher 
in its deliberations on the defense authorization bill for the 
new fiscal year beginning oct 1 the senate turned back an attempt 
to cut nearly four times as many us troops in europe as bush had 
proposed 
despite the argument that the cold war has ended and the united 
states faces severe fiscal problems the senate rejected an 
amendment to cut 130000 troops including 80000 in europe the 
vote was 5940 
in proposing a 307 billion defense bill for the fiscal year 
beginning oct 1 bush called for a troop reduction of about 
40000 the senate armed services committee adopted a 289 billion 
military budget last month that would cut overall troop strength by 
100000

the nations unemployment rate shot up to 55 
percent last month its highest level in two years the government 
said friday in a report that renewed fears that the economy may be 
toppling into a recession 
the economy appears to be caving in to a fullfledged 
recession the jump in the unemployment rate is the telling sign 
said allen sinai chief economist at the boston co 
on wall street the stock market sold off sharply amid the new 
recession fears and middle east oil concerns the dow jones average 
of 30 industrials down more than 120 points at its midsession low 
closed with a 5495point loss at 280965 
the labor departments unemployment report showed widespread 
weakness in the job market as payrolls fell by 219000 jobs 
that number was bloated by the 160000 temporary census workers 
the government laid off but other sectors of the economy posted 
job losses too construction and manufacturing continued their 
slide and even the nations service sector which had been carrying 
the economy suffered in july 
its one more nail in the coffin of the economic boom when 
you have 219000 people out there without jobs even if many of 
them were census workers youve got a lot of people without buying 
power its pretty clear evidence the economy is in big trouble 
said irwin kellner chief economist of manufacturers hanover trust 
the bush administration interpreted the numbers differently 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said the report does reinforce our 
concern for getting the deficit under control but said the 
economy is still growing we dont see a recession he said 
but richard rahn chief economist for the us chamber of 
commerce said the us economy is not going to hang on much 
longer it is headed directly into a recession 
analysts were also alarmed about how americas already 
struggling economy might react to oil price shock from iraqs 
invasion of kuwait 
were close to the edge it wouldnt take much of a breeze to 
push us over whats going on in the middle east may be the 
breeze to do it said robert dederick chief economist at the 
northern trust co of chicago 
fridays statistics were the latest in a string of lackluster 
government reports on economic activity that showed 
the us economy grew by just 12 percent in the second quarter 
of 1990 a rate far below the pace analysts believe is needed to 
generate new jobs 
orders to factories for manufactured goods fell in june for the 
third time this year a 15 percent decline which was likely to 
trigger further production cutbacks and layoffs in us industry 
construction spending was unchanged in june after falling for 
two consecutive months 
the governments index of leading economic indicators which 
has been flashing weak signals for most of the year showed no 
strength at all in june the index is designed to forecast economic 
activity six to nine months in advance 
last months 03 percentage point rise in the civilian jobless 
rate which was up from the june rate of 52 percent put the 
american unemployment rate at its highest level since it hit 56 
percent in august 1988 the labor department said 
analysts had been expecting the jobless rate to jump eventually 
to reflect the nations slow economic growth so far this year 
americas private industries have been producing an average of just 
96000 new jobs a month far below the 177000 generated monthly in 
1989 the labor department said 
janet norwood commissioner of the bureau of labor statistics 
blamed julys weak jobs report on the deterioration of the service 
sector that had been the major engine of job growth during the 
current economic expansion but that engine seems to have sputtered 
in july 
the service sector suffered a 160000jobs decline last month 
that number included temporary census workers as well as jobs in 
wholesale trade and business services retail trade added 20000 
jobs the government said 
construction payrolls fell by 50000 jobs after seasonal 
adjustment the fifth consecutive decline and a reflection of 
continued weakness in the housing market construction jobs are 
more than 100000 below the level of last fall the government said 
the nations manufacturing slump also continued in july as 
factory payrolls fell by 7000 jobs it was the 15th time in 16 
months that manufacturing jobs declined since reaching a 
postrecession peak in march 1989 nearly 350000 factory jobs have 
been lost 
health services which had added an average of 50000 jobs each 
month in the first half of this year expanded by only half that 
amount in july adding 25000 new jobs 
labor costs continued to increase average hourly earnings 
posted a 06 percent rise in july to 1009 up from the 1003 the 
average worker earned per hour in june 
overall total civilian employment was about 118 million in 
july down from the 1184 million employed in june the jobless 
numbered 68 million up from 64 million unemployed in june 
last months big jump in unemployment was a major departure from 
the steady nature of the jobless rate over the past two years 
before july the jobless rate had fluctuated within a tenth of a 
percentage point of 53 percent since september 1988 the only 
exception was march of last year when it hit a 15year low of 5 
percent

the internal revenue service will go to 
almost any lengths to retrieve back taxes in a case against an 
iranian immigrant federal officials are considering following the 
man into the grave 
the us attorneys office says it might ask to exhume the body 
of ehsanolla motaghed just to make sure hes dead motaghed 
apparently died june 9 without paying 156000 in back taxes 
theyre just mad because he had the audacity to die without 
settling his account said james martin davis the attorney for 
motagheds estate 
motaghed 66 who ran an optical lens importing business was 
indicted april 25 for allegedly offering a 4000 cash bribe to an 
irs agent he pleaded innocent and was free on bail 
according to both davis and local death records motaghed died 
june 9 in his omaha apartment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or 
lou gehrigs disease he was buried june 12 
the us attorneys office has said it is considering seeking a 
douglas county court order to have the body exhumed assistant us 
attorney bob kokrda has refused to say why officials suspect 
motaghed isnt dead 
this is about as grotesque a thing as ive ever dealt with 
said davis who has asked the court to dismiss the charges 
its an identification problem kokrda said in an interview 
tuesday it was four days after he was put in the ground that we 
read in the paper that he died were just trying to satisfy 
ourselves that the man died 
kokrda said his office hasnt decided whether to ask for 
exhumation if we can do it make an identification any other 
way we will he said 
the irs on monday filed liens against motagheds estate 
claiming he owes 156000 in back taxes the filing was the result 
of a review of motagheds 1985 through 1987 tax returns said omaha 
irs spokesman ed daemon 
motagheds daughter afsaneh mcgahey of san diego said she was 
questioned two weeks ago by irs officials about her fathers death 
i was horrified said mrs mcgahey who is a lawyer i 
dont know why they are doing this 
mrs mcgahey said shes satisfied the man in the grave at 
omahas evergreen memorial park cemetery is her father 
the death certificate on file with the county identifies the 
body as that of motaghed said douglas county attorney ron 
staskiewicz the certificate lists amyotrophic lateral sclerosis as 
the cause of death 
motaghed came to the united states 12 years ago after being 
expelled from iran by the government of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
the indictment alleged that during a tax investigation motaghed 
offered a bribe to an irs agent 
he was told he owed the irs money and the agent said he had 
to pay and so he gave the agent 4000 davis said 
the inspectioninternal security division which investigates 
alleged bribery of irs agents doesnt buy that version 
do you think the us attorneys office would take the case if 
it was like that said marti hosimer a spokeswoman in the 
divisions chicago office 
when motaghed was arraigned kokrda said his assets were between 
750000 and 1 million davis said motaghed invested his money in 
us treasury bills and lived off the income davis said it would 
have been difficult to hide that money from the irs 
motaghed posted his 110000 bail in treasury bills 
davis said nebraska law stipulates that the only legal reason 
for exhuming a body is for dissection to determine a cause of death 
they would have to dig him up for the purpose of dissection 
davis said ive heard the irs does that to people while theyre 
still alive but not when theyre dead

after years of collecting the remnants of 
yiddish literature which was virtually wiped out by the holocaust 
aaron lansky is taking the culture back to its roots 
lansky founder of the national yiddish book center recently 
returned from a mission of remembrance taking yiddish books to 
jews in the baltic republics of the soviet union 
these are jews that have been cut off from their own past 
lansky said friday unless they can connect now i think theyll 
simply lose it 
lansky and his associates packed up 6000 volumes in a rented 
van and drove for 12 days through the baltic states handing out 
copies of a written tradition that has nearly vanished in two 
generations 
he recalled in particular a trip to a town in lithuania that had 
been predominantly jewish before world war ii 
there was just no trace of jewish life at all lansky said 
had we been in that town 49 years before most of the people on 
the street would have been speaking yiddish to us here was a town 
that was virtually unchanged yet the jews had vanished 
lansky 35 began rescuing yiddish 10 years ago when he 
founded the national yiddish book center in western massachusetts 
running newspaper ads for unwanted yiddish books languishing in 
attics and cellars at that time it was estimated that 75000 
books existed written in the language that had been spoken by 
eastern european jews for hundreds of years 
instead about a million books have poured into the nonprofit 
center the largest repository of yiddish works in the nation 
which now has a staff of about two dozen and runs such educational 
programs as the yiddish library development program 
lansky got the idea to take books into the soviet union after 
receiving letters from jews in the baltic states who had heard of 
the center and hoped that the new openness would mean yiddish could 
be resuscitated 
the books were sent to finland and then to estonia where a 
nonjewish group the estonia cultural foundation had agreed to 
accept them lansky an associate and a photographer flew to 
stockholm rented a van and then drove to estonia 
we were there exactly 50 years to the day of the soviet 
occupation of the baltic states so it was an historic time 
lansky said 
many of the books in the van were reprints of works that had 
been originally published in the baltic states during the 100 or so 
years that yiddish literature flourished starting about 1870 
lansky said although many of the jews he spoke to hope to leave 
the soviet union now that immigration has relaxed somewhat they 
still want to keep in touch with their old traditions 
their grandparents were yiddishspeaking jews theyre not 
russians theyre not latvians it says right in the passport that 
theyre a jew but they havent the slightest idea what that 
means he said

president saddam hussein to his own 
apparent pleasure is known throughout iraq and the arab world by 
his first name which means one who confronts 
with his latest exploit facing worldwide condemnation and 
sanctions after invading kuwait and ousting its royal family he 
seems to be living up to his name 
even little children in iraq know their leader by his first 
name schoolgirls sing a little jingle saddam saddam we will 
give our blood for you 
headlines in iraqi and other arab papers use saddam to refer to 
the iraqi leader stories might say president saddam hussein 
but though hussein was the first name of his father who died 
before saddam was born he is never referred to in the press as 
president hussein he is called saddam 
saddam was born in the closeknit town of takrit north of 
baghdad and like many other residents bore the surname altakriti 
later he abolished regional surnames 
a wide interpretation of the law was that saddam wanted to 
obscure the number of members of his inner circle who were 
relatives from takrit

the next president of colombia is a 
softspoken economist who was catapulted to his nations highest 
office less through charisma than by violent events 
cesar gaviria of the liberal party the former campaign manager 
for a candidate who was killed by drug traffickers will become 
colombias next leader on tuesday 
he is a small man with a thin voice and a childlike face but as 
a congressman and cabinet minister he gained a reputation for 
being a tough negotiator and political manipulator 
hes a 21stcentury type smart practical and pragmatic 
said jorge orlando melo director of bogotas institute of 
political studies 
one year ago gaviria was campaign manager for sen luis carlos 
galan an antidrug crusader who was slain at a rally by drug 
traffickers 
galans death signified the start of a bloody war against drug 
lords it also marked the political rise of gaviria who vowed to 
carry on galans crusade against drug criminals who were 
endangering colombian democracy 
in many ways colombians were voting for a dead man when they 
chose gaviria said political scientist camilo castellanos 
colombians devastated by a seemingly endless nightmare of 
bombings and murders now look to gaviria to defend their countrys 
dignity 
he takes office at a time when drug lords have declared a 
ceasefire several leftist guerrilla groups are talking peace with 
the government and political leaders have agreed to call a national 
assembly to reform colombias 104yearold constitution 
but the atmosphere of hope is muted by the continued violence 
assassinations of political leaders judges and policemen 
continue guerrillas still fight the army in the countryside 
earlier this week police said they thwarted a plan by 
terrorists to disrupt next weeks inaugural ceremonies security 
forces found three uzi machine guns that they said were to be used 
to carry out terrorist attacks during the inauguration 
officials say tough security measures will protect the five 
heads of state and 81 foreign delegations visiting colombia for the 
inauguration 
but recent terrorist attacks underscore the fact that no one is 
truly safe in colombia as long as so many violent elements run free 
gaviria has promised to continue the tough stance against drug 
traffickers taken by the current administration of president 
virgilio barco 
observers say that one of barcos greatest achievements as 
president was getting the world to admit that the drug war was not 
just colombias problem 
during barcos tenure colombia went from being the criminal 
to the victim in the worlds eyes melo said 
but if barcos biggest feat was getting the world to admit the 
problem gavirias biggest challenge is getting it to act 
critics charge that barcos diplomatic successes were not 
supported by enough foreign aid to help colombia fight the drug war 
last year the united states sent 65 million in logistical aid 
such as helicopters and bulletproof vests 
however the economic assistance colombia had hoped for such as 
preferential treatment for its exports never materialized 
compared to barco gaviria is going to insist much more on the 
economic part getting commercial aid international credits 
etc melo said 
some observers say gaviria represents a new breed of colombian 
political leaders who shun the closed oldboy network of the past 
he has promised to open up the political system to 
underrepresented groups 
but not everyone agrees gaviria represents a change 
in order for anyone to get to where gaviria is youd have to 
play by the rules and those rules arent available to everyone

here is the text of the joint ussoviet 
statement on the iraqi invasion of kuwait as read by secretary of 
state james a baker iii at a new conference in moscow 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the soviet union and the united states as members of the un 
security council consider it important that the council promptly 
and decisively condemned the brutal and illegal invasion of kuwait 
by iraqi military forces 
the united states and the soviet union believe that now it is 
essential that the council resolution be fully and immediately 
implemented by its action iraq has shown its contempt for the 
most fundamental principles for the united nations charter and 
international law 
in response to this blatant transgression of the basic norms of 
civilized conduct the united states and the soviet union have each 
taken a number of actions including the soviet suspension of arms 
deliveries and the american freezing of assets 
the soviet union and the united states reiterate our call for 
unconditional iraqi withdrawal from kuwait the sovereignty 
national independence legitimate authorities and territorial 
integrity of the state of kuwait must be completely restored and 
safeguarded 
the united states and the soviet union believe the international 
community must not only condemn this action but also take 
practical steps in response to it 
we take the unusual step of jointly calling upon the rest of the 
international community to join with us in an international cutoff 
of all arms supplies to iraq the soviet union and the united 
states call on regional organizations especially the league of 
arab states all arab governments as well as the nonaligned 
movement and the islamic conference to take all possible steps to 
ensure that the united nations security council resolution is 
carried out 
governments that engage in blatent aggression must know that the 
international community cannot and will not acquiesce in nor 
facilitate aggression

us air force jets have screamed low over western 
canyonlands for years practicing bombing runs for a potential war 
against the soviet union in the volatile middle east 
now the persian gulf is aflame with gunfire but the 
superpowers are on the same side trying to halt the violence from 
day one 
fridays historic joint statement condemning iraq made in 
moscow by us secretary of state james a baker iii and soviet 
foreign minister eduard shevardnadze is the first time the 
superpowers coordinated specific sanctions to stop a war 
they condemned the brutal and illegal invasion of kuwait by 
iraqi military forces and agreed to seek a worldwide cutoff of 
arms shipments to the aggressor they asked the entire 
international community to join in taking all possible steps to 
restore kuwaits independence 
these steps that we have outlined are a lot more than simply 
rhetoric these are specific and concrete actions baker told a 
news conference 
the soviet union iraqs largest weapons supplier had already 
announced it was suspending arms shipments because of the invasion 
the united states which sells no military equipment to iraq froze 
iraqs bank accounts and banned imports of its oil 
the superpowers have cooperated in the past in the united 
nations on such fruitless endeavors as seeking peace for lebanon 
but fridays action is the first time they have tried to strangle a 
war by cutting off the aggressors resources 
it was a stark example of the radical change in soviet foreign 
policy over five years of mikhail s gorbachevs rule he has been 
saying for years that conflicts must be decided peacefully but the 
arms embargo backed words with action at the cost of angering a 
longtime ally 
fridays meeting also brought dramatic evidence that the cold 
war is truly over this time there is no fear that someone elses 
temper would turn an icy superpower confrontation into a 
conflagration that could destroy the earth 
iraqi soldiers overran kuwait and on friday gathered on the 
border with saudi arabia in spite of a clear warning that the 
united states may enter the war if saudi arabia is attacked 
for years the united states feared that a threat to saudi arabia 
would lead directly to a war between the superpowers but 
shevardnadze made it clear the soviet union has no intention of 
sending its own troops to the persian gulf 
there are no such plans he said 
shevardnadze also said he still believes iraq will have the 
political wisdom to end its occupation of kuwait 
he said one day after the soviet union cut off arms to iraq 
that baghdad had assured soviet diplomats its troops would begin 
withdrawing soon 
shevardnadze also warned of very very severe consequences 
if any of the thousands of soviet citizens in kuwait and iraq are 
hurt 
shortly after shevardnadzes announcement baghdad radio said 
iraqi troops would begin leaving sunday because the provisional 
government set up during the invasion could stand on its own 
western diplomats called the new kuwaiti government a puppet regime 
under the control of iraqi leader saddam hussein 
shevardnadze admitted that when he and baker meeting in 
irkutsk on wednesday first discussed the iraqi troops massing on 
the kuwaiti border i did not expect the iraqis would resort to 
such an overt invasion an undistinguished aggression against a 
defenseless peaceloving country which did not and does not 
threaten anyone 
shevardnadze said that if iraq does not withdraw the 
superpowers would continue to work together to that end and the 
soviet union would consider further steps of its own beyond the 
arms embargo 
president bush said the united states might blockade iraqs 
oilshipping routes 
richard grimmett of the us congressional research service said 
a worldwide arms cutoff would have no immediate effect on iraq 
because it has imported 43 billion worth of weapons in the past 
eight years 
but if the soviets the french the germans and the british all 
refused to sell arms to iraq and kept up the embargo for four or 
five years there is nobody out there who could take their place 
except possibly china that would eventually force saddam to stop 
his military aggression grimmett said 
bush hailed the transformation in americansoviet relations that 
allowed fridays events 
all the issues are on the table we dont dodge the tough 
ones and thats been the secret to our success so far bush told 
reporters in aspen colo on thursday 
a commentator for the novosti news agency vladimir alexeyev 
said friday that the sudden danger of war in the persian gulf just 
as european tensions are disappearing shows world peace is like a 
patchwork quilt as soon as a tear is mended in one place 
another appears somewhere else he wrote 
under these circumstances what is need are concentrated 
efforts on the part of all nations on all continents to work out 
a codex of international behavior that would effectively preclude 
the possibility of new local wars and local armed conflicts which 
pose a threat to peace and have the potential of turning into major 
conflagrations 
alexeyev said the bakershevardnadze meeting marked a new phase 
in superpower relations where egocentric ambitions are being set 
aside and the two nations are beginning to work together for the 
benefit of all mankind

iraq said friday it will begin withdrawing 
troops from kuwait in two days but the us state department said 
some iraqi soliders had pushed their advance to within a few miles 
of the saudi border 
an iraqi government spokesman said all troops in kuwait will be 
withdrawn according to a timetable beginning sunday according to 
an official radio broadcast no time was specified for complete 
withdrawal 
the government spokesman said the iraqi troops might stay longer 
if something cropped up that threatens kuwait and iraq 
iraq said it invaded kuwait on thursday to provide security for 
a provisional government that had overthrown kuwaits rulers the 
international community dismissed that claim 
in washington president bush warned iraq not to threaten us 
vital interests or try to add oilrich saudi arabia to its 
conquest of kuwait he said the united states was willing to help 
in any way we possibly can to stop iraqi aggression bush has 
refused to rule out the use of military force 
a nato source said the united states had contingency plans 
in case iraqs president saddam hussein advanced his forces 
further through the strategic region 
in related developments 
the soviet union and united states issued a rare joint 
statement demanding that all countries stop arms supplies to iraq 
and that iraq pull out of kuwait immediately the soviet union 
iraqs main weapons supplier cut off shipments thursday italy 
poland and france have also cut arms deliveries to iraq 
the united states and france have frozen iraqi assets while 
both countries and britain also blocked kuwaiti assets 
the united states proposed that the un security council adopt 
sweeping military trade and economic sanctions against iraq for 
its invasion of kuwait 
japan said friday it would go along with any economic sanctions 
against iraq that the united nations might vote to impose 
egypt broke the silence among major arab nations and harshly 
condemned the invasion the arab league meeting in cairo also 
denounced the invasion and called for iraq to withdraw immediately 
the gulf cooperation council which includes saudi arabia 
similarly criticized the iraqi attack in a statement issued in 
cairo 
jordans king hussein met with saddam in baghdad then 
announced that arab leaders would gather for a summit sunday to 
discuss the crisis he also urged the united states not to 
intervene militarily 
saudi sources said there was a good chance saddam would meet 
with the ousted kuwaiti ruler sheik jaber alahmed alsabah at 
the summit 
izzat ibrahim of the iraqi revolutionary command council met in 
jiddah saudi arabia with king fahd of saudi arabia he made no 
statement 
us officials sought information on 14 americans mostly oil 
workers missing in kuwait who apparently were seized by iraqi 
forces there are about 3000 americans in kuwait 
driven by fears of a production drop oil prices continued to 
climb north sea brent blend the most widely traded international 
crude rose 2 a barrel thursday and 86 cents more on friday to 
close at 2325 
last month oil prices were as low as 16 a barrel 
iraqs invasion followed two weeks of threats and accusations 
against its small persian gulf neighbor on july 17 saddam accused 
it of stealing oil from a field that includes land both sides 
claim he also blamed kuwait for a fall in oil prices saying it 
contributed to the oil glut by cheating on its opec production 
quotas 
iraq quickly overran kuwait on thursday and announced that it 
would begin leaving when the situation stabilized 
in amman jordan a senior iraqi diplomat said friday we 
believe that the national government in kuwait can take over all 
the responsibilities now and they are capable of defending their 
national security 
not a single member of the provisional government has been named 
publicly the iraqi government was unable to find leading kuwaitis 
willing to cooperate with it in joining a government said gulf 
sources outside iraq 
an iraqi radio broadcast which was also carried by a station 
calling itself the provisional government of kuwait radio said the 
alsabah royal family that ruled kuwait for almost 250 years will 
never return to power 
the bygone regime is finished forever and will never come 
back the spokesman said 
in his statement the iraqi government spokesman said that if 
anyone took action against iraqi forces iraq would chop off his 
arm from the shoulder 
the statement also indicated the decision to withdraw was not 
made to satisfy international demands 
we refuse to respond to empty chatter here and there by 
malicious people to whom we give no weight the statement said 
baghdad radio also carried a government statement denying 
reports it was massing troops inside kuwait along the saudi border 
but state department spokesman richard boucher said iraqi troops 
were between five and 10 miles from the saudi border british 
foreign secretary douglas hurd said iraqi troops were massing along 
the saudi border 
and residents of the saudi border city of khafji reached by 
telephone from bahrain said iraqi troops early friday evening had 
laid down a checkpoint less than a mile from the border 
one man speaking on condition of anonymity said that earlier 
iraqi troops almost touched the saudi territory but went back 
quite politely when the saudi border patrols instantly alerted 
them 
the opposite saudi checkpoint had registered about 50000 
foreign families fleeing kuwait since the invasion began saudi 
border authorities said 
an american couple living in kuwait who fled to saudi arabia 
after the invasion said they saw armored iraqi personnel carriers 
howitzers missile launchers and tanks heading toward the 
kuwaitsaudi border 
elizabeth thames 36 of glenrock pa said however the 
gathering arsenal stopped well before the frontier 
communication with kuwait gradually died friday with telephone 
and telex lines cut and radio broadcasts extremely fuzzy 
the iraqi army faced pockets of resistance early in the day 
according to residents and diplomats explosions and gunfire were 
reported at the countrys main military barracks in the capital and 
along the coast 15 miles away 
diplomatic sources in saudi arabia said an iraqi missile 
exploded early friday on saudi territory area near the kuwait 
saudi and iraqi borders it was not known if the missile was 
deliberately fired into saudi arabia but saudi security forces 
said in saudi arabia that an iraqi jet had apparently misfired the 
missile 
there were no reports of injuries or damage in the sparsely 
populated area 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters we are 
extremely concerned about the possibility of iraq broadening its 
invasions plans to any other country they are close enough to 
the saudi border to indicate cause for concern but we dont know 
what their intentions or motives are 
saudi arabia has the most oil reserves of any country in the 
world and provides the bulk of us oil imports its troops would 
likely be no match against iraqi forces 
iraq has been engaged in a major defense buildup since saddam 
came to power in 1979 its combined military forces are estimated 
at 1 million the saudis total armed forces number 65700 
oil is iraqs most important revenue source and saddam nearly 
doubled his supply when he sent his army into kuwait early thursday 
and forced the ruling family to flee to saudi arabia 
france said it was sending a second warship to patrol the gulf 
joining eight us navy ships there in addition the uss 
independence backed by six ships was heading toward the region from 
the arabian sea but was said to be several days away

there was no way out 
rumor had it the saudi arabian border and roads leading to it 
were closed the airport runway was laced with cluster bombs 
americans arent used to having no options im no exception 
this northern gulf state was invaded by iraqi troops early thursday 
and my first impulse was to get out 
i heard shelling in the distance ive never heard the sounds of 
war i didnt know how close the invading troops were 
it was the not knowing that frayed the nerves some said it was 
over others said the worst was yet to come 
id never known this kind of fear 
the whole bizarre drama began for me at 6 am thursday an 
american friend phoned telling me the news he said there were 
casualties 
i packed its funny what you think of in times of crisis id 
just bought a new pair of shoes the day before and i wanted to be 
sure and pack them i was leaving nearly all of my worldly 
possessions behind but i had my shoes 
others fled immediately our iranian friends packed the car and 
drove their families to the south fast i didnt even get to say 
goodbye 
a tiny shop in our apartment complex was filled with nervous 
customers 
a woman waiting in the checkout line said im staying put i 
have my birds upstairs i cant abandon my birds 
we took a short drive to see if i could get photographs i saw a 
communications tower that had been bombed 
there were long long lines at gas stations at banks at the 
bakeries 
people were wondering what would happen next i kept asking 
myself if my husband and i still had jobs we worked for the 
kuwaiti government but was there a kuwaiti government 
a friend working at the american embassy said the shelling and 
gunfire were close to her home she had two small children who were 
my 5yearold sons playmates we tried to joke about the situation 
but it wasnt easy 
people in downtown hotels were injured by flying glass 
within hours the rumors really began to fly the british 
embassy was fired on the american embassy overrun 
news reports via satellite told us that the emir fled to saudi 
arabia both of the emirs palaces were under iraqi control iraqi 
troops occupied ministries as well as the staterun radio and 
television stations 
for a few hours in the afternoon we set about organizing a trip 
to saudi arabia and safety but the us embassy told us to stay 
put they said the roads were blocked 
my husband worked in the oil fields three of the oil rigs he 
worked on were under iraqi control there was a rumor that 
americans on the rigs were captured by iraqi troops 
charles cumming a drilling foreman on one of the rigs said he 
saw 10 soviet migs flying low over the rig 
they were pretty loaded up he said i heard this massive 
explosion 
there were rumors of casualties but no one knew how many died 
the shelling got louder or seemed to the panic grew 
we decided to ignore the american embassy and try to get out it 
seemed worth the risk to get away from the fighting and we made it 
my hands are still shaking 
we drove about 60 miles from ahmadi in southern kuwait to the 
saudi border 
for the first 24 miles of our tense trip we saw thousands of 
confident smiling iraqi troops many waved us on our way 
at least 100 tanks were parked not far from an ahmadi 
administration building some young soldiers were making themselves 
at home by looting a small neighborhood store 
as we ventured further south we saw armored personnel carriers 
howitzers missile launchers and tanks they were heading south 
the direction of the kuwaitsaudi border the gathering arsenal 
stopped well before the actual frontier 
anyone with identification documents was waived across the 
border 
within minutes after leaving kuwait we were greeted with hugs 
and tears by other joyous americans and britons we saw about 100 
who had managed to escape 
we traded war stories during the hours it took to get saudi 
visas and clear customs

stephen sondheims a little night music 
cast with actors who sang or stabbed at singing on broadway in 
1973 has entered the repertory of the new york city opera in a 
classy production with singers who act very well 
presented for the first time friday night at the new york state 
theater its probably the best of the hybrids the company has 
attempted the voices all were good but never too operatic 
sally ann howes the second eliza in my fair lady on 
broadway played the actress desiree who gets to sing the shows 
bestknown song send in the clowns she did it with poignant 
musing the way it fits into the plot 
regina resnik from 1944 through 83 at the metropolitan opera 
and since then on broadway in cabaret played her mother 
madame armfeldt she has the best lines to speak and her timing and 
delivery were perfection she did full justice to liaisons her 
reminiscenses of affairs most importantly miss resnik was never 
vulgar 
the production is elaborate and highly effective with many 
scene changes people dressed as maids and butlers swiftly carried 
and slid furniture in and out a mansion front arrived from above 
much of the time blue sky with white clouds on the backdrop was 
reflected on the floor setting mood 
the plot based on ingmar bergmans film smiles of a summer 
night has many facets fredrik egerman george lee andrews has 
a young wife beverly lambert and a son kevin anderson who loves 
the young wife 
his former mistress desiree now is the mistress of count 
malcolm michael maguire whose wife maureen moore makes the 
most of the second best set of lines 
theres a lusty maid susan terry who gets to sing for i will 
marry the millers son and theres desirees daughter looking 
like alice in wonderland and played with winning solemnity by 
danielle ferland 
it was an amusing idea to cast a count not only younger but a 
great deal taller than fredrik egerman 
we enjoyed this a little night music more than its broadway 
presentation because it has so many different couples and 
entanglements and different ages and levels of experience it is 
easily compared with aspects of love now on broadway a 
little night music seems real and wise and aspects of love 
seems more than ever to have been charted on graph paper 
scott ellis directed paul gemignani conducted a large 
orchestra michael anania designed the set with a raked stage at 
the back lindsay w davis designed costlumes and dawn chiang 
designed lighting 
a little night music has been scheduled for five 
performances in august and six in october

secretary of commerce robert mosbacher 
indicated the united states may soon lift the trade embargo against 
vietnam 
he made his remarks friday before us businessmen who urged 
him to renew the trade ties that were cut when the communists won 
the vietnam war in 1975 
mosbacher said lifting of the embargo was still over the 
horizon but depending on the talks it could appear shortly 
in a letter addressed to him the american chamber of commerce 
in thailand said us companies are losing out on the potential 
vietnam offers on many economic fronts 
washington has said a settlement of the cambodian war must be 
reached before relations are normalized with vietnam which backs 
cambodias communist government 
however the united states reversed a longstanding policy last 
month announcing it would enter into direct negotiations with 
vietnam on cambodia

the house early saturday gave final 
congressional approval to legislation making permanent the 
dutyfree status on imports from 24 caribbean and central american 
nations including nicaragua and panama 
by a voice vote the house passed a trade bill extending 
permanently the dutyfree status of 4 billion a year in imports 
under former president reagans 1983 caribbean basin initiative 
but the house refused to expand it to cover imports of textiles 
shoes sugar and ethanol that might threaten us farmers and jobs 
the senate approved the bill earlier this week after lawmakers 
had spent nearly two months hammering out differences between its 
and the houses version the bill now goes to the white house for 
president bushs signature 
in addition to the cbi the bill also makes permanent what had 
been a yeartoyear ban on the export of raw logs from federal land 
and also from state lands in california oregon and alaska exports 
from stateowned land in washington would be reduced but not halted 
the log measure is intended to preserve the pacific northwests 
dwindling timber supply for domestic mills along with enough 
oldgrowth stands to save the northern spotted owl from extinction 
exports of logs from privately owned lands would still be 
allowed but the timber industry generally would be prohibited from 
substituting them for logs from federal lands as a way to escape 
the ban 
the caribbean basin initiative was intended to lift the regions 
depressed economy through a combination of direct aid and an 
elimination of tariffs and other trade barriers to encourage the 
development of exportoriented businesses 
excluded from dutyfree importation however were textiles 
clothing dinnerware luggage shoes and other sensitive goods 
that compete with usmade products import quotas also were kept 
on sugar 
critics say the initiative has failed to large degree because 
the direct governmenttogovernment aid fell victim to us budget 
deficits and drastically reduced imports of oil petroleum products 
and sugar from the region 
in 1983 when the initiative began caribbean and central 
american exports to the united states totaled nearly 88 billion 
by 1988 they had dropped to 6 billion to protect domestic sugar 
growers for example annual import quotas have been reduced from 
32 million tons to 12 million over the past seven years

education secretary lauro f cavazos with the 
academic year approaching is quickening efforts to make sure banks 
continue to grant student loans 
cavazos said friday a deal will be announced within a few weeks 
to cover the defaulted loans guaranteed by the financially troubled 
higher education assistance foundation or heaf of overland park 
kan one of the nations largest insurers of those loans 
we are intensively involved in sensitive discussions with 
other organizations that have an interest in and capacity for 
assuming all of heafs guarantee functions cavazos told the 
senate labor and human resources education subcommittee 
we are committed to putting in place a solution that will 
ensure that new loans are made and insured without interruption 
and that the existing heaf portfolio is properly serviced 
collected insured and reinsured he said 
he told the panel the arrangement would be in place within a 
few weeks 
education department spokeswoman etta fielek said it is unlikely 
heaf will survive the restructuring 
the financially threatened foundation guarantees student loans 
in minnesota west virginia kansas nebraska wyoming and the 
district of columbia and insures loans in other states as well 
heaf one of 47 guarantors nationwide told the education 
department four weeks ago it was having serious financial problems 
because of a high default rate 
the foundation blamed the problem on overlending to students who 
attend private trade and technical schools students from largely 
lowincome backgrounds who either drop out or earn too little after 
graduation to repay the loans 
cavazos who has already tightened regulations on loans for 
students at private trade schools said he will seek further 
restrictions on their accreditation and licensing next year 
he also said regulations will be published next week aimed at 
barring false information from the schools 
under the student loan program banks make the student loans and 
groups such as heaf guarantee that they will be repaid and take 
over collection the federal student loan marketing association 
known as sallie mae provides money to lenders by selling packages 
of loans to investors 
the education department is the backup insurer to the 
guarantors the taxpayers must make up the difference between the 
default liability and what the department takes in through loan 
fees and collections 
the department said last week that the taxpayer costs for the 
troubled foundation would not surpass 100 million 
several alternatives have been suggested for the bailout a 
takeover by sallie mae a takeover by indianapolisbased united 
student aid funds another large guarantor and a spreading out of 
the bad loans over a number of agencies

college students may be ordered to help bring in a 
bumper soviet harvest and delay the opening of their fall terms by 
one month according to vladilen nikitin director of the state 
food commission 
nikitin said prime minister nikolai ryzhkov signed an order 
friday drafting at least 15 percent of the nations civilian trucks 
to help with the harvest 
the officials tass news agency reported thursday that tens of 
thousands of soldiers and even kgb personnel are harvesting a grain 
crop estimated at a record 260 million tons 
we have to consider it reasonable to draft students for a 
month to permit deans to postpone studies for a month nikitin 
told the vremya tv news program friday 
the soviets are already losing 2 million tons a day because they 
cannot harvest and store the grain fast enough soviet news media 
blamed shortages of fuel trucks and storage space as well as the 
centrally planned economys inability to adjust to the demand 
the government has already sent 70 army battalions with 35000 
trucks to help with the harvest and tass said another 20 
battalions with 10000 trucks will be added

an insurance executive whose acquisition of 15 
failed savings and loans has been labeled a sweetheart deal says 
the transaction saved taxpayers more than 100 million 
james m fail of phoenix said the collection of texas thrifts 
that he now operates under the name of bluebonnet savings bank of 
dallas is part of the solution to the savings and loan crisis 
not part of the problem 
bluebonnet already has saved the american taxpayer over 100 
million as compared with continuing the operations of the 15 
insolvent thrifts fail said in testimony scheduled for delivery 
monday to the senate judiciary antitrust subcommittee the remarks 
were distributed to reporters friday 
sen howard m metzenbaum dohio the subcommittee chairman 
has sharply criticized the deal between fail and the nowdefunct 
federal home loan bank board he said fail acquired the thrifts and 
was awarded government subsidies valued at 18 billion after 
investing only 1000 of his own money 
fail borrowed the rest of his initial 70 million investment 
half of it from an insurance company he controls metzenbaum said 
but in his statement fail said substantially all of the 
government assistance ultimately will go to depositors and 
creditors of the 15 failed thrifts paying for mistakes made long 
before i ever heard of any of those thrifts 
he said bluebonnets profits do not depend solely on 
government largesse they depend on managing the institution 
well he said 
fail said the suggestion that he acquired bluebonnet for 1000 
was ridiculous he said he was committed eventually to invest a 
total of 120 million has invested 95 million so far and had 
pledged substantially all of my business holdings as collateral 
for personal loans in the deal 
further he said bluebonnet has distributed no earnings to its 
shareholders and as chairman of the institution he receives only an 
18000 annual retainer and a 1000 fee per meeting 
a 35 million loan for the acquisition from an insurance company 
he controls has been a good deal for the companys policyholders 
he said noting that the loan has paid 64 million in interest 
metzenbaum has questioned why the bank board did not disqualify 
fail as an acquirer because a company he controlled had pleaded 
guilty to fraud in 1976 in alabama but fail said he had repeatedly 
disclosed his legal problems

a new technique that allows diagnosis of 
inherited diseases in an unfertilized human egg before conception 
is being described as an important step toward the prevention of 
genetic diseases 
on friday researchers reported that they had diagnosed cystic 
fibrosis in a human egg before conception they said the technique 
could be used with many other inherited ailments including 
muscular dystrophy hemophilia and sickle cell anemia 
the technique could satisfy some abortion opponents objections 
to fetal diagnosis said yury verlinsky director of the 
reproductive genetics institute at illinois masonic medical center 
in chicago 
these diseases can now be diagnosed in the fetus before birth 
but such diagnosis often leaves the parents with no option but to 
terminate the pregnancy if the fetus carries the disease 
the new technique of preconception diagnosis makes abortion 
unnecessary verlinsky said in a telephone interview 
i feel its going to be the technique of choice for the 
families who are carriers for genetic diseases he said its 
better to avoid abortion and to have this technique to conceive 
only a normal child 
i get letters from righttolife people who say this is good 
research verlinsky said 
dr norbert gleicher director of the center for human 
reproduction at mount sinai hospital in chicago called it a 
very very important advance in practical terms this is a very 
important step and a very smart concept 
an important limitation of the technique is that it can be used 
only in conjunction with invitro fertilization or ivf the 
testtube baby technique in which an egg is fertilized in a 
laboratory dish and the resulting embryo is implanted in the 
mothers womb 
ivf which is what youre involved in has a limited success 
rate said dr laird jackson director of the division of medical 
genetics at thomas jefferson medical college in philadelphia 
in other words many eggs judged to be free of disease using 
preconception diagnosis will fail to result in births because of 
the difficulties of invitro fertilization 
nevertheless technical advances in the future could change 
that jackson said and preconception diagnosis was clearly of 
value for parents who are opposed to abortion he said 
last november verlinsky reported the development of the new 
technique at a meeting of the american society of human genetics 
his report of the preconception diagnosis of cystic fibrosis 
appears in todays issue of the lancet a british medical journal 
the technique makes use of a cell called a polar body that is 
discarded by an egg as it matures verlinsky said an immature egg 
contains a pair of each of the 23 human chromosomes 
as the egg matures it discards one set of chromosomes in the 
polar body and retains one set the sperm that later fertilizes the 
egg imports a set of the fathers chromosomes so the fertilized 
egg is back to full strength with a pair of each chromosome 
verlinsky analyzes the genes in the polar body to determine 
whether the remaining genes in the egg carry the cystic fibrosis 
defect 
on thursday dr alan handyside and colleagues at hammersmith 
hospital in london reported the first birth of children who were 
examined for genetic diseases by screening testtube embryos before 
the embryos were implanted in their mothers 
in that technique an egg fertilized in a test tube is allowed 
to divide until it forms an embryo of eight cells one cell is 
removed and analyzed for genetic defects if the embryo is healthy 
it is implanted in the mothers womb 
verlinsky who has also experimented with that technique said 
it could be used in conjunction with the preconception screening 
in circumstances in which the preconception screening alone was 
not enough to assure that the fetus did not carry a genetic disease 
the research team at hammersmith hospital also is experimenting 
with preconception diagnosis jackson said 
the preconception diagnosis of cystic fibrosis currently is 
limited to children of the 70 percent of cysticfibrosis carriers 
with the most common of the many genetic mutations that can cause 
the disease verlinsky said

the senate early saturday voted to let the 
government sink 72 billion deeper into debt over the next two 
months a cash infusion designed to avert an unprecedented federal 
default 
the senate passed the bill by voice vote after the house on 
friday cleared the bill by a vote of 247172 
the bill requested by president bush would provide enough 
money to keep federal coffers full through oct 2 
last tuesday the house approved a longerterm extension of the 
debt limit providing 322 billion in borrowing authority but that 
measure the target of possible amendments in the senate is not 
expected to move toward enactment until after congress august 
recess 
the treasury has warned that the government will run out of 
money by aug 15 unless its authority to borrow money is extended 
with congress poised to begin its monthlong august recess at the 
close of business friday lawmakers had to approve the measure 
before leaving the capital 
by aug 15 the government is expected to deplete its 
cashonhand in doing so the total federal debt will hit a record 
312 trillion 
the government has never defaulted on its payments if it did 
so economists say interest rates would skyrocket and financial 
markets could be badly shaken 
failure to enact the bill would result in disastrous economic 
political and financial consequences said house ways and means 
committee chairman dan rostenkowski dill 
because debt limit extensions are mustpass legislation they 
consistently attract unrelated amendments that would have little 
chance of passage on their own 
oct 2 is the second day of fiscal 1991 
it is a date by which bush administration and congressional 
budget negotiators would like to complete their work on a 
deficitreduction deal 
because any budgetcutting pact would contain unpopular tax 
increases and spending cuts budget bargainers would like to attach 
their package to the next extension of the debt limit

kuwait was filled with the tanks and soldiers of

were unable to get pictures of the combat from the scene 
network news made do friday with arrowfilled maps phone

kuwaits capital city file footage taken before the invasion and 
related reports from around the world 
but with kuwaits airport closed and outsiders barred network 
correspondents in the area including cbs anchorman dan rather 
and their camera crews had to do their reporting from neighboring 
persian gulf countries 
rather was vacationing in europe when the invasion began he 
rushed to the middle east to join cbs correspondents there 
officials at cbs said 
correspondents were not allowed into kuwait or iraq said 
officials at cbs nbc abc and cable news network 
in one gulf state that let correspondents file taped reports via 
satellite jittery officials fearful of angering iraq asked them 
not to mention the country from which they were reporting network 
executives said 
it resulted in correspondents ending their stories by simply 
saying they were reporting from the gulf 
network producers in the middle east remained tuned to telecasts 
from baghdad kuwait and saudi arabia for news footage from kuwait 
but it was in vain executives said friday

health and human services secretary louis 
sullivan says he is frustrated that he cannot express his own 
political beliefs without suffering racebased criticism 
sullivan in a speech in los angeles friday night to the 
national association of black journalists was referring to a 
remark by rep fortney pete stark dcalif that sullivan was 
a disgrace to his race and his profession because of 
administration policy on health care for the poor 
i guess i should feel ashamed because congressman stark thinks 
i am not a good negro sullivan said as a cabinet member who 
has spent almost four decades of my life dedicated to healing 
i am unable to express my own views without being subject to 
racebased criticism by those who are not ready to accept 
independent thinking by a black man 
sullivan called the remarks by stark a chairman of a house 
health subcommittee incomprehensibly offensive 
both sullivan and the administration had demanded an apology 
after the thursday remarks 
friday on the house floor stark who is white conceded that 
i blew it by injecting race into his criticism of a black 
cabinet member for backing bush administration policies 
but stark told the house he stood by his main point that 
administration policies are harming blacks and the poor and 
regretted that race had obscured his complaint 
to the secretary i have to say i blew it stark told the 
house i should not have brought into the discussion his race 
because it obscures the fact he is carrying on a bankrupt policy 
 
sullivan spokesman bob schmermund said starks latest comments 
were not the apology sullivan was looking for 
he was right about one thing he blew it other than that we 
certainly dont view what he said on the house floor as anything 
close to an apology he said 
the white house called starks remrks a bigoted assault 
before stark spoke house minority leader bob michel rill 
led a series of republican critics on the house floor he charged 
that stark had brought discredit on this institution demanded 
an apology and called starks attack as bizarre as it is 
deplorable 
no matter how heated our debate may be no one has a right to 
bring into question a mans race or religion or national origin 
michel said 
stark rose moments later and said michel is absolutely right 
to bring in race or religion into a policy debate is wrong 
but he repeated his complaints that sullivan was going along 
with bush administration policies that hurt the poor and 
minorities he said the policies were denying them decent medical 
care job training extended unemployment benefits and denying 
abortions for poor women 
democratic national chairman ron brown who is black said in a 
prepared statement that he was glad stark had clarified his 
original intent 
i do not believe that mr sullivan is a disgrace to his 
race brown said however i do think that many of the bush 
administrations policies like reagans policies before him are 
disgraceful i believe that is the point that congressman stark was 
trying to make 
the republican national committee then entered the argument 
saying starks unfair unwarranted and shameless attack 
warranted strong language from brown since stark only half 
concedes he was wrong chairman brown needs to step up and condemn 
him gop consultant charles black said in the rnc statement 
black is filling it for the ailing gop chairman lee atwater 
rep craig washington dtexas who is black rose in starks 
defense he told the house that if republicans were sincere in 
denouncing the racial remarks he hoped they would vote for the 
civil rights bill before the house 
stark made his initial remarks thursday in response to questions 
at a news conference on another subject he refused to apologize at 
a second news conference later that day 
stark accused sullivan of switching to an antiabortion position 
at the urging of administration officials and opposing expanded 
federal health coverage to the uninsured for the same reason the 
two differ on those issues and also over federally sponsored 
national health insurance which stark is pushing and sullivan said 
last month he opposes

the advisory body of the national endowment 
for the arts is pushing for the elimination of an antiobscenity 
pledge that artists and arts institutions must sign before they can 
receive federal grants 
after an emotional debate the national council on the arts 
urged endowment chairman john e frohnmayer on friday to stop 
requiring grant recipients to agree in writing to comply with a 
congressional ban on using federal funds for works that might be 
deemed obscene 
the 172 vote by the presidentially appointed council is not 
binding on frohnmayer im going to consider it and take my 
action in due course said frohnmayer 
the motion to remove the antiobscenity pledge was sponsored by 
council member roy goodman a new york state senator and arts 
patron who called it a loyalty oath reminiscent of the mccarthy 
era of anticommunist witch hunts led by sen joseph mccarthy 
rwis in the 1950s 
goodman said the pledge insulted and alienated the arts 
community and worsened the furor surrounding the endowment the 
artist knows what the law is he said we dont have to rub his 
nose in it 
frohnmayer instituted the pledge after conservative lawyers led 
by sen jesse helms rnc persuaded congress last october to 
amend the arts endowments current 171 million budget to include a 
prohibition against federal support for obscene art 
the ban prompted by protests over an neasupported exhibition 
of works by the late photographer robert mapplethorpe includes 
depictions of sadomasochism homoeroticism the sexual 
exploitation of children or individuals engaged in sex acts 
frohnmayer placed the text of the antiobscenity ban in the 
regulations that govern the award of endowment grants of the 2000 
nea grants approved by early july a dozen recipients have signed 
the pledge under protest a halfdozen have refused to sign and 
forfeited their grants and two have challenged the requirement in 
federal court 
at frohnmayers urging the council amended goodmans motion to 
make clear that it did not relieve nea grant recipients of the need 
to comply with antiobscenity law without such a qualification 
frohnmayer said the signal might be that the endowment is 
thumbing its nose at the law 
the council was beginning a threeday meeting devoted mostly to 
reviewing grant applications approved by the endowments panels of 
outside experts in dance theater music and other arts disciplines 
council member lloyd richards dean of the yale school of drama 
said the controversy over obscene art had injected fear into the 
arts community and threatened to transform the nea into a 
national endowment for the agreeable 
another member phyllis berney an arts patron and former member 
of the wisconsin arts board said the endowment had lost public 
confidence because of the mapplethorpe exhibit and other 
offensive art 
first amendment rights are an issue for lawyers she said 
saying the real issue is a handful of individuals who want to 
shock and do it with public funds 
rep pat williams dmont chairman of a house subcommittee 
that oversees the arts endowment warned there is no chance 
that congress will authorize an extension of the nea this year 
without some form of restrictions on obscenity 
williams won loud applause from council members and spectators 
who crowded into the hearing room when in a reference to 
mapplethorpe he denounced the howling mob of people hurling 
epithets at a dead gay male artist and other artists whose works 
are controversial

the united states is sending a third aircraft 
carrier and 15000 sailors and marines toward the middle east early 
next week to bolster its naval armada in the persian gulf crisis 
pentagon officials say 
as military strategists and lawmakers debated the dangers of 
committing us combat troops to a protracted desert war against 
iraqi tanks it was clear that the immediate us response to 
iraqs seizure of oilrich kuwait was to focus on a show of naval 
strength 
officials said 15 naval vessels led by the carrier saratoga and 
including a marine amphibious assault unit will leave east coast 
ports on monday and tuesday for the mediterranean 
pentagon spokesman pete williams refused to link the latest ship 
movements with the gulf crisis saying they had been planned for 
months although the saratoga had been scheduled to relieve the uss 
eisenhower he said the two carriers might remain together on duty 
in the mediterranean for a while 
the eisenhower was deployed in the region in march its marine 
amphibious unit has been stationed off the coast of strifetorn 
liberia for several weeks 
the carrier independence already is steaming toward waters 
outside the persian gulf from the indian ocean to back up the us 
navys task force of eight warships already stationed inside the 
gulf 
while the united states is focusing for the time being on naval 
maneuvers concerns were expressed at the pentagon and on capitol 
hill about the implications of sending american troops into battle 
against iraqs 5500 tanks and millionman army 
even though billions of dollars in us arms have been sold to 
saudi arabia over the years its 65000man army is largely 
untested on the battlefield just last month the saudis signed an 
agreement to buy 3 billion of the us armys most advance tanks 
the m1a2s but they arent scheduled for delivery until the 
mid1990s 
adm william j crowe jr former chairman of the joint chiefs 
of staff told nbc the united states could dominate the gulf from 
a naval standpoint and we can dominate them in the air but 
that landing us combat troops would be a major problem 
military observers note that most mideast nations friendly to 
the united states have refused to allow us bases on their 
territory 
the closest major ground forces available to the united states 
are based in western europe or on the island of diego garcia in the 
indian ocean a week to 10 days away from the persian gulf region 
by sea 
we were impotent 10 years ago in the hostage crisis and were 
impotent now said one military analyst who spoke only on 
condition that he not be identified 
we have no infrastructure there to accept any kind of land 
forces no way to get water food fuel let alone tanks and 
trucks to support a land war he said 
defense secretary dick cheney met with bush at the white house 
on friday and then reviewed iraqi military moves and us options 
with gen colin powell and other members of the joint chiefs of 
staff 
the possibility of an iraqi thrust into saudi arabia worried 
members of congress lawmakers who attended secret briefings on the 
crisis said the 120000 iraqi troops massed along their southern 
border could easily attack the saudis next 
house speaker thomas s foley said such a development would 
raise the most serious security questions for the united states 
and would call for a direct military response by the united 
states western europe maybe even the soviet union 
added foley this would be an action that could not be 
ignored 
the saratoga will be accompanied by the guided missile cruiser 
philippine sea the destroyer spruance guided missile destroyer 
sampson and frigate elm r montgomery all based in mayport fla 
departing norfolk va will be the battleship wisconsin guided 
missile cruiser biddle frigate thomas c hart and destroyer tender 
yellowstone the fast combat support ship detroit based in earle 
nj will also join the battle group the pentagon said 
those nine ships are scheduled to leave on tuesday they will be 
preceded on monday by five ships that make up the marine amphibious 
ready group 
those are the amphibious assault ship inchon and the amphibious 
transport dock nashville both based in norfolk and the dock 
landing ship whidbey island and tank landing ships newport and 
fairfax county based in little creek va 
carriers are normally outfitted with a wide array of missiles 
and firepower including fa18 jet fighters f4 attack aircraft 
and a6e bombers 
currently there are 18 us navy ships in the mediterranean 
with about 10000 personnel aboard pentagon sources said 
inside the gulf the us military presence is represented by 
eight warships of the joint task force middle east led by the 
command ship uss lasalle and including a cruiser destroyer and 
frigates

drinking water in many small communities falls 
below federal health requirements and in some cases violations are 
being hidden by improper tests or falsified records a 
congressional study says 
the general accounting office said in a report released friday 
that an investigation of compliance to drinking water standards at 
75 community water systems in six states showed many local 
authorities are not complying with the federal requirements 
the study also said that efforts by the environmental protection 
agency to uncover violations and take enforcement actions against 
the local water officials frequently are ineffective 
we found that many water systems particularly smaller 
systems are violating requirements for monitoring water quality 
and meeting drinking water standards richard hembra the gaos 
director for environmental issues told a house government 
operations subcommittee 
the environmental protection agency acknowledged problems with 
getting small community water systems to comply with federal clean 
water requirements 
she also acknowledged that some violations of federal drinking 
water standards go unreported because of erroneous information from 
local officials or inadequate monitoring by states 
nevertheless ms wilcher maintained that said the most serious 
violations have been resolved and in that available reports showed 
that 73 percent of the community water systems serving 183 million 
people were complying with federal health standards for drinking 
water in 1989 
according to the gao report however those statistics may 
overstate compliance nationwide

senate and house negotiators on clean air 
legislation reached agreement on a schedule for ending by the 
close of the decade use of chemicals that damage the ozone layer 
but leaders acknowledged friday the most difficult issues of the 
legislation have yet to be discussed 
among other provisions the negotiators agreed to forbid states 
and local governments from restricting or banning the chemicals for 
two years 
the conference committee is not scheduled to meet again until 
after the august congressional recess house and senate staffers 
were directed to work through the month to draft possible 
compromises on various parts of the two bills 
negotiators said they hoped the agreement on ozonedestroying 
chemicals would help break the deadlock 
that agreement calls for phasing out such chemicals including 
chlorofluorocarbons halons and carbon tetrachloride widely used 
as coolants solvents and foam blowing agents by the end of the 
decade 
some substitute chemicals that are less harmful to the 
environment such as hcfcs chlorofluorocarbons that contain one or 
more hydrogen atoms would be phased out over the next 40 years 
the measure also calls for recylcing of these chemicals by 1992 
and the installation of precautions to prevent routine release into 
the air

thomas m egan president and chief executive officer of stotler 
group said the company had been in negotiations with the creditors 
in efforts to reach a solution 
our intention and desire was to avert a filing in bankruptcy 
by developing a workable plan to cooperate with and maximize the 
return to creditors egan said 
however it appears unlikely that any return to shareholders 
of stotler group will be possible under the current 
circumstances he said 
the petition names only stotler group inc and does not affect 
stotler and co or its other holdings 
stotler and co was one of the largest brokerage firms before it 
announced its plan to liquidate its futures business 
stotler group identified the petitioners as advanced portfolio 
management which holds a 1 million unpaid note of the stotler 
group and two parties that received part of 415 million in 
defaulted commercial paper held by compass futures 
advanced portfolio management and compass futures are pooled 
investment funds operated by stotler funds inc another stotler 
group subsidiary 
the commodity futures trading commission earlier this week 
accused stotler funds of improperly talking money from apm and 
compass to help bolster its parent company 
the funds were supposed to be used only for investment in 
commodity markets 
mahlmann has denied any involvement in stotlers recent 
financial decisions saying he had spent almost all his time 
running the board of trade

congress early today extended for an extra 
month president bushs authority to tap the nations strategic 
petroleum reserve should iraqs invasion of kuwait disrupt the 
world oil market 
on a voice vote with no dissent the house approved an emergency 
temporary extension of the energy policy conservation act that 
established the rainyday stockpile in the event of another oil 
disruption 
without the extension bushs authority to pump crude oil from 
the stockpile to relieve shortages would expire aug 15 while 
congress is on vacation the senate passed the same bill thursday 
given the events in the middle east with respect to kuwait it 
would be unwise to leave town without extending the current law 
rep norman lent rny said 
the stockpile stored in salt caverns along the louisianatexas 
coast and accumulated at a cost of more than 20 billion over the 
past decade now has 580 million barrels enough to replace imports 
from abroad for 50 days at current import levels 
congress and the administration have been battling the past 18 
months over whether to increase the reserve to 1 billion barrels in 
view of growing us dependency on foreign oil bush has opposed 
increasing the reserve beyond 750 million barrels

a leading egyptian newspaper reported today 
that iraq executed 120 of its military officers who refused to 
fight against kuwait 
the governmentowned alahram said in a baghdaddated frontpage 
report that the executions occurred friday a day after iraq 
invaded kuwait in a dispute over land and oil 
the report did not cite any source raising the possibility that 
it was an egyptian intelligence leak 
it said iraqi president saddam hussein approved the death 
sentences handed down by a military court 
the officers had refused to obey orders issued to them to 
participate in the iraqi invasion of kuwait because this 
represented an unjustified aggression on a sister arab state the 
paper said 
the paper did not give the names or ranks of the executed 
officers 
it did not say how the officers were put to death but 
executions for military crimes in the arab world normally are 
carried out by firing squad

the house passed and sent to president bush 
early today a bill triggered by the wreck of the exxon valdez that 
would strengthen federal oil spill liability laws 
the house approved 3600 the compromise worked out by a 
housesenate conference committee as one of its last actions before 
recessing for the summer it passed despite strong objections by 
some lawmakers to a oneyear moratorium on drilling off the north 
carolina coast 
the senate voted 990 thursday to approve the legislation more 
than 16 months after the exxon valdez tanker ran aground in prince 
william sound dumping 11 million gallons of crude oil into the 
pristine alaska waterway 
the oil spill bill says safe transportation of oil is going to 
be part of the cost of doing business said rep george miller 
dcalif the chairman of the house interior subcommittee on 
offshore energy resources 
he called the bill the first environmental salvo of the 
decade 
its not as strong as many of us would like to see it but 
its landmark legislation said rep gerry studds dmass 
chairman of the house merchant marine and fisheries subcommittee on 
the environment 
stephen hart deputy press secretary at the white house said 
bush has some reservations about the bill but no veto 
recommendations 
we have reservations because the protocols are not in the 
bill and that the conference added the moratorium on north 
carolina said hart 
the protocols are a reference to an international treaty not 
yet ratified by the united states that would lessen liability the 
bill puts a oneyear moratorium on drilling off the coast of north 
carolina until a study of possible effects can be completed 
miller and other lawmakers pushing for tougher liability laws 
said they hoped to pin more responsibility for spills on oil 
companies instead of just the shippers 
miller was satisfied however that companies using 
irresponsible shippers would eventually have to pay said a miller 
aide 
the bill also allows states to enact tougher laws 
lawmakers who have been trying for years to get a federal 
liability bill through congress consider the legislation a major 
breakthrough that seemed to need a tragedy as devastating as the 
march 24 1989 oil spill to become reality 
many of us are glad not to have to work on it again in another 
congress said studds whose efforts to strengthen oil spill laws 
go back to 1975 
the exxon valdez spill the worst in us history prompted 
demands for tougher federal requirements following the spill the 
house and senate each passed differing bills that took lengthy 
conference negotiations to reconcile 
major provisions in the legislation going to bush include 
liability by shippers for up to 1200 per gross ton of the 
tanker instead of the current ceiling of 150 per gross ton 
creation of a 1 billion oil spill response and cleanup fund 
with the money coming from a 5centabarrel fee on domestic and 
imported oil 
a requirement that all new tankers have double hulls and that 
most of the existing tankers be retrofitted with double hulls or 
taken out of service over the next 20 years a small number of 
tankers will be given until 2015 to have double hulls 
formation of regional response teams within the coast guard to 
deal with oil spills and a national response center where computers 
will hold lists of personnel and equipment that can be called upon 
after a major spill 
increased research on oil pollution control 
a requirement that the government check driving records for 
alcoholrelated offenses before issuing licenses to operate an oil 
tanker

percent 
for the entire month of july with imported cars and trucks

in the superpowers first joint sanctions against 
a war the united states and soviet union have urged a world 
embargo of weapons sales to iraq and demanded that the baghdad 
government pull its troops out of kuwait 
we have been assured that very soon the iraqis will pull out 
their troops foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze told a 
friday news conference with us secretary of state james a baker 
iii at his side he said the soviets received the assurances 
through contacts in baghdad 
later friday an iraqi government spokesman said iraqi troops 
will begin withdrawing from kuwait on sunday baghdad radio 
announced iraq claimed the decision was not because of 
international pressure 
it was a historic case of the superpowers acting together to try 
to end hostilities 
they worked together in seeking peace for lebanon but fridays 
action is the first time they have tried together to strangle a war 
by cutting off trade with an attacker they also cooperated during 
world war ii but before attaining superpower status 
both countries separately condemned the iraqi invasion but 
baker noted superpower cooperation had made a joint stand 
natural 
in earlier days we might have been viewing this very tragic 
action through an eastwest prism baker said 
shevardnadze spoke slowly and softly to reporters as he reviewed 
his countrys decision to cut off arms shipments to its ally after 
the invasion began thursday 
the kremlin and baghdad have had a friendship treaty since 1972 
and the soviet union is iraqs major arms supplier 
it wasnt easy to adopt such documents and make a joint 
statement because of our wellknown good relations with iraq which 
have been evolving for decades shevardnadze said 
france said it already had suspended arms shipments to iraq 
citing payment problems with that middle east nation italy and 
poland have also cut arms deliveries to iraq and west germany is 
discussing such a move 
neither baker nor shevardnadze said specifically what their 
nations might do if iraq continues what their statement called 
brutal and illegal invasion and blatant transgression of the 
basic norms of civilized conduct 
they spoke of continued concerted action in the un security 
council 
shevardnadze said neither side was considering military 
intervention but baker when asked about further actions against 
iraq said i dont think that prudently you should rule out 
anything 
china is also a major arms supplier to iraq shevardnadze said 
the soviets planned to urge the chinese to stop supplies later a 
senior state department official speaking on bakers flight from 
moscow said the united states would do the same 
baker cut short a visit to neighboring mongolia to fly to moscow 
to meet with shevardadze for the second time in a week and to make 
the joint statement baker then flew to washington winding up a 
fournation asian tour 
shevardnadze acknowledged that baker earlier in the week had 
asked the soviets to act to stave off the possibility of an 
invasion 
i really did not think at that time that the iraqis would so 
openly engage in aggression against such a defenseless country a 
country that is a threat to no one shevardnadze said 
he said the soviet leadership sent a special message to 
president saddam hussein of iraq on thursday but did not reveal 
the contents 
shevardnadze referring to president mikhail s gorbachevs 
foreign policy said the invasion contradicts the principles of 
new political thinking and the principles of civilized relations 
between nations 
he warned iraq about the safety of the 900 soviets in kuwait and 
the 7000 to 8000 in iraq 
we expect the security of soviet citizens there to be 
safeguarded otherwise there might be very very severe 
consequences he told reporters 
baker said similar consequences would result if any of the 3000 
americans in kuwait or an undetermined number of americans in iraq 
are endangered 
speaking on bakers air force plane the state department 
official said the united states had privately warned iraq before 
the invasion not to attack kuwait 
there was a general warning at several different levels 
including very high levels the official said on condition of 
anonymity

a plan to remedy discrimination against 
hispanics won the backing of a federal judge who has ordered local 
lawmakers to redraw the political map in the nations most populous 
county 
us district judge david v kenyon ruling in a historic voting 
rights lawsuit friday supported a redistricting plan that creates 
a hispanic majority district for the board of supervisors the 
countys top elected officials 
for the first time the hispanic community is going to be a 
meaningful part of the electorate in los angeles county said 
attorney mark rosenbaum who represented the american civil 
liberties union in the suit this means we can take down the 
hispanic need not apply sign 
kenyon ruled june 4 that the board of supervisors discriminated 
against hispanics when redrawing district boundaries after the 1980 
census kenyon found the supervisors violated the federal voting 
rights act and ordered the board to submit a new plan that would 
help a hispanic win a seat 
an estimated 35 percent of the countys 87 million residents 
are hispanic but the board has not had an elected hispanic member 
in 115 years 
jose roberto juarez an attorney for the mexican american legal 
defense and educational fund said kenyons decision sends a strong 
signal nationally to governments that will be redrawing voting 
boundaries on the basis of the 1990 census results 
the most important outcome of this lawsuit is the recognition 
that we are prepared to do battle for voting rights regardless of 
the size of the opponent he said 
under the new plan a supervisorial district held by a retiring 
conservative supervisor would be redrawn to give it a hispanic 
majority the other four districts would undergo minor adjustments 
that generally preserve voter bases of two liberal and two 
conservative supervisors 
kenyons ruling came in the form of a request to the plaintiffs 
to draw a plan to his liking the plaintiffs plans already 
submitted generally conform to what the judge has asked for 
kenyon still must issue a formal order to implement the new plan 
the ruling could change a decadelong 32 conservative majority 
with possible sweeping effects on such matters as health and social 
services funding 
the decision also voids a june primary election and sets a 
special election for nov 6 for the new hispanic majority district 
that district had been held by conservative supervisor pete 
schabarum who is retiring 
the board obviously disagrees with judge kenyons ruling and 
our attorneys will file an appeal by monday morning seeking to 
stay his demand for a special primary election in the new 1st 
district conservative supervisor deane dana said in a statement 
we expect the appeals court to rule on our request for a stay 
by tuesday 
with new district lines dana and fellow supervisor mike 
antonovich face losing their conservative lock on the board 
maldef the aclu and the us justice department argued 
successfully that supervisors drew boundaries to protect their 
incumbencies 
the county supervisors denied purposefully discriminating 
against hispanics and said they did the best the could with the 
available census data 
the board majority approved a redistricting proposal that this 
week was rejected by kenyon as nonsensical and insensitive 
to hispanic and black residents

increased ultraviolet light streaming 
through the earths depleted atmospheric ozone layer may be causing 
the mysterious deaths of toads frogs and other amphibians reported 
in widely scattered areas of the world an oregon state university 
zoologist said 
cautioning that evidence remains circumstantial andrew 
blaustein said friday that ultraviolet radiation could explain the 
recent mass dieoffs in two cascade range lakes in oregon and 
other declines in amphibian populations in the western united 
states costa rica and australia 
he said tadpoles taken from the stricken oregon lakes before the 
dieoffs and reared away from direct sunlight in his laboratory 
developed normally prompting the theory that uv light was to blame 
if this is the problem humans will be directly affected 
blaustein said in a telephone interview they will also be 
greatly indirectly affected if it is starting to kill animal life 
amphibians are not the only ones to go 
blaustein a professor of biology at the university in 
corvallis said the theory would be one of the main topics tuesday 
at a meeting in new orleans of scientists studying the recent 
declines in amphibian populations around the world 
i am getting somewhat alarmed blaustein said adding that 
many possible causes for the mass deaths had been ruled out i 
would say people studying amphibians are somewhat alarmed by the 
possibility it could be increased uv 
scientists have blamed releases of chlorofluorocarbon gases 
used as a coolant in refrigerators and air conditioners and as a 
propellant in aerosol cans for widespread thinning of the ozone 
layer which screens ultraviolet light from the sun 
in the spring blaustein and other scientists discovered all the 
western toad eggs had died in lost lake near santiam pass in the 
cascade range and all the frog tadpoles had disappeared from an 
unnamed lake nearby 
blaustein said research done at oregon state university in 1975 
by robert worrest showed toad eggs and tadpoles were very 
susceptible to increases in midrange ultraviolet radiation 
jack hardy associate professor of environmental studies at 
western washington university in bellingham has found increased 
ultraviolet light reduced ocean planktons ability to perform 
photosynthesis the vital oxygen producingprocess of plants 
socalled middle range ultraviolet light between 290 nanometers 
and 420 nanometers reduces photosynthesis causes genetic damage 
and skin cancer and could affect the growth of food crops and 
forests hardy said 
i would not be surprised if it affects frog egg hatches 
hardy said 
research in antarctica indicates that ultraviolet light is 
strongest in the springtime when amphibians would be in their 
larval stage and most susceptible to damage from sunlight he added 
in the northwest scientists have noted the western spotted frog 
is no longer found in western oregon and western washington and 
breeding populations of the redlegged frog have disappeared from 
oregons willamette valley blaustein said 
up to 40 species of amphibians in costa rica are now endangered 
and the golden toad has disappeared from a national park there 
the redlegged frog once the most common frog in california 
has disappeared from the central valley and is declining elsewhere 
the gastricbrooding frog can no longer be found in australia

manhattans borough president wielded obscure 
veto powers to halt development on the site where malcolm x was 
assassinated a harlem ballroom she fought to preserve as a 
historical landmark 
ruth messinger led the battle to save the audubon ballroom but 
said her veto friday of an 81 million allocation for the proposed 
34 million medical research laboratory project was purely a 
business decision 
the project already was 9 million over budget messinger said 
in a letter to the port authority which was to have provided the 
81 million she challenged with the little usedveto power 
afforded her office by state law 
the deal to build the biomedical research lab also was too 
speculative and only promised 300 new jobs initially she said the 
city state and columbia university planned to share construction 
costs 
messinger left the door open for a compromise to save the lab 
project and preserve the ballroom where the famed black muslim 
leader was shot in 1965 
nothing bars a new submission from the mayors office she 
wrote in the letter 
deputy mayor bill lynch said the veto effectively halted the 
project 
messinger is a longtime ally of mayor david dinkins but crossed 
swords with him over the audubon ballroom the mayor recently 
agreed to a compromise plan that would have preserved 40 percent of 
the ballroom which has a distinctive terra cotta facade 
but messinger and other preservationists favored a plan backed 
by the municipal art society to keep the ballroom intact and build 
the lab on a different corner of the block city officials say that 
plan would push the project back into the approval process

dallas police chief mack vines and his deputy have 
been relieved from duty while prosecutors examine allegations of 
witness tampering and perjury during an investigation into a police 
officers firing 
city manager jan hart said friday that vines and assistant chief 
greg holliday were placed on indefinite leave 
the dallas county district attorneys office was looking into 
the allegations she said 
vines has been police chief since billy prince retired in april 
1988 amid a controversy over policeminority relations 
ms hart said a panel reviewing the case of former officer 
patrick lemaire fired after fatally shooting an unarmed mexican 
found potential witness tampering and perjury by vines and 
holliday 
the panels findings were reportedly related to an alleged 
conversation vines had with holliday before holliday testified in 
front of the panel this week the panel apparently believes that 
vines tried to get holliday to change his testimony 
this is a very serious matter ms hart said it involves 
the integrity of the department and public confidence in the 
department 
assistant chief willard rollins will run the department in their 
absence she said 
the dallas police association which represents 2000 of the 
departments 2400 members called for vines immediate resignation 
a report by the panel made public friday said it believed 
there was a deliberate attempt by one or more individuals to 
subvert its findings 
this conduct we believe was blatantly unethical and resulted 
in possible perjury testimony the report said 
the actions of vines holliday and other top police officials 
have been under scrutiny since lemaire was fired a year ago 
lemaire shot the mexican while searching for car theft suspects and 
was fired for failing to find alternatives to using deadly force 
when questioned about the conversation vines allegedly told the 
panel that it had been misinterpreted vines has denied any 
wrongdoing saying he reserves the right to request more 
information redirect investigators or set aside procedures in any 
inquiry

replicas of the ships that accompanied 
christopher columbus on his atlantic crossing have set sail but 
this time in search of tourist dollars instead of precious metals 
and spices 
the nina pinta and santa maria on friday began their sixmonth 
voyage to a dozen spanish ports to prepare for a 1992 reenactment 
of columbus trip to the new world 
the ships have a total of 90 crew members and all but the 
commander a spanish navy captain will sleep outdoors as 
columbus crew did on the voyage to america 
like columbus capt santiago bolivar will lead from the deck of 
the santa maria the flagship 
the objective of the 1992 voyage will be to study in action 
the navigation methods of the 15th century and the effectiveness of 
columbus sailing methods bolivar 40 told reporters 
the 15th century spanish royalty bankrolled columbus 
todays government spent 2 million to build the three replica 
ships from galician pine and oak from the pyrenees they sailed 
from this southern port 310 miles southwest of madrid 498 years 
to the day of columbus first voyage to the new world 
the head of the government company planning the 1992 
celebrations luis yanez saw them off and laid a wreath at a 
monument to columbus

chancellor helmut kohl says a proposal 
for early elections and unification is the will of the german 
people but he may need the will of the opposition for his wish to 
become reality 
in a statement from his vacation retreat in austria kohl 
welcomed east german prime minister lothar de maizieres call 
friday for allgerman elections on oct 14 six weeks earlier than 
planned 
the proposal corresponds with the wishes of the people in east 
germany and also in west germany kohl said 
de maiziere said friday that unification would be formally 
declared the day before the election he said said the volkskammer 
east germanys parliament could meet in a special session the day 
before the vote and make that decision kohl supports that idea 
but the opposition social democrats were quick to criticize the 
deal kohl and de maiziere reportedly reached in a late night talk 
at kohls vacation house earlier this week 
the social democrats candidate for chancellor oskar 
lafontaine called the proposal transparent manipulation and 
said this dateshifting carries panicky consequences the 
environmentalist greens called it a bad day for germany 
the germanys are working on finalizing a unification treaty that 
lays out the legal unification of the two states they merged their 
economies on july 1 it has been east germanys crumbling economy 
lurching from communism to capitalism that has spurred the push 
for early unification 
i think this is the right way kohls chief of staff rudolf 
seiters was quoted as saying in todays masscirculation bild 
newspaper only a strong unified german government is in the best 
position to master the problems in east germany 
kohl in his statement said the proposal corresponds to the 
evaluation of people in both parts of germany that a quicker 
unification process reduces difficulties and financial 
expenditures 
on thursday representatives of the germanys agreed on an 
election treaty setting the conditions for the balloting parties 
in both countries had previously agreed on dec 2 as the election 
date 
under west germanys constitution the country must elect a new 
bundestag the lawmaking lower house of parliament between nov 
18 and jan 18 
for an earlier election west german lawmakers could try to 
dissolve the bundestag through a majority vote of noconfidence for 
the chancellor using an article of the constitution as an 
emergency exit and not for its intended purpose kohls governing 
coalition has a simple majority 
lawmakers could also by a twothirds vote in the bundestag 
vote to change the constitution to allow earlier elections 
kohls governing coalition of christian democratic union 
christian social union and free democrats has a combined 282 seats 
in the bundestag but it would need 346 for a twothirds majority 
of the 519member chamber the social democrats have 193 members in 
the bundestag 
de maiziere told a news conference in east berlin that the 
allgerman vote should coincide with east german elections that 
will create five state governments to mirror west germanys federal 
system under bonns constitution those states could immediately 
seek unity with west germany 
the bundestag meets next week to vote on ratification of the 
election treaty kohl said that special session would also discuss 
the latest proposal for german unification

merchant sailors who bobbed in 30foot 
seas after hurricane bertha splintered their cargo ship stepped 
ashore with praise for their soviet rescuers and acceptance of the 
oceans fury 
rolando arellano an apprentice officer from manila 
philippines said friday he would resume his oceangoing life and 
vowed not to give in to fear no this is life at sea 
arellano said 
twentyone survivors of the wrecked freighter corazon were 
brought ashore by a soviet fishing support ship that plucked them 
from churning seas in the atlantic about 400 miles east of new york 
six crew members including most of the ships officers died in 
the wreck tuesday 
what made the whole operation complicated was the wind and the 
height of the waves as well as the rainstorms very little 
visibility said capt vladimir pushnoy skipper of the soviet 
ship mv leonid leonidov speaking through an interpreter at a news 
conference 
one man spent about 10 hours in the water before he was hauled 
to safety pushnoy said 
the survivors were mostly greek or filipino sailors aboard the 
593foot freighter hauling tons of cement from greece to new york 
we are very lucky said ships cook pantelis potiris of 
athens greece it was very bad very rough 
arellano said he spent about five hours floating in the water 
after his life raft capsized 
i hope only to stay alive arellano said i always pray to 
god we are thinking of our family and to save ourselves 
many survivors had only life jackets for flotation and the 
yellow vests were hard to see amid the foam and spray of the rough 
water pushnoy said 
after the corazon sent a distress signal tuesday afternoon the 
us and canadian coast guards provided information to help the 
leonid leonidov and several other ships find the survivors 
two other ships in the area got close to corazon crew members 
but couldnt get them aboard 
pushnoy said his ship was able to pull off the rescue because 
his 46member crew is used to working on the open sea and tying up 
with other vessels under adverse conditions 
survivors from the corazon hugged their rescuers after the rusty 
soviet ship pulled into port 
the russians are good said one survivor giving a thumbsup 
sign

iraqs invasion of kuwait puts saddam 
hussein in control of 15 jailed proiranian terrorists whose 
freedom is demanded by factions holding western hostages in lebanon 
shiite moslem sources familiar with the case of the 16 western 
captives say saddams control of the 15 terrorists held in kuwaiti 
jails gives the iraqi leader a role in the hostage issue 
seventeen terrorists were convicted by the kuwaiti authorities 
in connection with the 1983 bombings of the us and french 
embassies and other targets in the tiny oilrich desert state 
two of them were released after completing their prison term 
that left 15 two of whom have been sentenced to death but the 
sentence was never carried out 
freedom for the terrorists some of whom belong to the iraqi 
aldawa shiite fundamentalist group that has been working for 
saddams overthrow has been a key demand by captors of american 
hostages 
islamic jihad or islamic holy war which has demanded the 
release of the convicts in kuwait holds two americans journalist 
terry anderson and educator thomas sutherland 
anderson 42 chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press is the longestheld foreign captive in lebanon he was 
kidnapped march 16 1985 
kuwait refused to release the convicted terrorists and the 
united states has refused to pressure kuwait into succumbing to the 
kidnappers demands 
one shiite source speaking on condition of anonymity said 
saddams control of the 15 prisoners gives him a window open on 
the hostage issue 
the american abc television network reported friday the 15 were 
all free after the iraqi invasion of kuwait 
does this affect the fate of the american hostages we dont 
even know who freed the kuwait prisoners the abc announcer said 
the iranianbacked hezbollah or party of god which is believed 
to be the umbrella for the hostageholding factions withheld 
comment on the abc report 
no comment is our answer said the head of hezbollahs 
information department known only as abu hawraa he refused to 
elaborate 
the shiite source commenting on the release report said i 
think its farfetched the kuwaitis were not in a position to free 
them before their country fell to the iraqis 
i would swallow it if i heard that they were moved to baghdad 
saddam is not likely to release them free of charge that is if he 
releases them at all the source said 
i believe that if he controlled them saddam would use the 
prisoners to curb the wests moves against him for invading 
kuwait the source added 
one scenario speculated upon by the shiite source would be for 
saddam to offer to swap the 15 for the western captives in 
lebanon 
such a move by saddam would embarrass the west but would 
syria permit such a swap i doubt it he said 
syria iraqs main arab foe has 40000 troops deployed in 
predominantly moslem regions of lebanon and all previous hostage 
releases have been carried out with syrias help or approval 
the foreign captives currently missing in lebanon in addition 
to anderson and sutherland are four americans four britons two 
swiss two west germans an italian and an irishman

installations 
ronni mcdonald a spokesman for the offshore industry liaison 
committee the unofficial council representing the main oil 
industry unions said the sitin affected shell uk and british 
petroleum installations 
the unions claim workers should be involved in safety management 
to reduce the risk of accidents on the rigs

raised concerns about safety in the north sea oil fields at least 
four aircraft accidents have occurred in the past four years and 
167 men were killed in the piper alpha platform fire in july 1988

if liberias civil war had followed 
its script president samuel doe would be dead a prisoner or in 
exile 
but infighting among rebels and unexpectedly stiff resistance 
from does remaining troops have combined to destroy hopes the 
7monthlong war will end soon 
west african nations planned a meeting in gambia monday to 
consider intervention said government sources in nigeria 
on friday government troops and rebels loyal to prince johnson 
fired rockets and shells at each other in blockbyblock fighting 
for monrovia the ravaged liberian capital 
in addition a rivalry between rebel leaders johnson and charles 
taylor is prolonging the war 
sources said today that johnsons rebels recently attacked 
taylors forces deep behind their lines cutting a main supply 
route johnson had pulled some men out of monrovia for the surprise 
attacks said the sources who visited the area and spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
the attacks were launched in nimba county about 300 miles from 
the capital the rebels first began their invasion seven months ago 
in nimba county which borders the ivory coast 
diplomats confidently told reporters weeks ago that as soon as 
rebels were spotted in monrovia they expected does troops to flee 
like many other observers they believed does illtrained and 
poorly paid army would continue a pattern of retreat set in the 
early months of the campaign the rebels had encountered little 
resistance as they advanced hundreds of miles from liberias 
northeastern border with the ivory coast to monrovia in the 
southwest 
they finally slowed down as they entered hostile country and 
left behind territory populated by sympathizers who fed them hid 
them and informed on government troop movements 
guerrilla warfare training learned in libya and burkina faso was 
of little use in the seesaw street battles the rebels fought with 
does forces in the rundown capital 
civilian recruits have bolstered taylors forces from the 200 
who invaded from ivory coast in december to the more than 10000 
troops hes believed to command now but most like does soldiers 
have little training hundreds are boys barely in their teens 
for more than a month reporters traveling with the rebels have 
reported they are as ready to drop their arms and run as the 
government troops 
johnson a former doe officer with us military training has 
broken away with several hundred men who appear bettertrained and 
disciplined than forces under taylor a former doe bureaucrat 
this was evident two weeks ago when johnson attacked the capital 
from the west and got within hundreds of yards of does fortified 
residence 
taylor meanwhile was bogged down six miles east of the 
executive mansion 
many of the more than 1000 troops who remain to guard the 
beleaguered doe are from elite units trained by israelis and 
americans these men know that they likely face summary executions 
if they are captured 
but other government forces were hastily recruited like the 
rebels many criminals freed from prison in february were 
conscripted 
doe has proved himself a survivor by holding onto an area of 
monrovia a few miles square the rest of the ohiosized country is 
mainly rebelheld 
about 5000 people mostly civilians have died since rebels 
invaded from the ivory coast the rebels accuse doe who took power 
in a 1980 coup of corruption and human rights abuses 
the battle has turned in large measure into tribal warfare 
on monday up to 600 civilian refugees were killed in a lutheran 
church compound witnesses said the slayings were committed by 
government troops doe said rebels dressed as government soldiers 
were to blame 
the victims were members of the gio and mano tribes from which 
the rebels get most of their support soldiers accused of the 
massacre were said by witnesses to belong to does krahn tribe or 
the mandingo tribe 
west african leaders are scheduled to meet in banjul gambia on 
monday to decide whether to send a flotilla to end the fighting in 
liberia government sources in lagos the nigerian capital said 
today the sources did not elaborate 
us assistant secretary of state herman cohen said thursday the 
united nations could decide within a matter of days on an 
initiative for liberia cohen would not elaborate 
he said there was no plan for the united states to intervene 
with 2100 marines who are on standby in ships off the liberian 
coast to evacuate americans if necessary

soldiers allegedly massacred 19 
members of a moslem family to avenge the death of two comrades who 
were gunned down by a member of the clan a government official and 
witnesses said today 
lawyer ciriaco jabido regional director of the governments 
commission on human rights said the incident took place friday in 
the village of new passi on the outskirts of this town 610 miles 
southeast of manila 
the military unit operating in the area had earlier reported the 
incident as a clash between government troops and moslem 
separatists but six of the dead were children 
jabido who went to the scene of the massacre said the victims 
were members of the mamindiala clan 
jabido quoted witnesses as saying soldiers from the armys 38th 
infantry battalion arrived in the area to arrest kamlon mamindiala 
a suspected separatist guerrilla 
mamindiala 30 resisted arrest and managed to get a homemade 
12gauge shotgun from a hiding place and fire on the soldiers 
killing two jabido said 
the rest of the soldiers killed mamindiala as he attempted to 
escape 
a witness who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
soldiers then ordered manindialas relatives including those from 
two nearby houses to step out from their homes and gunned them 
down 
jabidos group recovered dozens of empty shells of m16 and m14 
rifles from the scene 
among those killed were mamindialas father kabagal 70 his 
mother 68 his 30yearold pregnant wife palumpukan and his six 
children aged between one to 13 years old 
the witness said the soldiers then burned the houses before 
leaving 
as a result of the incident about 100 of the mamindialas 
neighbors fled to the town center 
comments from military officials in the area were unavailable 
jabido said a forensic team from manila will arrive tuesday to 
investigate the incident

saudi arabia an oilrich ally of kuwait 
has been subdued in its reaction to iraqs invasion of kuwait 
the only direct saudi statement since the invasion was made by 
an anonymous government spokesman through the official saudi press 
agency the day after the iraqi move it did not condemn thursdays 
invasion 
it said saudi arabia was following the kuwait situation with 
extreme concern and that king fahd would be seeking to calm the 
situation and to find a solution in a manner ensuring the 
interests of all 
the only tangible help saudi arabia gave the kuwait government 
was to shelter members of the ruling family including the emir 
sheik jaber alahmed alsabah and his crown prince both nations 
are tightly run by royal families 
the saudis also allowed them briefly to operate a radio 
reportedly from a mobile van in the area around the saudikuwait 
border it broadcast calls for resistance to the iraqis 
but on friday the radio went off the air after a desperate call 
the people of kuwait appeal to you oh brethren oh arabs oh 
beloved brothers oh moslems rush rush to their help 
it was not known if the radio had been discovered by the iraqis 
or shut down by the saudis to avoid provoking iraqi president 
saddam hussein at a time when fears were being expressed that he 
might invade saudi arabia as well 
oil executives said saudi arabia has not and will not take the 
most potent action possible against iraq closing the pipeline 
that carries iraqi oil for export across saudi arabia to the red 
sea 
the executives said the saudis realize this would give the 
belligerent saddam an excuse to attack and occupy the saudi oil 
fields 150 miles south of kuwait giving iraq control of more oil 
than any other country in the world 
turkey also has refused to comment about president bushs 
suggestion that turkey cut off iraqs oil pipeline to the 
mediterranean two parallel pipelines pump iraqi crude oil to a 
terminal at yumurtalik at the eastern corner of turkeys 
mediterranean coast and constitute iraqs major oil export outlet 
the saudis did condemn the invasion as part of a joint statement 
issued by the gulf cooperation council in which it is allied for 
economic and security cooperation with kuwait the united arab 
emirates qatar oman and bahrain 
the six states issued a statement saying we strongly condemn 
and are very sorry for this attack that one arab state took against 
another arab state we do not recognize anything resulting from 
it 
iraqs huge armed force is clearly too much for the joint 
3000man gulf cooperation council force based at hafr albaten in 
northeastern saudi arabia 65 miles south of kuwait but there was 
no talk of specific action against iraq by kuwaits partners 
saudi arabia was also one of the 14 members of the 21member 
arab league that condemned the invasion in the same terms as the 
gulf cooperation council 
the arab league with onethird of its members voting against 
the resolution or abstaining was clearly unable to take any direct 
action

the lower the stock market went the more 
investors turned to gallows humor to help forget about the 
financial bath they were taking 
as the market sank friday angelo falco made light of iraqi 
leader saddam husseins decision to invade kuwait and a prediction 
by soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze that iraqi invaders 
would quickly back out 
i wouldnt be surprised if guys like hussein shevardnadze 
were playing the market this week he said prompting nervous 
laughter among other investors gathered inside charles schwab amp co 
inc at the world trade center 
its typical to hear a lot of gallows humor on a shaky stock 
market day like friday when the dow jones average of 30 
industrials closed down 5495 points after being down more than 120 
points earlier in the day he said 
theyre kidding and laughing knowing theyre losing thousands 
of dollars an hour he said most people are taking a good 
dunking today 
another man frowning one moment was smiling the next as he 
speculated that shevardnadzes prediction had caused the market to 
rebound 35 points in five minutes he couldnt believe how quickly 
the numbers were changing 
he pointed at one stock noting that it stood at 6 a share just 
moments after it had been 11 per share 
eleven now its only six half price half price 
unbelievable he shouted some who heard him focused on the 
numbers like gamblers around a casino table 
robert a burke editor of the investment trade paper eye on 
wall street watched as a steady stream of men took their turns 
at the market computers during fridays rollercoaster trading 
session 
everybody in america wants to get rich quick he said 
these guys are gambling once in a while theyll get lucky years 
ago there used to be millions of these guys but the stock market 
crashed and they all got wiped out 
burke attributed the sudden downfall in the market to the 
announcement friday that unemployment had risen to 55 percent its 
highest level in two years as well as the iraqi invasion and a 
revision of the gross national product last week

before i escaped from a side door and scaled a wall i saw a 
tiger rebel put a gun into the mouth of a small moslem boy and pull 
the trigger 
seneviratne said most of the victims were shot in the back or 
side 
evidence of the carnage was apparent today when the government 
flew reporters to the area the floor of the mosque was splattered 
with blood and the walls pockmarked with bullet holes 
bodies were lined up in neat rows wrapped in the traditional 
moslem white burial clothes small cardboard placards gave the name 
of the victim and the number of the corpse 
groups of sobbing moslem women flocked to the two mosques 
vehicles carrying bodies with moslem clergymen chanting verses 
rolled past armed soldiers patrolling the town shops homes and 
businesses were closed 
in a cemetery at the meera jumma mosque mourners had dug a long 
common grave for a row of coffins 
in colombo a moslem member of parliament and opposition leader 
said the government failed to protect moslems or give them arms to 
protect themselves 
this is a brutal massacre of innocent civilians by the tiger 
terrorists who do not hesitate to enter mosques and kill 
civilians said mohammad ashroff of the sri lanka moslem 
congress party 
we are compelled to conclude the government is a silent 
sadistic observer of the conspiracy against the moslems if not a 
passive participant in it he told reporters 
the tamil tigers did not immediately respond 
this was the second attack blamed on tiger rebels on a mosque in 
the area in one week in a similar attack sunday the militants 
killed 10 worshipers in samanthurai 25 miles east of batticaloa 
on july 24 tamil rebels killed four moslems at another mosque 
in batticaloa district 
moslems who make up about 7 percent of sri lankas 16 million 
people often have been victims of the 7yearold war between tamil 
rebels and the sinhalesedominated government 
the rebels want an independent homeland in the northern and 
eastern districts for tamils who are mostly hindus tamils make up 
18 percent of the population and the predominantly buddhist 
sinhalese account for 75 percent 
military officials say the rebels are killing moslems and 
burning their homes and shops because the tigers suspect them of 
supporting the government 
moslem leaders however say moslems are being killed because 
they are neutral 
the separatists say the sinhalese discriminate against tamils in 
jobs education and the use of the sinhala language the sinhalese 
dominate the government military and police

lawmakers clashed today over a measure to 
restructure the strategic defense initiative within the 1991 
defense bill with one democratic sponsor arguing that the 
amendment gives president bush clear guidance on the program 
in a frantic rush to finish the 289 billion defense bill and 
adjourn for a summer recess the senate tackled the thorny issue of 
sdi commonly known as star wars and the administrations request 
of 47 billion for the program 
the senate armed services committee in approving its bill last 
month trimmed about 1 billion from bushs budget proposal for the 
fiscal year beginning oct 1 
the most contentious issue was an amendment sponsored by sens 
jeff bingaman dnm and richard shelby dala to restructure 
sdi with the emphasis on groundbased systems rather than the 
spacebased brilliant pebbles system now in development 
a key proponent of the program republican sen malcolm wallop 
of wyoming criticized the restructuring measure charging that the 
measure abandons the balance in the program 
but shelby said during the debate that the amendment would 
give the administration clear guidance on the sdi program 
we would be rejecting early deployment of systems that would 
violate the antiballistic missile treaty in favor of a continued 
research program on treatycompliant shortterm options and 
longerterm more effective defenses bingaman said recently 
under the provision the fiscal 1991 budget request for the 
phase 1 program would be cut from 19 billion to 15 billion in 
addition the measure would reduce the proposal for brilliant 
pebbles from 329 million to 129 million 
the amendment comes on the heels of a congressional report that 
found deploying the first phase of sdi in 1993 would be premature 
and fraught with high risk 
the general accounting office the investigative arm of 
congress said in the study that the introduction of the brilliant 
pebbles has drastically changed the sdi systems design leaving it 
in a state of flux 
in january the pentagon incorporated the brilliant pebbles 
concept into phase 1 that technology involves several thousand 
interceptors that would orbit the earth to seek and destroy a 
target by smashing into it at high speeds 
on friday the senate rejected an amendment to cut 130000 
troops including 80000 in europe despite arguments that the cold 
war has ended and the united states faces severe money problems 
the vote was 5940 
in proposing a 307 billion defense bill for fiscal 1991 bush 
called for about 40000 troops to be cut from the 
21millionmember activeduty force the bill before the senate 
would cut troop strength by 100000 including 50000 in europe 
in a speech thursday bush called for a 25 percent reduction in 
troop size over five years about 500000 through 1995 but 
cautioned against drastic reductions in the nations military 
strength overall 
the senate also rejected 5544 an attempt to mothball three of 
the navys four battleships one more than bush proposed in his 
budget

the resignation of the nations highestranking 
black roman catholic clergyman because he was intimate with a woman 
has renewed calls from critics of mandatory priestly celibacy for a 
change in church policy 
atlanta archbishop eugene marino resigned last month because of 
his twoyear relationship with a lay minister vicki r long 
church officials confirmed this week they previously said he 
resigned for health reasons 
ms long 27 has filed a monetary claim against the archdiocese 
for an undisclosed amount 
neither marino nor ms long have commented about their 
relationship bishop james p lyke the acting administrator of the 
atlanta archdiocese would not say whether the relationship was 
sexual describing it only as intimate 
lyke sought to play down any questioning of the church law on 
celibacy which dates from the middle ages i dont think one 
mistake provides an occasion to bring about a discussion of 
celibacy he said 
but advocates for optional celibacy within the church say 
marinos prominence will provoke debate and call the celibacy 
requirement an eroding symbol of church misogyny 
pope john paul ii strongly supports the requirement during his 
1987 visit to the united states he said that a priests love for 
christ must be paramount and is at the foundation of our 
commitment to celibacy this love also makes it possible for us as 
servants of gods kingdom to love our people freely and chastely 
and deeply 
but richard mcbrien chairman of the theology department at the 
university of notre dame does not agree with the churchs stand on 
celibacy 
celibacy is unrealistic and its counterproductive now he 
said 
the priesthood as weve known it is falling apart because 
of a stubborn refusal to change 
mcbrien said about 15 percent of priests have resigned since 
1970 and officials expect seminary applications to decline 40 
percent by the year 2000 
cathy grenier of good tidings a pennsylvania support group for 
women and priests said catholic mandatory celibacy also is a 
feminist issue 
the attitude toward women is that if a priest touches a woman 
hes tainted said mrs grenier who married a former priest 
if women were not believed inherently evil and dirty thered be 
no problem with marrying us 
terrence dosh who runs a national support group for priests who 
later married said marinos stature drew attention to a widely 
disregarded church problem 
in the past 25 years 19000 american roman catholic priests 
resigned and married and 110000 in the world resigned and 
married he said it takes the situation of a bishop to draw 
attention to it 
dosh and mcbrien also said marinos resignation could hurt black 
catholics who make up only 2 million of the 53 million american 
catholics 
any leader of a group who falls theyre catholic hierarchy 
ashamed about it dosh said the people in charge in rome will 
be reluctant to put someone like him in his place 
mcbrien said he feared that people are going to say well he 
is black and they have different sorts of urges and needs 
thats racism of the worst kind but it will be an effort on the 
part of certain figures in the church to gloss it marinos 
resignation over 
lyke who is black said he hoped any racial backlash would be 
minimal 
the church deals with racism internally he said it would 
be a terrible expression of racism if we retreated on our 
progress 
the national conference of catholic bishops last year endorsed a 
national black catholic pastoral plan that calls for integrating 
africanamerican symbols into worship and increasing black 
membership on church policymaking groups 
the number of black catholics in the united states has grown 
from 900000 to 2 million in the past 20 years partly helped by 
immigration from haiti and the west indies 
meanwhile bishop george a stallings of washington dc 
founder of the breakaway africanamerican catholic congregation on 
friday asked marino to join his congregation 
roman catholics intuitively know that archbishop marinos dark 
night of the soul is not a personal failure but a failure on 
the part of the roman catholic church to deal realistically with 
the issue that a call to ordained ministry is not synonymous with 
celibacy stalling said in a statement 
stallings accused last year by a former altar boy of having a 
homosexual affair with him formed his own independent congregation 
and declared new church laws contrary to roman catholic teachings 
his congregation allows birth control optional celibacy for clergy 
and ordination of women 
stallings would like to install marino as an archbishop of his 
new congregations western diocese in los angeles or southern 
diocese in new orleans said stallings spokesman william marshall 
jr

portofspain trinidad ap a moslem zealots attempt to 
overthrow the government and the burning and looting that 
accompanied it have staggered trinidad after three decades of 
stable democracy 
the rebels surrendered wednesday and the sixday coup attempt 
ended with the safe release of the hostages but the casualty toll 
in the assault and subsequent violence was at least 38 dead and 150 
wounded 
now trinidadians face food and gasoline shortages economic 
disruption from a week of paralyzing curfews and the devastation 
left by looters and arsonists 
this racially and ethnically diverse nation known for sun and 
calypso also must deal with tensions created by the violent effort 
to destroy a democracy that has endured since independence from 
britain in 1962 
as a sociologist i know that conflict and crisis can either 
splinter groups or unify them its never inbetween said 
anthony maingot who was born in trinidad and is a caribbean expert 
at florida international university in miami 
the coup attempt by abu bakr leader of a commune of 250 to 350 
moslems began july 27 
bakr and his followers most of whom are poor and black 
attacked police headquarters with explosives and seized prime 
minister nr robinson and other government officials in parliament 
house 
other members of jamaatalmuslimeen simultaneously invaded the 
state television complex a mile away and took employees hostage 
bakrs immediate demands were the prime ministers resignation 
and elections within 90 days 
i dont know that they planned beyond taking red house the 
parliament building said col joe theodore who led the trinidad 
and tobago defense force in the crisis he went in with a 
halfbaked plan 
the sports and culture minister jennifer johnson one of the 
hostages said the rebels were convinced they could improve 
trinidad by establishing a fundamentalist moslem state bakr whose 
newspaper had attacked satanic us and international monetary 
fund economic treatment of trinidad promised to help the poor 
there were no signs of popular support for bakrs attempt to 
overthrow th prime minister 
robinson trails in public opinion polls and elections are due 
next year 
trinidad has had a boomtobust economy over the last 20 years 
tied to the world price of oil its main source of wealth 
the 1970s oil boom brought prosperity and gave trinidadians the 
highest standard of living in the caribbean the bottom fell out of 
the oil market in the 1980s and trinidads gross national product 
the value of all goods and services has dropped 41 percent in 
eight years 
robinson led the new national alliance for reconstruction to a 
landslide in 1986 with promises of recovery ousting the peoples 
national movement which had been in power since colonial days 
he has tried to diversify the economy partly by expanding 
tourism to which the island was largely indifferent during the oil 
boom unpopular austerity measures demanded by the imf in return 
for loans included wage freezes new taxes public employee layoffs 
and devaluations that cut the trinidad dollars value from about 42 
cents to 24 
officials say the economy has shown signs of recovery but that 
robinsons reserved personal style and an unraveling of his 
coalition weakened the government 
there is discontent in the country government spokesman 
gregory shaw said apparently he abu bakr took this as a sign 
that the people were ready to revolt but that is not the way 
trinidadians change government 
much of downtown portofspain was looted prompting 
international assistance that began with food shipments last week 
from venezuela 
tourism and foreign investment are expected to suffer 
we will have to make an effort to win peoples confidence 
shaw said 
there were signs of strained ethnic relations during the 
violence looters shouted epihets at arab store owners and moslems 
were the targets of anger 
most of trinidads 13 million people are hindu or christian 
each representing more than 40 percent moslems make up about 6 
percent and among them east indians outnumber the blacks 20 to 1 
many east indians scorn black moslems as a sect outside the 
mainstream islamic community an attitude resented by the bakr and 
his followers 
confidence in robinsons government could be undermined by the 
fact that such a small group was able to cripple the nation 
abu bakrs sect had been involved in court cases and with 
police it was under surveillance and police spokesman winston 
cooper said the libyan connection was established 
authorities say sect members received money and training from 
libya although there is no evidence moammar gadhafi libyas 
leader was linked to the coup attempt 
raffique shah managing editor of the mirror said he hoped 
other wouldbe rescuers of trinidad would learn from bakrs attempt 
and see the futility of such action 
as the week ended turmoil in another land offered some hope to 
trinidad the iraqi invasion of kuwait pushed oil prices up

the senate today pushed toward completion of a 
289 billion defense plan for next year the last item standing in 
the way of its summer vacation 
the senators were eager to follow their house colleagues who 
adjourned early this morning until after labor day 
before leaving the house passed major civil rights legislation 
opposed by president bush and a democraticsponsored campaign 
finance overhaul as lawmakers rushed for the doors the house also 
sent to the president a longawaited bill designed to cut down on 
offshore oil spills 
the senate held its unusual saturday session on the defense bill 
rather than coming back to work next week 
in a marathon friday session which ended in the early morning 
hours today the senate passed an emergency debt bill and despite 
the invasion of kuwait by iraq that began wednesday the senate 
also early today approved by voice vote and without debate the 
nomination of edward w gnehm to be us ambassador to kuwait 
the civil rights act of 1990 passed the house by a strong 
272154 vote after democrats beat back an administrationbacked 
attempt to water down the antidiscrimination bill 
the bill similar to a version passed earlier by the senate 
would overturn the effects of five supreme court rulings that have 
gone against the policy of affirmative action 
the most controversial provisions in the bill would make it 
easier for victims of discrimination to use statistics to win 
lawsuits against employers for punitive damages 
bush in a letter to house minority leader bob michel rill 
said the legislation would have the effect of forcing businesses 
to adopt quotas in hiring and promotion 
it will also foster divisiveness and litigation rather than 
conciliation and do more to promote legal fees than civil rights 
bush said 
but the chairman of the house judiciary committee rep jack 
brooks dtexas said weakening those provisions would rip the 
heart out of the bill 
the house and senate must agree on a single version of the 
legislation before it could be sent to bushs desk while making a 
veto threat the president left himself open to what he called a 
sound practical compromise 
there was little spirit of compromise when the house democratic 
leadership pushed through its partys version of a campaign finance 
package 
after nearly nine hours of raucous partisan battle the 
democrats pushed aside proposals from both republicans and from 
within their own party and prevailed 255155 
the democratic bill would limit house campaign spending to 
715000 per candidate and limit campaign contributions from 
political action committees or pacs to half of a candidates the 
total spending ceiling 
smalldonor pacs primarily labor unions could continue 
contributing up to 10000 per candidate 5000 each for the 
primary and general elections 
however pacs that raise more than 240 a year from an 
individual primarily those organized by corporate executives 
could contribute only 2000 per candidate 
while it has no public financing as some democrats favored the 
bill would establish a 50 tax credit for small donors 
the republican alternative rejected 241169 had no spending 
ceilings but would cut allowable contributions from special 
interest political action committees and ban pacs set up by some 
house members to further their own house careers 
before adjourning the house also 
sent the president a bill making permanent the dutyfree status 
of imports from 24 caribbean and central american nations 
including nicaragua and panama the bill also would restrict 
exports of raw us timber 
gave final congressional passage to a bill boosting the 
liability of shippers for the cost of cleaning up oil spills and 
requiring new tankers to have leakresistant double hulls it would 
also require the government to check for drunken automobile driving 
offenses before issuing licenses to tanker operators 
approved by voice vote a plan to provide more than 4 billion 
over five years to help communities hardest hit by aids 
the house on friday and the senate early today passed an 
emergency bill giving the treasury 72 billion in additional 
borrowing authority through oct 2 the bill was needed to avert a 
default as longterm action to increase the national debt has been 
bottled up while congress and the white house work out a budget 
deal 
the senate today planned to finish its defense bill but first 
a long debate is scheduled over how much money should be spent on 
the strategic defense initiative the star wars defense program 
during debate which lasted into this morning the senate 
rejected a proposal to increase by 30000 the 100000 troop cut 
already in the bill bush had proposed only a 40000 cut 
the senate also debated but then set aside an amendment to 
allow abortions in military hospitals for personnel and their 
dependents willing to pay for the procedure

saudi arabia has been subdued in its 
reaction to iraqs invasion of kuwait which places iraqi forces 
near the oilrich kingdoms border 
oil executives said saudi arabia has not and will not take the 
most potent action possible against iraq closing the pipeline 
that carries iraqi oil for export across saudi arabia to the red 
sea 
the executives said the saudis believe this would give iraqs 
belligerent president saddam hussein an excuse to attack and 
occupy saudi oil fields 150 miles south of kuwait giving iraq 
control of more oil than any other country in the world 
the only direct saudi statement since the invasion was made by 
an anonymous government spokesman through the official saudi press 
agency the day after the iraqi move 
the statement said saudi arabia was following the kuwait 
situation with extreme concern and that king fahd would be 
seeking to calm the situation and to find a solution in a manner 
ensuring the interests of all the statement did not condemn the 
invasion 
the only tangible help saudi arabia gave the kuwaiti government 
in the wake of the invasion was to shelter members of the ruling 
family including the emir sheik jaber alahmed alsabah and the 
crown prince both nations are tightly run by royal families and 
have been close allies 
the saudis also allowed the kuwaiti royal family to briefly 
operate a radio reportedly from a mobile van in the area around 
the saudikuwait border 
but friday the radio went off the air after a desperate call 
the people of kuwait appeal to you oh brethren oh arabs oh 
beloved brothers oh moslems rush rush to their help 
it was not known if the radio had been discovered by the iraqis 
or shut down by the saudis to avoid provoking saddam at a time when 
fears were being expressed that he might invade saudi arabia as 
well 
saudi arabia borders kuwait and iraqs invasion forces were 
reportedly near the saudi border 
the saudis did condemned the invasion as part of a joint 
statement issued by the gulf cooperation council in which it is 
allied with kuwait the united arab emirates qatar oman and 
bahrain 
the six states issued a statement saying we strongly condemn 
and are very sorry for this attack that one arab state took against 
another arab state we do not recognize anything resulting from 
it 
iraqs 1millionmember armed forces is clearly too much for the 
joint 3000member gulf cooperation council force or saudi arabias 
65700member army 
saudi arabia was also one of the 14 members of the 21member 
arab league that condemned the invasion in the same terms as the 
gulf cooperation council 
the arab league with onethird of its members voting against 
the resolution or abstaining was clearly unable to take any direct 
action 
turkey has also refused to take action and has not commented 
about president bushs suggestion that it cut off iraqs oil 
pipeline to the mediterranean two parallel pipelines pump iraqi 
crude oil to a terminal at yumurtalik at the eastern corner of 
turkeys mediterranean coast and constitute iraqs major oil export 
outlet

the 12 nations of the european community voted today 
to impose an embargo on imports of oil from iraq and kuwait and to 
suspend arms sales to iraq to protest baghdads invasion of its 
oilrich neighbor an official said 
the decision was taken during a meeting of senior ec foreign 
ministry officials in rome called by italy the current ec 
president said foreign ministry spokesman giovanni castellaneta 
he said the sanctions were designed to pressure iraq into an 
immediate unconditional withdrawal of its forces from kuwait 
the ec nations also voted to end cooperation with iraq in the 
military technical and scientific fields according to a 
communique 
in 1989 oil from both iraq and kuwait accounted for 109 
percent of the ecs total imports within the ec denmark is the 
most dependent on oil from the two countries importing 54 percent 
of its oil from them 
the united states has also imposed an embargo on iraqi oil 
included in a decree issued thursday that blocked all imports from 
iraq and froze kuwaiti and iraqi assets in the united states 
the action by the ec whose members include france west 
germany italy luxembourg belgium netherlands denmark greece 
ireland portugal spain and the united kingdom was the latest 
of many taken against baghdad 
in the middle east europe and the united states friday intense 
diplomatic activity was under way to pressure iraqi president 
saddam hussein to pull the estimated 100000 troops he initially 
sent into the oilrich shiekdom and any other reinforcements that 
may have been deployed 
britain announced it was sending two frigates to join the hms 
york in the persian gulf and france said it would station a second 
warship in the waterway the pentagon said a third aircraft carrier 
was being readied to head to the middle east to bolster the 
eightship us navy presence already there 
the ec statement issued today condemned the brutal iraqi 
invasion and described as groundless and unacceptable iraqs 
justification for the military action iraq claimed that it invaded 
at the invitation of unidentified rebels it said had already 
overthrown kuwaits government 
the statement said the ec was also suspending iraqs trade 
preference status which gives nations duty free access for 
manufactured goods the move is aimed at denying iraq trade 
advantages for its petrochemical exports 
senior foreign ministry officials said appropriate measures 
would be taken to freeze iraqi assets the statement did not 
elaborate although many ec nations have already frozen iraqi or 
kuwaiti assets or both 
protests against the iraqi invasion grew friday with 
condemnations from the organization of african unity china india 
tunisia and zimbabwe 
the united states and soviet union made an unprecedented joint 
condemnation of iraq and called on all countries to cut off 
baghdads arms supply

iii and soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze in moscow on 
friday 
the soviet union iraqs major arms supplier cut off shipments 
thursday 
france and italy suspended arms exports to iraq and 
czechoslovakia cut off all shipments that could serve a military 
purpose 
chinese foreign minister qian qichen hinted today that his 
country would not impose sanctions against iraq 
the issue should be solved within the scope of interarab 
relations the official xinhua news agency paraphrased qian as 
saying 
at nato headquarters in brussels belgium the united states 
alerted its allies that iraq may have designs beyond kuwait and 
said it has drawn up contingency plans of action to respond to 
that eventuality an alliance source speaking on condition of 
anonymity said friday 
he referred to reports that iraqi sources were massing near 
kuwaits border with saudi arabia he did not however say what 
those plans were

when hiroshima remembers the atom bomb 
it is with a flock of doves and a mournful tolling of bells on the 
central monument to the bomb victims is a prayer that this evil 
shall never be repeated 
fortyfive years after the united states dropped the first 
atomic bomb hiroshima continues to lay the grim realities of 
nuclear war before the world 
in japan most remembrances of the aug 6 1945 bombing focus on 
the horrors of the atom bomb and the 140000 deaths it caused and 
rarely on the responsibility of the warring nations 
when hiroshima began refurbishing its peace memorial museum last 
year 16 groups of citizens bomb victims and labor unions demanded 
the city include an aggressors corner that would focus on 
japans aggressive role in world war ii 
city officials refused in a written statement the city quoted 
former prime minister noboru takeshita who said in 1988 that it 
was unclear that japan was an aggressor in world war ii 
the purpose of this museum is to bear witness to what happened 
on august 6th in hiroshima said yoshitaka kawamoto president of 
the museum 
the museums exhibits say the atomic attack was aimed at 
civilians 
if we had a display about japans aggressive role people will 
think it is natural for aggressors to be atombombed said toru 
kataoka manager of the peace culture center which is housed in 
one of three major buildings at the peace park it opposes our 
basic policy on the museum which is to pray for the victims 
more than 20000 of those victims were koreans brought here as 
slave laborers during japans 35year colonization of the 
neighboring korean peninsula 
they have seldom been recognized 
when south koreans built a monument in 1970 to honor their 
countrymen who died in the blast city officials said there was no 
room in the peace memorial park citing the 20 monuments there 
already 
the koreans kept up their pressure and in may the city relented 
in hiroshima the citys efforts to preserve the horrific 
experience continue last year the city collected more than 25 
million in public donations to preserve the atombomb dome the 
hulking skeletal remnants of a building left standing near the 
center of the blast 
preserving the dome is important because its ravaged state 
sounds a warning about the potential for humanity to destroy itself 
with nuclear weapons mayor takeshi araki said last year 
most japanese observe the anniversary of the atomic bombings 
mournfully adding names to lists of those who have died in the 
past year due to the continuing effects of radiation or other 
injuries 
this year the victims will also be honored in the united states 
at a desert ceremony west of salt lake city later this month 
members of the squadron that dropped the bomb on hiroshima will 
dedicate a 16foot obelisk honoring their bomber group and all 
who contributed to bring this dreadful war to an end 
the group will also honor those who died in the blast at 
hiroshima and at nagasaki where a second atom bomb was dropped 
three days after the bombing of hiroshima 
japan surrendered six days after the atomic bombing of nagasaki 
ending world war ii

half a million homeless victims of the 
iranian earthquake are threatened by food shortages and the frigid 
weather about to descend on northern iran 
the quake june 21 killed 40000 people and injured 60000 in 
gilan and zanjan provinces where temperatures sometimes drop to 
zero in winter 
housing the refugees before then is the governments main 
priority abdollah nouri the iranian interior minister said last 
week 
nouri said on iranian television a parliamentary committee 
estimated more than 200000 houses would have to be built 
eventually then added in about two months we have to provide 
temporary shelters for the homeless 
relief efforts clearly have been inadequate the government 
already burdened by reconstruction needs after an eightyear war 
with iraq is short of cash equipment and materials 
the interior minister acknowledged that we cannot build what 
we want given the means at our disposal 
each homeless family will be given a limited amount of 
construction materials and technical support to build a shelter of 
about 10by13 feet to get through the winter nouri said 
he emphasized that the refugees would have to build the shelters 
themselves more than 100000 people now live in tents 
an asian diplomat based in tehran who visited the stricken 
areas to deliver truckloads of aid sent by his government told the 
associated press construction of the shelters had not yet begun 
he said reconstruction was in a bureaucratic tangle and it 
appeared doubtful that enough shelters could be built before 
winter he spoke on condition of anonymity 
tehran radio said construction of the shelters and repair of 
damaged houses involved five different ministries 
heavy winter snows and frigid temperatures are the rule in gilan 
and zanjan provinces 
manjil a gilan town in one of the worsthit areas is so windy 
that residents customarily spend winters in nearhibernation to 
escape the cold 
at a recent prayer meeting in rudbar a devastated town in gilan 
province friday prayer leader hojatoleslam vahedi urged 
authorities to rush construction of temporary housing 
the earthquake struck a rich agricultural area in midharvest 
survivors worry about facing winter with their crops ungathered and 
food scarce relief workers have been helping with the harvest 
vaccinating cattle and rebuilding irrigation canals 
a report on tehran radio said farmers would be paid higher 
prices for their crops this year 
nouri said on television that rebuilding schools before the new 
academic year starts in september was another priority he urged 
people to provide what help they could in rebuilding or repairing 
about 1200 structures 
more than 400 aftershocks some of them strong shook the two 
provinces after the june 21 quake the most recent was recorded 
july 19 
the tremors have caused panic among survivors and made it 
difficult for them to patch their damaged homes 
president hashemi rafsanjani toured the area after the quake and 
said all the people are anxious they cannot live in the damaged 
houses as they rightly cannot feel safe there 
tehran radio said power and water had been restored to the main 
towns in the quake area roads were being repaired and crews were 
working to restore services to 1500 affected villages 
parliament revised the current budget to allocate 300 million 
for the victims 
outside aid in the form of cash food tents medicine and 
clothing totaled 84 million from 45 countries the un disaster 
relief organization reported 
seifollah dastjerdi head of irans red crescent society said 
only 25 million of the total was in cash he also said the 
recommended use dates on many donated medicines had expired or were 
about to do so 
iran surprised some observers by accepting 760000 worth of 
supplies from the united states which its officials call the 
great satan

claude buckner sat with his two dogs in 
the shade of his little weatherbeaten house and shook his head at 
the trucks that rumbled by on the road in front of his yard 
apparently his nextdoor neighbor legendary rock n roller 
chuck berry was having more asphalt work done 
they must be going to blacktop the whole farm joked 
buckner 81 a retired farmer who sees most of the comings and 
goings on buckner road named for his grandfather 
neighbors like buckner say they see little of the intensely 
private berry who first hit the radio airwaves in 1955 with 
maybellene and later with such early rock n roll hits as 
johnny b goode roll over beethoven and sweet little 
sixteen 
the 63yearold berry still performs today but now hes in the 
spotlight for a different reason drug and child abuse charges 
its not the first time berry has been in trouble with the law 
in 1944 when berry was 18 he was sent to a missouri prison after 
being convicted of armed robbery in 1960 he was convicted of 
illegally transporting a 14yearold girl across state lines for 
immoral purposes some of his defenders said he was charged because 
he is black and the girl was white 
this time st charles county authorities say they found 
marijuana and films of nude girls under 17 at his compound berry 
park about three miles south of wentzville authorities accuse 
berry of making the films himself 
on monday berry returned from a european tour and turned 
himself in posted the required 10 percent of 20000 bond and was 
released he has not yet entered a formal plea but he has denied 
the charges 
people in wentzville say berry famous for his guitar style and 
stooped duck walk keeps a low profile 
weve been out here almost 20 years said neighbor ed 
garwood a 79yearold retired real estate salesman never seen 
the guy 
berry park is roughly 150 acres separated from buckner road by 
a 7foot chainlink fence that runs alongside the road for about a 
mile 
neighbors say berry has bought up houses along the road to 
extend the compound through the years he paves the driveways and 
puts up the same fence some of the places are rented out others 
are empty 
a granite cemetery monument marks the main gate the words 
berry park founded aug 15 1957 and the names of family 
members are chiseled in keith richards of the rolling stones and 
eric clapton have visited there 
in town which is about 40 miles west of st louis berrys name 
gets mixed reaction 
george ehll calls him a friend 
ehll is the manager of the western auto and the chief of the 
volunteer fire department which has been called out to fight grass 
fires at berry park last year they were called to a fire that 
destroyed berrys recording studio 
he comes in here occasionally ehll said from behind the 
counter at his store i think everybody realizes who he is but i 
dont think they blow it out of proportion 
other people remember that berry used to have parties and 
concerts at berry park in the 1970s 
he used to have some hellacious parties out there said 
capt tom neer of the st charles county sheriffs department 
hippies said buckner they tore up everything you 
couldnt get up the road 
linda baker 31 grew up on the other side of the woods behind 
berry park as a teenager she could hear the parties but her 
mother wouldnt let her go 
as a bartender baker has served berry orange juice a time or 
two he doesnt drink alcoholic beverages she said and thats why 
she was surprised when she heard about the charges against him 
he just seemed like another person baker said from behind 
the bar at just plain country a dimly lit tavern i was real 
surprised what happened kind of disappointed 
the charges stem from a raid in june by local drug agents at 
berry park an informant had told officials that berry had received 
a large amount of cocaine 
authorities found no cocaine but they said they did turn up 
several plastic bags of marijuana some hashish two 22caliber 
rifles and a shotgun plus 122000 and various pornographic 
videotapes slides and books 
berry has other trouble too 
last december a former cook at his southern air restaurant in 
wentzville sued him alleging he made videotapes of her and other 
women as they dressed undressed and used the toilet in the womens 
restroom there 
earlier this summer a classaction lawsuit was filed against 
him on behalf of 200 other women 
berrys attorney wayne t schoeneberg said the charges and 
suits have caused berry to lose some bookings 
i think theres a certain element of people who are offended 
at any mention of drugs or sex schoeneberg said its a tough 
charge even if youre acquitted people always want to think the 
worst 
i think chuck berry is a man who basically wants to be left 
alone who has tried not to bother anybody and for some reason 
unknown to me people seem to resent that

diplomats planned a weekend of private 
talks on sanctions the united states wants imposed if iraq fails to 
withdraw troops from kuwait 
we are in a state of consultation which is the preparatory 
stage of moving to sanctions and we will keep our eye on the 
process going on to bring peace and a settlement to the area 
us ambassador thomas pickering told reporters friday night 
a us official briefing reporters on condition of anonymity 
said the us government might call for an emergency meeting of the 
un security council during the weekend to seek adoption of a 
resolution on sanctions 
iraq said it invaded kuwait thursday to provide security for a 
provisional government that had overthrown kuwaits rulers the 
international community dismissed the claim 
on friday an iraqi government spokesman said all troops in 
kuwait will be withdrawn according to a timetable beginning 
sunday according to an official radio broadcast 
but moves to put more international pressure on iraq continued 
at the united nations 
earlier friday pickering said members of the security council 
showed strong interest in usproposed measures to punish iraq 
for defying a council resolution demanding an unconditional 
withdrawal of troops from neighboring kuwait 
the resolution approved by the 15member security council 
following the iraqi invasion also called for immediate negotiations 
between iraq and kuwait 
the resolution raised the prospect of a punitive un response 
by saying the council would meet again if necessary to consider 
further steps to ensure compliance in un parlance that means 
the council is prepared to impose sanctions if the demands of the 
resolution are not met 
pickering said the united states seeks sweeping sanctions 
covering economic trade financial and military aspects the 
military measures would include an embargo on arms military 
supplies training and equipment but would not cover the 
possibility of deploying un or international troops to force iraq 
to withdraw from kuwait 
the security council rarely imposes sanctions but improved 
ussoviet relations increase the possibility that the five 
permanent members the united states soviet union britain 
france and china would work together to punish iraq 
but diplomats speaking privately said china was not supporting 
the proposed sanctions as one of the five permanent council 
members it has veto power 
in moscow the united states and the soviet union issued a joint 
statement friday that said both countries sought immediate 
compliance with the un resolution in response to the iraqi 
invasion 
the un charter provides that the security council may call 
upon members to impose sanctions including economic sanctions and 
interruption of travel and communications and severing diplomatic 
relations 
in extreme cases the council may employ blockades and military 
operations by the air sea or land forces of un members 
the council last threatened sanctions in 1987 aiming to bring 
about a ceasefire in the 198088 iraniraq war 
the current nonpermanent members of the security council are 
yemen romania cuba canada colombia ivory coast ethiopia 
finland malaysia and zaire

robert mapplethorpe stirred national attention 
with sexually explicit photographs but without the controversy 
would his work be regarded as one boston columnist sees it so 
mediocre woolworths wouldnt carry it 
art dealer robert klein is among many who rank mapplethorpe a 
lot higher than that he had that feeling from the first 
photographs he saw 
i remember thinking they were very elegant he said cool 
elegant highly polished photographs and down and dirty thats the 
way his career ran 
but the reviews of mapplethorpe are often mixed he is cited as 
making breakthroughs in his picture selection and as a fine 
technician and beautiful framer but he is faulted most often for 
providing pictures that are oddly too pretty 
a show of his work robert mapplethorpe the perfect moment 
opened at the institute of contemporary art in boston on wednesday 
the show which runs through oct 4 ends a national tour that 
resulted in an obscenity indictment in cincinnati 
the show is a retrospective that mapplethorpe helped put 
together shortly before he died of aids last year at age 42 the 
124 photographs are mainly portraits and pictures of flowers but 
about a quarter of them are sexually graphic 
roberts sensibility is not only in the work but also in the 
selection of the work robert is someone who was very involved in 
the details in aesthetic points said david ross the icas 
director 
he agrees with the many critics who say mapplethorpes prints 
are technically exquisite 
he transcended the fact of what he was supposed to photograph 
and added an essence of his own the flower studies are really 
amazing said sylvia wolf an assistant curator of photography at 
the art institute of chicago you dont even have to see his 
nudes because if you look at the flowers you can really sense his 
nudes behind him the calla lilies just drip and droop 
there are very few photographers who would emphasize print 
quality and robert was one of those agreed marvin heiferman a 
freelance curator and critic in new york 
but the choice in subject matter itself is an artistic decision 
and mapplethorpes inclusion of homosexual and sadomasochistic acts 
in his photographs pushed at the bounds of whats taboo said 
heiferman 
his contribution is the admission of that kind of subject 
matter people think nothing of a female nude he added robert 
photographed male genitalia just like he photographed anything 
else 
kay larson writing in new york magazine pointed to a 
provocative photograph of weight lifter lisa lyon a favorite 
mapplethorpe subject and said 
unlike pornography which prefers to keep its taboos firmly in 
place the better to violate them this image coolly aims a 
shotgun at the cultural prohibition against selfarousal the 
picture is riveting because of its utter candor 
even in such photographs mapplethorpes classical sensibilities 
are detectable ross said 
some of his last photographs were of black male nudes in simple 
poses with taut muscles and gleaming almost metalliclooking skin 
and ross described mapplethorpe as a formalist citing the 
photographers statements that he would have been a sculptor if he 
had lived 100 years ago 
mapplethorpes work is really very mainstream very classical 
in some ways he said he uses the camera as if its still the 
1870s 
it is exactly on those grounds that freelance photography 
critic ad coleman sharply criticizes mapplethorpe 
thats a very simplistic use of photography to use the 
camera simply as a recording device he said in a telephone 
interview from his home in staten island 
i consider him to be a minor photographer and i dont think he 
would have a significant place in the history of photography 
without the controversy and im not sure he will with it he 
added the flower studies are warmedover pictorialism 
doug ischar a freelance critic who teaches photography at the 
university of illinois scored mapplethorpes work as nothing more 
than beautiful design 
i dont think its important artwork in terms of the art of 
the 20th century he said its very conservative in a way 
hes an imitation of andy warhol hes a success but he didnt 
make the sort of aesthetic breakthroughs that warhol did 
asked what impact mapplethorpe would have on history coleman 
replied i dont see a thought there so i dont know how i would 
recognize any influence mapplethorpe may have had what he had 
was a willingness and an opportunity to address a sort of subject 
matter

the soviet press unleashed harsh criticism 
saturday against iraq and its leader saddam hussein calling 
moscows old ally a totalitarian regime and calling the attack 
on kuwait a blitzkrieg 
while press accounts did not criticize saddam by name they did 
refer negatively to baghdads rulers and regretted that soviet 
weaponry was used to satisfy the ambitious designs of 
nearsighted politicians 
moscow and baghdad have had a friendship treaty since 1972 and 
the soviet union is iraqs major arms supplier 
since iraqs invasion of kuwait on thursday however the soviet 
union has cut off weapons supplies to iraq and demanded that 
baghdad pull its troops out of kuwait 
the nation the soviet union has praised in the past for its 
peaceloving foreign policy was slammed in the media saturday 
for its brutal aggression and hegemonistic foreign policy 
iraqi blitzkrieg was the headline atop a commentary in the 
rabochaya tribuna workers tribune newspaper using the word that 
described nazi germanys lightning war half a century ago 
in a nation that lost millions of people in world war ii the 
naziera reference carries a deeply negative meaning 
the issue of aggression had been decided long before on a 
dark southern night wrote the newspapers vladimir mikhailov 
the guns barked the bombers took off the tanks ripped into the 
border of kuwait while talks were under way the stamp of 
soldiers boots could be heard from iraq 
iraqs leaders were convinced their aggression would go 
unpunished he wrote 
striking a sympathetic tone toward kuwait mikhailov asked 
what kind of adversary is it whose total troops including 
police are less than 20000 whose territory is 25 times smaller 
than iraqs and whose population is less than half of baghdads 
its logical from the point of view of a totalitarian 
regime he said 
a shumilin writing in the communist partys youth newspaper 
komsomolskaya pravda said this act of unprecedented aggression 
should be regarded as yet another manifestation of the frankly 
hegemonist policy of baghdad in the region 
its to be regretted that the soviet weaponry which comprises 
the backbone of iraqs military is being used for fanning regional 
conflicts for the sake of satisfying ambitious designs of 
nearsighted politicians he said 
the newspaper sovietskaya rossiya also referred to the 
hegemonistic nature of the iraqi leaderships foreign policy over 
the past decade 
while the communist party newspaper pravda did not carry a 
commentary critical of iraq it did provide candid accounts of the 
attack 
it said iraqs invading army included tens of thousands of 
troops and hundreds of tanks and warplanes according to 
preliminary reports some 200 kuwaiti people were killed including 
sheikh fahd alsabah one of the emirs brothers who took part in 
the defense of the monarchs palace 
similarly the official soviet news agency tass reprinted a 
report from an egyptian newspaper that saddam personally ordered 
the execution of 120 iraqi officers on friday for saying the 
invasion was a crime 
mikhailov in the workers tribune also described the iraqi 
invasion as a crime 
the events are tragic but we have confirmation that the world 
has changed he wrote 
look at the immediate reaction from the un security council 
look at the measures taken against iraq by the rest of the world 
look at the extremely negative reaction of the international 
community 
this leaves us hope for the future mikhailov said

it was business as usual for most 
shipping in the persian gulf but usflagged tankers were moving 
warily saturday depending on the us navy for guidance 
eight us warships are inside the waterway gulf shipping 
executives said the warships were operating normally but added 
that they had cut down on their radio communications 
the us warships are just not talking as much as usual and 
not identifying themselves said one shipping executive who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
a shipping executive at the bustling port of dubai said there 
is no tension all is normal but the american vessels are being 
cautious 
another executive reached at ras tanura the main saudi oil 
loading terminal about 125 miles south of the kuwaiti borders said 
there is no problem absolutely loading and unloading is normal 
two of the five kuwaiti tankers which still fly the us flag 
suspended their journeys to kuwait after iraqs thursday invasion 
of kuwait 
kuwait reregistered 11 tankers to fly the us flag at the 
height of the iraqiran war to entitle them to us navy protection 
saturday the kittanning a us tanker was overheard by radio 
monitors in the region asking the us navy whether it should 
continue to the saudi arabian port of ras tanura 
the operator on the american warship which was not identified 
said he would check within 10 minutes he came back to advise the 
kittanning no problem continue 
scores of oil tankers were destroyed during the last few years 
of the eightyear iraniraq war which ended in 1988 iran and iraq 
attacked some 550 vessels of various nationalities during the war 
in an effort to cut off shipping to the opposing side

the jurors in mayor marion barrys drug and 
perjury trial asked for all government and defense exhibits today 
as they continued weighing the mayors fate 
in six weeks of testimony prosecutors introduced more than 100 
pieces of evidence barrys attorneys produced almost 60 documents 
the jurors request came after us district judge thomas 
penfield jackson revealed friday that the jurors can release 
verdicts on a piecemeal basis one count at a time 
the jury of nine women and three men planned a halfday of 
deliberations today deliberations began thursday 
meanwhile barry shrugged off questions about his trial friday 
while jurors were deliberating his fate 
i feel fantastic he said after addressing a group of city 
youth leaders asked whether he was encouraged by the way his trial 
had gone he said im encouraged by these young people here 
the threeterm mayor refused to answer other questions about his 
legal situation 
the jurors meanwhile apparently were unaware of a botched drug 
sting at their suburban maryland hotel thursday night that targeted 
an associate of the late university of maryland basketball star len 
bias 
like a scene from a movie the futile sting operation involved 
helicopters search dogs and an escape car ramming police cruisers 
authorities said the drug sting was aimed at brian tribble a 
friend of bias who died in june 1986 of cocaine poisoning a day 
after signing with the boston celtics of the national basketball 
association 
peter gruden special agent in charge of the federal drug 
enforcement administrations washington field office said he was 
pretty sure that it was not known by the dea that the barry 
jury was sequestered at the hotel 
the identity of the jurys hotel throughout the twomonth trial 
had not been made public 
tribble was lured to the hotel to purchase cocaine but fled as 
authorities moved in officials said an associate was taken into 
custody and faced arraignment on drug possession charges 
tribble drove off rammed two police vehicles blocking his 
escape drove back to the hotel and fled into a wooded area said 
prince georges county md police 
in a brief court session on an unrelated matter barrys chief 
lawyer r kenneth mundy said he wants a representation on the 
record that the jurors werent aware of the incident operation 
judge jackson agreed and said i was assured by the us 
marshals service which provides court security that our jurors 
were oblivious to the sting mundy pointed out that someone would 
have had to ask them a question about the sting to ensure the 
jurors were unaware of it 
they may have been aware there was a commotion said 
jackson who then agreed to include such an assurance in the court 
record 
one of the cocaine possession charges barry faces stems from his 
jan 18 arrest in an fbi sting operation at a downtown washington 
hotel 
after speaking to the teenagers at the youth forum barry met 
with top staff members and cabinet officials in his office it was 
the first time the mayor had visited city hall without having to 
rush back to the federal courthouse since jury selection in his 
trial began june 4 
barry was tried on 10 misdemeanor cocaine possession charges 
one misdemeanor conspiracy count and three felony charges of lying 
to a grand jury about his drug use 
after closing arguments in the case thursday he predicted he 
would be acquitted completely 
the jury on friday asked for complete sets of the 32page 
instruction booklet read thursday by jackson and later asked to 
look at a chart listing the month and year that government 
witnesses have testified that they used drugs with barry 
the panel also requested a copy of a form in which one witness 
agreed to cooperate with the government

voters will decide tuesday whether to 
add 10 a year to the average property tax bill to put the big 
cats apes and other animals at the city zoo into better housing 
opponents say the money would be better spent on people 
friends of the kansas city zoo want to double the zoos size 
providing large open habitats that would allow animals to roam 
together as they do in the wild they say the zoo is substandard 
and needs renovating to ensure better care for the animals they 
also say the plan would help with sagging attendance 
critics particularly some black groups say the tax money is 
needed to combat more immediate problems like drugs crime 
substandard housing and lack of health care for the poor 
opponents also say higherincome taxpayers in the suburbs should 
pay for zoo improvements they will enjoy as much as the people of 
kansas city 
the 50 million bond issue to finance the proposal will require 
57 percent of the votes cast tuesday and both sides are predicting 
a close election 
its just a low priority right now especially when youre 
talking about public funds said the rev nelson thompson of the 
black agenda group we feel its an undue burden its an 
untimely proposition 
opponents also say the expansion would displace popular 
gathering areas in swope park one of the largest municipal parks 
in the country 
the planners didnt sit down with the various neighborhood 
residents thompson said it appears as though we have an 
adversarial role but actually if we were consulted before the 
fact then we wouldnt have come out against the plan the way we 
have 
some critics say its the wrong time to add to city tax bills 
residents of the school district soon are likely to pay a property 
tax increase for teacher salaries that tax hike has been approved 
by a federal judge in the citys school desegregation case and 
awaits action by the school board 
the zoo bonds would add about 10 a year to the average kansas 
city homeowners property tax bill 
the current zoo is not a distinguished one said albert p 
mauro president of friends of the zoo a nonprofit booster group 
its just on the border of meeting its regulatory requirements 
its close to having to spend a lot of money just to stay open 
the bond issue would provide the money needed to double the 
81yearold zoo to 160 acres and increase the number of species 
from 168 to 263 the plan calls for completing the expansion by 
1994 
new african and australian exhibits would let several species 
interact as they do in their natural habitats the 90acre african 
section envisions safarilike tram canoe and land rover rides 
overlooking forest grassland and water habitats 
the visitors will suspend their disbelief said bob 
berkebile main architect of the master plan they will think 
they are in africa even though they know they are not 
planners want to boost educational functions of the zoo with a 
starttofinish theme of conservation an entrance pavilion would 
acquaint visitors with animals they are about to see an exit 
pavilion would teach viewers what steps humans can take to save 
endangered creatures 
our assumption is unless we change our actions we humans 
will be the next endangered species berkebile said we believe 
we are immersing the visitor in a complete experience

iraqs conquest of kuwait is expected to 
produce political realignments in much of the arab world reinforce 
us ties with israel and threaten the economies of oilpoor 
countries far removed from the persian gulf experts say 
while the full impact of the iraqi action is difficult to 
measure there was almost unanimous agreement that the events of 
this past week probably have made an arabisraeli accommodation 
more remote than at any time in the past generation 
they also have raised the possibility at least that two iraqi 
foes in the region syria and iran could be encouraged to seek 
more cooperative relationships with the united states and other 
western countries both appear to have few other options 
three days after the invasion the political fallout was 
uncertain partly because no one is quite sure what iraq meant on 
friday when it said the invading force will be withdrawn beginning 
sunday 
the main concern in the united states is saudi arabia and 
whether iraq either through force or intimidation will attempt to 
impose its will on that strategic gulf state president bush has 
declared saudi arabia a vital interest for the united states 
and warned that he would not acquiesce in an iraqi takeover of the 
kingdom 
under some worst case projections iraqi domination of the opec 
oil cartel could shoot prices from the present 2450 into the 
40plus range wreaking havoc in oil importing countries 
everywhere especially the third world 
these were the countries which suffered the greatest hardship 
from opec price increases in the 1970s alternatively bush has 
said that sharp curtailment of supplies would have a devastating 
effect on the free world 
the iraqi invasion occurred at a time of widespread complacency 
in international relations an attitude spawned by the success of 
the united states and the soviet union in easing tensions after 
more than 40 years of high stakes rivalry 
the brookings institutes judith kipper believes the 
sovietamerican accommodation actually enhances the possibility for 
regional flareups such as the one in the gulf 
this is the first postcold war crisis she said with the 
end of eastwest competition little countries can act with 
impunity 
while many experts consider iraqi domination of arab politics 
especially oil politics likely leonard spector of the carnegie 
endowment believes that outcome can be avoided 
a combination of economic and military pressure by the west and 
by gulf countries might be enough to tame president saddam 
husseins ambitions spector said 
right now he looks unstoppable spector said he could be 
stoppable in 10 days each country pursuing its interests 
individually could restore the power balance 
saddam would appear to be most vulnerable to a show of western 
military power widespread international adherence to an embargo of 
iraqi oil loss of access to oil pipelines through neighboring 
turkey and saudi arabia and to soviet military spare parts 
the soviets have been iraqs main military supplier but 
announced a cutoff thursday after the invasion bush said friday 
that the possibility of turkey closing the iraqi pipeline will be 
an option im certain 
without decisive action saddam almost certainly will be able to 
call the shots in the gulf 
i think if everybody trembles and fall then obviously hes 
going to move on said shireen hunter of the center for strategic 
and international studies 
gary sick a former national security council aide warned that 
saddam left unchecked could become the ultimate arbiter of 
opec policy able almost singlehandedly to determine supply and 
price levels 
there was broad agreement among the experts that the gulf crisis 
will have a salutary effect on usisraeli relations which had 
been suffering as a result of us accusations of israeli 
intransigence concerning the peace process 
even before the events of last week in the gulf palestine 
liberation organization chairman yasser arafat had been shifting 
allegiances from egypt to iraq a switch that was hardly reassuring 
to israel 
arafat left americas best friend for americas worst enemy 
said barry rubin of the washington institute for near east policy 
rubin noted that iraq has been allied for some time with abul 
abbas head of a palestinian faction which claimed responsibility 
for an abortive attack on an israeli beach two months ago 
against this background rubin said that the plo is not going to 
do what is necessary to resume its dialogue with the united states 
which president bush suspended six weeks ago

when dennis ross a top state department policy 
maker accepted an invitation to spend a few days at a soviet dacha 
discussing the future of the world nobody paid much attention 
it was supposed to be a quiet time a little vodka and a lot of 
talk then iraq invaded kuwait and ross and his soviet 
counterparts helped make history 
on friday secretary of state james a baker iii and foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze issued a joint statement prepared 
by ross and soviet officials condemning iraqs invasion and 
calling for an international arms embargo on baghdad 
for the first time since world war ii the superpowers acted as 
allies when confronted with a war moscow assented to washingtons 
request it cut weapons deliveries to iraq 
for the soviets the decision to join the americans was a 
difficult one because of decades of close ties with iraq moscow 
has a treaty of friendship with iraq and is its biggest arms 
supplier 
but as shevardnadze said during a hastily called news 
conference with baker at a military airbase outside moscow on 
friday this aggression is inconsistent with the principles of 
new political thinking 
perhaps more significantly state department officials said the 
soviet union put no restrictions on any us response to the crisis 
the genesis of the statement reads like a case study of new 
political thinking shevardnadzes buzzword for the changing 
relationship between moscow and washington 
american officials who participated in the whirlwind talks 
telephone calls and abruptly changed plans used words such as 
extraordinary and milestone to describe the negotiations 
with their longtime foes 
here is a daybyday account of those talks 
wednesday a halfmoon glimmered overhead when baker stepped 
off his air force plane in the soviet city of irkutsk at 230 am 
for talks with shevardnadze 
the talks in the paris of siberia were expected to focus on 
the 12yearold civil war in afghanistan and arms control but in 
the first session baker asked shevardnadze to pressure iraqi leader 
saddam hussein to withdraw troops massed on kuwaits borders 
shevardnadze declined 
later the foreign minister in a remarkable step admitted the 
response had been wrong 
i really did not think at that time that the iraqis would so 
openly engage in aggression against such a defenseless country 
shevardnadze said 
thursday morning lt gen howard graves an aide accompanying 
baker tells the secretary that iraq has invaded kuwait 
baker informs shevardnadze and requests the soviets to cease 
arms supplies to iraq 
thursday at 130 pm bakers jet touched down in ulan bator 
mongolia making him the first top american official to visit this 
vast landlocked nation in 46 years but events in the middle east 
overshadowed his trip 
in moscow the soviet union condemned the invasion and stopped 
arms deliveries to iraq 
enter dennis ross 
after the irkutsk talks with shevardnadze ross went to moscow 
with shevardnadzes men for what were originally planned as broad 
discussions on the next two years 
in a dacha outside moscow the americans raised the idea with 
soviet officials of a joint statement 
there was a fair amount of discussion about the consequences 
of allowing naked aggression to go unchallenged said a senior 
state department official if you allow someone to engage in this 
kind of action and get away with it youre going to invite more 
back in ulan bator baker gamely watched mongolian wrestling and 
archery competitions as the crisis unfurled 
lt gen graves kept him posted 
weve got more phone lines out of mongolia than the 
mongolians graves quipped as scantily clad mongolian wrestlers 
grappled with each other on a grassy plain outside ulan bator 
at 8 pm baker received a call from president bush who was 
interested in the joint statement 
at a banquet that night baker toasted mongolias moves toward 
democracy then announced he cut short his trip 
it is with a very heavy heart he said the texan had 
planned a twoday hunting trip on the gobi desert 
in moscow ross and his soviet colleagues thrashed out details 
of the statement an international arms embargo was agreed on 
state department officials declined to say whether there were any 
disagreements but they said the soviets did not make washington 
rule out any option against iraq 
friday 145 am bush flying on air force one to colorado 
called baker again and approved the statement 
wake up and get a pencil state department spokeswoman 
margaret tutwiler told one reporter at 3 am were going back to 
moscow 
friday 730 pm at moscows vukunovo ii military airport 
this has been a rather unusual meeting shevardnadze said of 
his just concluded talk with baker 
then the two men read the statement each in his native tongue

two gunmen armed with silencerequipped 
pistols on saturday killed an official of terrorist mastermind abu

police said 
a police spokesman said the gunmen shot abdul fattah aziz known 
by the codename kifah ghalib shortly after midnight at the ein 
elhilweh refugee camp 
aziz was hit in the chest and neck death was instantaneous 
said the spokesman who cannot be named in line with police

abu nidal whose real name is sabri albanna broke away from 
yasser arafats palestine liberation organization in 1973 and set

libya and lebanon 
last month arafats guerrillas routed abu nidals followers at 
the rashidiyeh refugee camp 
five guerrillas allied with abu nidals were killed 16 wounded

report said the atrocities included the december 1985 attacks on 
rome and vienna airports that killed more than 20 people 
nidals group was torn by a bloody internal feud in late 1989 in 
which some 200 dissidents were slain the groups strength is now 
estimated to be less than 100

campaign finance reformers are looking to 
congressional leaders and the bush administration to begin serious 
negotiations on cleaning up future elections when congress returns 
in september 
the house kept the issue alive by voting 255155 late friday 
night for a highly partisan democratic bill that even many of its 
supporters acknowledged privately stands no chance of becoming law 
president bush has vowed to veto any bill that imposes absolute 
spending ceilings on congressional candidates as both the house 
and senate versions do and that doesnt curb labor and business 
pacs rapidly escalating role in politics 
democrats in the senate bowed to bushs call to ban special 
interest political action committees entirely even though lawmakers 
in both parties acknowledge that the supreme court is likely to 
rule it an unconstitutional prohibition on free speech 
house democrats sought only to curb what they called fat cat 
corporate executive pacs cutting the amount they can contribute to 
each candidate for combined primary and november election campaigns 
to 2000 while leaving the current lid of 10000 on such gifts 
for union pacs 
although reform groups such as common cause had called the house 
democratic bill a sham and fraud they urged lawmakers to 
hold their nose and pass it before congress went on vacation 
saturday to prevent the issue from dying 
its part of the process that you have to work your way 
through to go to the next step of the process said common cause 
president fred wertheimer the house must not block the senates 
efforts to clean up its own campaign finance system 
league of women voters president susan lederman said the house 
version is dangerously close to being an incumbent protection 
bill rather than a campaign reform bill 
at least the house action keeps the legislative process 
alive she said 
the house bill would establish a 715000 ceiling on how much 
candidates could spend on their primary and general elections 
combined originally it would have provided a ceiling of 550000 
but the bills authors modified it thursday night weakening 
several other provisions in the process after several disgruntled 
democrats complained privately the original version would have 
crippled their reelection bids in 1992 
also removed from the package republicans said were criminal 
penalties on candidates who overspend the limits and prohibitions 
on lobbyists doubling as fundraisers 
a republican alternative with no spending ceilings cutting 
allowable contributions from special interest political action 
committees and banning socalled leadership pacs involved in recent 
house ethics scandals was rejected earlier by a 241169 vote 
also rejected by 128122 was a proposal by reps mike synar 
dokla and david obey dwis that would have provided up to 
100000 in public financing matching funds to candidates who raise 
an equal amount in contributions of 50 or less from instate 
residents 
obey and synar also would have limited candidates to getting no 
more than 40 percent of the proposed ceiling from pacs compared to 
a 50 percent lid on pac contributions from the democratic bill by 
rep al swift dwash that was passed 
they would have financed the public matching funds by raising 
from 1 to 3 the current voluntary checkoff for presidential 
elections on individual income tax returns 
republicans overwhelmingly voted present on the amendment 
which had been approved earlier on a voice vote but was brought up 
again after democratic leaders feared it would kill the bill 
swifts bill had no public financing but it would allow a 100 
percent tax credit up to 50 to encourage small contributions

iraq said today it was creating a new 
kuwaiti army to prop up the government it installed in kuwait us 
reports that baghdad has massed troops on the saudi border prompted 
fears the invasion could spread 
on friday a government communique read on baghdad radio had 
said iraqi forces would start withdrawing from kuwait in two days 
unless something appears that could threaten the security of 
kuwait and iraq but the white house expressed skepticism that 
iraq would pull out 
president saddam hussein faced mounting international pressure 
to withdraw from kuwait us warships headed toward the persian 
gulf arab leaders sought a diplomatic solution and many countries 
moved to isolate iraq economically 
in other developments 
shipping sources in the persian gulf said iraqi troops today 
seized the 20man american crew of the tanker sea wolf docked at 
kuwaits main port removed the men from the vessel and took them 
to an undisclosed location but lloyds shipping intelligence unit 
in london said it could not confirm a us ship had been seized and 
did not believe the sea wolf was even in the gulf 
us officials are already seeking information on 14 americans 
mostly oil workers missing in kuwait who apparently were seized by 
iraqi forces to help keep oil installations running about 3000 
americans live in kuwait 
iraqi soldiers took 35 british servicemen acting as advisers to 
kuwaiti forces from their homes in kuwait on friday night and early 
today the british ministry of defense said in london their fate 
was not known 
jordanian officials said an emergency arab summit scheduled in 
saudi arabia on sunday to discuss iraqs invasion was postponed due 
to a dispute between saudi arabia and iraq over whether kuwait 
should be represented at the meeting by its ousted rulers who have 
taken refuge in saudi arabia 
in rome the 12 nations of the european community voted today 
to impose a total embargo on imports of oil from iraq and kuwait in 
response to baghdads invasion of its oilrich neighbor an italian 
official said 
kuwaiti diplomatic sources who contacted kuwaiti residents by 
telephone said iraqi tanks and armor had begun to withdraw from 
downtown kuwait city no further details were available 
there was no indication that saudi arabia and turkey were 
prepared to close pipelines in their countries that carry iraqi oil 
to the red sea and the mediterranean the pipelines constitute 
iraqs major oil export outlets 
baghdad radio today broadcast a communique from the 
provisional government of free kuwait announcing creation of an 
army that would accept all arab nationals who wish stability for 
kuwait in its new age 
iraqi television said more than 100000 iraqis had volunteered 
to serve 
the us state department said parts of the iraqi invasion force 
had pushed to within five to 10 miles of the southern kuwaiti 
border with saudi arabia 
the possibility of an iraqi thrust into saudi arabia worried 
members of congress lawmakers attending secret briefings on the 
crisis said 120000 iraqi troops massed along their southern border 
could easily attack the saudis next 
but a highranking saudi official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said today that no iraqi troops had entered saudi arabia 
president bush on friday warned iraq that attacking saudi 
arabia with the worlds largest oil reserves would be attacking 
american vital interests 
iraqs revolutionary command council led by saddam said it 
planned to begin a withdrawal sunday but not in reaction to arab 
or superpower demands 
we refuse to respond to empty chatter the ruling council 
said in a statement on official baghdad radio an iraqi government 
spokesman warned that if anyone took action against iraqi forces 
iraq would chop off his arm from the shoulder 
iraq did not say how many of the estimated 100000 troops it 
originally sent into kuwait would pull back or how long the 
withdrawal would take leaving the door open for saddam to keep 
forces in kuwait for some time according to persian gulfbased 
diplomats who spoke on condition of anonymity 
telephone communications to kuwait were partly restored today a 
woman at kuwait university was reached by her family in bahrain and 
they quoted her as saying the situation is very quiet almost 
eerie and tense 
in kuwait city guns were silent today and residents could 
determine little about what was going on 
iraqi soldiers were stopping cars and politely asking people 
to step out so they could check them the woman told her family 
the iraqi government on friday issued a separate statement 
denying that its troops made incursions into saudi arabia but 
residents of the saudi border city of khafji reached by telephone 
from bahrain said iraqi troops had laid down a checkpoint less 
than a mile from the frontier 
a nato source said the united states had contingency plans 
in case iraq thrust further into the strategic region he did not 
say what those plans were 
the united states will send a third aircraft carrier with 15000 
personnel toward the middle east next week to bolster its naval 
armada in the persian gulf pentagon officials said friday 
a second carrier was on its way thursday the ships will back up 
the navys task force of eight warships already stationed inside 
the gulf 
the soviet union and united states issued a rare joint statement 
in moscow demanding that all countries stop arms supplies to iraq 
and that baghdad withdraw from kuwait immediately 
the soviet union iraqs main weapons supplier cut off 
shipments thursday while the united states froze iraqi and kuwaiti 
assets on the same day france italy poland britain and other 
countries also imposed sanctions against iraq 
in cairo an emergency arab league council meeting on friday 
strongly condemned the invasion demanded the immediate withdrawal 
of iraqi troops and rejected any foreign intervention 
driven by fears of a production drop oil prices continued to 
climb north sea brent blend the most widely traded international 
crude rose 2 a barrel thursday and 86 cents more on friday to 
close at 2325 
last month oil prices were as low as 16 a barrel 
iraqs invasion followed two weeks of threats and accusations 
against its small persian gulf neighbor on july 17 saddam accused 
it of stealing oil from a field that straddles their disputed 
border he also blamed kuwait for a fall in oil prices that cost 
iraq 14 billion saying it contributed to the oil glut by cheating 
on its opec oil cartel production quotas

the nation capped a violent decade with 21500 
homicides last year the fbi reported saturday and experts blamed 
drugs 
the nations capital remained the killing capital for a second 
year with 434 murders and other nonnegligent homicides according 
to the fbis compilation of crime reports from around the country 
that gave the district of columbia a rate of 72 slayings per 
100000 people compared with the national rate of 87 per 100000 
the national rate represented a 36 percent increase over 1988 
detroit and atlanta again occupied second and third place for 
homicides the positions they held in 1988 atlanta however had 
the highest overall crime rate for the second straight year 
criminologists blame drug trafficking for the rise in murders 
and assaults that helped make 1989 the most violent year of the 
decade forcible rapes also rose over the decade by 35 percent 
although experts say the increase may be due to more such crimes 
being reported 
the drug trade is driving the violence said richard 
bennett a professor of justice at washingtons american 
university things such as bad debts territorial disputes 
thats what driving a lot of our assaults and homicides 
noted dr alfred blumstein dean of the school of urban and 
public affairs at carnegie mellon university in pittsburgh 
middle class folks take each other to court thats not the way 
to resolve issues for people whose disputes are over illegal 
activities like drug dealers you cant tell the judge this guy 
is invading my corner it wont work 
detroits 624 killings gave it a homicide rate of 60 per 
100000 atlanta with 246 killings had a rate of 577 per 100000 
the homicide rate was actually higher at the opening of the 
decade the fbi said 102 people per 100000 died of violent crimes 
in 1980 but the overall violent crime rate reached a record high 
in 1989 exceeding the 1980 level by 111 percent among those 
violent crimes was forcible rape which rose 35 percent in the 
decade 
atlanta led all major cities those with 400000 or more 
population when all crimes surveyed by the fbi in its uniform 
crime reports are considered homicide forcible rape robbery 
aggravated assault burglary larcenytheft motor vehicle theft 
and arson 
the overall crime rate in atlanta last year was 2076 per 1000 
population an increase over the 1762 crimes for 1988 dallas 
moved from third place in 1988 to second with 1685 crimes per 
1000 population swapping places with its texas neighbor fort 
worth which had 1578 crimes per 1000 population 
the rate of violent crime in general 6631 incidents per 
100000 population increased 41 percent from 1988 to 1989 
during the year the biggest increase during the year was 
robbery where the rate hiked 55 percent to 233 robberies per 
100000 population the rate of forcible rape increased 13 percent 
to 381 rapes per 100000 aggravated assault went up 36 percent 
to 3834 attacks per 100000 
although there were more property crimes than in 1980 the rate 
was 51 percent lower than at the start of the decade the 1989 
rate was 50779 incidents per 100000 population 
the rate of motor vehicle theft has jumped by 255 percent over 
the decade to hit 6304 incidents per 100000 population the rate 
of burglary has plummeted by 242 percent to 12763 incidents per 
100000 the rate of larcenytheft has remained virtually constant 
between 1980 and 1989 increasing only 01 percent over the decade 
firearms were used in 62 percent of 1989s killings compared 
with 59 percent in 1985 the most popular firearm remained the 
handgun which was used in 475 percent of the killings last year 
compared with 43 percent in 1985 
the uniform crime reports compile information submitted by about 
16000 law enforcement agencies nationwide representing about 96 
percent of the us population the fbi extrapolates from that 
information to provide totals for the entire country

president bush said today the use of us 
military force remains an option in trying to compel iraq to 
withdraw its troops from kuwait and restore the kuwaiti monarchy to 
power 
after meeting with top aides for two hours bush disclosed that 
the governments of japan france and west germany had joined the 
united states in freezing kuwaiti assets to prevent their seizure 
by iraq 
we continue to seek the immediate complete and unconditional 
withdrawal of iraqi forces from kuwait and restoration of the 
legitimate government of kuwait white house press secretary 
marlin fitzwater said in a statement as we have stated before 
all us options are under consideration 
the statement issued after bushs meeting with aides at camp 
david md made no mention of any iraqi threat to saudi arabia 
reports today from the middle east said replenished iraqi invasion 
forces had advanced south toward the saudi border 
the white house said it has no information on missing americans 
in kuwait sources in the persian gulf said today that 20 americans 
had been seized from a us oil tanker in a kuwaiti port and that 
other foreigners had been detained in kuwait 
also 14 american oil workers in kuwait have been reported 
missing the state department said friday it believed the 14 were 
being held by iraqi forces 
fitzwaters statement also welcomed the decision today of the 
12nation european community to freeze iraqi assets ban imports of 
iraqi oil and halt arms sales to iraq 
bush met at camp david with vice president dan quayle defense 
secretary dick cheney secretary of state james baker iii cia 
director william webster and senior military officials 
fitzwater said bush would continue to monitor the middle east 
situation and would meet with brent scowcroft his national 
security adviser and other aides on sunday evening at the white 
house 
on friday bush had reached out to leaders in the arab world and 
beyond to pressure iraq to withdraw its invasion army from oilrich 
kuwait and pointedly warned that saudi arabias freedom is very 
very important to the united states 
the white house on friday was skeptical of badhdads 
announcement that iraqi troops would be withdrawn from kuwait on a 
timetable beginning sunday the iraqi government added however 
that the alsabah royal family that ruled kuwait for almost 250 
years is finished forever and will never come back 
we need to wait and see said presidential press secretary 
marlin fitzwater we asked for immediate and unconditional 
withdrawal if there are strings we need to see what they are 
bush himself said iraqi president saddam hussein should haul 
them out right now 
bush said he planned to stay in touch by telephone with world 
leaders over the weekend to try to tighten international sanctions 
against iraq 
in moscow baker and soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
jointly called upon all countries to cut off arms supplies to iraq 
the soviets have been baghdads biggest arms supplier 
asked about the possibility that saddam might next invade 
oilrich saudi arabia which borders kuwait bush said im not 
discussing options but i would simply say the status quo is 
unacceptable and further expansion would be even more 
unacceptable 
pressed on whether he was committed to defending the saudis who 
ship 12 million barrels of oil to this country daily the 
president said when you look at vital interests of the united 
states the relationship with saudi arabia and its independence and 
its freedom come under the heading of very very important 
if the saudis ask for assistance i would be inclined to help 
in any way we possibly can he added 
the white house said americans could expect to pay 7 to 8 cents 
more per gallon at the gasoline pump from a 3perbarrel jump in 
the price of oil 
bush said there is a surplus of crude oil now but longrun 
economic effects on the free world could be devastating if 
supplies are curtailed 
the state department said iraqi troops hardened by eight years 
of war with iran were positioned five to 10 miles from the saudi 
border 
the chairman of the house armed service committee rep les 
aspin dwis said bluntly i think it means war if iraq 
expands its invasion the world cannot sit back and watch a 
person like saddam hussein take over half of the oil reserves in 
the world 
the pentagon said a third aircraft carrier was being readied to 
head to the mideast to bolster us forces already scattered 
outside the persian gulf officials said the uss saratoga would 
relieve the uss eisenhower which was sent to the region in march 
the carrier independence already is headed from the indian ocean 
toward the persian gulf to strengthen the eightship us navy 
presence there 
with tensions rising the state department advised the 3000 
americans in kuwait and the 500 in iraq to leave as quickly as 
possible airports and ports were closed in kuwait however 
fitzwater said iraqi troops have been stationed around the us 
embassy in kuwait city but they have not gone inside there is 
no indication they intend to do that 
the administration said 14 american oil workers were known 
missing and believed to be in iraqi hands the united states 
demanded that they be accounted for and freed fitzwater said 
a state department official said today the administration is 
aware of reports that iraqi military forces took some americans 
into custody at rumaliah oil field 
the official was unable to confirm news reports about their 
release 
the us ambassador to the united nations thomas pickering was 
in new york discussing what pressure the un can bring against 
iraq fitzwater noted that the un charter allows members to 
impose a military blockade on a renegade state 
the spokesman said iraq had ignored international calls for 
withdrawal at this point we have received only scorn from 
iraq he said 
iraq began jamming shortwave broadcasts from the voice of 
america late friday said richard carlson director of the 
government radio network 
two of the six frequencies carrying arabiclanguage broadcasts 
to the middle east were jammed but weaker arabic signals and 
englishlanguage broadcasts were not affected he said 
nato sources in brussels said meantime that the united states 
alerted western allies that it was prepared to respond should iraqi 
troops push beyond kuwaiti territory 
we have told them that we dont rule out any military option 
and that everything is under consideration fitzwater said we 
are considering all options 
saudi arabias ambassador to the united states prince bandar 
met at the white house with scowcroft the national security 
adviser 
bush said he talked by telephone with turkish president turgut 
ozal whose country is a conduit for much of the oil flowing from 
iraq he said he and ozal look at this matter with the same sense 
or urgency and concern 
asked if the turks would close the iraqi pipeline bush replied 
that will be an option im certain

financial disclosure forms for this years 
house and senate races show few exceptions to the rule that 
incumbents have the edge in fund raising according to a federal 
election commission analysis released saturday 
candidates raised 279 million and spent 192 million from 
january 1989 through the end of june the analysis says the 
candidates still in this years races reported having 1588 
million available to spend for the november elections 
the data confirm the overwhelming advantage of incumbents 
particularly in receiving donations from specialinterest political 
action committees proposals to significantly restrict or even 
prohibit pac donations and other incentives designed to level the 
playing field for challengers are included in campaignfinance 
overhaul plans now before congress 
overall when races for open seats are excluded four of every 
five dollars donated to congressional candidates went to incumbents 
the 441 incumbents seeking reelection to house or senate seats 
reported raising a total of 196 million in the 18month period 
covered by the study with 74 million of that total coming from 
pacs including primary races there were nearly twice as many 
challengers 793 but they raised just 46 million with 6 3 
million coming from pacs the total of challenger loans to their 
own campaigns eclipsed their overall pac receipts by more than 1 
million 
but challengers have matched or even surpassed incumbents in 
raising money in a dozen races some of them this years hottest 
contests 
in oregon for example democratic challenger mike kopetski is 
essentially even with incumbent republican rep denny smith in a 
race considered a tossup and in california actor ralph waite 
running as a democrat reported raising 235000 as of june 30 
more than twice the total raised by incumbent republican rep 
alfred mccandless 
two virginia races have challengers beating their opponents at 
fundraising democrat james moran mayor of the washington suburb 
of alexandria reported a slight edge over incumbent republican 
stan parris republican rep frank wolf is expected to keep his 
seat but is being beaten at the fundraising game by lyndon 
larouche the perennial fringe presidential candidate who is 
running despite being in a federal prison for a fraud conviction 
in senate races where sixyear terms give plenty of time to 
raise money incumbents enjoy huge fundraising edges 
the king of senate fundraising is republican phil gramm of 
texas who raised 89 million from january 1989 through june 
alone and as of june 30 reported 62 million in the bank 
democratic challenger hugh parmer had raised 14 million over the 
18 months but had just 20500 left to enter the final months of 
the campaign 
not far behind gramm was new jersey democratic sen bill 
bradley who is considered a possible presidential candidate in 
1992 bradley raised 67 million over the 18month period and had 
43 million in the bank at the end of june republican challenger 
christine todd whitman raised 228000 and had less than 75000 on 
hand 
on the house side members of the democratic leadership have the 
biggest advantage 
for example missouri rep richard gephardt the house majority 
leader and another potential 1992 presidential candidate raised 
nearly 1 million over the 18month period his republican 
challenger malcolm holekamp collected just 18436

nearly half the states have seen no real 
growth in revenues this year indicating they are in recession or 
close to it a study of state finances said saturday 
the impact was cushioned by a big round of tax increases last 
year and even more are likely next year the author of the study 
said 
the pressure is building on states to raise taxes next year 
said steven d gold director for the center for the study of the 
states at the nelson rockefeller institute of government at albany 
ny 
if you see a state that has lower revenue this year than last 
year you know theyre under tremendous pressure and theres a good 
bet theyll have to raise taxes next year he said 
the report was issued by the center which is part of the state 
university of new york at albany 
it said that in a survey of revenue collections in 43 states 23 
reported total tax revenue increases equal to or below the 
inflation rate meaning no increases after adjustment for 
inflation 
the figure was in line with a labor department report friday 
showing unemployment shot up to 55 percent last month and the 
economy grew by just 12 percent in the second quarter below the 
level needed to create new jobs 
orders to factories for manufactured goods fell 15 percent in 
june the third drop this year a sign layoffs and cutbacks could 
be coming 
construction spending was unchanged in june after being down two 
straight months and the governments index of leading economic 
indicators weak most of the year showed no strength at all 
the conclusion that many state economies are in or near 
recession is consistent with a report from the national governors 
association and the national association of state budget officers 
in april that states were in worse financial condition than a year 
ago 
the fresh study said corporate income tax collections were the 
weakest component of the state revenue picture with a 67 percent 
decline reflecting a drop in earnings 
the two other principal revenue sources the sales tax and 
personal income tax posted overall gains of 66 percent and 7 
percent respectively 
those three taxes account for more than 70 percent of state 
collections in most states the revenue figures were for the 12 
months ending in june 
weak state economies were found in all regions of the country 
but new england and midatlantic states were in the worst shape 
the report said 
in five states revenue was lower than in the corresponding 
period a year earlier massachusetts maine michigan new 
hampshire and new york 
eighteen other states had increases of less than 5 percent the 
approximate rate of inflation used in the report 
they were rhode island vermont maryland new jersey 
pennsylvania ohio iowa kansas nebraska alabama florida 
mississippi south carolina tennessee virginia new mexico 
colorado and oregon 
only eight states had revenue increases of 10 percent or more 
illinois georgia louisiana north carolina west virginia idaho 
wyoming and nevada 
tax increases enacted since last year have helped boost revenue 
in several of those states including illinois georgia and west 
virginia 
things are even worse than they look when you consider the 
fact states raised taxes quite a bit last year gold said in an 
interview if those tax increases hadnt occurred the decline in 
revenues would be even lower 
thirty states raised taxes last year about the same number as 
this year twelve of the 1989 increases were large involving 
either income or sales taxes 
gold said last years tax increases totaled about 5 billion 
with 3 billion taking effect this year that should have been 
enough to increase the overall revenue figure by about 15 percent 
he said 
three states reported decreases in personal income tax 
collections hawaii which cut its rates and michigan and new 
york but 10 others had increases below the inflation rate 
maine and massachusetts reported lower sales tax revenues and 
19 others had increases of 5 percent or less 
seven states did not provide figures for the study alaska 
delaware north dakota south dakota utah washington and 
wisconsin the report said several of those states are known to 
have strong revenue growth north dakota utah and washington

reverberations of the gunfire in the 
persian gulf are being felt by many us farmers who are facing 
yet another trade embargo after a foreign invasion 
iraqs attack on kuwait prompted president bush to order 
economic sanctions that ended sales of us commodities such as 
wheat rice and tobacco to the middle eastern nation 
moreover disruption of oil supplies from the warring countries 
has caused the costs of fuel to run tractors and for 
petroleumbased fertilizers to climb higher so farmers costs 
could be going up at the same time the embargo depresses prices 
paul drazek international trade specialist for the american 
farm bureau federation in washington said the loss of sales to 
iraq and kuwait would be small compared with total us farm 
exports 
its not a big chunk of the action but it will have some 
impact on producers in agriculture even a small amount can have 
an impact on prices drazek said 
the us agriculture department estimated agricultural sales to 
iraq in 1989 at 720 million out of total farm exports of 40 
billion or 18 percent sales were even smaller to kuwait 
still drazek and others said they feared the administrations 
sanctions would be costly to american farmers 
the worst thing to do is single out agriculture youre 
signaling the world that youre using food as a weapon he said 
were saying we support the presidents action as long as it is 
across the board and not singling out agriculture 
wheat growers said they hoped the economic sanctions do not 
bring about a repeat of president jimmy carters embargo in 1980 
that cut off sales to the soviet union after that countrys 
invasion of afghanistan 
sanctions operations particularly related to food products 
usually dont work very well said nelson denlinger executive 
vice president of us wheat associates a washington dc 
cooperative organization that represents wheat producers 
as with the afghan invasion youll find that commodities of 
that sort are replaceable he said you usually will find 
somebody somewhere who will sell you something food is not a 
good weapon for changing another countrys behavior 
its a neverending challenge to figure out what kind of 
rhubarb is going to happen next that will affect the ability to 
market wheat said john oades of us wheat associates office at 
portland ore its a very politically vulnerable commodity 
middle eastern oil is another politically sensitive commodity 
said carl schwensen executive vice president of the national 
association of wheat growers in washington dc 
were removing a significant source of petroleum imports from 
our consumption picture he said as prices increase that will 
flow through to the farmer as higher fuel chemical and fertilizer 
costs 
the increasing petroleum costs come at a time when the price of 
a bushel of wheat is falling because of a large crop of 27 million 
bushels up 700000 bushels from last year schwensen and others 
said 
in july the average farm price for wheat was 281 a bushel 
down from 378 during the same month a year ago 
iraq last year bought 13 million tons of wheat from the united 
states 
other agricultural commodities also get pinched by the embargo 
iraq has been the us rice markets largest customer 
accounting for as much as onefourth of us exports 
almost all of the exports to iraq about 350000 to 450000 
tons a year is longgrain rice grown in arkansas louisiana 
texas and mississippi 
i think it will cause less sales for arkansas rice which in 
effect will hurt our economy and hurt our farmers said john 
tull a lonoke ark rice farmer and i think that next year we 
will probably have to have a reduction in rice acres 
our farmers are seriously affected and we would hope that 
agriculture and rice would be treated in a separate way from 
political things said jim willis vice president for foreign 
market development at the houstonbased council for market 
development 
earlier this year the bush administration decided not to extend 
to iraq additional credit guarantees iraq had purchased us rice 
through the use of about 1 billion a year in government credit 
guarantees 
iraq is an importer of us tobacco products said britt cobb 
an assistant director of marketing for the north carolina 
department of agriculture iraq in 1988 imported 21 million of 
american tobacco he said 
california agriculture exports to iraq totaled a little less 
than 44 million in 1989 a little more than 1 percent of the 
states total food and fiber exports according to statistics 
compiled by california state world export commission cotton and 
livestock comprise the bulk of that total 
chicken growers also will feel the impact of the invasion said 
tommy irvin commissioner of agriculture for georgia a major 
exporter 
during the first four months of 1990 the united states sold 
more than 3 million worth of pieces of chicken 900 metric tons 
to kuwait and about 106 metric tons of whole chicken valued at 
130000 irvin said

the european community on saturday imposed an 
embargo on oil imports from iraq and kuwait as part of a series of 
tough sanctions aimed at striking at the heart of iraqi 
economic and military interests 
the action described as the strongest punitive measures ever 
taken by the the 12nation ec was aimed at forcing iraq to 
immediately unconditionally withdraw its invading forces from 
neighboring kuwait 
we will not be satisfied until there is not a single iraqi 
soldier in kuwait and until there is a legitimate and sovereign 
government in kuwait a spokesman for the italian foreign 
ministry giovanni castellaneta said 
the measures were announced after a threehour meeting of senior 
ec foreign ministry officials italy which holds the rotating ec 
presidency convened the emergency meeting to forge a joint 
response to the iraqi invasion thursday 
in addition to the oil embargo the 12 nations agreed to freeze 
iraqi assets halt arms sales to iraq and suspend all cooperation 
with baghdad in the military technical and scientific fields they 
also decided to suspend iraqs trade preference status 
the europeans are also seeking to protect kuwaiti assets in 
their countries and deny iraq financial benefit from its military 
action which the officials condemned as a brutal invasion 
several of the ec nations whose members include france west 
germany italy luxembourg belgium netherlands denmark greece 
ireland portugal spain and the united kingdom had earlier 
announced separate moves to freeze kuwaiti assets and halt arms 
sales to iraq 
the most punishing sanction is the embargo on iraqi and kuwaiti 
oil 
last year oil from the two countries accounted for 109 percent 
of the ecs total oil imports at the same time iraq is almost 
totally dependent on oil for its export earnings 
this will strike at the heart of iraq castellaneta said 
the oil embargo was formally proposed by france but the italian 
official said all other countries were in unanimous agreement the 
embargo could hurt some of the ec members such as denmark which 
depends on iraq and kuwait for more than 50 percent of its oil 
italian officials called the sanctions the toughest taken 
against iraq by any countries other than the united states and said 
they hoped other nations and organizations would follow suit 
especially the un security council 
the united states has also imposed an embargo on iraqi oil 
included in a decree issued thursday that blocked all imports from 
iraq and froze kuwaiti and iraqi assets in the united states iraqi 
oil had represented 75 percent of us oil imports according to 
the lastest industry figures this year 
ferdinando nelli the italian official in charge of european 
political affairs said the oil embargo marked without a doubt 
the strongest economic sanctions ever imposed by the ec 
he described the sanctions as a neartotal commercial embargo on 
iraq 
the strength of the measures and unanimity were in marked 
contrast to past crises when the ec members have been divided over 
whether to impose sanctions and how strong they should be 
during the us hostagetaking in iran for example trade 
sanctions imposed by the ec fell short of us expectations there 
have also been differences among the member nations on policy 
toward libya 
italian officials said the ec members did not discuss the 
possibility of joint military intervention in the persian gulf 
saying such a step would be taken only in concert with the united 
nations 
the 12 did not cut diplomatic relations or withdraw their 
ambassadors from iraq because that would make it impractical to 
defend their citizens in the area castellaneta said 
in a written statement the countries described as groundless 
and unacceptable iraqs justification for the military action 
iraq claimed it invaded after rebels overthrew kuwaits government 
the ec nations said they would do everthing they could to avoid 
an implicit recognition of the socalled provisional government 
iraq installed in kuwait 
the statement said the ec was ready to take part in any effort 
to defuse the crisis and was in close contact with several arab 
governments 
castellaneta said italian foreign minister gianni de michelis 
had received a message from secretary of state james a baker iii 
explaining the american position on the gulf crisis 
the spokesman said italy and the united states have identical 
viewpoints on the need for strong measures to force an iraqi 
withdrawal

technology 
according to hamburgbased der spiegel more than 100 west 
german companies are suspected of having helped iraq build its 
military might in recent years 
german companies have helped iraq with the development of 
military nuclear technology construction of rockets and production 
of poison gases the magazine said without elaborating 
in a telex to news media the magazine said the iraqis in the 
past few days finished building a cannon factory with the help of 
west german companies

dna testing a way to identify people or 
parentage using the bodys genetic code is reliable courtroom 
evidence but national standards for the tests are needed the 
office of technology assessment said saturday 
the ota which evaluates technical subjects for the congress 
said that dna testing first was introduced into the courtroom in 
1986 and already has been used in more than 2000 criminal 
investigations in 49 states and presented as evidence in more than 
185 court cases 
law enforcement agencies particularly the fbi want to 
establish a data bank of dna markers similar to the national files 
of fingerprints to help in the investigation of crimes but the 
ota said that such files could pose a threat to basic civil 
liberties 
in a report the ota said that the principles of dna 
identification are solid and that forensic uses of dna tests 
are both reliable and valid when properly performed and analyzed by 
skilled personnel 
evidence from dna patterns have been used to convict murders 
rapists and other criminals it also has been used to determine 
parentage and to identify bodies innocent men have been freed by 
dna testing and police have used the technology to guide their 
evaluation of suspects 
validity of dna testing has become so widely accepted the ota 
said that no state court has found that dna testing per se fails 
to meet established tests for admissibility although some courts 
have limited or barred its use in specific cases 
dna shorthand for deoxyribonucleic acid is the protein 
molecule that contains the genetic pattern for each individual 
except for red blood cells dna is present in every cell of the 
body every human has a unique dna pattern with the exception of 
identical twins who share the same genetic structure 
thus police who recover bodily fluids or tissue from a crime 
scene can use dna from those specimens to connect suspects with the 
crime 
dna patterns can be extracted from recovered specimens of blood 
semen body tissue bone hair roots saliva urine or the pulp of 
a tooth these patterns can then be compared to patterns found in 
blood or other specimens taken from the suspects 
the ota said the major difficulty with dna identification is the 
assurance that uniform standards are followed in conducting the 
tricky laboratory procedures in conducting the tests 
instituting quality assurance mechanisms should proceed 
without delay the ota said it called for a standardization that 
would assure that tests are conducted and interpreted the same way 
in each jurisdiction 
widespread use of dna testing the report said could be a 
significant weapon in fighting crime 
dna testing can save law enforcement and courts time and money 
by exonerating innocent suspects before trial or through plea 
bargaining for guilty parties as increasingly defendants are 
confronted with dna typing results the study said 
the ota said that society should prepare for the use of computer 
data banks for the storage of dna identification tests it said 
that 16 states and one county already have authorized or considered 
creating dna files for known offenders and the fbi is developing a 
system to store dna profiles for investigative uses 
centralized or linked databases containing dna profiles would 
permit rapid electronic comparison of results from tests on 
different samples within a laboratory and among laboratories 
nationwide the report said 
dna files kept of convicted offenders for instance could be 
used to analyze whether evidence found at a crime scene matched a 
profile in the database and thus provide police with a lead toward 
identifying a suspect the report said 
the report said that computer files of convicted offenders would 
be particularly helpful in investigating rape cases since released 
rapists are 105 times more likely than other offenders to be 
rearrested for rape the files also would aid police in 
investigating serial crimes because it would enable them to link 
individual cases more quickly 
creating such a computer data however the ota predicted will 
evoke several concerns about privacy 
because dna is specific to an individual and so highly 
personal some are reluctant to see any dna test results become 
part of a de facto national database it said 
many states now are hiring private laboratories to conduct dna 
testing and to provide expert witnesses when the evidence is used 
in court the ota said there were three major companies providing 
the service cellmark forensic science associates and lifecodes 
pricing systems vary with costs ranging from 325 per test to 
1500 for a case cost of expert witnesses range from 100 an hour 
to 1000 a day the report said 
the report said that congress could play a role in the 
development of dna testing by establishing standards and funding 
laboratories or training for personnel but the ota said congress 
also will have to consider whether to establish national computer 
databanks of dna information and wrestle with the concerns about 
privacy and civil rights in collecting and storing dna profiles

the red cross the nations biggest charity 
often takes days to respond to disasters has conflicts with other 
relief organizations and overstates its accomplishments according 
to a newspaper report 
a ninemonth investigation by the pittsburgh press that examined 
emergency responses to more than 200 disasters including every 
major one in the past five years showed that in some cases the 
red cross lived up to its promise to deliver help quickly fairly 
and compassionately 
but in others the review showed there were widespread 
deficiencies the alleged problems included delays of up to six 
days after a disaster hits before adequate numbers of trained 
workers arrive a lack of cooperation with local agencies and an 
emphasis on staging news media events during disasters 
the paper in a series set to begin in sundays newspaper also 
said the charity does not always spend all money donated for a 
specific disaster on that disaster 
the red cross said it was unfairly criticized because of highly 
publicized shortcomings last year following hurricane hugo and the 
northern california earthquake 
its absurd to look at last falls hurricane and earthquake 
and say the red cross cant do the job the red cross may have had 
a few little problems but we were dealing with two unprecedented 
disasters said barbara lohman a national red cross spokeswoman 
in washington dc 
if you want to be fair and get an accurate picture look at 
the hundreds of other disasters that we worked on and youll find 
that the red cross performance was almost flawless she told the 
newspaper 
the red cross unique operating position was created in 1900 
when congress passed a law making it the only volunteer agency 
required to aid victims of disaster 
today funded almost totally by donations from the american 
public the 12 billion operation promises immediate response to a 
disaster with food and shelter medical care clothing temporary 
housing and other basic needs 
to raise money it is red cross policy to stress image even in 
the early hours of a disaster according to the newspaper report 
two of the four names posted on the nightly callout roster at 
national headquarters in washington dc those people to be 
notified in case of a major disaster are fundraisers 
we had a film crew and a still photographer on the ground on 
the coast before hurricane hugo hit the mainland and with the 
earthquake we had a video crew in san francisco within the first 
24 hours ms lohman acknowledged 
most of the national disaster staff did not arrive until several 
days later 
the emphasis on fund raising irks many critics of the 
organization founded by civil war nurse clara barton in 1881 
when the fundraising ability of a disaster diminishes so 
does the national red cross said carl bradford west virginias 
director of emergency management the national organization is 
clearly driven by how much money it can raise so when the 
television crews and reporters leave the red cross is in the next 
cars out of town 
mayor anita wiley of shadyside ohio where 26 people were 
killed in flooding in midjune said the red cross didnt arrive 
for three days and then all they care about is raising money and 
their public image 
george moody chairman of american national red cross conceded 
that problems sometimes occur but he said theyre rare 
when you have 2200 active chapters involved in delivering 
services youre going to have inconsistency once in a while he 
said 
allegations of diverting funds designated for a specific 
disaster area surfaced after the northern california earthquake 
san francisco mayor art agnos charged the red cross was leaving 
town with 55 million contributed specifically for earthquake 
relief the red cross announced a month later it would spend 40 
million in additional earthquake relief 
while the red cross is by far the nations largest recipient of 
disaster contributions totaling 175 million last year the press 
concluded that less publicized disaster relief groups primarily 
the salvation army and other national church groups usually arrive 
first stay longer and do more

jurors deliberated four hours without a 
verdict in mayor marion barrys cocaine and perjury trial saturday 
and then stopped work for the rest of the weekend 
deliberations halted until monday after the panel asked the 
judge for another look at more than 150 prosecution and defense 
exhibits 
prosecutors introduced more than 100 exhibits and barrys 
lawyers more than 60 during the sixweek trial on cocaine and 
perjury charges 
district judge thomas penfield jackson brushed off questions 
from reporters waiting at the courthouse saying do you people 
ever feel silly doing this 
the jurors are sifting six weeks of testimony from 44 witnesses 
including 10 of barrys friends who said they saw him use cocaine 
some 200 times dating back to 1983 
friday was the first full day of jury deliberations in the trial 
the panel has been told to ignore such factors as the mayors 
flamboyant personality and his central place in local politics 
defense attorney r kenneth mundy said in his closing argument 
that barry had engaged in occasional cocaine use but he said 
the government failed to prove the instances of cocaine possession 
charged in the indictment 
the government tracked down cocaine dealers former aides and 
exgirlfriends of the mayor pressuring them into giving false 
testimony his lawyers said they said the fbi entrapped the mayor 
by supplying the crack cocaine he smoked in a videotaped sting 
operation 
rasheeda moore who lured barry to the hotel where he was 
arrested in a drug sting testified that the mayor slapped her to 
the floor when their twoyear affair ended in 1988 
she said their relationship mixed sex with cocaine opium and 
marijuana 
i guess you all figured that i couldnt resist that lady 
barry told fbi agents after moore persuaded him to come to her 
hotel room seven months ago on the night of the sting 
barry lawyers attacked the credibility of prosecution witnesses 
moore was unable to recall specific dates of cocaine use she said 
that was because she was not good with numbers mundy said the 
actual reason was that her testimony was made up 
another key witness against the mayor was convicted drug dealer 
charles lewis son of a prominent virgin islands family he 
testified that he and barry constructed a makeshift crack pipe out 
of a sherbet glass and smoked cocaine at a washington hotel 
a city attorney backed lewis testimony saying he found barry 
one night in a bathroom slumped over and surrounded by drug 
paraphernalia 
mundy depicted lewis as the center of a drug and prostitution 
ring whose testimony was aimed at shortening his prison term

the stakes were high but both sides in 
the abortion debate refrained from public protests during a federal 
hearing on a challegnge to pennsylvanias strict abortion law 
three days of testimony ending last thursday took place in an 
atmosphere of restrained decorum the courtroom in reading with 
seating for about 15 was only occasionally filled 
the closest it came to high drama was when senior us district 
judge daniel h huyett admonished a witness for being evasive 
but belying the hearings mannerly discourses the 
specialinterest groups were hard at work 
seated beside senior deputy attorney general kate l mershimer 
throughout the trial was maura quinlan a harrisburg attorney whose 
law firm lists the pennsylvania catholic conference among its 
clients 
on the other side the suit filed on behalf of a group of 
abortion clinics and doctors was being handled in part by kathryn 
kolbert an attorney for the american civil liberties union 
attorneys for the clinics also received legal aid from planned 
parenthood in new york 
the suit challenges the laws provisions mandating a 24hour 
waiting period and that women notify their spouses in most cases 
before they have an abortion 
other contested sections require minors to get the permission of 
one parent or a court order before having an abortion and require 
clinics to file detailed reports with the state on each abortion 
huyett is not expected to rule for about a month the judge has 
blocked the disputed sections of the law pending a decision 
an appeal is likely regardless of the outcome 
pennsylvanias law is the most stringent of any state a tougher 
one was passed last month by the louisiana legislature but it was 
vetoed by gov buddy roemer only guam a us territory in the 
pacific has adopted stricter controls 
mershimers witnesses characterized the law as a reasonable set 
of guidelines that would protect the interests of women and 
families 
but attorneys for the clinics argued that the law set up 
draconian requirements that would set up a series of difficult 
hurdles for women seeking abortions 
the case has been closely monitored by abortion activists 
because it poses a potential of spawning a case that could lead to 
a us supreme court decision overturning roe vs wade the 1973 
ruling that established abortion as a constitutional right 
still advocates on both sides said they decided not to protest 
because it wouldnt serve a useful purpose 
planned parenthood spokeswoman suzanne mayer said abortion 
rights advocates were informally discouraged from protesting during 
a meeting last month of pennsylvanians for choice 
huyett is very fair theres no need to annoy him with 
protests she said if its in the courts youre going to 
leave it to the courts 
garnett biviano president of the pennsylvania prolife 
federation said protests are appropriately aimed at the 
legislature where the law was drafted 
we recognize the difference between the legislative branch and 
the judicial branch of government she said 
during closing arguments huyett gave some clues that he might 
have concerns with the law he previously has upheld challenges to 
pennsylvanias 1982 abortion law much of which was later struck 
down by the supreme court parts of that law were redrafted into 
the existing statute 
huyett said there may be a problem with the defining which 
medical emergencies would permit doctors to perform immediate 
abortions to avoid substantial injury to the mother 
on the 24hour waiting period huyett citing testimony 
speculated that the requirement might create a delay of several 
days or a week for some women and at certain times of pregnancy 
that wait could be medically significant

state legislators are worried that 
efforts by president bush and congress to balance the federal 
budget will knock their state budgets out of balance 
proposed federal tax increases are targeting some of the revenue 
sources states depend on to keep their ledgers from dipping into 
the red said illinois house minority leader lee daniels 
daniels will be presiding this week over the annual meeting of 
the national conference of state legislatures where the federal 
budget will be a major topic for 2000 state lawmakers 
recent us supreme court decisions have set the stage for 
discussions on states power to ban public financing of abortion 
and to require pregnant teens to get the consent of a parent or a 
judge before having an abortion 
another supreme court decision on the agenda the missouri case 
involving a familys right to halt lifesustaining treatment and 
the states interest in preserving life 
daniels said some issues may be divisive but not the subject of 
the federal budget deficit 
states fear proposals being discussed in washington dc could 
cost them up to 4 billion by 1995 he said 
he said state legislators fully support efforts to reduce the 
federal deficit but a national conference of state legislatures 
study suggests federal tax hikes on gasoline tobacco or alcoholic 
beverages would damage state economies and reduce state collections 
of similar taxes between 1991 and 1995 
federal budget negotiators must understand that states cannot 
accept proposals that would result in damage to state fiscal 
systems daniels said 
states rely on these taxes to a far greater extent than the 
federal government because the federal government preempts much 
of the income tax base and restricts many other revenue sources 
the study showed the largest damage would come from a proposed 
6cent per gallon increase in the federal gasoline tax which could 
cost states 315 billion 
among the speakers at the legislators 16th annual summer 
meeting will be white house chief of staff john sununu and us 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine 
both have been attempting to negotiate a plan to slash 500 
billion from the federal budget deficit over the next five years

a doctor was fined and another still 
faces disciplinary action for mistakenly performing openheart 
surgery on the wrong woman after a mixup in patient records 
besides fining dr howard w ramsey of gainesville 5000 on 
friday the state board of medicine ordered him to write an article 
for other doctors warning them about making the same mistake 
board action is still pending against dr daniel knauf a 
university of florida surgeon who operated on the healthy palatka 
woman in 1988 for letting an assistant who was not a doctor 
examine the patient before surgery instead of doing it himself 
during surgery knauf found the womans valve normal and sewed 
her up again she survived and sued ramsey knauf north florida 
regional and shands the suit has yet to be heard 
this case reveals the most bizarre sequence of events that i 
have heard of in a cardiologic practice wrote dr marshall a 
burns who reviewed the case for the board one fiasco followed 
another 
ramsey couldnt explain how the palatka womans name wound up on 
the report of another patient with a more serious problem 
nothing the board can say to me can be as severe as the 
humiliation and chagrin and anger i have that this could have 
happened ramsey said 
the woman underwent cardiac catheterization supervised by ramsey 
at north florida regional medical center in gainesville but her 
name was erroneously placed on the report of a patient who had a 
serious heartvalve defect 
after taking the erroneous report to shands hospital at the 
university of florida for a second opinion she was examined by 
knaufs assistant and sent to surgery

an atlantabased italian bank helped finance 
the iraqi invasion of kuwait by supplying 3 billion in credits 
partly guaranteed by the us government the chairman of the house 
banking committee said saturday 
there is no question but those 3 billion are actually 
financing the invasion of kuwait rep henry b gonzalez 
dtexas told the associated press there is no question that the 
greater portion of that was dealing with armaments 
gonzalez said 800 million of the credits made during the 1980s 
when iran and iraq were at war was guaranteed under an agriculture 
department export financing program gonzalez first made his 
assertions in an interview friday with the austin texas 
statesmanamerican 
justice department investigators months ago began looking into 
activities of the atlanta affiliate of the banca nazionale del 
lavoro a large romebased institution owned primarily by the 
italian government 
the atlanta bank is one of several bnl branches in the united 
states others are in new york chicago miami and los angeles 
gonzalez said 
he said a number of officials of the atlanta bank recently were 
fired as the investigation intensified 
gonzalez said the defense intelligence agency is also looking 
into the arrangement he also said that the italian government has 
sent an investigator to atlanta to look into the case 
gonazalez scheduled an aug 14 hearing in the case by his house 
banking finance and urban affairs committee 
the inquiry followed reports that the atlanta bank extended 3 
billion in letters of credit to iraq some guaranteed by the 
department of agricultures commodity credit corp 
the commodity credit corp and other agriculture department 
agencies normally guarantee loans by private banks to foreign 
countries as a means of financing exports of american farm products 
and related goods 
gonzalez said in this case the ccc guaranteed 800 million of a 
total of 3 billion in credits for iraq he said the loans were 
supposed to finance purchases of grain and machinery 
gonzalez said however there was clear evidence that armaments 
perhaps including chemical weapons were obtained by iraq under the 
deal he said some agricultural exports may also have been included 
the cost to iraq of seizing and occupying kuwait may never be 
known but iraq did borrow an estimated 30 billion from its arab 
neighbors over the course of its eightyear war with iran 
he said full details of the arrangement are hard to come by 
because iraq later settled with the parent bank in rome 
he also complained that there is too little federal regulation 
of such operations 
banca lavoro is just small potatoes even though italy 
astoundingly is second in foreign banking activity in the united 
states gonzalez said what worries me is that there is 
probably 500 billion of this in lord knows how many similar 
transactions going on 
gonzalez said full details of the arrangements between the 
atlanta bank and iraq remain unknown in part because iraq has 
since settled its debt with the parent bank in rome its locked 
in a maze of secret transactions that unfortunately are entered 
into outside the united states

the mapocho river which crosses santiago after human rights 
activists and residents of slums in the area reported that at least 
33 executed leftists were buried there in 1973 
following the coup the military launched a campaign against 
leftists who supported the toppled government of salvador allende 
an avowed marxist thousands were detained and forced into exile 
abroad many others were tortured hundreds were executed 
in most cases the relatives of the victims were officially 
notified of the executions but the bodies were never delivered to 
them 
military officials at the time said the executions were the 
result of a state of internal war which they blamed on the 
marxists

for the last 12 years literary 
enthusiasts have hiked up a rocky mountain peak in the berkshires 
to toast the first meeting of nathaniel hawthorne and herman 
melville 
its great fun and a wonderful way to mark the beginning of 
the most famous literary friendship in american history lea 
newman said before sundays hike marking the 140th anniversary of 
the picnic on monument mountain at which the two authors met 
the north adams state college professor is president of the 
national hawthorne society and has written books about both 
authors she said that as a result of the meeting melville 
entirely revised the novel that became his most famous moby 
dick melville dedicated the novel to hawthorne 
over the decades the friendship between the young melville and 
the older and already established hawthorne has piqued literary 
scholars interest and generated a flood of doctoral dissertations 
they run the gamut from they were practicing homosexuals even 
though both had wives and families to they really hated each 
other newman said 
melville was by far the more flamboyant of the two but i like 
to think it was a mutual relationship she said they did a lot 
of drinking smoking and philosophizing together 
and thats the cue taken by the literary fans who make the 
annual trek up monument mountain she said 
whoever wants to goes you just have to be interested in 
either melville or hawthorne she said 
as they munch their picnic lunches the hikers read an account 
of the 1850 picnic written by melvilles publisher and william 
cullen bryants poem monument mountain 
for years gloria mcinerney who helped start the jaunts 
sponsored by the berkshire historical society has hauled champagne 
up the mountain in her husbands black doctors bag 
oliver wendell holmes who was a doctor as well as a poet and 
writer carried the bubbly up the mountain for his literary friends 
at the first picnic in 1850 newman said 
at one point melville jumped out on a rock ledge and pretended 
he was on the top mast of a whaling ship she said it was 
after the champagne then it began to rain and they all 
scurried for cover under the rocks thats happened to us some 
years too

the senate on saturday approved an 
intelligence budget for 1991 that eliminates us support for a 
covert war in cambodia and sharply restricts money for rebels in 
afghanistan according to sources 
the legislation passed by voice vote in the early morning 
hours authorizes us intelligence activities around the world 
from spy satellites to secret operations 
while most of the bill is secret it is believed to authorize 
spending in the neighborhood of 30 billion most of it is hidden 
away in the defense departments budget 
when the senate intelligence committee approved the measure on 
june 28 it eliminated a 13 million program of covert aid to a 
rebel coalition fighting cambodias communist government sources 
said 
the move was prompted by congressional fears that the aid was 
primarily helping the ruthless khmer rouge which is fighting 
alongside ussponsored rebel groups 
soon after the committee action president bush announced a 
series of policy changes in cambodia reflecting similar concerns 
the khmer rouge was responsible for the deaths of more than 1 
million cambodians during its 3year reign in the late 1970s it 
was chased from power when neighboring vietnam invaded 
reflecting a growing distaste on capitol hill for proxy 
conflicts in the third world the committee also slashed 100 
million from the 300 million request by the administration for aid 
to the mujahadeen rebels of afghanistan who are battling the 
sovietsponsored government in kabul 
washington and moscow have been trying to engineer an accord to 
end the conflict 
the bill governs the budgets of the central intelligence agency 
the national security agency which electronically spies on the 
world and defense intelligence agency 
it also provides for operations of the supersecret national 
reconnaissance office which is building and launching a new 
generation of spy satellites 
the house intelligence committee has deferred action on its 
version of the bill until congress returns in september hoping 
that by then policy decisions will have been made resolving 
disagreements on whether to fund conflicts like those in cambodia 
afghanistan and angola

andrew youngs hopes to become georgias first 
black governor have been reduced to a long shot as the former 
atlanta mayor tries to land a punch against lt gov zell miller 
the white frontrunner 
the democratic primary runoff in georgia headlines elections 
tuesday in four states including a strong challenge to kansas gov 
mike hayden in a republican primary voters in michigan and 
missouri also will go to the polls 
young came out swinging shortly after his secondplace finish in 
georgias july 17 primary in which he suffered a 
weakerthanexpected showing among black voters 
young charged that miller who is chairman of a small bank 
helped himself and key supporters by pushing banking laws through 
the legislature 
if it doesnt embarrass his supporters that he passed a tax 
bill and ended up with a bank i dont know what would embarrass 
them young said during a campaign stop in dekalb county 
saturday he added that he and miller just live by a different 
standard if id done that id have been in jail 
in the only negative advertising of the campaign a young 
television spot featured a miller cutout bouncing across the screen 
while an announcer accused him of changing positions on taxes and 
abortion 
on saturday miller soaked up the cheers of a crowd of 20000 as 
grand marshal of the georgia mountain fair parade in hiawassee and 
criticized young for mounting a negative campaign the andy young 
i used to know would not engage in that type of mudslinging 
miller said 
two polls released last week showed miller favored by more than 
50 percent of likely democratic voters and young trailing by 
margins of from 17 to 20 percent 
race has been little discussed in the runoff race and voter 
attention seems centered on millers proposal to legalize a state 
lottery 
young says he favors a referendum on a lottery but miller says 
young lacks the conviction to see it through both favor no new 
restrictions on abortion and say they dont expect to need to raise 
taxes 
miller captured 412 percent of the vote against four 
challengers in the primary last month young placed second with 
288 percent securing a majority of the black vote but not with 
the same strength that jesse jackson showed during his 1988 
presidential bid 
georgia law requires a candidate to win a majority of the vote 
to avoid a runoff the winner of tuesdays democratic runoff will 
face gop state rep johnny isakson who easily won a fourman 
primary race 
in recent weeks young has increased his efforts to woo the 
black vote an aspect of the campaign that critics said he had 
been neglecting 
miller meanwhile chided young for negative advertising and 
continued pushing the lottery he also summoned news reporters and 
camera crews to scenic locales a mountain stream a racecar 
drivers shop a high school science lab to record his thoughts 
on issues 
the signs point to a disintegrating young campaign said atlanta 
pollster claibourne darden 
its impossible for andy to win at this point one of the 
sure signs of a crumbling campaign is for the politician to openly 
and consistently cultivate his pocket vote the vote he should 
have in his pocket darden said 
state rep calvin smyre who is black said youngs problems 
among blacks stem from the perception that he left his base and 
pitched his campaign toward whites 
blacks make up about 28 percent of the states registered 
voters some critics contend that youngs effort to broaden his 
base by wooing urban suburban and rural whites during the primary 
campaign left black voters and black elected officials feeling 
ignored 
also working against young smyre said was that zell miller 
has not had a bad record when it comes to issues which relate to 
the black community and hes worked very well with black elected 
officials 
darden said youngs failure to score with more than about 15 
percent of the states white democratic voters showed he failed to 
erase the liberal image he developed in public life 
andy had the blueprint handed to him from the successful 
campaign last year of virginia gov l douglas wilder and andy 
refused to go with it and take a walk down the middle darden 
said 
in kansas hayden faces a strong challenge in the gop 
gubernatorial primary from a political newcomer challenger nestor 
weigand a wichita real estate executive has capitalized on 
widespread increases in property taxes as a strong issue against 
hayden 
former gov john carlin appears to be well ahead of his two 
opponents joan finney the state treasurer and topeka preacher 
fred phelps in seeking the democratic nomination for governor 
gop sen nancy kassebaum faces only token opposition in the 
primary 
in michigan us rep bill schuette is favored over attorney 
clark durant to win the gop senate nomination the winner will take 
on democratic sen carl levin in november 
michigans democratic gov james blanchard has no primary 
opposition his opponent in november is expected to be state senate 
republican leader john engler who has only token opposition in the 
primary 
missouri has no governor or senate race this year

rebel leader prince johnson said 
saturday he is ordering the arrest of all foreigners in monrovia in 
hope of provoking international intervention in the nations bloody 
civil war 
johnson whose troops have occupied much of the city in their 
battle to oust president samuel doe told reporters the roundup 
would begin monday and single out american british lebanese and 
indian civilians at first 
four us warships containing 4000 marines have been stationed 
off the liberian coast for weeks but washington repeatedly has 
ruled out intervening the forces could presumably evacuate the few 
hundred remaining americans 
fighting has shifted considerably throughout the capital in 
recent days and it was unclear whether foreigners in sections now 
under johnsons control could move freely to areas controlled by 
does troops 
a lebanese trader on saturday became the first foreigner 
reported killed in the fighting which began as an insurgency in 
december but which has since turned into vicious tribal war 
including massacres and torture 
mohamed farhat who had lived in the liberian capital for more 
than 15 years was reportedly shot and killed in front of his wife 
and four children when he tried to stop does troops from looting 
his furniture store 
johnson himself shot and killed a liberian wearing a red cross 
emblem friday claiming the man was selling rice that was supposed 
to be free according to a western journalist who saw the shooting 
i want the world to know how we deal with profiteers 
johnson said before firing a burst from his ak47 assault rifle 
killing him instantly while another detained relief worker still 
handcuffed to the victim said rice vouchers were being sold to 
prevent a stampede 
the victim whose name was not known was arrested with jacques 
monthouroy a frenchman working for the us catholic relief 
services monthouroy was released after the us embassy vouched 
for him 
the killing has stopped rice distribution in monrovia 
the fighting in the civil war is centered in monrovia where 
forces loyal to johnson are trying to topple doe whose troops were 
defending does fortified mansion forces loyal to a rival rebel 
leader charles taylor had been stopped by does troops east of 
the capital 
at least 2000 foreigners mostly lebanese and indian traders 
still live in the embattled capital besides the americans the 
westerners include a few dozen britons it was not clear whether 
johnsons order included the many diplomats who remain in monrovia 
including us ambassador peter de vos and british ambassador 
michael gore 
i have decided to give a rigid order to arrest all foreign 
nationals johnson told reporters at his field headquarters in 
the capitals bushrod island those arrested would be held at a 
secret location he said 
they will not be harmed johnson promised 
i hope this will create an international incident so foreign 
troops can come in to intervene he said 
in an interview monday johnson said he had telephoned the 
deputy chief of the us mission dennis jett to ask for direct 
intervention by the marines cruising offshore 
the marines are on standby to evacuate americans and some other 
foreign nationals from the besieged capital if it becomes necessary 
nigerian and other foreign troops would be welcome in liberia as 
part of an international force he said but not on their own 
initiative 
west african leaders are scheduled to discuss sending a joint 
flotilla to enforce peace in liberia at a summit in banjul gambia 
on monday according to nigerian government sources in lagos 
three nigerian naval ships including one armed with missiles 
and heavy guns came to monrovia last week to evacuate nigerians in 
the capital but were turned away by johnsons men 
the nigerian sources in lagos said the ships now in freetown 
capital of neighboring sierra leone could form the core of a west 
african task force that would include ships from guinea and sierra 
leone 
as johnson spoke to reporters he received word his forces were 
being attacked by taylors rebels 
johnson said he had no more information about the attack which 
came two days after taylor vowed to defeat johnson before 
assaulting does mansion 
about 5000 people mostly civilians have died in the rebellion 
in this nation founded in 1847 by freed american slaves 
the rebels accuse doe who took power in a 1980 coup of 
corruption and human rights abuses but massacres have been carried 
out by both the rebels and government forces 
last week government troops killed up to 600 people sheltered 
in a refugee compund in monrovia taylor said he believed his 
father was among those killed in the sanctuary of st peters 
lutheran church there was no independent confirmation of the claim

iranian president hashemi rafsanjani said 
saturday that tehran is ready to restore ties with britain severed 
over ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis death call on author salman 
rushdie britain said obstacles remain to restoring ties 
irans official islamic republic news agency monitored in 
nicosia quoted an iranian official as saying that recent remarks 
by british foreign secretary douglas hurd had made resumption of 
ties possible 
rafsanjani had instructed the foreign ministry to proceed with 
restoration of ties following a meeting of the national security 
council on saturday irna said 
in london the foreign office said we have noted the irna 
report with interest we will be studying it nevertheless 
obstacles to better relations remain we look for a substantive 
gesture of goodwill from the iranian authorities 
britain has demanded that iran lift the death sentence against 
rushdie an indianborn moslem who is a british citizen 
it has also sought irans help in obtaining the release of four 
british hostages believed to be held by proiranian shiite moslem 
groups in lebanon and a british businessman imprisoned in tehran 
for espionage 
hussein musavian directorgeneral for west european affairs at 
the iranian foreign ministry said hurds remarks met conditions 
set by an iranian parliamentary ruling last year for resumption of 
with britain 
hurd said in a british foreign office letter released wednesday 
that his government has no wish to insult islam and it understands 
that rushdies novel the satanic verses offended moslems 
the british government had nothing to do with the publishing 
of the satanic verses hurd said in his letter 
the letter did not specifically condemn the book but musavians 
remarks indicated that iran was prepared to accept it as a 
condemnation 
irna quoted him as saying that the letter was an adequate 
response to the demand set by the majlis or parliament 
the members unanimously agreed that the majlis demand has been 
met with thus removing the legal obstacle in the way of 
resumption of political ties between the two countries irna 
quoted musavian as saying 
the march 1989 ruling banned any restoration of ties with london 
unless the british government condemned rushdies book the 
satanic verses and pledged to respect islam

the resumption of ties could be a major blow for rafsanjanis 
hardline opponents headed by former interior minister ali akbar

1979 islamic revolution 
for rafsanjani who has been moving to circumvent his opponents 
and restore ties with the west in order to attract foreign 
investment and technology for irans sluggish economy the move is 
an important victory 
rushdies book caused an uproar in february 1989 when khomeini

islam in his novel 
tehran severed ties with britain after london objected to the 
call and supported rushdie on grounds he was exercising his freedom

the judge who sentenced roswell 
gilbert to a life prison term for killing his ailing wife said the 
retired engineer did not deserve clememcy because it was an act of 
murder not mercy 
roswell held himself above the law not one of us has that 
right and punishment is appropriate circuit judge thomas m 
coker jr said in a letter to gov bob martinez the letter was 
released friday 
state officials commuted gilberts life sentence wednesday and 
freed the ailing 81yearold inmate thursday after he had spent 
more than five years in prison 
coker objected to descriptions of the 1985 shooting death of 
gilberts 72yearold wife emily who suffered from alzheimers 
disease as a mercy killing 
it is indeed my sincerest hope that the media will eventually 
cease and desist from referring to this homicide as a mercy 
killing the judge wrote there can be no serious question that 
it was murder and not mercy 
a television movie of the killing and trial starring robert 
young as gilbert was titled mercy or murder 
nowhere in the record of this case is there any suggestion 
that mrs gilbert ever asked her husband to kill her coker said 
back in the condominium he shared with his wife gilbert said he 
thought of her but was determined to return to live there 
its easy to come back this is my home he said friday 
it doesnt bother me to be alone because i know my friends are 
near me 
gilbert ate chinese food and a welcomehome cake and drank 
champagne and some jack daniels in moderation as a stream of 
friends and acquaintances welcomed him back 
i always have emily in the back of my mind gilbert said 
i grieve for my wife but im going to have to deal with it

the armenian parliament elected a proindependence 
nationalist as the republics president saturday as it prepared to 
debate whether to begin breaking away from the soviet union 
the election came just days before a kremlin deadline for about 
40000 members of pronationalist armenian paramilitary units to 
turn in their weapons or face forcible confiscation by soviet 
troops the armenian parliament has already refused to comply with 
the order 
the republics parliament was scheduled to consider an 
independence resolution monday said legislator raphael popoyan 
if armenia adopts the resolution it would become the fifth of 
the 15 soviet republics to move toward complete separation from the 
soviet union lithuania latvia estonia and georgia have already 
taken such steps 
however unlike the other independenceseeking republics 
armenia is locked in a deadly ethnic and territorial dispute with 
the neighboring republic of azerbaijan the conflict turned into 
civil war for several weeks in january before soviet troops cracked 
down 
in the past armenia sought affiliation with czarist russia a 
fellow christian nation as a means of defense against its 
traditional enemies the moslem azerbaijanis and turks 
the new armenian president elected saturday is levon 
terpetrosyan a leader of the armenian national movement 
terpetrosyan spent six months in jail last year for helping 
organize mass demonstrations against azerbaijani control of the 
disputed territory of nagornokarabakh 
terpetrosyan defeated armenian communist party chief vladimir 
movsisyan by 140 votes to 76 popoyan said 
on monday the armenian parliament will also consider a less 
radical measure calling for sovereignty within the soviet 
union popoyan said 
similar autonomy resolutions proclaiming a republics right to 
overrule national laws have already been approved by eight soviet 
republics 
the independence proposal calls for specific steps toward 
achieving separation from the soviet union popoyan said it does 
not follow the example of lithuania which declared immediate 
independence with the details to be worked out later 
lithuanias defiance led to a 10week oil and gas embargo by 
kremlin it ended a month ago when the lithuanians agreed to 
freeze the declaration for 100 days starting from the date the 
soviet union begins negotiations on independence lithuanian and 
soviet officials have been meeting regularly to set up those talks 
popoyan said the victory of terpetrosyan a supporter of the 
independence proposal indicated the parliament probably will 
support complete separation from the soviet union 
tensions have been rising in armenia over thursdays deadline 
for turning in weapons as fears grow of a confrontation between the 
soviet army and the armenian paramilitary groups the situation 
worsened when the army reported 100 flamethrowers had been stolen 
from a weapons depot this past week and launched a massive search 
for the thieves 
popoyan said the flamethrowers were turned in anonymously on 
saturday as the armenian parliament ordered after terpetrosyans 
election was announced 
the armenian parliament has stated it will take responsibility 
for maintaining the peace and controlling weaponry on its own 
territory popoyan said 
the baltic republics started their independence drives with 
sovereignty declarations two years ago but sovereignty became a 
major issue when russia the largest of the 15 republics with half 
the countrys population also claimed the right to overrule the 
kremlin 
the ukraine uzbekistan byelorussia and moldavia also have 
declared sovereignty

sen alphonse damato implored the no 2 
official in the japanese embassy saturday to urge his government in 
tokyo to back president bushs call for a worldwide boycott of 
iraqi oil and other exports 
damato rny a member of the senate intelligence committee 
invited takayuki kimura to his senate office to hand over a letter 
signed by all 100 members of the senate 
the letter addressed to japanese prime minister toshiki kaifu 
said we urge that the government of japan take official action 
against iraq including blocking iraqi assets and prohibiting 
import into japan of all goods and services of iraqi origin and 
make these sanctions both mandatory and comprehensive 
frank coleman a spokesman for damato said that kimura the 
deputy chief of mission at the embassy accepted the letter but was 
noncomittal in his statements 
he said that kaifu had talked to bush and that no options 
were precluded coleman said of kimura the dcm said he 
couldnt say specifically what course of action would be taken 
but that an announcement would be made 
a white house statement issued after a bush meeting with top 
advisers at camp david md saturday said that japan along with 
west germany and france had decided to join the united states in 
freezing kuwaiti assets in order to stop iraq from confiscating 
them 
but kaifu has said that japan would impose sanctions against 
iraq only if the united nations votes to do so 
damatos office said that japan gets 8 percent of its imported 
oil from iraq and 59 percent from kuwait 
describing his meeting with kimura damato said he told the 
envoy that the japanese should understand the depth of feeling in 
the united states senate on this issue 
the senator said in a telephone interview that if they deal in 
their own selfinterest and arent willing to share in the burden 
of boycotting iraqi oil i think that portends a very poor future 
for usjapanese relations 
it seemed to me that his indications were very positive 
damato said and i told him to stop this business of waiting to 
see what the world community does 
damato said he told kimura the japanese should understand that 
iraqs occupation of kuwait presents a window of opportunity 
for tokyo to demonstrate its willingness to cooperate with the 
united states as an ally on difficult national security questions

the snub that city leaders gave nelson mandela over 
his praise for fidel castro is beginning to cost miami convention 
bookings by national black organizations 
the national bar association a group of black lawyers with 
about 2000 delegates decided last week to move its 1993 
convention from miami to another city 
a leading black fraternity omega psi phi canceled plans for a 
1991 meeting in miami another fraternity alpha phi alpha 
considered canceling its miami beach convention this year but 
stayed because of longstanding booking obligations 
city officials refused to issue a proclamation in honor of 
mandela the south african antiapartheid leader when he visited 
june 28 cuban exiles were offended by mandelas show of gratitude 
to castro for his support when mandela was imprisoned 
jewish leaders also were upset over mandelas embrace of yasser 
arafat chairman of the palestine liberation organization 
some local black leaders have endorsed the boycott citing the 
mandela flap as well as alleged employment discrimination against 
blacks in the tourism industry and the arrest of haitian 
demonstrators during a violent scuffle with police july 5 
were very concerned said mary english spokeswoman for the 
greater miami convention amp visitors bureau for the last several 
years we have put a great deal of emphasis on working with black 
groups they offer tremendous business potential for the community 
its frustrating to see this happening now but we understand their 
concerns 
merrett stierheim the convention bureaus president sent 
letters to black leaders assuring them the tourism agency will back 
an affirmative action plan 
stierheim also asked black leaders to reconsider the boycott 
because it is injurious to the economy of this community and 
hurts all people including blacks 
the bureau has been running an aggressive campaign to lure more 
blacks who represent 17 percent of dade countys visitors and up 
to now had been succeeding nine major black organizations had 
scheduled conventions in miami this year up from five in 1989

the senate on saturday passed a roughly 28 
billion transportation appropriations bill for the new year 
including money for upgrading the nations airports mass transit 
systems and amtrak 
there can be no prosperity without mobility sen frank 
lautenberg dnj said in hailing the legislation passed by 
voice vote shortly before the senate recessed for its august 
vacation 
lautenberg chairman of the senate appropriations transportation 
subcommittee said the measure which will now have to be 
reconciled with a slightly less expensive house version takes 
some critical steps to improve americas network of highways 
bridges and public works facilities 
the bill provides 138 billion for highway construction 808 
billion for the federal aviation administration 33 billion for 
mass transit facilities and just over 3 billion for the coast 
guard the appropriation for the coast guard includes nearly 53 
million for oil spill cleanup activities 
the measure includes a provision seeking to tie federal highway 
funds to efforts by states to suspend the licenses of drivers 
convicted of drugrelated offenses 
suspending the drivers licenses of drug offenders is an 
effective weapon in the war on drugs said lautenberg who 
sponsored the provision it will make people especially young 
people think twice before getting involved with drugs 
the measure also includes 125 million to switch from diesel to 
electric power the rail line between new haven conn and boston 
a move that supporters said would shorten commuters travel time by 
two hours

thousands of south koreans lined up 
before dawn saturday for passes that would allow them to travel to 
north korea during a proposed fiveday border opening 
president roh taewoo made the proposal july 20 and south 
korean officials said it could promote unification of the two 
countries however north korea has effectively rejected the 
borderopening proposal 
the seoul government decided to receive applications from 
wouldbe travelers despite the north korean rejection apparently 
to put pressure on north korea for the unprecedented border opening 
saturday was the first day for government offices throughout the 
country to begin accepting applications government officials said 
they believed more than 10000 people submitted applications during 
the day 
officials predicted the total applications would reach 1 million 
before wednesday when officials stop accepting them 
the seoul government has said all 42 million south koreans can 
cross the border if north korea guarantees their safe return 
north korea made no direct mention of the applications being 
received in south korea on saturday but its official korean 
central news agency said in a report monitored in tokyo that rohs 
border opening is a deception 
the agency reported a commentary carried by the norths 
communist party organ the rodong shinmun criticizing seouls 
refusal to receive a letter concerning pyongyangs plan to dispatch 
a team to meet a jailed south korean radical student 
north korea had earlier said it planned to send a delegation 
across the border during the fiveday period to console im 
sukyong a 22yearold south korean woman student jailed for 
making an illegal trip the north last year 
judging from the fact that they refuse to receive even a 
letter addressed to roh taewoo it is clear that his talk 
about grand exchanges of people and free travel is a lie the 
report said 
the two koreas have been bitter rivals since the division of 
their peninsula in 1945 they fought the 195053 korean war their 
border is tightly sealed and there is no mail or other means of 
communications between them 
most of the applicants saturday were elderly north koreans who 
want to see relatives left behind when they fled the communist 
state during the korean war there are about 10 million separated 
family members in both sides of korea 
some came in groups but most applied individually the onepage 
application asks for name occupation and the place to be visited 
plus two headshot photographs 
i feel crazy whenever i think about my relatives left in the 
north said mrs lee sungsil 69 who fled the north 40 years 
ago my parents must have died but some of my brothers and 
sisters may probably alive

police and sheriffs deputies have 
formed an antiabortion group that will press for a law allowing 
officers to refuse duty protecting clinics 
the local group is led by nueces county sheriff james t hickey 
who said he wouldnt send deputies to help police clear clinic 
entrances because i would be aiding in murder of babies if i 
did 
officers for life is apparentlhy the first of its kind in the 
country said ron delord president of the combined law enforcement 
agencies of texas 
elva bustamante director of new womens clinic targeted by 
antiabortion protestors said she was astounded that officers 
would form such a group 
this is outrageous she said i cant believe this i 
really cant maybe they should find another means of earning a 
living 
the city of 230000 has become a focus of growing antiabortion 
activism 
the roman catholic bishop on june 1 excommunicated rachel 
vargas director of reproductive services inc the other clinic in 
the city that performs abortions and warned bustamante she could 
be excommunicated 
a group called body of christ rescue has held more than 20 
protests at the clinics since november at one rally sheriff 
hickey prayed on the sidewalk while police pulled his wife and 
other protesters from a doorway 
petitioners obtained a referendum on the november ballot that 
would create a city charter amendment declaring human life begins 
at conception the declaration would have no bearing on the law 
ruben rodriguez a sheriffs department communications 
supervisor said about 12 police and deputies attended officers for 
lifes first meeting on july 26 
we want to unite law enforcement and public safety personnel 
to share and discover the truth about life in the womb said 
rodriguez who wears a brass replica of the feet of a 10weekold 
fetus on the collar of his uniform 
hickey said most law enforcement officers are opposed to 
abortion and that legislating a conscience clause would simply 
give them a right already granted hospital employees and other 
medical personnel 
delord said he doubted the state legislature would pass a law 
permitting officers to be selective about which laws they enforce 
im supportive of their right to have a group and the right 
to legislate he said but they have to set aside their 
personal beliefs to enforce the law 
police chief henry garrett said the issue had been raised only 
once by an officer who had friends among the antiabortion 
protestors he said he wouldnt object to his officers joining 
officers for life 
if they have their personal opinion and want to express it by 
being a member of that group thats ok as long as it doesnt 
affect their ability to do the job he said

while federal agents prowled remote 
mountain areas on a sweep to uproot marijuana this weekend local 
sheriffs were forced to send their eradication teams home because 
of funding problems 
mendocino county is disbanding its marijuana team on sunday 
because the state has not renewed its funding the sheriffs of 
trinity and humboldt counties plan to dissolve their teams within 
weeks unless they get state help 
state and federal agents last sunday began operation green 
sweep which they said was the largest antimarijuana operation 
ever conducted on public land the drug hunt in the king range 
national conservation area in humboldt county also was the first in 
the continental united states to use army troops 
but some local sheriffs refused to participate and characterized 
the operation as political grandstanding saying that local 
programs were a more consistent way of reducing cultivations in the 
area about 180 miles northeast of san francisco 
it really shows a lack of good planning and vision to waste 
all our money on some kind of a flashinthepan military 
exercise said us rep doug bosco dsebastopol 
this area of northern california has been dubbed the emerald 
triangle because the emeraldgreen pot plants thrive during the 
long sunny growing season while growers enjoy the privacy of 
large empty spaces 
since 1984 the state has provided mendocino trinity and 
humboldt counties with money to patrol the mountains and yank the 
weeds valued at up to 3000 each last year the counties received 
a total of 22 million 
staff members at the state office of criminal justice planning 
said the sheriffs should know within about a week how much money is 
available in the new state budget but it could be september before 
they get any guarantees 
last year criminal justice officials advanced the money for the 
pot raids but were forced to make cuts in other programs after the 
legislature refused to reimburse their budget 
mendocino county supervisors have made sure that wont happen 
with local funds and mendocino sheriff tim shea said he would 
disband his nineperson marijuana eradication team on sunday 
im afraid were going to be right back in the same situation 
we were in 1984 said shea referring to a year in which of 
increases in drugrelated killings and assaults 
trinity county sheriff paul schmidt said he was spending local 
dollars to fight pot growing but could do that for only another 
week or two humboldt sheriff dave renner said he would keep his 
team on duty for a few more weeks

south korea and the soviet union once 
bitter enemies have agreed to broad economic cooperation as a step 
toward formal diplomatic ties newspapers reported saturday 
the agreement was made at two days of governmentlevel talks 
that ended in moscow on friday the newspapers in seoul said in 
reports from moscow 
the talks were arranged after soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
sent a letter to president roh taewoo last month calling for joint 
efforts to help promote economic and other relations between the 
two countries 
the two leaders met in san francisco in early june in the first 
encounter of top leaders of the two countries which do not 
recognize one another the soviet union is a close ally and arms 
provider for seouls rival communist north korea 
both sides agreed to continue the negotiations in seoul next 
month the newspapers said 
seoul newspapers quoting korean delegates in moscow said the 
moscow talks laid a solid foundation for an early normalization of 
relations between the two countries 
during the twoday talks both sides presented details of 
projects or cooperation they want to promote in 11 sectors 
including fishery forestry electronics aviation steel and 
metals natural gas and petrochemicals the newspapers said 
the soviet union also presented a list of consumer goods it 
wants from south korea the newspapers said 
south korean delegates said in seoul before departing that they 
would offer to help ease an acute shortage of consumer goods in the 
soviet union such as soap shoes toothpaste radio and television 
sets and other electronic items 
government sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
indicated that south korea may provide loans for the soviet union 
to import korean consumer goods 
despite the lack of diplomatic relations seoul and moscow have 
greatly strengthened economic and other nonpolitical links in 
recent years especially after the 1988 olympics in seoul 
establishing formal ties with the soviet union is a prime goal 
of south koreas policy of improving ties with socialist and 
communist nations seoul officials believe such ties would help 
open north koreas closed society and thus ease tension on the 
korean peninsula

about 250 protesters angry about a mohawk 
blockade occupied a drawbridge over the st lawrence seaway for 
five hours saturday blocking passage of ships 
police finally cleared away the antimohawk demonstrators who 
were also demanding more action by the federal government to settle 
an armed standoff elsewhere between quebec provincial police and 
mohawks 
the mohawks have blocked the mercier bridge for more than three 
weeks the bridge closure has forced long detours for people 
traveling across the st lawrence river between montreal and its 
south shore suburbs 
indians from the kahnawake mohawk reserve near montreal have 
blocked the bridge in sympathy with mohawks in the town of oka 18 
miles west of montreal who have been engaged in an armed standoff 
with provincial police 
the standoff in oka began july 11 after police rushed a 
barricade set up by the mohawks to stop the expansion of the local 
golf course on land they claim is theirs an officer was killed in 
the gun battle that followed but it is still not clear if he was 
shot by indians or fellow officers 
the antimohawk demonstrators blocked a drawbridge over the 
stecatherine locks on the st lawrence seaway which connects the 
river with the great lakes the stecatherine locks near montreal 
are entirely in canadian territory 
during the afternoon protest two freighters as well as several 
pleasure boats were held up on the great lakes side of the 
drawbridge normally between 10 and 30 ships pass through the locks 
daily most of them heading for ottawa 
about 50 provincial police equipped with clubs arrived on the 
scene to catcalls from the demonstrators but the crowd ignored a 
police order to disperse within five minutes 
police then lined up three abreast and pushed the crowd off the 
drawbridge one man with a cane fell to the ground in apparent 
convulsions and was taken away by ambulance 
it was a good demonstration because it affected international 
opinion by blocking an international shipping lane said the 
demonstrations leader jeanpierre potvin the president of the 
local chamber of commerce 
it didnt bother the ships crews they just did a bit of 
housecleaning 
the protesters mainly from montreals south shore suburbs 
said that by blocking the seaway traffic to the canadian capital 
ottawa they hoped to send a message to the federal government that 
their needs cannot be ignored 
meanwhile traffic was flowing freely on the champlain bridge 
and on south shore roads after police removed several blockades put 
up by antimohawk local residents on friday the protesters had 
threatened to maintain the barricades until the mercier bridge is 
reopened 
the roadblocks went up at daybreak friday and some remained late 
into the night causing chaos for travelers

the bush administration lifted its objections 
to legislation creating a commission to probe the savings and loan 
collapse after being assured the panel would not interfere with 
criminal prosecutions senate sponsors of the bill said saturday 
sens christopher bond rmo and christopher dodd dconn 
released letters from the departments of justice and treasury 
indicating the administration dropped its objections to a 
senatesponsored bill setting up an eightmember bipartisan 
investigative commission 
administration officials had said they would fight a rival 
version of the legislation the banking law enforcement act of 
1990 passed by the house on july 31 and had spoken out against a 
proposal by the national governors association last week for such 
an investigative panel 
in a letter to sens bond and dodd made public saturday deputy 
assistant attorney general bruce navarro restated administration 
concerns that the house version of the legislation could pose 
real dangers to ongoing savingsandloan criminal investigations 
we are particularly pleased that unlike the house bill your 
proposal takes care to ensure that ongoing criminal investigations 
and prosecutions conducted by the department are neither 
compromised nor impeded 
the executive and legislative branches of government 
historically have feuded over companion investigations of various 
scandals by the justice department and congressional committees 
this was dramatized recently in a federal appellate courts 
decision reversing one of former marine lt col oliver norths 
irancontra convictions and ordering a lower court to review other 
convictions to determine whether immunized testimony north gave the 
congress was impermissibly used against him by irancontra 
prosecutors 
bond and dodd got the administration to lift its objections to 
their sampl factfinding commission by agreeing to amend the 
legislation under the new version the commission would be 
required to inform the justice department when it plans to call 
witnesses implicated in savings and loan failures 
the two senators said in a statement saturday that if the 
department or the resolution trust corporation certifies that 
commission testimony could jeopardize a pending criminal 
investigation the commission would not call the witnesses 
however the commission has the authority to request 
additional powers after 60 days if it believes the investigation is 
impaired in any way their statement said 
in his letter navarro said we have concluded that your 
proposal constitutes a workable compromise solution that adequately 
takes into account the legitimate concerns of all involved 
consequently we have no objection to its enactment 
bryce harlow an assistant treasury secretary in charge of 
legislative affairs said in a separate letter that his department 
is satisfied the senate proposal has sufficient safeguards to 
protect ongoing civil and criminal investigations 
a host of congressional committees already is conducting various 
investigations into the savingsandloan debacle and the 
administration had previously shown no enthusiasm for the separate 
effort by a study commission 
the bipartisan commission would be constituted of two members 
appointed by president bush two by senate majority leader george 
mitchell dmaine two by house speaker thomas s foley dwash 
and one each by senate minority leader bob dole rkan and house 
minority leader bob michel rill

president bush huddled saturday with senior 
advisers to devise a strategy for pushing iraqi occupation forces 
out of kuwait while an iraqi envoy announced that kuwaiti 
authorities were now in control of the oilrich nation 
mohammed sadiq mashat the iraqi ambassador to the united 
states read a government statement reiterating baghdads intention 
to begin withdrawing from kuwait on sunday unless a threat to the 
security of kuwait or iraq has reemerged 
mashat speaking at the iraqi embassy also said iraq will not 
attack saudi arabia the worlds largest oil exporter and he 
confirmed that 11 of 14 americans missing in kuwait had been found 
taken to baghdad and are now free to leave the country 
the ambassador declined to elaborate on the americans plight 
mashat said the troop withdrawal was deemed possible because 
order had been restored 
the situation in kuwait is back to normal he said 
security and stability are maintained for all the population 
indiginous and resident kuwaiti authorities are consolidating 
their control over all aspects of life in kuwait 
the bush administration has expressed doubts about iraqs 
pledge first delivered on friday to begin withdrawing its 
invasion force from kuwait on sunday 
i assure you he does not intend to withdraw saud nasir 
alsabah the kuwaiti ambassador told reporters at a news 
conference shortly after the iraqi ambassador spoke in washington 
they iraqi forces have already dug in they have already dug 
in the south along the saudi border they have dug in our country 
deeply they have taken over the central bank they have ransacked 
all the banks in kuwait all the institutions they have even gone 
to the low of going into houses and taking private property 
alsabah a member of kuwaits ruling family said the iraqi 
forces have conducted themselves in a way that no other occupying 
force has 
he said he interpreted during a telephone conversation earlier 
saturday between bush and the emir of kuwait but declined to 
disclose what was said he said the kuwaiti embassy in washington 
also facilitated a letter exchange between bush and the exiled 
leader 
white house spokesman douglas davidson said bush also spoke by 
telephone saturday afternoon with king fahd of saudi arabia and 
prime minister turgut ozal of turkey but the spokesman gave no 
details on the conversations 
although alsabah had called earlier for military intervention 
from the united states he said saturday that he was grateful for 
economic and diplomatic sanctions arranged by the united states 
the question of military assistance he said is a decision 
that has to be made by the administration according to their 
readiness and their policy making the bottom line is we are 
pleased the united states is moving and cultivating the whole world 
behind it 
bush met for two hours with vice president dan quayle and the 
presidents top military and national security aides at his camp 
david md mountain retreat to consider possible us actions and 
to monitor reports on iraqi troop movements 
a white house statement issued after the meeting said three key 
us allies japan west germany and france had decided to join 
the united states in freezing kuwaiti assets in order to stop iraq 
from confiscating them 
in all 11 nations have frozen kuwaiti assets the actions take 
aim at kuwaiti government investments that amount to as much as 
100 billion and that include massive holdings of us government 
securities chains of gasoline stations across europe an american 
oil services company and stakes in other major corporations 
also on saturday the 12nation european community agreed to ban 
imports of iraqi oil freeze kuwaiti assets and halt arms sales to 
iraq the united states banned imports of iraqi oil on thursday and 
bush has encouraged others to do the same 
marlin fitzwater the white house press secretary indicated in 
a statement on the camp cavid meeting that bush was keeping open 
the possibility of resorting to military force to compel iraqi 
president saddam hussein to withdraw from kuwait 
we continue to seek the immediate complete and unconditional 
withdrawal of iraqi forces from kuwait and restoration of the 
legitimate government of kuwait fitzwater said as we have 
stated before all us options are under consideration 
fitzwater said the white house had no information on missing 
americans in kuwait 
iraq announced on friday that its troops would begin withdrawing 
from kuwait on sunday but that the kuwait royal family that ruled 
the citystate would not be allowed to return 
in bahrain persian gulf shipping sources said iraqi troops on 
saturday seized the american crew of a ship docked at a kuwait port 
and took them off the vessel the sources said the fate of the 20 
americans from the ship was not known 
the vessel was docked at shuwaikh port the main port of kuwait 
city said the sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
the state department questioned the report on the seized crew 
we did check into the story said a spokesperson for the 
departments kuwaiti task force we have no confirmation it is 
true 
another official also speaking on condition of anonymity said 
earlier the department thinks the story is untrue 
mashat the iraqi ambassador said he had not heard of the 
report 
the state department also said saturday that three of 14 
american oil company workers believed to have been detained by iraq 
in kuwait had turned up in baghdad apparently unharmed a us 
official said eight others also were believed safe as of late 
saturday iraqi time the eight had not been contacted by us 
consular officials but were reported to have checked in to a 
baghdad hotel the official said 
he added that the two groups may account for all americans 
thought to have been missing since the invasion thursday the names 
of the americans were not available from the state department 
a central dilemma facing the bush administration in considering 
a further response to the iraqi occupation of kuwait is the 
complications of a us military operation the united states has 
no ground forces based in the area iraq has one million men under 
arms and is by far the strongest army in the region 
pentagon sources said saturday that cheney and gen colin 
powell chairman of the joint chiefs of staff briefed bush at camp 
david on the military situation in the gulf 
the situation with the iraqi military seems to be pretty 
static said one senior pentagon official speaking on condition 
he not be identified right now were looking to see if they 
withdraw their forces from kuwait as they said they would 
one senior military official who spoke privately said some 
refined options apparently were offered to the president by 
defense officials but that he could not discuss what they were 
bush earlier had been presented with what was described as a 
spectrum of options for military action that included offering 
warfighting hardware to kuwaits neighbors and more aggressive 
moves such as a naval blockade or tactical air strikes or bombing 
runs against iraq pentagon sources said 
but just because we presented these to the president doesnt 
mean that well use them cautioned another senior pentagon 
official providing such a range is what we do here contingency 
planning is our job 
the chairman of the house armed services committee les aspin 
dwis said saturday that kuwait appears to be firmly in the grip 
of iraq putting the administration in a quandary if saddam hussein 
installs a puppet government and withdraws his forces 
i think its going to be difficult to sustain an economic 
boycott or military action in any case with the american public 
and the world aspin said on cnns newsmaker saturday i 
think thats a very tough situation for us to deal with if such a 
situation is tolerated by iraqs arab neighbors

oil oozed into sensitive marshlands on 
the north end of galveston bay but fishing resumed saturday in 
parts of the bay where up to 700000 gallons of oil spilled from a 
damaged barge 
cleanup crews used vacuum trucks to suck up the oily mess which 
has washed up along an estimated sevenmile stretch of houston 
point the oil has struck marshes and some residential property in 
the area 
coast guard capt thomas greene who flew over the area 
saturday said he was encouraged by the shoreline cleanup but 
expected it to last another week 
were at the point where most of the oil is on the beach i 
think we can deal with that greene said theres no more oil 
coming from anywhere its just a matter of finishing the job 
environmentalists were worried by reports of at least two 
oilsoiled birds workers used noise makers along the oily shore to 
keep birds from landing in the goo 
booms along the shoreline trapped some of the oil and stopped 
new crude from washing ashore the coast guard said 
new oil was reported friday morning along houston point on the 
north end of the bay between the houston ship channel and trinity 
bay 
crews were laying additional absorbent booms to protect marshes 
further into trinity bay greene said the coast guard also plans 
to spray oilgobbling microbes on some marshy areas sunday he said 
state officials dumped the microbes on a 400yard stretch of 
beach on pelican island on thursday but results werent expected 
for several weeks 
my comfort level is much higher today as far as the oil we can 
see said larry mckinney director of resource protection for the 
texas parks and wildlife department for the longterm im still 
concerned because we cant account for about 500000 gallons 
coast guard officials estimated that between 500000 and 700000 
gallons of oil spilled but they have been perplexed by the 
relatively small amount of oil that has been cleaned up or has 
washed ashore 
the oil spilled into galveston bay when a tanker collided with 
two barges july 28 in the ship channel the coast guard said 
one of the barges nearly sank but it has since been raised and 
moved to shallower waters in the bay salvage crews saturday were 
considering the possibility of cutting it in half then moving the 
pieces out of the bay 
limited traffic resumed friday in the ship channel after the 
barge was moved 
in beaumont texas two federal lawsuits were filed on behalf of 
hundreds of people who say their livelihoods have suffered because 
of a massive oil spill in galveston bay 
both classaction lawsuits name apex reampt inc owner of the 
barges and eletson corp owner of the tanker shinoussa as 
defendants 
the lawsuits seek monetary awards for each fisherman expected to 
lose money because of the spill which occurred with the shrimping 
seasons peak period approaching neither lawsuit asks for a 
specific amount of damages 
lawyers in houston for both companies did not return calls from 
the associated press saturday 
meanwhile a ban on all commercial and recreational fishing in 
the bay was partially lifted early saturday but texas health 
commissioner robert bernstein cautioned fishermen and consumers to 
avoid eating fish tainted with visible oil or fish caught in oily 
waters 
a federal inquiry investigating the cause of the accident also 
resumed saturday in houston 
on friday a houston pilot capt raymond fincher disputed 
claims by crewmen of the tanker shinoussa who said the pilot 
ordered the vessel to speed through the ship channel and then to 
turn into the barges in the oncoming lane 
fincher blamed shinoussa helmsman mohammed haque of bangladesh 
fincher said haque failed to turn correctly setting the ship on a 
collision course with three barges towed by the tugboat chandy n 
the third barge was not hit by the tanker 
us coast guard lt cmdr robert douville said findings of the 
panel are not expected for at least six months

americans had also been taken there in a group of 24 westerners 
iraqs us ambassador said the americans would be free to leave

hussein ali he holds the positions of prime minister commander in 
chief of the armed forces minister of defense and interior 
minister the other eight members were lieutenant colonels and

iraqis 
i assure you that none i repeat none of the names 
put forward are kuwaiti nationality or citizenship said 
alsabah the kuwaiti ambassador in washington and a member of the 
royal family they are all iraqi military people

less than a mile from the frontier

the possibility of an iraqi thrust into saudi arabia worried 
members of congress lawmakers attending secret briefings on the

border could easily attack the saudis next

in what may be the first time a government 
has been sued for the movement of a glacier the united states has 
agreed to pay the husband of a woman killed when ice fell on her in 
kenai fjords national park 
thais grabenauer 59 of napa calif died one day after the 
june 16 1987 accident during the couples outing to the 
spectacular exit glacier 
according to a national park service investigation mrs 
grabenauer was standing beneath overhanging ice while her husband 
ken stepped away to take a photograph half a ton of ice broke off 
and knocked both of them to the ground 
rangers flew mrs grabenauer to anchorage where she died in a 
hospital of internal injuries 
the lawsuit filed two years later by ken grabenauer charged the 
park service with negligence for failing to warn visitors 
adequately of the hazards of glacier ice and for failing to erect 
barriers 
park service officials admitted no liability in the outofcourt 
settlement reached in march both parties agreed not to disclose 
the amount of the settlement 
grabenauer 68 had asked for 15 million assistant us 
attorney sue ellen tatter in anchorage said last week the 
settlement was considerably less than that 
one of the main issue in the case was whether the park service 
is responsible for warning people and keeping them out of dangerous 
areas 
the onceremote glacier had become more accessible in the years 
before mrs grabenauers death 
a twolane highway was built over a wild river that past 
visitors had to ford to reach the glacier15 miles from seward 
which is 125 miles south of anchorage 
the grabenauers were on a driving vacation to alaska and decided 
to visit the glacier on a lark after seeing promotional material 
in seward that said they could walk up and touch a glacier 
the park service which has placed new warning signs since the 
accident claimed those up at the time adequately warned of the

the leader of a political party backing 
lech walesa for president said saturday that the current holder of 
that post should step down soon 
jaroslaw kaczynski chairman of the prowalesa center alliance 
said his party would support a proposed change in the constitution 
to make the president elected directly by the people but he said 
the president should then be given stronger powers than under the 
current parliamentary system 
kaczynski said a fight for the presidency could occur between 
walesa chairman of the solidarity trade union and prime minister 
tadeusz mazowiecki walesas former ally and adviser but he said 
his party would not be afraid of such a battle 
a clash between walesa and mazowiecki in presidential 
elections would not be very favorable for poland from the political 
point of view but if this is the will of the people too bad 
kaczynski said speaking at a news conference at his office 
the center alliance calls for the president of the republic to 
resign in the shortest possible time we think that it could happen 
even in the next few weeks kaczynski said 
the current president wojciech jaruzelski was polands 
communist leader before its transition to democracy last year 
although the center alliance has been calling for the parliament 
to quickly install walesa as president kaczynski said the party 
would support changing the constitution to allow a direct election 
in light of opinion polls showing that method is far more popular 
with the public 
but he added changing the president is more important than 
the manner in which it should be done 
if a constitutional change cannot be agreed to swiftly then 
walesa should be elected by the current parliament for six to 10 
months he said during that time he said a new parliament would 
be elected and a new constitution written 
after this provisional presidency walesa could run again for a 
full term in a direct election he said 
kaczynski also said sweeping cabinet changes should follow the 
proposed elections but advocated leaving mazowiecki as prime 
minister he added that it is highly probable that mazowiecki 
would resign after the new presidents appointment 
kaczynski said a petition passed among parliament members 
calling for the immediate resignation of jaruzelski which began 
circulating july 28 now has 125 signatures there are 470 deputies 
in the sejm the lower house and 100 senators

a plastics company sent nine employees to 
iran on saturday to build 1200 houses for those left homeless by 
an earthquake that killed more than 50000 people 
the workers from fana inc of springfield took with them 
heatshrink film and pipes that will be used to build the 
structures said fana president anthony seraphin 
the film is a thick opaque plastic that is designed to be 
shrunk on pipe frames to form a shelter the homes are not designed 
as permanent structures but should last two to three years 
we can put these buildings up quickly a home 20by20 feet 
takes two hours tops seraphin said we wont build all the 
structures we will be showing them how to do it and then go on to 
the next town 
the company which also aided earthquake victims in soviet 
armenia two years ago started planning the trip shortly after an 
quake struck in iran on june 21 leaving more than 50000 dead and 
500000 homeless 
but the task became mired in complications because the united 
states severed relations with iran more than a decade ago over the 
hostage crisis 
it certainly has been a long road seraphin said armenia 
was nothing compared to this 
first the iranian government insisted on assigning a department 
to take charge of the effort but couldnt decide which one 
seraphin said iranian officials finally settled on the 
revolutionary guard 
then seraphin said the company encountered difficulty in 
getting an air carrier to haul the equipment and the company 
workers 
the military wanted to take us but the state department had 
to say no because they cant help us over there seraphin said 
the company finally lined up pakistani airlines international to 
take the workers to frankfort germany where iranian planes will 
pick them up seraphin said 
the equipment left several days ago on a third carrier 
alitalia seraphin said the entire effort has been financed with 
45000 in private donations he said 
seraphin said iranian officials have promised him the companys 
problems will end once the workers reach iranian soil for the 10 
days of work 
we have been assured by the iranian government that we will be 
able to move from town to town he said we have been assured 
we will be very welcomed there 
another relief agency americares based in new canaan conn 
distributed 40 tons of supplies to survivors of the iranian 
earthquake shortly after the disaster struck 
i think this is a major breakthrough in relations seraphin 
said were just going in there to help the people in armenia 
there were tears when we left and im sure the same will be true 
this time

the family of a black teenager fatally 
shot by a white police officer marched with 200 supporters saturday 
and called for an investigation of the coroner who made errors in 
the youths autopsy 
bergen county medical examiner lawrence j denson was relieved 
of his medical duties last week after errors were found in his 
autopsy of phillip pannell 16 of river edge who was shot april 
10 
we want an investigation on the medical examiner to determine 
whether his alleged mistakes were truly mistakes or if they were 
intentional said ted wells a lawyer with the bergen county 
chapter of the national association for the advancement of colored 
people 
the father of the slain boy said that conspiracy not 
incompetence was at question 
no mistake whatsoever it started out as a coverup said 
phillip pannell sr the problem is that this system doesnt 
work 
state medical examiner robert goode wrote in a letter dated 
wednesday that denson made mistakes in concluding where pannells 
hands were when he was shot a crucial point in the controversy 
surrounding the youths death 
witnesses said pannell had his hands up when he was shot by 
officer gary spath but spath maintains pannell was turning and 
reaching for what the officer thought was a gun in his coat pocket 
a forensic specialist brought in by the bergen county 
prosecutors office concluded pannells arms were raised because 
the bullet hole in pannells down jacket indicated the jacket had 
ridden up his back 
a state grand jury last week voted not to indict spath but 
attorney general robert del tufo said a second grand jury will 
investigate the shooting using the results of the second autopsy 
we want the new forensic evidence presented and an indictment 
for murder returned against officer spath said wells 
carrying the flags of the united states and south africas 
african national congress the 200 marchers walked the length of 
cedar lane the main commercial street in this new york city suburb 
some of the predominantly black marchers voiced anxiety about 
the future of teaneck held by many to be a model of racial harmony 
after it voluntarily desegregated its schools in the late 1960s 
i moved here because this is a special town and i want to 
preserve it said eunice pruitt whose four children and two 
grandchildren grew up in teaneck 
this whole thing makes me sick said john gish of 
hackensack a gay activist who said he marched to protest all bias 
violence 
a rally april 11 to protest the shooting turned into a riot 
with youths smashing windows and overturning police cars

claim that a soviet sailor sexually assaulted a us navy woman 
aboard a soviet warship in port on a goodwill visit officials said 
saturday

to public visits during a fiveday stop at the port that began 
tuesday 
the woman was not identified and officials did not say which 
ship she visited no further details of her claim were revealed 
both of our navies are jointly evaluating whether there is any 
basis to this allegation said adm charles larson commander of 
the us pacific fleet a joint evaluation of evidence must be 
made to decide if theres any basis in fact 
the woman was not able to describe the assailant or provide 
additional information to naval investigative services agents said 
lt cmdr bob pritchard a navy spokesman 
when the navy finishes its investigation the findings will be 
turned over to the soviets who would have jurisdiction pritchard 
said 
if there is enough evidence for a court marshal the sailor 
would likely be prosecuted in the soviet union and not extradited 
to the united states said col nicholay n bessubchenco of the 
soviet political directorate 
the allegation surfaced on the eve of the departure of three 
soviet ships we are checking our sailors to ask them about 
everything bessubchenco said its very serious this a very 
serious report 
the soviet port call in san diego was part of an ongoing 
goodwill exchange between navies of the two countries 
two pacific fleets of two great countries reached out for a 
handshake said adm genadiy khvatov the soviet pacific fleet 
commander before hundreds of people gave the soviet sailors a 
rousing sendoff let this handshake become a warranty of good 
naval relations and mutual understanding 
larson said he shared with khvatov everything he knew about 
iraqs invasion and occupation of kuwait earlier this week 
the united states and the soviet union have jointly condemned 
iraqs aggression and called for the invaders to withdraw 
three soviet ships visited norfolk va last july and three 
us warships visited the black sea port of sevastopol last august

the senate approved a 289 billion defense 
bill saturday that cuts 1 billion from president bushs request 
for the strategic defense initiative but leaves intact his fiscal 
1991 proposal for two b2 bombers 
in a rush to finish before a summer recess the senate adopted 
7916 a military budget that slashes 18 billion from bushs 
request of 307 billion for the fiscal year beginning oct 1 
we have developed a manageable and prudent and responsible 
reduction in defense expenditures related to the threat senate 
armed services chairman sam nunn dga said shortly before the 
chamber approved one of the first military budgets in the postcold 
war era 
the senate package adopted despite the threat of a presidential 
veto calls for a military personnel reduction of 100000 and 
elimination of 16 billion in procurement money for the mx 
railgarrison missile program 
the white house has said defense secretary dick cheney would 
recommend a presidential veto because of the sdi total and troop 
cuts the objection comes even though the senate bill is considered 
the high mark in congress 
the house when it returns in september will likely approve its 
committees version of a 283 billion defense bill 
senators lingered as legislative loners in the capitol as house 
members commenced their august recess in the early morning hours 
during a marathon session they passed campaign finance reform 
legislation a bill containing assistance for areas hardest hit by 
aids cases and an environnmental protection measure arising from 
the exxon valdez oil spill off alaska 
shortly before adjourning until sept 10 the senate also passed 
a bill appropriating roughly 28 billion for transportation 
programs for the new year including money for upgrading the 
nations airports mass transit systems and amtrak 
and sources said that an intelligence budget for 1991 passed by 
voice vote during the previous postmidnight session eliminates 
us support for a covert war in cambodia and sharply restricts 
money for rebels in afghanistan many of the details in the bill 
are secret since it authorizes some of the nations most sensitive 
covert operations 
passage of the defense bill came after the senate voted to 
restructure the sdi program commonly known as star wars by 
delaying deployment of the brilliant pebbles concept 
by a vote of 5444 the senate approved a restructuring 
amendment that leaves intact the chambers approved total of 37 
billion for sdi 1 billion less than bush proposed 
however the measure scales back the administrations request 
for the brilliant pebbles concept from 329 million to 129 million 
nunn criticized the pentagon for trying four different systems 
for the sdi program in the past three years while congress hasnt 
received one clue from anybody in this administration on how to 
pay for the antimissile shield 
no one can tell you where the moneys coming from and yet 
theyre charging straight ahead nunn said noting the likely 
annual cost of 10 billion for sdi 
the amendment comes on the heels of a congressional report that 
found deploying the first phase of sdi in 1993 would be premature 
and fraught with high risk 
the general accounting office the investigative arm of 
congress said that the introduction of brilliant pebbles has 
drastically changed the sdi systems design leaving it in a state 
of flux the technology involves several thousand interceptors that 
would orbit the earth to seek and destroy a target by smashing into 
it at high speeds 
a key sponsor sen jeff bingaman dnm said the amendment 
would be rejecting early deployment of systems that would violate 
the antiballistic missile treaty 
the senate later rebuffed two attempts to reduce the sdi budget 
even further including one that would have cut the 1991 budget to 
about 3 billion 
the defense bill deletes money for two ssn21 seawolf attack 
submarines replacing the request with two ssn688 los 
angelesclass attack submarines and delays the c17 transport 
aircraft program 
the bill also provides 238 million in research money for the 
v22 osprey tiltrotor aircraft a program defense secretary dick 
cheney has tried to kill for the past two years 
during three days of lengthy sessions the senate adopted by a 
narrow margin the presidents request for 46 billion for two b2 
stealth bombers in fiscal 1991 despite eroding support for the 
costliest aircraft in history at 865 million a copy the senate 
left intact bushs budget proposal but required the program to pass 
critical tests before money could be spent 
the senate decision sets up a confrontation with the house armed 
services panel which agreed to halt the program at the 15 
radarevading planes in development 
the bill also eliminated 16 billion in procurement money 
requested in fiscal 1991 for the program to put mx nuclear missiles 
on railroad cars the senate left intact the 548 million for 
research on the system as well as the 202 million for the 
midgetman landbased nuclear missile 
the house armed services committee eliminated the 
administrations request for both missiles and instead set up a 
strategic pot of 610 million for the two weapons the panel also 
called on bush to decide which missile he wants 
the legislation calls for a cut of 100000 military personnel 
including 50000 from us troop strength in europe where the 
committee believes the threat of a largescale warsaw pact attack 
against western europe has virtually been eliminated 
the nations troop strength currently totals 21 million a 
number certain to decrease significantly in light of bushs plan 
announced thursday to reduce us forces 25 percent over the next 
five years 
among the measures approved by the house and senate late friday 
and early saturday were these 
a house democratic leadershipbacked version of a campaign 
finance package majority democrats pushed aside proposals from 
both republicans and from within their own party and prevailed 
255155 
the bill which now has to be reconciled with a senate version 
would among other things limit house campaign spending to 715000 
per candidate 
a bill boosting the liability of shippers for the cost of 
cleaning up oil spills and requiring new tankers to have 
leakresistant double hulls 
a measure providing more than 4 billion over five years to 
help communities hardest hit by aids 
emergency legislation providing the treasury department with 
72 billion in additional borrowing authority through oct 2 
an intelligence budget for 1991 that eliminates us support 
for a covert war in cambodia and sharply restricts money for rebels 
in afghanistan according to congressional sources

the navy investigating allegations of cheating 
on nuclear reactor safety inspections aboard the uss nimitz has 
restricted four crew members aboard ship 
no charges have been filed navy spokesman lt donald thomas 
said this action is a standard precautionary measure taken to 
ensure the presence of individuals until an investigation is 
complete 
four nimitz sailors approached local news media last week and 
said sailors aboard the nimitz were cheating on inspections and 
were overworked and insufficiently trained to react to a nuclear 
accident 
it wasnt known if the four restricted sailors were the same 
ones who had approached the news media 
the nimitz is completing a monthlong maintenance run at the 
puget sound naval shipyard in bremerton 
thomas comment came in written response to questions submitted 
by kirotv 
the station aired a segment thursday night in which the sailors 
alleged crew members had cheated on reactor inspections that some 
nuclear operators had to work up to 100 hours a week in port and 
that many crew were not trained sufficiently to react to a nuclear 
accident 
the crew members whose faces and voices were masked also 
alleged that some had considered disabling the reactor to ease 
their heavy work schedule 
one of the sailors later told the associated press that the 
comment was not meant as a direct threat but that overworked crew 
members might resort to minor acts of sabotage to put their 
commanding officers in a bad light 
the sailor said the nimitz was leaving monday for a training 
mission which would last about a month the navy declined to 
comment on the ships movements 
the navy in a response forwarded by senior chief journalist 
gene romano at sand point naval station in seattle acknowledged 
that the upkeep period has been a demanding time with significant 
effort required of the crew 
pressure to accomplish the work safely and on schedule is 
naturally present but is no different from what a crew must 
routinely contend with whether in port or in combat training at 
sea it said under these circumstances a lot is asked of 
and given by these dedicated individuals and it is 
understandable that they sometimes look for outlets to let off 
steam 
the navy said the reported allegations are vague and there are 
few specifics on which to base a response however performance 
standards on nimitz are very high and a continuing program of crew 
training testing and qualification is conducted with extensive 
oversight widespread cheating is not possible

the blackstone group a new york firm that 
invests in corporate takeovers is considering trying to buy 
greyhound lines inc in a deal to end the sixmonth drivers 
strike a partner in the firm said friday 
we are exploring the possibility said partner richard 
ravitch 
greyhound americas only nationwide bus line has been 
operating under the protection of federal bankruptcy laws since 
june 
any deal to take over the bus line would have to include the 
return of the 6300 union drivers who have been on strike since 
march 2 ravitch said 
i think that its fair to say the only viable deal is one in 
which the union is a participant ravitch said 
greyhound spokesman george gravley said he had never heard of 
the firm and noted that under federal bankruptcy laws the bus line 
has until early october to file a reorganization plan and then 
another 60 days to prove the reorganization will work 
the company has no plans to voluntarily sell the bus line 
gravley said 
we are building cash balances were having a good summer 
things are going pretty well business as usual has been our theme 
song gravley said 
ravitch said the investment banking group was approached about 
the deal by greyhounds creditors the bus line suffered a loss of 
more than 50 million in the first three months of 1990 sought 
chapter 11 bankruptcy protection june 4 
ravitch declined to elaborate on details of any deal saying 
only that the investment firm was trying to get data concerning 
the company weve had a discussion with the union and were 
proceeding 
an official with the amalgamated transit union who asked to go 
unnamed said the union is still interested in some type of employee 
buyout 
blackstone considers the unions participation crucial the atu 
official said because union drivers are experienced and also 
because returning them to work would alleviate millions of dollars 
in porivers strike which entered its sixth month on thursday 
was marred by shootings bomb threats and other violent incidents 
in its first few months the two sides have not set down to try and 
negotiate a settlement since early may

sandinista peasants with machetes 
seized a private ranch and sandinista workers warned of a general 
strike working in unison to threaten anew on friday the government 
of president violeta barrios de chamorro 
about 60 campesinos took over the santa julia ranch in juigalpa 
120 miles southeast of managua on thursday night hours earlier 
the 150000member national workers front threatened its third and 
largest labor action since the united national opposition coalition 
of mrs chamorro took office on april 25 
ranch invasion leader leopoldo siles blanco said the peasants 
acted in retaliation for takeovers in recent weeks of sandinista 
cooperative farms 
we are prepared to invade other private ranches he said in 
an interview 
about 150 sandinista peasants occupied agriculture minister 
roberto rondons ranch on wednesday 
lucio jimenez leader of the national workers front told a news 
conference his federation plans a walkout of all sandinista unions 
because more than 1000 government employees were fired despite 
promises nobody would be laid off 
jimenez complained that currency devaluations over the last 
three months have reduced the purchasing power of the 150000 
government workers by 90 percent despite pay raises 
people cant pay for water and electricity because the 
government has eliminated subsidies for public services in its 
attempt to reduce its large financial deficit he said 
jimenez also complained that despite an accord in which the 
government promised not to privatize stateowned lands large 
farms with machinery and silos have been rented to large 
landowners close to the government 
six people were killed and about 100 injured in clashes between 
sandinista supporters and opponents in the last sandinistaled 
strike in july the strikers erected barricades paralyzing managua 
and disrupting the rest of the nation 
edgardo garcia chief of the sandinista farmworkers association 
said the government has not lived up to agreements that ended the 
july strike including limits on the amount of land distributed by 
sandinistas that could be returned to former owners 
police spokesman miguel centeno said police lines were set up at 
the private ranch owned by chester noguera leader of the 
nicaraguan farmers and ranchers federation that was taken over 
thursday 
mrs chamorros 14party united national opposition defeated the 
sandinistas in elections last february and took power in april in 
this central american nation of about 35 million people 
inflation and low farm production caused by massive land 
reform are the two biggest problem she inherited from the 
antius sandinistas who ruled nicaragua for a decade after 
overthrowing dictator anastasio somoza 
thursday the government devalued the cordoba by 77 percent 
the 27th devaluation since it took office as part of a 
belttightening effort to keep the economy afloat 
that brought the cordoba down to 560000 to the dollar at the 
official rate of exchange and up to 670000 on the black market 
mrs chamorro has been trying to return nicaragua to a free 
market economy but strikes and strike threats have undermined her 
efforts 
her government managed to eliminate government subsidies and 
price controls but this sent prices for staples skyrocketing

eastern airlines remaining unionized pilots 
have authorized their leadership to strike the airline if a 
contract cant be reached by aug 11 the pilots union said friday 
a spokesman for the air line pilots association acknowledged a 
strike would not pose much of an immediate threat to the carriers 
operations because there are few union pilots flying eastern planes 
instead the planes are being flown by pilots who crossed picket 
lines that were up when eastern pilots joined striking machinists 
in a sympathy walkout last year 
still alpa spokesman john mazor said a strike would be 
significant because as much as anything else a strike focuses 
the attention of the public it creates a lot pressure on the 
company 
eastern pilots overwhelmingly authorized the strike through a 
ballot taken at local council meetings thursday night alpa said 
contract talks are set to resume next week the union said 
on thursday a federal judge in miami ruled that pilots who 
struck eastern and later offered to return to work are entitled to 
replace the strikebreakers who were hired they are also entitled 
to back pay the judge ruled 
eastern which is still in the midst of bankruptcy proceedings 
said it would appeal the ruling

senate and house negotiators on clean air 
legislation reached agreement friday on a schedule for ending by 
the close of the decade use of chemicals that damage the ozone 
layer but leaders acknowledged the most difficult issues of the 
legislation have yet to be discussed 
among other provisions the negotiators agreed to forbid states 
and local governments from restricting or banning the chemicals for 
two years 
the conference committee is not scheduled to meet again until 
after the august congressional recess house and senate staffers 
were directed to work through the month to draft possible 
compromises on various parts of the two bills 
we dont have much time ahead of us said sen max baucus 
dmont the conference chairman noting there are only 23 
legislative days remaining until congress is scheduled to adjourn 
in early october 
negotiators said they hoped the agreement on ozonedestroying 
chemicals would help break the deadlock 
that agreement calls for phasing out such chemicals including 
chlorofluorocarbons halons and carbon tetrachloride widely used 
as coolants solvents and foam blowing agents by the end of the 
decade 
some substitute chemicals that are less harmful to the 
environment such as hcfcs chlorofluorocarbons that contain one or 
more hydrogen atoms would be phased out over the next 40 years 
the measure also calls for recylcing of these chemicals by 1992 
and the installation of precautions to prevent routine release into 
the air 
the ban on local action will affect at least 17 states and 
communities that have acted on their own in various ways to 
restrict the use of ozonedepleting chemicals 
the compromise substantially mirrors requirements in the 
montreal protocol the international treaty on ozonedepleting 
chemicals 
the house and senate conferees have been struggling for nearly a 
month in an attempt to reconcile different bills approved by the 
house and senate that would impose tougher air pollution controls 
on automobiles industry and electric utilities 
but so far the two sides have not even discussed specific 
compromises on the most controversial areas of the bills including 
what smogreducing controls to impose on automobiles and how 
industry must cut toxic chemical emissions 
at fridays session the house and senate members had trouble 
even agreeing what issues staff members should discuss during the 
august recess 
the ozone layer 25 miles or so above the earth protects living 
organisms from the harmful ultraviolet rays of the sun which can 
cause skin cancer the normally inert chemicals in question last so 
long in the atmosphere that they eventually rise to to ozone layer 
where ultraviolet light breaks them down and liberates chlorine 
that destroys ozone

friday hours after masked arabs kidnapped him from his west bank 
home

palestinians slain by fellow arabs during the 31monthold 
palestinian uprising against israeli rule in the occupied 
territories most of the victims have been accused of collaboration

civilians in the rebellion and 45 israelis have died

stabbing wounds they said 
the army command confirmed the death and said police were

more than 7000 new cases of aids were reported to 
the world health organization in july increasing the global total 
to 273425 since records began 
an aids update published friday showed 741 cases registered in 
romania at the end of june up from 74 cases recorded in february 
of these 687 were children under the age of 13 figures showed 
18 of the young victims picked up the disease from their mothers 
and the rest were infected by contaminated needles and blood in 
hospitals and orphanages 
the united states notified who of 3496 new cases in july 
raising the registered number of us victims to 137385 since 
reporting began in 1981 
the number of reported cases underestimates the true extent of 
the disease especially in africa who officials said they believe 
the actual total is two to three times higher 
the who report covers only victims of acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome and not people infected with the human immunodeficiency 
virus hiv which precedes fullblown aids 
the united nations on wednesday said an estimated 8 million to 
10 million people may already carry the hiv virus spread by sexual 
contact infected syringes contaminated blood and by pregnant 
women to their babies 
the latest figure is 2 million higher than previous estimates 
who said the increase was because of the unexpectedly swift spread 
of the disease in subsaharan africa and asia 
the report warned that existing predictions of 15 million to 20 
million hiv infections by the year 2000 may also be too low 
aids is a disease in which a virus attacks the bodys immune 
system leaving victims susceptible to a wide variety of infections 
and cancers

at a manhattan brokerage firm the grins and 
groans of a dozen men watching the tickertape friday told the story 
of the tickemania that characterized the roller coaster ride of 
stocks following events in the persian gulf 
as the market plunged friday angelo falco made light of iraqi 
leader saddam husseins decision to invade kuwait and a prediction 
by soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze that iraq would 
quickly back out 
i wouldnt be surprised if guys like hussein shevardnadze 
were playing the market this week he said evoking some nervous 
laughter among other investors gathered inside charles schwab amp co 
inc at the world trade center 
another man frowning one moment was smiling the next as he 
speculated that the prediction by shevardnadze had caused the 
market to rebound 35 points in five minutes he couldnt believe 
how quickly the numbers were changing 
he pointed at one stock noting that it stood at 6 a share just 
moments after it had been 11 per share 
eleven now its only six half price half price 
unbelievable he shouted the others focused on the numbers like 
gamblers around a casino table 
its typical to hear a lot of gallows humor on a day like 
friday falco said when the dow jones average of 30 industrials 
was down 5495 points after falling 120 points 
theyre kidding and laughing knowing theyre losing thousands 
of dollars an hour he said most people are taking a good 
dunking today 
robert a burke editor of an investment trade paper eye on 
wall street watched with detached amusement as a steady stream 
of men took their turns at the computers 
i call these guys tickaholics the disease is tickemania he 
said 
most of them were the kind of investors who viewed stocks with 
the same enthusiasm of those bitten by lotto fever he said 
everybody in america wants to get rich quick he said 
these guys are gambling once in a while theyll get lucky years 
ago there used to be millions of these guys but the stock market 
crashed and they all got wiped out 
burke attributed the sudden downfall in the market to the 
announcement thursday that unemployment had risen to 55 percent 
its highest level in two years as well as the iraqi invasion and a 
revision of the gross national product last week

florida declared victory over the mediterranean 
fruit fly friday and agricultural officials gloated that they had 
swiftly crushed the insects while california was fighting a 
protracted battle 
on april 16 a fruit fly was found in a trap near miami 
international airport within a week the state agriculture 
department launched an extensive trapping and spraying program to 
keep the infestation localized and then eradicate it 
our immediate reaction upon discovery of the medfly and our 
allout effort provides a vivid contrast between floridas 
eradication program and whats happening in california said 
agriculture commissioner doyle conner in a statement 
floridas effort took less than four months cost less than 16 
million and was confined to a 20squaremile area he said 
in contrast californias infestation has been going on for a 
year has spread to more than 900 square miles and already has cost 
more than 38 million conner said 
he noted florida and california are both states with large 
production of fruits and vegetables so essential to our nations 
health and are both very vulnerable with long coastlines 
deepwater ports international airports and traverlers 
yet we in florida have been successful in medfly eradication 
in a short period he said 
unlike california where aerial malathion spraying produced a 
continuing public outcry the spraying in virginia gardens miami 
springs and parts of hialeah northwest of miami went on with little 
fuss although some resistance developed as the spraying continued 
the aim of floridas battle which included eight aerial 
treatments in sevenday cycles compared to 21day cycles in 
california was to wipe out the invasion as quickly as possible 
conner said 
medflies lay eggs in host fruit and vegetables and their larvae 
feed on the pulp it is considered the most destructive farm pest 
because it can attack 250 different varieties of fruit and 
vegetables

a mistrial motion was filed friday on behalf 
of a defendant in the enrique camarena murder case because a 
newspaper article allegedly found in the jury room may have 
influenced deliberations 
edward medvene the attorney for ruben zuno arce also claimed 
government officials may have influenced the jury by conducting 
some sort of formal monitoring system in order to allegedly 
ensure the jurors safety 
medvene also alleged members of the us marshals staff walked 
in and out of the jury deliberation room on a regular basis and 
that one of them asked the jurors when they were going to come back 
with a verdict 
it is clear that any consideration by the jurors of 
information outside of the record and not in evidence is improper 
and may well have affected their deliberations andor verdict 
regarding zuno arce the motion said 
zuno the brotherinlaw of former mexican president luis 
echeverria was found guilty tuesday of kidnapping racketeering 
and aiding and abetting the escape of a fugitive he was acquitted 
of murder 
the jury is still considering charges against one defendant 
javier vasquez velasco charged with the murder of two american 
tourists 
there were hints of problems with the jury on thursday when us 
district judge edward rafeedie summoned them individually into his 
chambers for questioning 
medvene said lawyers were not notified about the problems which 
turned out to be the discovery of a newspaper article about zuno 
under questioning the lawyer said one juror admitted that the 
panel did consider information outside the record during the 
course of their deliberations 
specifically medvene said the juror told of a discussion among 
panelists in the jury room about an article which appeared in the 
los angeles times after last weeks conviction of defendant juan 
ramon matta ballesteros 
the motion did not say what the discussion was about 
the jury convicted matta a honduran business tycoon and 
convicted drug kingpin of racketeering conspiracy and kidnapping 
but acquitted him of the murder of camarena the us drug 
enforcement administration agent slain in mexico in 1985 
the jury also convicted former mexican policeman juan jose 
bernabe ramirez of kidnapping but found him innocent of murder

prime minister vp singh won a vote of 
confidence from his governing coalition friday ending a political 
crisis over his dismissal of devi lal a powerful deputy prime 
minister 
there was no dissent said ram jethmalani a senior leader 
of the janata dal party after an hourlong meeting of parliament 
members and other leaders of the governing national front coalition 
singh fired devi lal on wednesday a move that could have split 
the janata dal and toppled the government fears eased thursday 
after senior party leaders and devi lal said they supported singhs 
action 
devi lal a popular rural politician who was no 2 man in the 
government until his dismissal from the cabinet said he would 
return to power but would not try to divide the janata dal 
singh ordered devi lals dismissal for circulating an allegedly 
forged letter that accused a cabinet rival of accepting kickbacks 
from multinational firms 
he also criticized devi lals interview with a weekly news 
magazine in which devi lal called singh spineless and 
described other cabinet ministers as wimps and cheerleaders

gov james r thompson on friday asked for 
federal disaster relief for businesses on chicagos west side that 
were hit by a threeday blackout last weekend 
in a letter to the us small business administration thompson 
said it is crucial that the government help the 40000 utility 
customers including 2000 small businesses affected by the 
blackout 
this area of the city is particularly depressed economically 
a large portion of the residents are receiving public assistance 
he wrote federal involvement in the form of subsidized loans is 
crucial 
mayor richard m daley said losses from the blackout may amount 
to millions of dollars 
meanwhile a spokesman for commonwealth edison co disputed a 
lawsuit filed by the city thursday that charges the utilitys was 
negligent in failing to properly maintain a transformer 
edison spokesman john hogan said there was no evidence of 
negligence 
they seem to be jumping to conclusions that no investigator 
has come to yet hogan said in the absence of any proof of 
negligence the courts have historically thrown these types of 
cases out 
alderman jesus garcia filed the action asking for unspecified 
damages for the 38000 residential customers and 2000 businesses 
that lost power after a fire in utility equipment on saturday 
this is not an act of god said james fennerty an attorney 
who filed the lawsuit it could have been prevented it should 
have been prevented there must have been some negligence even if 
we cant prove it 
garcia said if the plaintiffs are successful in court 
restitution could range from 50 for residents to several thousand 
dollars for businesses that lost sales and perishable items

a new technique that allows diagnosis of 
inherited diseases in an unfertilized human egg before conception 
is being described as an important step toward the prevention of 
genetic diseases 
on friday researchers reported that they had diagnosed cystic 
fibrosis in a human egg before conception they said the technique 
could be used with many other inherited ailments including 
muscular dystrophy hemophilia and sickle cell anemia 
the technique could satisfy some abortion opponents objections 
to fetal diagnosis said yury verlinsky director of the 
reproductive genetics institute at illinois masonic medical center 
in chicago 
these diseases can now be diagnosed in the fetus before birth 
but such diagnosis often leaves the parents with no option but to 
terminate the pregnancy if the fetus carries the disease

despite foreign investors recent disinterest in 
us treasury securities economists expect them to resume buying 
at the upcoming quarterly auction of new notes and bonds 
foreign investors sold more treasury securities than they bought 
in the first quarter of 1990 the first time there were net sales 
since the third quarter of 1988 according to the securities 
industry association 
but nicholas sargen an international economist at solomon 
brothers inc said to the extent weve gotten past 
participation i wouldnt be surprised to see some buying at 
the auction 
the us treasury is scheduled to sell a record 3225 billion 
of three and 10year notes and 30year bonds tuesday wednesday 
and thursday to help refinance the federal deficit 
this quarters amount surpasses last quarters record 305 
billion 
sargen said that while the trend has been toward less foreign 
buying in the us treasuries market foreign investors 
particularly japanese try to concentrate their buying on the 
refunding 
as brokerdealers they are obligated to make a bid at the 
auction also those seeking liquidity usually choose to buy the 
latest issue 
foreign investors reasons for staying away from the us market 
have been good yields on government bonds in other countries 
offer them better returns 
for instance this past week west germanys 10year bond was 
yielding 8 percent about 016 percentage point more than the us 
10year note also the spread between the us 10year note and 
the comparable japanese bond has been narrowing 
most notably canada japan the netherlands singapore and 
australia sold 65 billion more us treasury securities than 
they bought in the first three months of the year according to the 
sia 
but economists warn that foreign investors who are spreading 
the word they might not do much buying during the auction could be 
trying to push down the price so they can get bargains and higher 
yields 
you never know until the actual event to what extent they 
actually participate said irwin kellner chief economist at 
manufacturers hanover trust co 
government reports of a soft economy could help domestic buying 
sentiment at the auction as investors seek the fixed interestrate 
notes and bonds predicting the federal reserve will bring down 
interest rates to prevent the nation from falling into a recession 
bad economic news might encourage enough domestic investors to 
buy the securities to make up for any shortage of foreign 
investors said marilyn schaja a money market economist at 
donaldson lufkin amp jenrette securities corp 
last week the commerce department reported the index of leading 
economic indicators was unchanged in june many economists had 
expected the index designed to forecast economic activity six to 
nine months in advance would increase slightly 
also the labor department said the unemployment rate jumped to 
55 percent in july the highest in two years and further evidence 
of a weakening economy

a sustained rise in oil prices due to iraqs 
invasion of kuwait and speculation about further aggression 
threatens a global economic slowdown higher inflation and rising 
interest rates experts say 
however the industrial world is much less vulnerable to oil 
shocks than it was in the 1970s when arab oil embargoes rattled 
western economies they said 
the situation will be different even in the worst case 
scenario it is unlikely that oil prices will jump on a sustained 
basis as they did then said michael hughes an economist at the 
london investment firm barclays de zoete wedd 
but hughes added the impact on the world economy could still 
be quite significant 
at the very least the developments will bring unwelcome 
uncertainty to the global economic outlook 
iraqs invasion of kuwait on thursday sent the spot price 
soaring for north sea brent blend the most widely traded 
international crude the oil traded at above 24 a barrel by late 
friday in london 
that was some 50 percent higher than the price of nearly 16 a 
barrel on july 12 when iraqi president saddam hussein began 
threatening to take action against kuwait 
iraq accused its muchsmaller neighbor of stealing oil from 
border areas and of costing iraq billions of dollars in lost 
revenue by overproducing crude and helping to depress world oil 
prices 
the proximity of iraqi troops to the border with saudi arabia 
late in the week raised further speculation of threats to supplies 
geoff pyne an oil analyst with ubs phillips and drew said 
under the bestcase scenario based on current supplies oil prices 
should settle at 21 to 22 a barrel 
if supplies are seriously disrupted prices could reach 30 a 
barrel he said levels crude reached in the mid1980s before a 
sustained price drop pummeled oil producers 
the most vulnerable country is japan which imports 99 percent 
of its oil economists say 
the arab oil embargo after the 1973 arabisraeli war set back 
japans economic growth with skyrocketing oil prices inflation and 
cutbacks in industrial production 
if oil prices rise to at least 25 a barrel and maintain that 
level through next year japans economic growth could fall to 36 
percent instead of the expected 39 percent next year and its 
annual inflation could rise to 28 percent instead of 21 percent 
said stephen king international economist at the london investment 
firm james capel and co 
in the united states where the economy already has shown signs 
of slipping into a recession economic growth could be 15 percent 
next year instead of the forecast 2 percent king said inflation 
could be 52 percent instead of 475 percent 
in the united states you can wonder whether an oil shock if 
there is to be an oil shock is the straw that breaks the camel 
back king said it does appear the chances of recession are 
increasing anyway 
germany should still have growth of 4 percent and inflation of 
35 percent next year king said but interest rates could rise in 
germany as well as in japan he said 
they have plenty of reasons already to tighten policy and the 
oil price could be an extra reason king said 
the united states will be torn between wanting to lower interest 
rates to spur growth and wanting to raise them to counter the 
inflationary pressures of higher oil prices king said 
the temptation will be to leave interest rates unchanged which 
could slow growth enough to tip the united states into recession 
he said 
joe roseman a british economist at ubs phillips and drew said 
a sustained 25 a barrel oil price could mean british economic 
growth of 17 percent instead of 19 percent next year and 
inflation of 65 percent instead of 55 percent 
also threatened are developing economies and eastern european 
countries which are attempting to turn themselves into market 
economies 
but oil prices havent risen proportionally anywhere near as 
much as in the 1970s oil shocks king said 
in the 1979 oil price shock prompted by the iranian revolution 
oil prices nearly tripled to an annual average of nearly 37 a 
barrel from 13 pyne said 
in the 1973 price rise blamed on the arab oil embargo prices 
almost quadrupled from 280 a barrel to 1040 he said 
currently there is a world oil glut and a slowdown in economic 
growth in the past two years has eased demand for oil the experts 
said 
furthermore the 1970s energy crises prompted further 
development of alternate sources of oil and other forms of energy 
and conservation methods they said

the convulsions in the middle east stirred 
unhappy memories of price shocks of 1974 and 1979 the specter of 
2agallon gas cars queued up around the block no gas signs 
on pumps 
experts say thats highly unlikely 
but for independent gas station owners like bob horick in 
minnetonka minn iraqs invasion of neighboring kuwait this past 
week hit quickly his customers havent felt the impact yet but he 
has 
thats because wholesale prices for gasoline moved up nationwide 
after iraq stormed through its opec neighbor thursday provoking 
fears of a world supply crunch 
analysts reported jumps of 5 cents to 12 cents a gallon or more 
for wholesale gasoline even in places minnesota which gets most 
of its oil from canada and california which is supplied from 
oilrich alaska 
the increase in wholesale prices followed rises on spot oil 
markets worldwide they occurred even though oil companies were 
selling existing inventories horicks supplier raised prices 5 
cents a gallon at noon and another 2 cents at midnight 
horick dispatched a truck to a pipeline terminal in roseville 
minn to try to buy gasoline at old prices but trucks were lined 
up for more than two miles he made the purchase at an extra cost 
of 595 a load 
so horick just passed on the extra 6 cents a gallon cost to 
consumers right wrong he kept the retail price of unleaded 
gasoline at 1099 a gallon at his stations in st paul and 
hutchinson minn 50 miles west of the twin cities 
major oil companies set the tone for small retailers 
competition dictates that only when the big companies raise prices 
can the little guy match them if horick ups his price first he 
risks fewer customers and less secondary business in candy soft 
drinks cigarettes and road maps 
there isnt a retailer in this country who wants to be the 
first to raise his price on the street said brian ettesvold 
executive director of the minnesota service stations association in 
st paul 
but the effect of higher crude prices doesnt hit major oil 
companies for about three months the time it takes them to refine 
existing crude in the interim they can absorb a hit at the pumps 
by raising wholesale prices 
they can really hurt the independents at a time like this 
horick said 
kevin lindemer an energy analyst with cambridge research 
associates in cambridge mass said the panicky atmosphere and 
increased demand during the summer driving season doesnt help 
now that theres a perception in the market that prices are 
going up everybody scrambles to fill their inventory he said 
theres also the fear factor that if i dont fill up now the 
price is going to be a lot higher tomorrow 
to avoid a rapid depletion of stocks and discourage panic 
buying some wholesalers quickly allocated supplies to ensure an 
even distribution while others have stopped making deliveries 
altogether 
service station groups say the average us gas tank is half 
full if every driver filled up at once it would take 30 to 60 
days to refine enough crude oil to replenish the nations gasoline 
inventories they say 
short of a nationwide panic energy analysts said the worlds 
oil production system today makes the likelihood of a repeat of the 
troubles of the 1970s unlikely 
for one thing there are no signs of a large cutoff in oil 
supplies because of the iraqi invasion 
in the first five months of 1990 the united states imported 
610000 barrels of oil a day from iraq less than 8 percent of 
total imports and 120000 barrels a day from kuwait less than one 
half of 1 percent 
domestic crude oil stocks are at their highest level in eight 
years lindemer said surplus production capacity in other countries 
could quickly make up for losses from kuwait or iraq including 2 
million barrels outside the persian gulf region 
in 1979 the iranian revolution cut off the countrys 6 million 
barrels a day from world markets in 1974 the united states 
embargoed oil imports from the arab world production capacity 
elsewhere was thin in contrast to todays market 
and no one is anxious to repeat the recession that accompanied 
both 70s oil crises 
everybody is well aware what very high oil prices did to the 
consuming as well as producing economies lindemer said 
everybody is trying to head that off 
in other business and economic news this past week 
economic reports were gloomy contributing to declines in the 
stock market the government said its index of leading economic 
indicators was unchanged in june construction spending held steady 
and the nations unemployment rate jumped to 55 percent in july a 
private study of purchasing managers activity pointed to a 
sluggish manufacturing sector 
the ballooning cost of bailing out the nations savings and 
loans ballooned even more the bush administration said the cleanup 
would require about 100 million in the next 12 months officials 
said junk bond losses alone from thrifts seized by the government 
would exceed 1 billion congress meanwhile approved legislation 
to increase prison terms for sampl cheats 
general motors corp chairman roger smith drove the secretive 
saturn car off an assembly line in a closed ceremony retiring 
after 41 years with gm he was succeeded by robert stempel

visions of a pair of old nemeses recession and 
energy crisis are back haunting the investment markets of wall 
street 
the chill they created spread through world financial centers 
after iraq invaded kuwait this past week driving oil prices 
sharply higher 
suddenly wall street veterans were recounting tales of the 
1970s when stocks and bonds languished under the influence of a 
slumping domestic economy and a runaway rise in the price of oil 
from american investors point of view there could scarcely be 
any good time for a new flareup of trouble in the middle east 
but iraqs action struck many analysts as especially 
inopportune coming as it did when evidence was starting to 
accumulate fast that the us economy was turning weaker than 
almost anyone had thought just a few weeks ago 
on friday the labor department reported that nonfarm payroll 
employment fell by 219000 in july surprising analysts who had 
been looking for a modest increase the civilian unemployment rate 
jumped threetenths of a percentage point to 55 percent 
a sustained simultaneous rise in oil prices and unemployment 
would stand to compound the problems facing the federal reserve in 
setting its monetary policy 
increasing joblessness would seem to mandate moves to ease 
credit and thus cushion the potential effects of a recession but 
the inflationary impact of higher energy prices could stymie any 
effort by the fed to lower longterm interest rates 
in the midst of this crossfire would stand the banking system 
already burdened by the strains of a retrenchment from the credit 
boom of the 80s 
twice in the past two weeks the dow jones industrial average 
has suffered intraday declines of more than 100 points 
but on the second occasion on friday some analysts said the 
market was simply jumping around wildly in reaction to breaking 
news from the middle east rather than providing any reliable gauge 
of a lasting shift in investor sentiment 
i dont think it was so much a panic as a desire to get to 
safety before the market closed for the weekend said william 
lefevre an analyst at advest inc we have a global market with 
instant communications but diplomacy takes time 
at the close on friday dow joness average of 30 blue chips 
stood at 280965 down 8886 points from the week before 
the new york stock exchange composite index fell 450 to 18882 
the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market dropped 
2511 to 41746 and the american stock exchange market value index 
was down 886 at 34663 
volume on the big board averaged 20851 million shares a day up 
from 17172 million the week before 
as events unfolded in the middle east and the economy some 
analysts declared that a recession was increasingly imminent or 
even under way 
david a levy and s jay levy economists in chappaqua ny 
rated recession a 60 percent probability even before the new 
conflict in the middle east flared up 
an economic storm is threatening they asserted the most 
visible black clouds are decreasing unit retail sales the housing 
recession and stagnant employment 
other more optimistic observers say the fed will move swiftly 
to combat recession if the economic indicators keep worsening that 
could set up a stern test of the central banks powers over an 
economy driven by worldwide forces

northwest airlines moving to counter rising 
jet fuel prices said friday it will add a flat oneway surcharge 
of 8 to the price of domestic tickets beginning aug 9 
the surcharge stems directly from increases in jet fuel costs 
incurred by the carrier since iraqi troops invaded oilrich kuwait 
said northwest spokesman bob gibbons 
this will give us a chance to see what happens in the next few 
days gibbons said this is not intended to be a permanent 
increase and its certainly adjustable 
fuel prices have jumped 8 cents a gallon and are expected to 
rise even higher because of uncertainty in the persian gulf 
gibbons predicted other airlines would follow northwests lead 
as jet fuel costs continue to rise the effect of the uncertainty 
in the middle east is clear it packs a pretty big wallop he 
said 
the surcharge will be reviewed periodically and could jump even 
higher said gibbons 
he said northwest is also considering adding a similar surcharge 
to its international flights fuel surcharges do not require 
governmewnt approval for domestic flights 
fuel costs are a major contributor to the operating expenses of 
all airlines said jack van der wege senior director of fuel 
administration crude oil prices have jumped considerably since 
wednesday and will be sharply higher in august than was previously 
anticipated 
fuel is northwests secondlargest cost accounting for about 17 
percent of its operating expenses in january the eaganbased 
carrier announced similar surcharges to offset rising jet fuel 
costs but withdrew them additional before they went into effect
