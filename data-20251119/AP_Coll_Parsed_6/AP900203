after more than 27 years makaziwe 
mandelaamuah is happy to be getting her father back 
but the 35yearold daughter of jailed african national congress 
leader nelson mandela says the release doesnt mean the struggle 
has ended in south africa 
apartheid is not over today she said after south african 
president fw de klerk announced friday in a speech to parliament 
that mandela would be released unconditionally although he set no 
date 
the historic changes will be meaningless until apartheid is 
totally destroyed until the conditions of the people in south 
africa improve and all the illegal laws that have declared us 
inferior noncitizens in the land of our birth are totally 
dismantled said mandela who is known as maki 
at a news conference at the university of massachusetts where 
she is a fulbright scholar studying anthropology maki mandela said 
she got up at 3 am to watch the broadcast live on cable 
television 
even if it didnt happen today the thought that i will have a 
father back that he will be a free man again is very very good 
news to me she said 
in his address to parliament de klerk also legalized the anc 
after 30 years of guerrilla war against white rule and said he 
would lift bans on more than 30 other opposition groups 
the announcements appeared to clear the way for talks on a new 
constitution that would end the black majoritys exclusion from 
national politics 
maki mandela said the reforms announced were a landmark but the 
news she found most exciting was the promise of her fathers 
pending release 
mandela 71 has been jailed since 1962 on charges he helped 
plan the start of the ancs sabotage and bombing campaign 
i think for many people in the international community my 
father is a symbol of the liberation struggle she said 
i think that hes a source of encouragement to many people in 
the world and they are amazed that a man who has been in prison for 
more than 27 years can still be so dedicated to fight and bring an 
evil system down to its knees 
maki mandela the youngest of three children from mandelas 
first marriage said she has no immediate plans to fly back to 
south africa because she must finish her studies she last saw her 
father during a visit over the summer

the roman catholic churchs decision to ban 
the traditional draping of an american flag on the coffins of war 
veterans or police officers has drawn fire from veterans groups 
there are a lot of people who feel strongly that either dad or 
uncle charley or whoever received these war medals and should have 
the right to a flag if they want it said hank bradley commander 
of the american legions norfolk county district 
a vaticanapproved revision of the funeral liturgy took effect 
dec 3 it specifically spelled out a ban on secular symbols which 
had been stated less clearly in an earlier liturgy 
we believe the eucharist or the mass is so central to faith 
that only christian symbols can be used said msgr dennis 
sheehan director of the boston archdiocesan office for family 
worship 
the casket may be draped with a flag during the wake but it 
must be replaced with a white cloth before the funeral the flag 
may be returned to the casket after the service 
john walsh a spokesman for cardinal bernard law said some 
veterans groups had already contacted the archdiocese to object 
some will apparently misunderstand this as a denigration of 
patriotism he said it is no such thing i dont want to make 
light of what the veterans are feeling but they should try to look 
at the intent of this particular norm 
but veterans groups disagree 
its terrible if someone served in the war and theyre a 
veteran like my husband i think they should have the right to have 
the flag draped over them said anne torrance a member of the 
american legion auxiliary

members of a presidential commission say a 
costly new device to detect explosives at airports is flawed and 
probably could not have found the terrorist bomb which destroyed 
pan am flight 103 over lockerbie scotland 
members of the presidential commission on aviation security and 
terrorism complained friday that the giant and heavy bomb detectors 
being deployed at major us and foreign airports have not been 
adequately tested 
several members said at a hearing the devices should not be 
installed at hundreds of airports until their reliability can be 
guaranteed 
but monte belger associate administrator of the federal 
aviation administration said the sophisticated detection device is 
the best of its kind has gone through enough tests and should be 
set up soon to make airports more secure 
it is not perfect and we know it belger said it 
would be a mistake not to continue to deploy it it is wrong to 
wait for the perfect machine 
at an allday hearing the commission also was told the device 
which uses a technique called thermal neutron analysis or tna 
will cost far more than original estimates of between 700000 to 
1 million each 
belger said the first five tna machines actually will cost a 
total of 15 million or about 3 million each because of the rush 
order 
a tna system employing an 18foot high tenton detector is 
inspecting baggage at kennedy international airport in new york a 
second system was installed at miami international airport last 
week and is being calibrated a third tna machine is to be 
installed at gatwick airport near london next month and another is 
being planned for washington dulles international airport 
i think there is a lot of flimflam going on said sen 
alphonse damato rny a commission member saying the tna has 
incredible deficiencies 
the tna looks good but it does not do what it is supposed to 
do damato said congress has been sold a bill of goods 
there is a reduced ability to detect plastic explosives at the 
levels believed to have been used at lockerbie 
investigators believe the lockerbie crash on dec 21 1988 was 
caused by less than a pound of plastic explosives inside a portable 
tape player the crash killed 259 people aboard the boeing 747 
aircraft and 11 people on the ground 
hadi bozorgmanesh vice president of science applications 
international corp defended the tna device his company developed 
saying the accusation that the machine cannot detect bombs as small 
as two pounds is absolutely false 
he said the machine has a 94 percent reliability rate and we 
would like to get closer to 100 percent and to detect smaller 
amounts of explosives with better accuracy 
i totally agree that the system is not perfect but its far 
better than anything else that can be demonstrated he said 
damato said setting the device to detect a lockerbiesized bomb 
would set off so many false alarms you would have a system which 
is inoperative 
science magazine which first reported in august that the tna 
machines would not be able to detect a lockerbiesized bomb said 
the devices are being set at a sensitivity to detect about 2 
pounds of explosives 
the tna machines probe luggage for the presence of nitrogen a 
major component of explosives a problem with the tna system is 
that some types of fabric leather and such things as plastic ski 
boots can have nitrogen densities as high as explosives

the drug scourge is beginning to pass and 
the government is well on its way to winning the war against 
narcotics national drug policy director william j bennett says 
the war is by no means over but it is clearly winnable and 
the momentum i think is shifting our way bennett told the 
senate judiciary committee on friday 
he said there is still too much bad news but there are also 
scattered but clear signs that we are beginning to win the 
scourge is beginning to pass if we keep up our efforts indeed 
intensify our efforts we are going to win 
bennett said when he became head of the effort a year ago it 
was by no means certain that we would win it but he said my 
view has changed 
his remarks did not stray beyond what the bush administration 
unveiled last week in the second installment of its antidrug 
strategy calling for a 106 billion budget in the fiscal year 
that begins oct 1 
senators of both parties did not bicker over details of the 
administrations plan 
but chairman joseph biden ddel did ask bennett to comment on 
an alternative strategy biden wrote it calls for putting more 
stress on hardcore users education treatment and a onetime 
program to forgive international debt owed by andean nations if 
farmers plant other crops in place of the coca they normally 
produce 
bennett agreed with most biden proposals and said differences 
were largely a matter of emphasis but he said that if forced to 
choose between education and enforcement he would strengthen 
enforcement 
the former secretary of education said his background is a 
helpful auxiliary 
i know children bennett said that may not be a very rosy 
view of children but i do know children 
it seems to me that its more than a helpful auxiliary sen 
paul simon dill said you talk to leroy martin the 
superintendent of police in chicago and hell tell you that 
education should be the centerpiece 
sen edward m kennedy dmass pressed bennett on why the 
administration did not bar the import of semiautomatic assault 
pistols which are often only slightly different from the 
semiautomatic assault rifles the government does not allow to be 
imported 
the question sparked an exchange similar to fiery arguments over 
firearms that have arisen at past judiciary committee hearings 
between bennett and sens kennedy and howard metzenbaum dohio 
why are you silent why are you quiet kennedy demanded 
because i have given my advice to the president senator and 
that is where it should lie bennett said 
kennedy pressed ahead reminding bennett at one point that 
police are in danger of being targets of assault pistols bennett 
said the issue was highly complex and criminals would always be 
able to get guns while other people had good reason to possess 
weapons 
the world is awash in guns senator bennett said this is 
a cheap symbolic victory that you are interested in that has 
nothing to do with reality

president bush says us sanctions against 
south africa should be reviewed in light of president fw de 
klerks reform announcements but he wants to see more specifics 
before scaling back the sanctions 
im sure that well have a lot of debate and discussion inside 
the administration as to what the next move by the united states 
ought to be bush told reporters i am one who has not favored 
additional sanctions so im perfectly willing to review things as 
new developments take place 
bush said he would look particularly for the freeing of 
imprisoned african nationalist leader nelson mandela 
i think when people move in the right direction its 
certainly timely to review all policy but we havent gotten into 
any specifics on that at this point we want to see the policy 
initiatives go forward and the release of mandela he said 
de klerk announced friday that he would free mandela a 
political prisoner for 27 years and lift the ban on mandelas 
outlawed african national congress and other political opposition 
organizations 
de klerk announced a series of other reform measures but they 
stopped short of what the united states would require to lift the 
sanctions said us officials 
under us law the president can suspend or modify the 
sanctions if mandela and other political prisoners are freed and 
other specific conditions are met 
all are essential in ending apartheid and restoring justice 
said rep william h gray iii dpa 
some members of congress urged bush to keep the sanctions in 
place noting south africas system of racial apartheid is still 
intact 
the sanctions should be maintained in full force this is no 
time to relax them said sen edward m kennedy dmass 
apartheid is crumbling as the berlin wall crumbled only a few 
months ago kennedy said adding the sanctions had helped 
pressure south africa into changes 
the economic sanctions include a ban on us imports of 
textiles coal uranium steel and agricultural products and 
prohibition of new us investment in south africa landing rights 
for south african airlines and new bank loans to the country 
pretoria in recent weeks has freed several political prisoners 
and prominent opposition leaders 
sen richard lugar rind former chairman of the senate 
foreign relations committee said de klerk had made a bold stroke 
for freedom but that bush has promised to consult with congress 
before he takes any action 
lugar added the trend in events is south africa has been a 
strong one toward negotiation 
in washington the rev jesse jackson said we must balance 
hope with caution caution because the structure of apartheid is 
still in place and nelson mandela is still in jail 
randall robinson executive director of transafrica a 
washington lobbying organization said celebration would be 
premature as long as the apartheid system remains in place as 
it does we must sustain in the united states the imposition of 
economic sanctions 
as rumors of mandelas imminent release circulated white house 
press secretary marlin fitzwater has said president bush would 
invite him to the white house and invite de klerk in a separate 
visit 
there was talk last year of a visit by de klerk to washington 
but it failed to materialize in the face of controversy over 
whether bush should receive a leader whose government enforces 
official apartheid policies of racial separation 
bush reacted to the news from south africa as he was leaving 
friday for a trip to raleigh nc and knoxville tenn to 
spotlight his budget proposals on science and research and 
development 
the president said the news from south africa was quite 
positive 
im very encouraged by some of the changes that have taken 
place and certainly by representations yesterday by mr de klerk 
he said 
the bush administration has made few public pronouncements on 
south africa maintaining opposition to the apartheid policies but 
not taking any new initiatives in the region

authorities have decided not to cut off 
the limbs of 12 prisoners condemned to that punishment under 
islamic law and similar cases are under review the chief justice 
said 
the sudan news agency said friday that chief justice kamil ali 
lutfi had also ordered retrials for some people sentenced to 
various punishments under islamic law 
the news agency gave no reason for lutfis actions however lt 
gen omar hassan elbashirs 7monthold military government has 
come under strong criticism from the amnesty international human 
rights group and other western agencies and governments for alleged 
violations of human rights 
in 1983 sudan began a strict interpretation of islamic law 
which decrees that a thiefs limbs must amputated an adultress 
must be stoned to death and people who drink alcohol must be 
flogged 
murder was made punishable by death unless the victims kin 
accepts payment from the culprit 
however lutfi has begun reviewing dozens of such sentences 
imposed under the tough islamic penal code which is called hudud 
the news agency said 
we will reconsider those sentences he was quoted as saying 
on thursday the first day of luftis review he told 12 inmates 
each sentenced to having an arm and leg lopped off that he was 
changing their punishments to prison terms of five to 10 years 
the change triggered speculation that the move was made under 
pressure from moderate military men inside and outside the ruling 
15member junta to get the government to improve its image 
president gaafar nimeiri deposed by the military in 1985 after 
a 16year rule imposed islamic law in 1983 several dozen people 
convicted of theft had limbs cut off in the 20 months before his 
overthrow 
nimeiris action brought criticism from neighboring egypt and 
western countries including the united states it also has added 
fuel to a southern rebellion launched by the sudan peoples 
liberation army 
after nimeiris fall courts continued to hand down sentences in 
accordance with the hudud but the sentences were not carried out 
and remained suspended until the chief justices review began on 
thursday 
police brig gen alkamil m soleiman of the prisons 
administration said there were 40 convicts in jail who must pay 
money to the families of murder victims 
another 37 prisoners had been sentenced to limb amputations and 
were waiting for them to be carried out he said 
the news agency quoted lutfi as saying he had ordered ordered 
retrials for some of those sentenced under hudud he did not 
specify the number

the state departments annual human rights 
report doesnt pull any punches in describing abuses by china 
in its crackdown on the prodemocracy movement according to a 
congressional source familiar with the report 
the frankness of the document surprised some congressional 
figures who expected the bush administration to mute criticism of 
china as it presses for better relations with beijing 
it describes every human rights crime you can think of a 
source who had seen the unreleased report said friday night 
murders disappearances executions suppression of labor 
rights religious persecution of catholics and buddhists slave 
labor camps in western china you name it its in there said 
the source speaking on condition of anonymity 
the administration has asserted it is important to maintain a 
dialogue with chinese leaders to encourage liberalization 
bush successfully vetoed a bill protecting chinese students 
against deportation arguing he had accomplished the same 
objectives through administrative action and has sent highlevel 
emissaries to china twice since last summers bloody suppression of 
demonstrators in tiananmen square 
we expected in light of those visits that they might go 
somewhat easy on the chinese but they didnt said a second 
congressional source who also has seen the report 
the report doesnt pull any punches said the source who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
the second source said the document avoided hightemperature 
rhetoric confining itself to factual and accurate statements 
nbc news reported first on the report friday evening 
the network quoted from the document as of years end there 
were continuing reliable reports of beatings of political detainees 
in the beijing area by security forces prisoners both criminal 
and political are subjected to severe psychological pressure to 
confess 
deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger is scheduled to 
appear before the house foreign affairs committee and the senate 
foreign relations committee on successive days next week the two 
congressional sources said he was certain to be questioned about 
the document 
the annual report is given to the house or senate committees in 
alternate years and was scheduled for release feb 21 by the house 
committee 
congressional democrats and even many republicans have attacked 
bush for moving too rapidly to reestablish ties with china since 
the tiananmen square massacre and say beijing has made only 
cosmetic changes since june 
china was one of the major criticisms of house speaker thomas s 
foley dwash in responding to bushs state of the union address 
on wednesday 
earlier this week secretary of state james a baker iii in 
testimony before the senate foreign relations committee listed in 
his advance text cuba and china as countries who try to shut out 
democratic values but in actually speaking the words omitted the 
reference to china 
bush has said he was pleased by the chinese governments recent 
lifting of martial law and release of some prisoners

president bush says his decision to void 
chinas purchase of a seattle aircraft parts company was made on 
national security grounds and not to discourage chinese investment 
in the united states 
bush on friday ordered the divestiture of the mamco 
manufacturing co of seattle by the china national aerotechnology 
import and export corp which is owned by the chinese government 
bushs action on mamco which manufactures metal parts for 
aircraft upheld the recommendation of an interagency panel 
in a report to congress bush said his action was based on a 
particular transaction and does not reflect a policy shift 
it does not change our open investment policy and is not a 
precedent for the future with regard to direct investment of the 
united states from the peoples republic of china or any other 
country bush said 
even so his move was likely to help mute widespread criticism 
in congress that bush has been too conciliatory toward the beijing 
government since its brutal crackdown on chinas prodemocracy 
movement 
citing credible confidential information bush negated the 
december 1988 acquisition on national security grounds the chinese 
corporation was given three months to sell all its holdings in the 
company with the possibility of a single threemonth extension 
bushs order invoked for the first time a provision of a 1988 
trade law that gives the president power to restrict foreign 
investment in the united states if the nations security may be 
harmed 
the president ordered the chinese government to sell the company 
because continued control of mamco might threaten to impair the 
national security the white house said in a statement it did 
not elaborate on what harm might result from the chinese ownership 
the action came a week after bushs veto of a bill extending 
visas of chinese students in the united states was narrowly 
sustained by the senate bush called the legislation an 
infringement on his presidential foreign policy prerogatives 
but some members of congress argued bush has acted too quickly 
to step up contacts with the beijing government which they said 
has done little to loosen its staunch control since the tiananmen 
square crackdown last june 
sanctions bush imposed after the crackdown bar all military 
sales to china however bushs order on friday did not allege a 
violation of those sanctions in the relationship between mamco and 
china 
the interagency panel that reviewed mamco found the seattle 
company which reported 20 million in sales in 1988 was involved 
with sensitive materials that could have military applications 
said officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
the chinese corporation is part of the chinese ministry of 
aerospace industry it has business dealings with various us 
companies in several sectors including commercial aircraft 
the white house statement said 
bush acted under the socalled exonflorio provision of 1988 
trade legislation that allows a president to intervene to bar 
foreign investment in the united states on national security 
grounds 
the legislation is named after sen james exon dneb and 
former rep james florio dnj now the governor of new jersey

the bush administration should kill plans to 
upgrade its landbased nuclear missile force if a ussoviet pact 
is signed on strategic weapons and mobile missiles say three 
former chairmen of the joint chiefs of staff 
i just dont see the great need for modernization of that 
element right now retired gen david jones who served as joint 
chiefs chairman in the early 1980s told the senate armed services 
committee on friday 
asked whether one part of the strategic deterrent could be 
dropped the former chairmen agreed on drastically scaling back 
plans to build more multiplewarhead railbased mx missiles and to 
deploy the new singlewarhead midgetman 
i would cancel the two landbased missiles said retired 
gen john vessey who was joint chiefs chairman in the mid1980s 
i think the idea that someones going to attack our silobased 
missile forces its just not reasonable now 
retired adm william crowe who stepped down last october as 
chairman of the joint chiefs agreed with vessey and noted the 
united states has a mobile missile in the field the seaborne 
mobile missile on submarines 
the comments by the former military leaders prompted the 
committees chairman sen sam nunn dga to say that unless the 
administration pushes for a ban on multiplewarhead missiles in a 
strategic arms control pact he would not support the mx and 
midgetman 
i sold a lot of people on that people on both sides of this 
issue that i thought a ban on mobile multiple warheads was 
going to be forthcoming from the white house nunn said 
there is no way that i can support two missiles this year with 
the current arms control position that we have 
the united states and soviet union are working on a treaty that 
would cut their longrange nuclear arsenals by 30 percent to 50 
percent to 6000 warheads apiece 
however the two sides disagree over how to count airlaunched 
cruise missiles how to handle undeployed missiles and us 
allegations that the soviets have encoded data transmissions from 
ballistic missile tests in violation of arms accords 
secretary of state james a baker iii is expected to discuss the 
issues with soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze when the 
two meet next week in moscow 
the administrations new budget released monday proposes 
spending 28 billion to fund railbasing of the mx and 202 
million for the truckbased midgetman 
fifty mx missiles are already in silos along with the older 
minuteman longrange missile force and the administration wants to 
put 50 more mxs on rail cars to make them less vulnerable to attack 
vessey emphasized any action on the mx and midgetman should be 
done along with a strategic arms control agreement with the soviet 
union 
i would not do this without forcing them to give up their 
mobile warheads he said 
jones suggested some money should be left in the missile 
programs for research and development 
nunn expressed dismay over the failure of the administration to 
spell out its strategy and arms control agenda especially in light 
of the collapse of communist regimes in eastern europe 
were going to have an arms control position thats out of 
sync with our strategic planning and our posture and its just a 
tragedy we cant get together on this nunn said its got to 
start with some vision coming out of the white house and the

allegedly took nude pictures of children in his care has been 
hospitalized with a slashed wrist after an apparent suicide 
attempt police said 
john shaver 56 was admitted as a psychiatric patient and 
listed in fair condition friday at broward general medical center 
after being found in a hotel bathtub with his right wrist cut said 
police spokesman ott cefkin 
meanwhile no evidence of physical abuse was found friday in the 
first of 14 children scheduled for medical and psychological exams 
after their parents identified their pictures out of 200300 nude 
photos found at shavers house one official said 
six children visited the countys sexual assault treatment 
center friday and none had been sexually assaulted said center 
director joanne richter eight more children were scheduled for 
tests today 
the pictures which do not depict sex acts or sexual poses show 
the children wet or in a wading pool and often covered with finger 
paint cefkin said more parents are expected to view the pictures 
next week 
shaver released on 5000 bond wednesday after his arrest 
sunday admits owning the pictures that police confiscated but does 
not consider them pornography he faces five counts of possessing 
child pornography for magazines found at his home just across the 
street from his rainbow learning center 
possessing child pornography is a thirddegree felony in florida 
and punishable by a maximum fiveyear prison sentence said dave 
casey of the fort lauderdale state attorneys office 
shaver who checked into the guest quarters hotel thursday was 
found friday in the tub dressed only in shorts his right wrist had 
been cut with a serrated knife blade in the room police found 
seven empty 1ounce liquor bottles and two notes

children and said it was easier to kill himself than deal with the 
situation cefkin said the second note apologized to the hotel 
staff for the mess he would leave 
police also found a copy of the search warrant of his home and a 
printout of his moneymarket account which showed shaver was 
quite wealthy cefkin said 
the children identified in the photos reported to the sexual 
assault treatment center for medical tests and interviews director 
richter said the medical tests are mostly to alleviate the fears 
of the parents and rule out the possibility of actual sexual 
abuse she said 
although the photographs themselves are not pornographic under 
the law they could lead to sexual exploitation accusations against 
shaver if the evidence meets that criteria cefkin said 
our primary interest is the children he said were not 
going to subject a child to the criminal justice system if its not 
warranted 
broward county officials shut down shavers daycare center 
thursday contending shaver lacked good moral character 
shaver opened the daycare center in 1985 for children ages 3 to 
5 thirty children mostly 4 and 5 attended the center at the time

in 1984 in hawaii shaver pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge 
of operating a daycare center without a license the plea came a 
year after the state of hawaii revoked his license amid allegations 
that he fondled several young girls at his center he was never 
criminally charged and shaver denied any wrongdoing

control of the nations embassy in the united states after a 
federal judge ended a dispute that reflected the violent divisions 
in beirut 
us district judge harold greene on friday dismissed a lawsuit 
by the former lebanese ambassador to washington an ally of the 
lebanese christian military leader gen michel aoun 
hours later the embassy was turned over to hrawi 
representatives said the secret service which is responsible for 
security at embassies 
the transition occurred smoothly and there were no 
difficulties said secret service spokesman rich adams although 
he said there was some shouting between the two factions as they 
were watched closely by secret service officers 
greene ruled that former ambassador abdallah bouhabib who was 
trying to avoid being evicted was given adequate notice that the 
united states was recognizing hrawis new government greene denied 
the request for a preliminary injunction by a lebanese faction to 
which bouhabib remains loyal 
the hrawi government has designated the former lebanese consul 
in washington bassam naamani as charge daffaires pending the 
arrival of a new ambassador naamani has been working in a 
commercial office arranged by the arab league 
bouhabib became lebanese ambassador to the united states in 
1983 hrawi was elected president on nov 24 and dismissed aoun 
who refuses to recognize the rival christian government 
when a group of demonstrators supporting aoun temporarily 
occupied parts of the embassy in washington jan 22 bouhabib was 
told the us government would send law enforcement personnel to 
the premises the next day to remove him and all those attached to 
the aoun regime 
the aoun faction filed suit against the secretary of state 
in court papers the state department said it notified bouhabib 
dec 11 that he was no longer lebanese ambassador

the school superintendent reinstated a 
teacher and librarian who were suspended after high school students 
were shown the rrated film catch22 
la cueva high school teacher joyce briscoe and librarian pauline 
jones had been suspended wednesday with pay after the film was 
shown to collegebound juniors in ms briscoes english class the 
film had been checked out of the school library 
officials said the two were reinstated friday after they learned 
that catch22 was rated pg at albuquerques manzano high 
superintendent jack bobroff said the two would return to work 
monday he said he suspended them not for disciplinary reasons 
but as standard procedure to handle potentially disruptive 
situations and in situations where school policy has not been 
strictly adhered to 
but richard d heffner chairman of the board of the 
classification and ratings administration for the motional picture 
association of america said late friday that the pg rating was a 
mistake he said in a telephone interview from los angeles that 
catch22 has always been rated r 
school guidelines released jan 10 require a committee to review 
films rated pg13 or r before they are shown the principal would 
then review the committees recommendations and make a decision an 
rrated film at a movie theater requires children under age 17 to 
be accompanied by a parent or adult guardian 
ms briscoe meanwhile said in a statement that she and ms 
jones were pleased to be returning to work she also thanked her 
colleagues and city residents for their support 
ms briscoe had sparked controversy last fall when she showed 
students with parental permission the last temptation of 
christ which some religious groups find offensive 
la cueva student body president randy puro one of ms briscoes 
students said before the reinstatement that students had believed 
their rights as individuals have been taken away 
if people think movies are going to corrupt kids as far as 
im concerned the news on tv is going to corrupt kids he said 
la cueva students and teachers circulated petitions supporting 
the two and the albuquerque federation of teachers had filed a 
grievance asking that ms briscoe and ms jones be immediately 
reinstated 
school board president diego gallegos said district 
administration probably overreacted to the catch22 screening 
because of the furor over last temptation 
catch22 based on joseph hellers novel of the same name 
portrays life in a us bomber squadron during world war ii the 
book is on the national advanced placement reading list for honors

members of congress are criticizing the 
insurance industry for socking the elderly with huge price 
increases for medigap health policies and say tougher 
regulation may be needed to curb price and marketing abuses 
millions of seniors spend billions of dollars each year on 
medigap policies and many are being ripped off and cheated out of 
their limited fixed incomes rep ron wyden dore told a 
senate finance subcommittee on friday 
this medigap mess has flourished because federal regulation is 
a voluntary unenforceable patchwork of legal mumbojumbo more 
loophole than law he said 
private insurance companies sell medigap policies to the elderly 
to bridge gaps in their coverage from medicare premiums are rising 
sharply this year insurers say the increases are justified because 
healthcare costs are rising and because benefits must be provided 
that previously were offered under medicares catastrophiccare 
program 
but several members of the senate subcommittee on medicare and 
longterm care questioned whether the big rate increases are 
warranted even with rising costs and the repeal of the 
catastrophiccare program

the justice department is urging a delay in 
turning over 33 excerpts from former president reagans diaries to 
irancontra defendant john poindexter and says a summary of the 
entries should be compiled for poindexters use instead

monday for reagan to give the nearly three dozen excerpts to his 
former national security adviser who is scheduled to go on trial 
feb 20 
in urging a postponement the justice department said friday

north 
indeed there may be no information in the diary entries 
covered by greenes court order that is not in the public 
domain the justice department said in a fivepage brief 
it said irancontra prosecutors and poindexters lawyers should 
attempt to draft a stipulation covering the facts contained in the 
diary entries greene can then compare the proposed stipulation 
with the diary entries to ensure that all pertinent information 
has been covered said the justice department 
a stipulation is an agreement on facts by both sides in a

were high intensity drug trafficking areas eligible for 
hundreds of additional law enforcement agents and millions of

a powerful state senator who was found 
guilty of corruption by a federal court jury now faces the prospect 
of a jury of his 38 colleagues 
a us district court jury on fridday found state sen joseph 
montoya guilty of one count of racketeering one count of money 
laundering and five counts of extortion 
he was found innocent of three other extortion counts including 
one that accused him of asking for money from actor ed asner and 
the screen actors guild in exchange for help with legislation 
montoya chairman of the senate business and professions 
committee is the first california legislator in 35 years to be 
convicted of a felony while in office 
us district judge milton schwartz set sentencing for april 26 
until then montoya will remain free on his own recognizance 
he faces a potential maximum sentence of 125 years in prison and 
a 175 million fine according to prosecutors who said they would 
ask for a prison sentence 
but the guilty verdicts did not cost montoya his senate seat it 
would take a twothirds vote of the senate to expel montoya from 
the legislature if he doesnt resign first 
defense attorney michael sands refused to say friday if montoya 
planned to step down 
senate leader david roberti of los angeles said in a brief 
statement that he would talk to montoya and convene a senate rules 
committee hearing on monday to consider montoyas status 
many said the conviction would almost certainly put more 
pressure on legislators to enact tougher standards of ethics for 
themselves 
common cause a citizens group that supports political reform 
measures said montoyas conviction further diminished the 
reputation of a once respected institution and if nothing else 
reaffirmed the need for comprehensive ethics and campaign finance 
reform legislation 
montoya who sat between his attorneys at the defense table 
seemed to pale when schwartz read the guilty verdict on the first 
count 
montoya 50 refused to speak to reporters afterwards and left 
the courthouse through a security gate as us marshals blocked the 
media 
sands said he would appeal the verdict 
jurors who deliberated 18 hours over four days said they had a 
difficult time reaching their verdicts 
it was not an easy decision said juror emily ingram of 
benicia we toiled over it a few of us lost sleep some of us 
could not eat 
montoyas former top aide amiel jaramillo was indicted with 
the senator and is scheduled to go on trial next month on 
racketeering and extortion charges

deposed panamanian dictator manuel noriega has been 
given prisonerofwar status but the us government said he still 
will face drug trafficking charges in federal court 
the government filed its response to counter defense arguments 
that civilian courts have no jurisdiction over noriega and 
codefendant luis del cid who surrendered to us troops following 
the invasion of panama 
the government intends to provide prisonerofwar treatment to 
noriega and del cid said the 39page federal document filed 
friday assistant us attorney michael sullivan said the 
government agrees the geneva convention covers the hostilities in 
panama 
but the geneva convention also allows for the prosecution of 
pows for offenses committed before the time they came into us 
custody sullivan said 
us justice department spokesman david runkel said 
prisonerofwar status means noriega can direct any complaints 
about prison conditions to a us military liaison officer already 
designated by the defense department but he will not be moved to a 
military facility 
even if noriega and del cid are considered to be prisoners of 
war within the meaning of the geneva convention they are not 
entitled to dismissal of the charges against them read the 
response filed with us district judge william hoeveler 
the judge has scheduled a hearing for thursday on the issue of 
his jurisdiction and noriegas pow status 
prior to the prosecutions response del cids attorney samuel 
burstyn filed his own motion friday demanding his clients release 
burstyn cited a federal appeals court case us vs toscanino 
which says a prisoner should be released if the court finds that 
the united states government deliberately and unreasonably 
exploited illegal conduct in an outrageous fashion 
burstyn said that should apply to the us invasion of panama 
the us government illegally dispatched 25000 agents 
members of the us armed forces and others to forcibly enter the 
republic of panama said the motion 
he said the government was in effect kidnapping him to the 
united states with the invasion 
noriega and del cid face drugtrafficking and moneylaundering 
charges in a 12count february 1988 indictment which accuses them 
of turning panama into a safe haven and shipment point for 
usbound cocaine

a swiss drug company will 
become the majority stockholder of genentech inc the worlds 
leading biotechnology company in a 21 billion deal some say will 
boost longterm research 
robert swanson founder of genentech said friday the merger 
with roche holding ltd was made because huge investments are 
needed to get new products to the market 
swanson named chairman of the board on friday said at a news 
conference announcing the transaction that the company will have 
the resources and the independence to fully deliver the dream of 
biotechnology 
swanson referred to the 14yearold companys need to be free 
from wall street pressures to deliver quarterly profits which have 
been needed to invest in products still in development and two or 
three years from term 
genentech has been the clear leader in biotechnology racking up 
profits every year since 1979 except for one and has a scientific 
staff considered the biggest and best in the field 
but the companys stock was depressed on wall street and the 
company sought a corporate partner to provide funds for development 
and meet increasing competition on its two existing products 
genentech hopes to sell more of tpa or activase which helps 
dissolve blood clots in heart attack victims and human growth 
hormone a treatment for children with pituitary dwarfism 
sales of tpa failed to live up to expectations in 1988 its 
first full year on the market the disappointing results turned 
genentech from a darling to a dog on wall street as the new 
york times characterized it and its stock plummeted 
we have so much we want to do and the quarterly pressures 
of the stock market would inevitably inhibit our abilities to take 
advantage of the brain trust that works on these 30 acres here 
said g kirk raab genentechs president and chief executive 
officer referring to company headquarters 
analysts generally hailed the agreement saying it would give 
genentech the cash it needs to invest heavily in research and free 
the company from wall street pressures 
its an incredible deal for genentech in that roche made the 
purchase not for immediate results on some products but for the 
whole overall goal of gaining the cutting edge of biotechnology 
research which is something thats going to come years down the 
road said bob cuper a genentech analyst with kidder peabody amp 
co in new york 
under the agreement roche will invest 492 million in 
genentech buying half its 82 million shares of outstanding stock 
for 36 per share 65 percent above thursdays closing stock price 
genentech was the most active issue friday on the new york stock 
exchange rising 812 to close at 2987 
roche will own 60 percent of the 112 million voting shares of 
genentech stock that will be outstanding after the companies 
restructure and merge the companies said 
genentech will remain a publicly traded company under the deal 
they said the proposal will be submitted to genentech stockholders 
in april the board of directors on friday approved the agreement 
officials of both companies said genentechs management and 
research division would operate independently of roche and that 
genentechs sales force would remain intact and all the companys 
employees retained 
although it will become major shareholder roche will be given 
only two seats on genentechs board of directors which will be 
expanded by two members for a total of 13

the lawyer for reputed mob boss john gotti 
called a surprise witness on his clients behalf the union 
official who prosecutors say was ordered shot by the defendant 
john oconnor testified friday in the assault and conspiracy 
trial of gotti that he didnt know who had shot him and that police 
had given him no warning he was in danger 
prosecutors say gotti had ordered oconnor shot for leading 
union goons to wreck a manhattan restaurant affiliated with the 
gambino crime family which gotti reputedly heads 
they maintain that a secretly recorded tape shows gotti saying 
oconnor was to be busted up 
the defense arguing the tapes are largely inaudible said that 
if the comment was clear enough to prosecute gotti then it was 
clear enough to warn oconnor 
gotti 49 and anthony guerrieri 60 an alleged gambino 
soldier are on trial in manhattans state supreme court on charges 
of assault and conspiracy in the oconnor shooting 
under questioning by defense lawyer gerald shargel oconnor 
detailed the nearfatal shooting of may 7 1986 
oconnor 56 said he noticed four or five men hanging around 
outside the offices of his union local when he arrived at work 
while waiting in the lobby for an elevator oconnor testified 
he heard a thunderous clap and felt something in his body but 
did not realize he had been shot 
a man shouted mr oconnor mr oconnor when he turned 
oconnor saw a man pointing a gun at him the elevator arrived and 
oconnor said he got on as the gunman fired into his buttocks 
oconnor said he got off on the seventh floor when he sought 
help from an acquaintance 
dr jose corvalan the surgeon who treated oconnor at st 
clairs hospital said the victim would have died without prompt 
medical treatment 
oconnor said that in viewing police photos he was never able 
to identify any of the men he saw outside his office the day he was 
shot 
he said he initially told police that union trouble had nothing 
to do with the incident but admitted in testimony that there were 
internal problems in the union 
the defense argued that oconnors enemies in his union might 
have shot him because of internecine rivalries 
prosecutors who rested their case thursday called oconnor 
former vice president of carpenters union local 608 a corrupt 
mob associate who has been charged in a 127count indictment with 
perjury extortion and labor racketeering 
crossexamined by assistant district attorney michael cherkasky 
oconnor asserted his fifth amendment right against 
selfincrimination when asked about his alleged links to organized 
crime 
oconnor took the stand after acting justice edward mclaughlin 
denied a defense motion to dismiss the case 
shortly after oconnor testified the defense rested the trial 
is recessed until monday when final arguments are expected

until a year ago fw de 
klerk was a lowkey politician viewed as cautious pragmatic and 
relatively conservative now the president is being called 
courageous even by antiapartheid militants who spent years in jail 
de klerk was raised in a culture that accepted white domination 
as gods will his father was in the cabinet when african national 
congress leader nelson mandela went to jail in 1962 
on friday before a national television audience de klerk 
announced that mandela would soon be freed unconditionally and that 
his guerrilla movement was no longer banned 
in a matter of just over half an hour mr de klerk has set in 
motion a process of peaceful revolution that will undo four decades 
of doctrinaire national party policies that have spelt misery for 
millions said the rev stanley mogoba head of the countrys 
methodist church 
mogoba spent three years in prison in the 1960s for membership 
in the pan africanist congress another blackled guerrilla group 
legalized by de klerk in hopes of promoting blackwhite 
negotiations 
de klerk was education minister in bothas cabinet botha 
suffered a stroke jan 18 1989 and feb 2 exactly a year before 
fridays speech de klerk took over as national party leader 
narrowly defeating a cabinet colleague who at the time was 
considered more liberal 
botha resigned in august after losing a power struggle with the 
cabinet and de klerk became acting president he was formally 
inaugurated to a fiveyear term sept 20 following general 
elections and told the country we stand on the threshold of a 
new era in south africa 
now even doubters are beginning to believe him 
we would be unreasonable if we fail to acknowledge that of all 
the presidents of all the leaders of the nationalist governments 
de klerk has taken the most bold step and has has emerged as the 
most courageous said black activist pope molefe 
molefe a leader of the united democratic front antiapartheid 
coalition was freed in december after more than four years in jail 
when the appellate court overturned a treason conviction 
de klerk 53 comes from a long line of politicans going back to 
his greatgrandfather a senator his brother willem quit as 
editor of rapport the countrys largest afrikaanslanguage 
newspaper after being criticized for his increasingly liberal 
views 
the dutchdescended afrikaners began settling south africa 350 
years ago and account for 3 million of the countrys 5 million 
whites they are taught in state schools that role as rulers was 
ordained by god until a few years ago the main afrikaner church 
preached that the ideological foundation for apartheid was found in 
the bible 
when fw de klerk took office willem de klerk expressed 
uncertainty as to whether significant reforms would follow but de 
klerk moved rapidly even before his inauguration he gave approval 
for the first legal antigovernment marches in decades 
since then de klerk has freed eight prominent political 
prisoners including colleagues of mandela declared an end to 
segregation of beaches consulted with mandela and many 
antiapartheid leaders and cut back the power and influence of the 
security establishment 
he halved mandatory military service for white men from two 
years to one cut the defense budget and scrapped a controversial 
bureaucratic network through which security force officers 
exercised control over black townships 
all these moves paled compared to fridays pronouncements 
publisher tertius myburgh whose sunday times is the countrys 
largest newspaper called it the most important speech of the 
century in south africa

west germanys foreign minister says he and 
us secretary of state james baker agree that a unified germany 
will not mean a greater nato military umbrella 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher who met with baker late 
friday at the state department said afterward we were in full 
agreement that there is no intention to extend the nato area of 
defensive security toward the east 
genscher who was returning to europe during the night crossed 
the atlantic and back in less than 24 hours to consult with baker 
before the secretary of states meetings next week with soviet 
leaders in moscow german unity was expected to be a major issue 
baker will take up with soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze and president mikhail gorbachev 
both genscher and baker said they agreed that if a 35nation 
european summit gorbachev has proposed for next autumn is held it 
should add the right of free elections to other human rights 
enumerated at the original summit on cooperation and security in 
europe held at helsinki in 1972 
genscher suggested the autumn summit could set the stage for 
major steps toward german unification 
unlike helsinki the two german states at this summit will 
come not with diverging views but as i hope with a joint 
concept he said 
genschers whirlwind visit came after gorbachev softened his 
opposition to german unification over the past week east german 
prime minister hans modrow also endorsed creation of a single 
germany providing it belongs neither to the north atlantic treaty 
organization nor to the warsaw pact 
west german chancellor helmut kohls government has opposed 
military neutrality for a unified germany baker also indirectly 
rejected the idea telling reporters friday im frankly 
encouraged by what genscher has said about continued german 
membership in nato 
western allied governments remembering the struggle against 
nazi germany in world war ii have long considered west germanys 
membership in nato and the european community more effective than 
neutrality in deterring any revival of german expansionism 
poland czechoslovakia and hungary after ending 40 years of 
communist rule have asked the kremlin to withdraw its military 
forces from their soil drawing predictions the warsaw pact will 
collapse 
genscher said the west can offer east european countries 
partnership in stability 
we can make it quite clear to the east that whatever happens 
in the warsaw pact on our side there is no intention to extend our 
area natos area toward the east he said 
baker said he and genscher agreed we need to develop a process 
and a framework for it reunification taking into consideration 
the interests of all who are involved in the issue 
genscher said that after east germanys promised march 18 free 
elections we are going to enter into negotiations with that 
freelyelected government about the future of the two german states 
and we are convinced that the freelyelected government of the 
east german gdr will just as ourselves want to see the process 
of a unity be imbedded in the process of european unity he 
added suggesting major agreement could be reached by the autumn 
summit 
baker planned to meet french foreign minister roland dumas in 
ireland on tuesday before flying on to prague for one day of talks 
with czechoslovakias new leaders from there hell continue on to 
moscow 
genscher also planned to meet shevardnadze next week

more than 900 candidates hit a frosty campaign 
trail today officially launching a race that will provide the 
first serious challenge to the conservative liberal democrats in 
decades 
the candidates including prime minister toshiki kaifu of the 
liberal democrats and takako doi of the japan socialist party came 
out in bitter cold to lure voters to their parties in the feb 18 
vote for parliaments lower house 
polls show the liberal democrats could lose their majority in 
the powerful chamber partly because of an unpopular 3 percent 
sales tax and partly because of scandals that have soiled the 
partys image over the past year the party has controlled japans 
government for 34 years 
the contenders have been conducting unauthorized stumping for 
months but they intensified their efforts today with speeches at 
major train stations as the official twoweek campaign got under 
way 
kaifu 59 addressed about 200 people at shibuya station in 
tokyo most of his audience toting japans redandwhite flags 
appeared to be party members invited to the rally with passersby 
lingering in the nearfreezing temperatures only until traffic 
lights changed 
sounding his major theme kaifu declared that the election is a 
critical one that will determine whether the nation will give 
credit to the liberal democrats for their efforts or give power 
away to socialism the socialists are the largest opposition 
party 
my administration started out under the worst possible 
circumstances kaifu said i need your support 
prime minister noboru takeshita resigned in april because of a 
stockprofiteering scandal his successor sousuke uno lasted only 
two months after allegations surfaced that he kept paid mistresses 
the liberal democrats lost their majority in the upper house of 
parliament in july 
at shinjuku station in tokyo about 400 police guarded the 
socialists kickoff rally 
ms doi 61 told about 1000 people that the only road left 
is for each of you to change politics with your votes 
flanked by waving girls in bright blazers and short skirts ms 
doi reiterated her opposition to the sales tax and to recent moves 
to open japans agricultural markets to imports those stands were 
popular in the july election 
another key issue in the election is expected to be calls for 
political reform prompted by the stock scandal 
i dont really understand the differences in policies but im 
supporting the socialists because i think its time someone else 
took over government said one 22yearold woman who refused to 
give her name 
also doi is a woman and i feel she wouldnt lie to me like 
those men do she said 
a total of 931 candidates are expected to register their 
candidacy for the 512seat lower house kyodo news service reported 
newspapers gave mixed reviews to fridays debate between kaifu 
ms doi and three other party leaders the first major televised 
debate since 1960 saying the party leaders avoided the substantive 
issues 
the leaders failed to provide substantial new information for 
the voters said the englishlanguage japan times it attacked 
kaifus campaign theme of warning voters that a vote for the 
opposition would endanger their democratic freedoms calling it 
scare tactics 
the masscirculation yomiuri shimbun criticized the four 
opposition leaders saying they offered no image of what that 
political authority ought to be

hungry sea lions are beginning to fatten up on 
the prized and protected steelhead trout driving state authorities 
to a drastic plan to end the free lunch they want to kill the 
blubbery creatures 
the easy pickings at the ballard locks have led wildlife 
officials to try a number of remedies to get rid of the sea lions 
as the stateprotected steelhead begin their annual run 
as many as 40 sea lions have gathered near the locks inside city 
limits each winter for the past eight years to eat the trout which 
climb a fish ladder on their way from puget sound to freshwater 
lake union en route to upstream spawning grounds 
the sea lions weigh up to 800 pounds and they can eat 5 percent 
of their body weight in fish each day 
one option is a plan by state and federal officials to truck 10 
male sea lions to their breeding grounds off southern california 
and harass the remainder with firecrackers rubbertipped arrows 
and fish laced with vomit capsules 
another plan would be to alter the structure of the locks a 
possibility under preliminary discussion with the us army corps 
of engineers said curt smitch director of the state department of 
wildlife 
but smitch noted friday that wildlife agents have tried just 
about all the nonlethal actions they can think of 
we would like to have access to that option he said of the 
proposal to kill we think that we are trying to protect a 
resource which is washingtons wild steelhead 
federal officials say theyre researching the question of 
whether sea lions protected under federal law can be killed if they 
threaten to destroy the stateprotected wild steelhead run which 
generally lasts from late february to april 
a period of public comment is expected to begin by the next 
month rolland schmitten northwest regional director of the 
national marine fisheries service said friday 
representatives of environmental and animal rights groups did 
not return calls for comment late friday on the proposal to kill 
the sea lions which were at the locks eating steelhead said 
acting lockmaster bill mcgraw 
cynthia rust a spokeswoman for greenpeace action said earlier 
friday she lacked details to comment on the trucking plan but she 
said the vomit capsules probably would not work 
the sea lions werent considered a problem until 1985 when they 
caught 30 percent of the wild fish run last year they gobbled up 
65 percent and at the current rate the run would disappear within 
a decade smitch said 
this year officials hope that more than a third of the 
approximately 2100 fish will survive to spawn 
in past years wildlife officials have tried chasing the sea 
lions with boats scaring them with firecrackers and taped sounds 
of orca whales their natural predator feeding them chemicallaced 
fish and keeping them from the fish with nets nothing worked 
the sea lions managed to have their feast last year even though 
37 of them were trucked 270 miles to the southern washington coast 
within an average of 12 days 29 had returned to the locks in 
time to eat steelhead 
washington state sent a letter last fall asking the national 
oceanic and atmospheric administration which enforces the marine 
mammal protection act for a ruling on whether killing sea lions 
might be permitted 
a federal ruling should be made by the end of this year after 
the public comment period in time for next years steelhead run 
schmitten said 
in the next few weeks wildlife agents plan to corral 10 sea 
lions and haul them at a cost of about 15000 to breeding grounds 
in the channel islands northwest of los angeles 
authorities hope the sea lions will stay there or at least take 
45 days to swim the 1100 miles back to seattle that would give 
the fish enough time to get to the spawning grounds smitch said 
the sea lions will be tagged with radio transmitters to track 
their movements and monitor whether the effort has been effective 
he said

the rate of unemployment soared nearly 600 
percent last month after the solidarityled government imposed a 
host of marketoriented economic reforms 
at the same time prices rose by almost 70 percent compared to 
government projections of 50 percent finance ministry 
undersecretary andrzej podsiadlo told a news conference friday 
the number of unemployed people registered with the government 
grew from 9600 in december to 55800 in january said government 
spokeswoman malgorzata niezabitowska the number of job vacancies 
fell from 254000 in late 1989 to 35200 in january she said 
the solidarityled government anticipating the first postwar 
wave of unemployment has set aside funds to provide social 
benefits to up to 400000 jobless people however critics of the 
plan have said the number of unemployed could go much higher 
the steepest price rises came at the beginning of the month 
when the government loosened controls on almost all goods and 
increased the price of energy by up to 700 percent podsiadlo said 
but most producers faced with a sharp decline in purchases had to 
begin reducing prices by the end of the month he said 
the government hopes that by midyear prices will be rising by 
only 1 or 2 percent a month he said 
the governments economic shock treatment calls for a tight 
money policy limiting state subsidies and bank loans limits on 
wage growth and the loosening of price controls 
the program approved by the international monetary fund is 
designed to quickly bring polands 1989 annual inflation rate of 
700 percent under control by limiting the amount of money consumers 
have to spend it is also supposed to drive inefficient companies 
into bankruptcy 
the solidarityled government took over in september of last 
year after the opposition scored an overwhelming victory over 
communist candidates in june elections

motor city was down to its last auto assembly 
plant with the closing of chrysler corps jefferson avenue factory 
after 83 years and about 83 million cars the plant on 
detroits lower east side closed friday it had been the nations 
oldest active auto factory 
its last car was a gray dodge omni with a gray interior 
the days are gone forever when you didnt even have to 
graduate from high school before you went down to dodge or ford or 
chrysler or gm and got a job said jesse sandifer 47 a pipe 
fitter 
we were fortunate enough to be the last of a dying breed now 
you must have an education in order to succeed in life 
the last full assembly plant in detroit is general motors 
corps poletown plant several other factories in the city 
manufacture auto parts 
some of the 1700 workers being laid off indefinitely hope they 
will go back to work in late 1991 at the chryslers planned 
jefferson north plant which will be built next to the closed 
factory 
ralph winchester of warren who worked at the plant for a 
quartercentury said he was unsure of his plans 
im just going to get settled and see what happens he said 
winchester said he hopes that hell be recalled late next year 
when chrysler begins training workers for its jefferson north 
plant where the company hopes to build a sportutility vehicle by 
late 1992 
but he added i didnt get any guarantees 
harry anderson who also closed out 25 years with chrysler on 
friday said he wasnt counting on work at the jefferson north 
plant he went through another closing in january 1980 when 
chrysler shut down its dodge main plant and he said hes had 
enough of layoffs 
im going to school for robotics and tv and radio repair 
anderson said 
the laidoff workers can draw from a variety of funds that could 
bring benefits to as much as 95 percent of their straighttime pay 
while they were working 
officials of united auto workers union local 7 which represents 
the jefferson avenue workers doubt if the funds will stay at that 
level until retraining for jefferson north begins 
they said layoffs the automaker already has announced for later 
this year will boost the number of eligible workers those on 
indefinite layoff drawing against the funds between now and the 
end of march chrysler plans to indefinitely lay off nearly 6000 
workers 
all of us in america have got to turn this thing around 
said larry gorzelski a tool room supervisor at jefferson avenue 
were losing all our jobs and pretty soon this will be just a 
service industry 
jefferson avenue is the second plant chrysler has shut down 
since 1988 on thursday the company announced it would close its 
st louis car plant in midseptember 
that closing will bring to seven the number of assembly plants 
chrysler and general motors corp will have shut down in three 
years 
ford motor co has been able to avoid closing plants because its 
car and truck sales are healthy and it can eliminate large amounts 
of overtime it used instead of opening a new plant

the board of regents allowed rotc to stay 
at the university of wisconsin after the schools faculty said it 
wanted them off because of the militarys restrictions against 
homosexuals 
the board decided 133 friday to accept uw president kenneth 
shaws recommendation against evicting the reserve officers 
training corps 
but regents also approved a resolution that requires uw 
administrators to report annually on their efforts to lobby 
congress for a change in the militarys restrictions against 
enlisting gays and lesbians 
we intend to hold their feet to the fire regent ruth clusen 
said writing letters isnt going to get us anywhere 
i think it was the appropriate resolution to pass regent 
erroll davis jr of madison said this resolution keeps the issue 
in the front line and will force us to deal with it 
capt cheryl batterman head of uw recruiting for the air force 
rotc said she was pleased the regents decided to keep rotc but 
she said the resolution makes the situation seem uncertain and may 
discourage enrollment 
were already feeling the pinch ms batterman said i had 
hoped they wouldve gotten this all resolved at once now we still 
dont know what might happen thats a hard plan to sell to 
students and parents 
the faculty senate voted 386248 in december in favor of 
evicting rotc unless the military agreed by 1993 to enlist gays and 
lesbians 
about 200 people rallied at the campus earlier this week 
arguing it was unfair to make a student pay tuition for rotc 
courses and then deny him enlistment 
shaw said severing ties with rotc probably wouldnt influence 
the military canceling the courses would only harm the students 
who benefit from the classes he said 
there are about 440 students in army navy and air force rotc 
programs at madison out of an enrollment of 42000 there are 1300 
rotc students in the entire uw system which has 135000 students 
at 13 major campuses and several smaller centers

passengers arriving today on the ferry 
from lebanons christian enclave said the battles raging between 
christian factions are inflicting more damage on beirut than any 
others in 15 years of civil war 
we never had a war like this said 24yearold robin haik 
like most of the 40 passengers on the boat haik was fleeing the 
fighting that police say has killed at least 140 people and wounded 
550 since it broke out tuesday 
haik said he took advantage of a lull in the fighting to escape 
brutal exchanges in beiruts ashrafiyeh district hundreds of 
shells fell near his apartment building he said 
the lebanese forces put all kinds of artillery between every 
house to try to get the army and the army tried to hit them with 
all kinds of shells 
the fighting pits christian gen michel aouns troops against 
the lebanese forces the main christian militia headed by samir 
geagea 
traffic on the coastal highway from ashrafiyeh to the christian 
port at jounieh north of beirut was reduced because of sniper 
fire and checkpoints set up by the opposing forces haik said 
he said he had seen a car lying on the road with four dead 
bodies in it 
crewmembers on the ferry baroness said 200 burned cars littered 
the parking lot at the port evidence of the struggle for control 
of the tiny naval facility held by geageas militia 
one street is controlled by the army the next by the lebanese 
forces its terrible said crewmember elie who like his 
colleagues wanted only his first name used 
the ferry normally docks for several hours in jounieh but today 
it stayed only a half hour before leaving on the sevenhour 
125mile trip to larnaca on southeastern cyprus 
passengers said the sound of gunfire and rockets thundered 
across the port it was very bad there were bombs rockets the 
crewmembers were afraid and so were the passengers said chief 
officer demetris asnasis 
most of those who made it onto the boat live in jounieh and its 
immediate surroundings 
our house is just two minutes from the port thats how we 
were able to get out said tony helou another passenger we 
dont want to go back again said his wife susan 
aouns forces attacked on tuesday to try to gain full control of 
the enclave north and east of beirut where 1 million christians 
live geagea has 6000 militiamen bolstered by several thousand 
reservists aoun comands 20000 soldiers 
aoun was fired by moslem president elias hrawi who was elected 
in november under the terms of an arab leaguebrokered peace plan 
aimed at shifting political power to the moslem majority and ending 
a 15yearold civil war the war has left 150000 people dead 
aoun says the peace plan approved by parliament in october 
provides no fixed withdrawal timetable for syrias estimated 45000 
troops 
geagea has neither accepted or rejected the peace accord but

attorney barry kane was sentenced to 
12 years in federal prison and fined 500000 after being convicted 
of making two cocaine flights for colombian drug baron carlos 
lehder rivas 
kane 53 of hyannis mass was convicted in october in the 
socalled son of lehder trial of conspiracy to import cocaine 
into the united states he made two 250kilogram cocaine flights 
from colombia for lehder in 1977 
us district judge john h moore ii who could have sentenced 
kane to 19 to 24 years under sentencing guidelines friday said he 
gave the lesser sentence out of downright fairness 
as kane was led out of the courtroom in shackles his daughter 
jennifer who had testified in his behalf yelled i love you 
dad 
in a statement to moore on friday kane said that his life had 
been destroyed his career ruined and his family vilified and 
devastated 
i am sorry for having caused all of this hasnt there been 
enough retribution i pray your honor that there has been kane 
said his voice cracking 
three of kanes sons and his daughter asked the judge for 
leniency 
there is nothing left to be taken everything is gone said 
his son barry stephen kane 30 i dont believe hes an evil man 
hes a man who made some mistakes im begging for mercy 
kane who collapsed when he was convicted oct 26 seemed at 
times to be shaky friday 
the case grew out of testimony in the 198788 trial of lehder 
40 who is serving a life term plus 135 years for directing the 
smuggling of some 20 tons of cocaine into the united states 
ten defendants have pleaded guilty and received sentences

china added another 1577 million people last 
year to bring its population to 1112 billion according to the 
state statistical bureau 
the bureaus figures reported today by the official peoples 
daily said the natural population increase for the year was 1433 
per 1000 people up slightly from 142 per 1000 in 1988 
it said there were 2083 births per 1000 up from 2078 in 
1988 and 65 deaths per 1000 a slight decline from the previous 
year 
the worlds most populous nation in the past decade has achieved 
one of the lowest growth rates in the developing world the rate 
is 20 per thousand in india and 28 in the philippines as a result 
of strict family planning policies limiting most families to one 
child 
however the natural growth rate has moved up again somewhat in 
recent years because of resistance to the onechild policy in rural 
areas and a sharp increase in the number of women reaching 
childbearing age 
between 1986 and 1997 another 11 million to 13 million women 
will reach childbearing age every year a consequence of high birth 
rates in the 1960s and 1970s when communist chinas revolutionary 
founder mao tsetung paid little attention to family planning 
china had hoped to keep its population down to 12 billion at 
the end of the century but demographers now say it will be closer 
to 13 billion about onefifth of the worlds people 
from the viewpoint of age structure our country will continue 
to see a rising birth rate trend for the next few years the 
report said family planning work cannot be relaxed by even an 
iota

the pilot of avianca flight 52 asked his 
copilot if he had told the control tower that they had an 
emergency shortly before the jet crashed on long island a 
source close to the crash investigation said 
copilot mauricio klotz did not directly answer capt laureano 
caviedes hoyos question saying i told them were low on fuel 
the source who asked not be identified told the associated press 
investigators have pointed to the crews use of the word 
priority instead of emergency in conversations with 
controllers in explaining the handling of the boeing 707 
when a pilot declares a fuel emergency to controllers the 
plane is cleared to land immediately that doesnt happen when the 
word priority is used 
fridays disclosure was the first indication that a crew member 
used the word emergency in describing their situation 
cockpit tapes show that the crew never told air traffic 
controllers they had an emergency investigators say 
the plane glided powerless into a hillside on long islands 
north shore jan 25 killing 73 of the 159 people aboard including 
the cockpit crew 
the investigation has focused on the conversations between 
controllers and crew in the final leg of its flight from bogota and 
medellin colombia 
after nearly an hour and a half of delays the crew told 
regional controllers the plane was low on fuel and needed priority 
handling the plane was then put in the hands of local controllers 
the flight was handled in a routine manner on its first 
approach which was aborted in wind and fog it was then told to 
loop back over long island to try again another routine 
direction which was okd by the crew 
it was during this loop that the engines quit and the plane 
crashed 
the cockpit conversations shifted back and forth between english 
and spanish according to the source who quoted an unofficial 
translation

voters cast ballots today in an election 
pitting mayor sidney barthelemy against a challenger who has 
accused him of racebaiting 
barthelemy new orleans second black mayor is running for a 
second term his main challenger is donald mintz a white attorney 
who wears a lapel button showing white and black hands interlinked 
mintz 46 who left new orleans dock board to make his first 
run for elective office claimed barthelemys ads on a black radio 
station appealed to antiwhite racism 
barthelemy 47 said it was mintz who interjected the issue of 
race during the campaign which also included anonymous fliers 
depicting barthelemy as an opportunistic uncle tom 
barthelemy predicted that he will win by about 10 percentage 
points slightly below the margin shown in recent polls 
i think without question that the vast majority of black 
voters are going to vote for me and the vast majority of white 
voters are going to vote for mintz he said friday therell be 
some crossover i think ill get more crossover votes than he 
will 
about 544 percent of the citys voters are black and 444 
percent white with asians making up most of the rest 
about 55 to 60 percent of the citys 237342 voters are expected 
to turn out for the election said registrar louis keller the 
ballot also includes races for five city council seats and nine 
other city offices 
the lowkey election campaign has been upstaged by the christmas 
holidays the sugar bowl and the super bowl even the issue of 
race which sparked the two televised debates did little to 
enliven the campaign 
early polls put mintz ahead of barthelemy even though mintz has 
no government experience but barthelemy a former state senator 
and city councilman has drawn ahead by 10 to 12 percentage points 
in recent polls 
also running are herman j buster bustamente and black 
businessman rudy e mills sr who are expected to draw few votes 
if no candidate gets more than half the vote a runoff will be 
held march 3

the fbi shifted part of its 
investigation of the mail bombings that killed a federal judge and 
a civil rights attorney to an operator of a print shop and his wife 
blood hair and saliva samples will be taken from brian joseph 
fleming and his wife georgia their attorney said 
the fbi seized documents filling nine boxes friday at flemings 
home but his attorney john knowles said they were nothing 
really important to the mail bomb probe 
no typewriters in the septic tank the attorney said 
in the last two weeks agents have canvassed enterprise a 
southeastern alabama community of 18000 residents and the 
surrounding area even digging up septic tanks for a typewriter 
believed used by the bomber 
killed in the december bomb attacks were 11th us circuit court 
of appeals judge robert vance and savannah ga attorney robert 
robinson no one has been charged in the case 
another 10 boxes of material were removed from flemings 
business the printing press located across the street from the 
fbis temporary command post 
fleming 32 just shrugged when asked why the agents wanted the 
material the agents maintained their silence on the case 
knowles said the government apparently was trying to link the 
mail bomb case to flemings indictment on a charge of conspiring to 
export firearms reportedly to northern ireland 
fleming pleaded innocent to the gun exportation charge and is 
free on 5000 bond 
the fleming searches drew attention away from salvage dealer 
robert wayne oferrell a parttime preacher who has been at the 
center of the fbi investigation 
last month oferrells home and business were subjected to 
similar fbi searches 
doug marshall an fbi spokesman in mobile said the fbi would 
continue to make enterprise the base of its mail bomb investigation 
for an indefinite time 
meanwhile in houston an apparently unrelated mail bomb that 
injured a pastors daughter on tuesday was mailed from 
elizabethtown nc a federal postal inspector said 
list osteen 31 suffered bruises and flash burns and was in 
good condition friday at methodist hospital in houston

the state comptroller said the federal takeover of 
floridas largest thrift is in the taxpayers best interests but 
some analysts say the government dragged its feet in seizing the 
financially troubled centrust bank 
the treasury departments office of thrift supervision friday 
declared that the savings and loan was operating in an unsafe and 
unsound condition and turned it over to the resolution trust corp 
for sale or liquidation 
the seizure which had been imminent for some time came as two 
large savings institutions in texas and california showed signs of 
recovery with the help of federal subsidies 
but two other florida banks also were seized friday 
federal investigators fanned out through centrusts towering 
miami headquarters on friday making sure employees left the 
building without taking any documents 
centrusts offices remain open for business with deposits 
guaranteed to 100000 per account the institution had 62 
billion in 325813 accounts and was not insolvent federal 
regulators said but would soon be if changes were not made 
centrusts failure was blamed on junk bond investing and lavish 
spending on art a company yacht and high salaries since december 
the thrift was losing an estimated 2 million a day analysts said 
the big question is why the otc didnt act sooner said 
miami thrift analyst kenneth thomas who contended having seized 
the bank in december would have saved taxpayers millions of dollars 
its inexcusable basically centrust chairman david paul 
gouged his thumb into the thrift offices eye and kept it 
there said bert ely a financial institutions analyst in 
alexandria va 
but thrift office enforcement director rosemary stewart said 
we dont think this took long at all proof that this 
institution was in serious enough financial condition to warrant a 
takeover was just recently obtained 
a centrust spokesman did not immediately return telephone 
messages seeking comment friday and a man who answered a phone at 
pauls miami beach office also declined to comment 
this is not an action you like to take but it is one we 
thought was in the best interests of the depositors and 
taxpayers said florida comptroller gerald lewis whose office 
participated in fridays action this whole situation with the 
thrift industry is one that has to be turned around 
two banks seized by federal authorities indicated the industry 
can prosper the bright banc savings association of dallas one of 
the nations largest savings institutions was sold for 48 
million and the american savings bank in california said it earned 
2142 million in 1989 
in separate actions friday federal regulators also seized 
pioneer savings bank in clearwater the states 11th largest 
thrift with 2 billion in assets and state regulators closed 
commerce bank of tampa with 21 million in assets 
centrust with 82 billion in assets is floridas largest and 
the nations 23rd largest savings institution 
the thrift office in announcing the takeover said that as of 
sept 30 centrust was 245 million in the red 
the agency also cited substantial dissipation of assets and 
earnings due to violations including excessive and 
inappropriate expenses and investments 
in december the thrift office issued a cease and desist 
order instructing centrust to sell what was left of its 30 million 
art collection much of it displayed in pauls home plus 
limousines a corporate jet and a 233000 company sailboat

salvadoran president alfredo cristiani says he 
hopes to hear by monday whether leftist guerillas will agree to 
talks brokered by the united nations aimed at settling el 
salvadors prolonged civil war 
our government is set on finding a political solution to the 
conflict cristiani said friday there is no use for a military 
solution we are ready to sit down and discuss the incorporation of 
the fmln in the democratic process 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said friday that 
secretary of state james a baker iii telephoned un secretary 
general javier perez de cuellar to express support for un efforts 
to restart negotiations 
cristiani holding talks with us officials in washington told 
the national press club that de cuellar told him wednesday he would 
immediately try to contact leftist fmln rebels and get talks 
started 
cristiani said he hoped there would be an answer from the rebels 
by the time he returns to san salvador on monday 
ms tutwiler said president bush and the secretary of state 
discussed the issue with cristiani on thursday 
the united states strongly supports president cristianis 
efforts to enlist un assistance in resuming negotiations she 
said 
cristiani also appealed in his speech for continued us aid to 
el salvador 
we believe for the first time in 10 years we have a great 
possibility of finding a solution to the salvadoran conflict he 
said it would be a shame to give the extreme right and the 
extreme left a negative sign any change in the status of aid would 
be a negative sign 
us economic aid to el salvador in the current fiscal year was 
cut by the bush administration to 1306 million from the previous 
years 185 million 
the administration has requested an increase to 180 million in 
economic aid to el salvador for the fiscal year beginning oct 1 
after leaving washington cristiani made an unannounced visit to 
boston friday night where he was met by demonstrators protesting 
the slaying of six jesuit priests in his county last november 
according to a published report 
david voisin a spokesman for central american solidarity 
association told the associated press that cristiani was planning 
to meet with cardinal bernard law the roman catholic archbishop of 
boston to try to smooth over strained relations between his 
government and the church 
however laws press secretary monsignor timothy moran said 
cristiani had not contacted law and no such meeting was scheduled 
the herald reported that a state department spokesman would only 
say that cristiani was in boston for a private visit 
voisin said more protests were planned today

a 2month trial has ended in guilty 
verdicts for general electric co and two employees accused of 
bilking the government of 10 million on a battlefield computer 
system 
the verdict friday raised the possibility ge could be suspended 
from new pentagon business a step the government often takes 
against contractors accused of wrongdoing 
the jury found ge the nations secondlargest defense 
contractor guilty of four counts of mail fraud and 282 counts of 
making false claims it was acquitted of one mail fraud count and 
30 other false claim counts 
gerald a leo former materials manager of ge subsidiary 
management and technical services co was convicted of four counts 
of mail fraud and one count of trying to deceive federal 
investigators 
james badolato former subcontracts manager for the subsidiary 
was convicted of one count of obstructing justice and one count of 
trying to deceive investigators 
leo 52 faces up to 25 years in prison and a 1 million fine 
badolato 43 faces up to 10 years in prison and a 500000 fine 
both men now work in other ge departments 
both men were acquitted on separate mail fraud and racketeering 
charges 
us district judge lowell a reed jr allowed leo and badolato 
to remain free on bail pending sentencing scheduled for april 10 
attorneys for ge and badolato said they would appeal an attorney 
for leo declined to comment on an appeal 
the case involved a 250 million contract to supply the army 
with an updated version of its decentralized automated service 
support system computer known as das3 prosecutors claimed leo 
and badolato with the tacit consent of ge officials padded 
costs and failed to notify the pentagon of savings negotiated with 
subcontractors 
ge faces a fine of about 50 million plus the costs of 
prosecution assistant us attorney david howard said in 
addition the government has filed a 23 million civil suit against 
ge alleging overcharges and seeking damages 
ge said in a statement from its fairfield conn headquarters 
that its subsidiary had been ready since 1985 to settle the civil 
case the indictments were issued in november 1988 
assistant us attorney nicholas harbist said the verdict 
sends a message that once a company engages in this kind of 
conduct merely opening up their wallet isnt enough 
but ge said the verdict stretches the theory of vicarious 
corporate liability beyond reasonable limits 
harbist said a decision on whether ge would be suspended from 
pentagon contracts would rest with the secretary of the army 
badolatos attorney greg miller said he was shocked with the 
verdict but called his clients acquittal on racketeering charges 
a victory 
it was ges second defenserelated fraud case in four years 
in may 1985 the company pleaded guilty to illegally claiming 
800000 in cost overruns on minuteman intercontinental ballistic 
missiles and paid a 104 million fine 
ge receives approximately 6 billion annually for defense 
contracts ranging from jet engines and electronic warfare equipment 
to highly classified strategic work

parliament today chose a moderate 
reformer as bulgarias new premier a day after the ruling 
communist party expelled much of its old guard and picked another 
advocate of change as its leader 
the new premier politburo member andrei lukanov promised 
immediate reforms in a speech after his unanimous election the 
opposition however continued to reject a communist offer to join 
a provisional government 
on friday the communist party ended a watershed party congress 
by electing alexander lilov a politburo member as its new chief 
lilov 56 replaces petar mladenov who will continue as president 
mladenov took over both jobs on nov 10 following the ouster of 
hardline leader todor zhivkovs after 35 years in power 
the communistdominated government of former premier georgi 
atanassov resigned late thursday 
it was not immediately clear which of the three leaders the 
premier the party chief or the president would have the most 
substantive power in the new government 
lukanov a 51yearold economist who speaks several languages 
became the third moderate communist reformer in the upper echelon 
of the crisisridden party which is struggling to remodel itself 
under the wave of popular pressure for democratic reform that has 
swept eastern europe 
lukanov and his reformminded colleagues face public skepticism 
about their commitment to reform the party and the nation as well 
as their ability to handle a flagging economy hobbled by 
unprecedented labor unrest 
we have to make fundamental economic reforms and we have to 
do them immediately lukanov told parliament in his address today 
he said he would present new ministers for his government on 
thursday and prepare an anticrisis program for social and 
economic problems by feb 28 
during the party congress the communist central committee was 
replaced by a 153member supreme council less than half its size 
the new policymaking body contains a much broader political 
spectrum including radical proreform factions 
ninety percent of the central committee members failed to win 
election to the new council party sources said 
at a joint news conference friday with lukanov lilov told 
reporters that consultations would start today with other parties 
and groups for setting up a government of national concord 
his comment was a renewed offer for the opposition to enter into 
an accord to set up a new government to rule until multiparty 
elections set for may 
petar beron a senior member of both the ecoglasnost 
environmentalist group and the opposition union of democratic 
forces described lukanov today as very capable and resourceful 
but he repeated the oppositions refusal to take part in a 
provisional government 
beron said there was little point in taking part because the 
communists dominate parliament anyway 
on friday beron also appeared to reject at least for now 
multiparty elections in may opposition activists say they need 
more time to prepare 
beron said he could envisage elections under international 
supervision possibly by the united nations 
also friday state radio and television reported that zhivkov 
who was earlier reported under arrest has been transferred to an 
undisclosed hospital for an unspecified illness 
television quoted his doctors as saying friday he could not be 
held further under arrest at the central investigation center in 
sofia 
television also announced that the bulgarian attorney general 
was appealing to western european countries to establish whether 
there are accounts under zhivkovs name or those of his relatives 
in their banks the attorney general wants such funds impounded

rashaf four miles north of the israeli border and opened fire 
killing two 
the guerrillas were armed with sovietmade rpg7 grenade 
launchers and assault rifles the military said the army said it 
was unclear to which organization the guerrillas were tied 
the clash took place in the area of israels selfdeclared 
security zone a sixto10mile wide strip of land patrolled by the 
israelibacked south lebanon army militia and the israeli army the 
security zone was carved out in 1985 when israel withdrew most of 
its forces from lebanon ending its three year occupation of the 
southern part of that country 
the last incident in the tense security zone was on jan 26 
when three israeli soldiers were wounded in two separate mine 
blasts

west german chancellor helmut kohl 
said today he is certain that east germans will vote in favor of 
reuniting with west germany but he hinted that a neutral new 
germany could be dangerous 
kohl sought to defuse recent soviet worries about the revival of 
a strong germany he reiterated that a united germany should be 
achieved within security structures in europe spanning both 
alliances at lower levels of armament 
east german communist premier hans modrow on thursday offered a 
fourpoint plan for a united but militarily neutral germany bonn 
immediately rejected the neutrality idea 
kohl and modrow planned to meet later today at davos for talks 
expected to focus on the continuing domestic crisis in east germany 
in a speech to a privately sponsored meeting of business 
executives and statesmen kohl said the continuation of eastern 
europes reform drive particularly in east germany is 
indispensable for european stability 
every successful reform in a country is a step toward more 
stability in all of europe he told the annual world economic 
forum in this swiss resort 
kohl said the western military alliance while it must adapt to 
changes in the warsaw pact remains indispensable 
this includes also in future a substantial security role for 
the united states on our continent he said 
the goal of unity corresponds to the wishes and hopes of an 
overwhelming majority of all germans kohl said adding that west 
germany will respect the decision of east germans in any referendum 
on unification 
but i have no doubt what it will be he said 
yet kohl also said the germans do not want to go their own 
nationalistic way 
that is why i am also strictly against the idea of german 
neutrality such a proposal is contrary to the logic of the process 
of paneuropean unification he said 
a united germany in the heart of europe should not have any 
special status which would isolate it he added he was 
apparently referring to the disastrous attempt by other european 
powers to rein in germany after world war i 
kohl also said there could be no firm timetable for unification 
he said his 10point plan for eventual german unity advanced 
last fall respects legitimate security interests of all 
participants in east and west not least of the soviet union 
in moscow soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze said 
in an interview published friday that the issue of german 
reunification be put to an international referendum because the 
world suffered so much at the hands of the nazis

five ethnic albanian groups appealed 
to yugoslavias leaders today to open a dialogue with them in the 
troubled southern province of kosovo 
thousands of police backed by tanks and planes patrolled the 
province where 21 people have been killed in clashes with police 
in the past 11 days no new demonstrations were reported 
in an englishlanguage statement the five groups said they 
supported the governments attempt to resolve the unrest and asked 
for talks 
the statement urged the government to investigate reports that 
police fired without cause or warning several times in the past 
week killing people in several villages 
it said authorities used classic forms of state terrorism to 
put down ethnic albanian calls for greater autonomy from 
yugoslavias largest republic serbia which has administrative 
control over kosovo 
it demanded an immediate ban on the use of lethal firearms by 
police establishing a commission to investigate all alleged 
murders as a way to defuse the explosive situation that threatens 
to turn into a bloody civil war 
serbian authorities claim the ethnic albanian majority is 
harassing the serb minority population in kosovo and that the 
republic must retain control over the province they claim that the 
ultimate goal of ethnic albanian separatists is to secede from 
yugoslavia and join neighboring albania 
yugoslavias liberal northern regions of slovenia and croatia 
have backed ethnic albanian calls for greater selfgovernment and 
blamed the unrest on serbian moves backed by nationalist serbian 
leader sloboban milosevic to reduce the provinces autonomy 
on friday president janez drnovsek appealed to ethnic albanians 
and serbs in the province to stop the violence which he said 
threatened the process of economic and political reform nationwide 
the government has pledged to allow a multiparty democracy and 
observe human rights according to internationally recognized 
standards 
drnovsek has said that the use of arms is in no groups interest 
and has repeatedly called for a dialogue 
but officials of serbia have demanded that opposition leaders 
first renounce their alleged separatist plans before any dialogue 
can be expected 
the groups who made the statement were the kosovo branch of the 
yugoslav union for democratic initiative the committee for human 
rights and freedoms the democratic league of kosova the society 
of philosophers and sociologists of kosova and the initiating 
board for the youth parliament kosova is the name albanians use to 
refer to the province

the soviet foreign minister has proposed that the 
issue of german reunification be put to an international referendum 
because the world suffered so much at the hands of the nazis 
eduard a shevardnadze in an interview published friday said 
europe must be assured that another militaristic regime will not 
arise 
it is not the idea of german unity itself but the revival of 
sinister shadows of the past associated with it as well as a 
possible growth of militarism that are met with apprehension in 
the world shevardnadze told a group of soviet reporters 
according to tass the official news agency 
its necessary to find a method of sounding out public opinion 
in the most democratic and open way possible say through an 
alleuropean referendum with the participation of the usa and 
canada or at least through wide parliamentary discussions the 
foreign minister said 
in davos switzerland today west german chancellor helmut kohl 
said he is certain that east germans will vote in favor of 
reuniting with west germany but he hinted that a neutral new 
germany could be dangerous 
he also sought to defuse soviet worries about the revival of a 
strong germany while at the same time saying he opposes making a 
united germany neutral 
the germans do not want to go their own nationalistic way 
he said 
while giving the strongest kremlin endorsement yet of a united 
germany shevardnadze repeated longstanding soviet conditions that 
the process not happen too quickly or cause instability in europe 
we wish the movement of germans toward a united motherland to 
develop without upheavals not to upset the european and world 
balance and not to create a threat to their neighbors he said 
tass did not say when the interview took place but 
shevardnadzes comments responded to an outline offered thursday by 
east german premier hans modrow on how a single german state should 
be attained 
modrow called for a militarily neutral united fatherland 
with berlin as its capital 
while shevardnadze generally supported modrows plan and 
endorsed the idea of neutrality he said the issue was too 
important for politicians alone to decide 
its important that not only the politicians but the peoples 
as well decide the fate and the future of europe he said 
suggesting a say for third parties appeared to conflict with 
shevardnadzes stated support for selfdetermination for east and 
west germany 
in the kremlins clearest endorsement of reunification he told 
the interviewers we favor the eventual creation of a united 
peaceful democratic germany 
the soviet union has traditionally opposed a single germany but 
president mikhail s gorbachev softened that position with a 
handsoff policy that has allowed radical reform in eastern europe 
shevardnadze said the suffering of world war ii in which 20 
million soviets were killed meant all peoples especially the 
peoples of the soviet union should have the right to a guarantee 
that there will never again be a threat of war from german land 
they will accept and support german unity only if they are 
sure of this he told soviet journalists 
third countries also must have pledges that the germans will 
recognize unconditionally and strictly observe borders in 
europe formed after world war ii and not make territorial claims 
he said 
gorbachev met friday with gregor gysi chief of the east german 
communist party gysi told reporters afterward they agreed that any 
reunification must not threaten stability in europe and only time 
will give the answers to how it can be achieved 
in washington visiting west german foreign minister 
hansdietrich genscher said friday he and secretary of state james 
a baker iii had agreed that german reunification would not mean 
extending natos military area eastward

the newly legalized african national 
congress called a meeting of its senior leaders saturday to begin 
reviewing strategy in light of the dramatic policy changes in south 
africa 
anc secretarygeneral alfred nzo and joe slovo head of the 
south african communist party flew into stockholm late friday to 
join walter sisulu and other anc veterans touring scandinavia after 
their release from prison in october 
the meeting was described as a session of the executive 
committee of the anc the largest movement opposing south africas 
apartheid system of legalized racial discrimination 
the anc will discuss new strategies because of the new 
situation which has arisen said david kgabang an official of 
the ancs stockholm office 
president fw de klerk told the south african parliament in 
cape town friday that the government was lifting the 30year ban on 
the anc and about 60 other opposition groups and promised to 
unconditionally free anc leader nelson mandela 
mandela 71 the countrys bestknown black leader was jailed 
in 1962 and is serving a life sentence for helping plan the start 
of the ancs sabotage and bombing campaign against the whiterun 
government 
de klerk also rescinded most emergency regulations imposed in 
1986 to quell antigovernment uprisings and declared a moratorium 
on executions 
in a statement drafted in stockholm friday the anc gave a 
cautious welcome to the speech but voiced concern that some 
emergency restrictions remained in place including the power to 
detain without trial it called for the continued international 
isolation of south africa until apartheid is dismantled 
victory is in sight said sisulu but he added that the 
measures were only a preliminary step toward creating the conditons 
for negotiations 
kgabang said he expected the anc to reopen its offices in 
johannesburg and elsewhere in south africa the group operated 
openly for 48 years until it was outlawed in 1960 and launched a 
campaign of sabotage the following year 
the arrival of nzo and slovo brought together in sweden most of 
the ancs top decision makers nzo is the groups acting president 
in place of oliver tambo who is recuperating from a stroke in a 
stockholm clinic slovo is a former head of the ancs armed wing 
they joined thabo mbeki who is in charge of the ancs foreign 
relations sisulu and five other recently freed leaders from the 
mandela era 
this is an opportunity to discuss developments with the 
leadership which has been in the cold for so many years kgabang 
told the associated press 
meetings were expected to last until monday when sisulu and the 
other released veterans planned to return to south africa while the 
rest head back to the ancs headquarters in lusaka zambia 
the anc said in its statement friday that it would consult with 
the mass democratic movement the main alliance of antiapartheid 
groups the review of the new situation will include an 
assessment of the prospects of genuine negotiations to end the 
apartheid system it said

the communist party will consider shedding its 
constitutionally guaranteed leading role in soviet society at a key 
central committee meeting next week a published report said today 
the soviet union ruled exclusively by the communists since a 
few months after the 1917 russian revolution is the last remaining 
warsaw pact nation to give the communists a guaranteed monopoly on 
power 
a draft platform to be presented at the central committee 
meeting on monday and tuesday calls for the party to fight for 
its leading role but assume no state or government powers nor lay 
any claim to having its role set down in the constitution said 
interfax a news service of official radio moscow 
interfax did not say how it obtained its information on the 
platform that party leader mikhail s gorbachev apparently will 
present monday as a basis for preparing the partys next congress 
scheduled for october the central committee meeting is widely 
expected to turn into a crucial political battle between party 
reformers and hardliners 
in addition it is likely to be the hardliners last chance to 
make a power play before the voters decide on their future in local 
and republiclevel elections in february and march 
communist party officials have said gorbachev would present a 
program to the twoday session calling for a radical 
democratization of the party 
a group of reformminded deputies calling itself the democratic 
platform also has drafted an alternate program for the party 
calling for a multiparty system and a virtual apology for decades 
of strict oneparty rule 
members of the democratic platform group have said they would 
try to have their program introduced at the central committee 
meeting as an alternative 
the leading role of the communist party written into the soviet 
constitution under former president leonid i brezhnev in 1977 has 
come under increasing attack in recent months the lithuanian 
republic already has struck that reference from its constitution as 
it prepares to legalize other parties 
reformers tried to have the issue brought before the 
2250member congress of peoples deputies at its december meeting 
but they were defeated by a margin of about 300 votes 
gorbachev in a visit to lithuania less than a month ago tried 
to persuade lithuanian communists to heal their split with the 
national party that they declared in december 
but he added that he saw no tragedy if a multiparty system 
evolves nevertheless gorbachev continues to insist that a 
multiparty system also is no panacea for all the countrys 
troubles 
the demcratic platform is considering declaring that the 
communist party cannot be reformed and breaking away to form a 
social democratic party if the communists refuse to embark on 
radical reforms 
interfax said the draft recognizes the right to platforms 
inside the party and the right of a minority to defend its views 
however the party will not permit factions with an internal 
organization or discipline of their own 
the report also said new party structures would be proposed the 
central committee cut from more than 300 members to 251 at a 
meeting last year would be reduced to 200 it said 
the party would have a chairman and two deputy chairmen and a 
new structure called the political executive committee would be 
formed and include representatives of all 15 soviet republics it 
was unclear whether the executive committee would replace the 
current politburo the ruling force of the party and of soviet 
society as a whole

the government today lifted curfew for 
several hours but shops remained closed because of a strike called 
by moslem militants leading a secessionist campaign in 
jammukashmir state witnesses said 
the jammukashmir liberation front spread the strike call by 
word of mouth on friday night and early today local journalists 
said quoting shopkeepers in downtown srinagar and its suburbs 
the front is spearheading the fourdecadeold campaign for 
secession of jammukashmir states predominantly moslem kashmir 
region 
at least 76 people have been killed since the government began 
cracking down on the increasingly violent secessionist movement 
jan 20 
most of those killed during the crackdown were curfewbreaking 
militants shot by the security forces 
the government reported no deaths between jan 25 and friday 
when at least four people were killed 
three of them died when police opened fire on a mob defying 
curfew in neighboring sopore police said the fourth was a hindu 
shopkeeper who was shot by the militants according to gov 
jagmohan who uses only one name 
todays strike in srinagar was to protest the sopore deaths 
kaiser mirza a local journalist quoted the shopkeepers as saying 
the curfew relaxation began at 5 am and was scheduled to end at 5 
pm 
mirza said most shops did not open in the morning when curfew 
was lifted and a few shops that did open soon put down their 
shutters when owners learned of the general strike call 
it was not immediately clear if the shops were closed fearing 
attacks by the militants or to sympathize with the separatist cause 
during earlier curfew relaxations which began one week ago 
vegetable shops and groceries were crowded and streets were filled 
with people and traffic this morning small groups of men stood at 
the street corners but little traffic moved on the streets mirza 
said 
the moslem militancy dates back to 1948 when the hindu maharajah 
of mostly moslem jammukashmir opted for union with predominantly 
hindu india 
pakistan born out of a 1947 division of the indian 
subcontinent objected saying a moslem area should go to 
predominantly moslem pakistan 
two wars over kashmir left a slice of the old royal state under 
pakistani control while the rest remained part of indias 
jammukashmir state 
jammukashmir with 64 percent of its 5 million people following 
islam is the only moslem majority area among indias 25 states 
nationwide moslems account for 12 percent of the 880 million 
population 
kashmiri militants at first demanded union with pakistan but 
have recently campaigned for a separate neutral country which if 
formed would nestle between india pakistan and china

china today protested a visit to czechoslovakia 
by the tibetan spiritual leader the dalai lama and beijing 
retaliated by postponing the visit of a czechoslovak minister 
the dalai lama who received the nobel peace prize last year 
has championed tibetan autonomy chinese diplomats in prague 
earlier criticized his visit as an indication of political support 
for separatism in tibet which is ruled by communist china 
czechoslovakias ambassador to china eduard saul was summoned 
to the foreign ministry today and told the dalai lamas visit 
constitutes a gross interference in chinas internal affairs 
the official xinhua news agency reported 
saul also was told that china is postponing a visit by 
czechoslovakias minister of metallurgy engineering and the 
electrotechnical industry scheduled to begin feb 17 xinhua said 
the dalai lama was invited by czechoslovakias new noncommunist 
president vaclav havel for a fourday private visit that began 
friday 
the tibetan religious leader talked to reporters today but did 
not address the chinese protest directly he said he was pleased to 
visit czechoslovakia following its peaceful prodemocratcy 
uprising in november that ousted its hardline communist leadership 
he said only time will tell whether the chinese government will 
change and he appeared to urge other countries to take a firm 
stand with the beijing leadership 
our experience is that when somebody tries to appease them 
they get bolder and bolder but if you stand firm they show more 
compliance he said 
the buddhist monk is to spend sunday in spiritual 
consultations and meditations with havel 
havel said monday he had told chinas ambassador to 
czechoslovakia that the dalai lamas visit was personal 
i wanted to meet with him a long time ago when i was not yet a 
president i want to meditate with him the czechoslovak leader 
said if the chinese republic is not satisfied with this 
explanation i am sorry 
havel a playwright and former dissident became president last 
month in the culmination of czechoslovakias revolution 
china says tibet has been part of china for 700 years and 
accuses the dalai lama of instigating proindependence violence 
that has hit the tibetan capital of lhasa repeatedly in the past 
two years lhasa remains under martial law imposed nearly a year 
ago after a round of antichinese rioting 
the dalai lama fled tibet to india in 1959

antiapartheid activists long 
banned from public comment spoke out freely today as the government 
put into effect sweeping political reforms announced a day earlier 
by president fw de klerk 
thousands of blacks celebrated the changes at a stadium at 
alexandra a black township near johannesburg chanting viva 
anc and swaying to the rhythm of freedom songs blacks also 
celebrated in cape town and in the natal provincial capital of 
pietermaritzburg 
the day before de klerk legalized the african national 
congress the main guerrilla group fighting white rule and lifted 
restrictions on 60 opposition groups and 374 individuals 
for the first time in three decades helen joseph a friend of 
jailed black leader nelson mandela and the first white person ever 
placed under house arrest for antigovernment activity was quoted 
by newspapers 
this is a wonderful day i am very excited about my personal 
freedom since i am no longer a listed person ms joseph 84 was 
quoted as saying by the star in johnannesburg above all i am 
excited about the return of all my friends and comrades and all the 
exiles who will be coming back home all my comrades who will be 
released from jail 
in his speech de klerk also promised to release mandela the 
jailed leader of the anc but de klerk did not say when 
in addition the president placed a moratorium on executions and 
partially lifted emergency restrictions on the news media police 
still will retain control over photography or the filming of 
political unrest and police action 
de klerks announcements friday met most of the conditions set 
by the anc to begin negotiations on a new constitution to bring the 
black majority into the nations political life however many 
activists said the government must go further and dismantle 
apartheid under which the 28million black majority has no say in 
national affairs 
the concessions announced by de klerk will help efforts to end 
an international sports boycott on south africa johan du plessis 
chairman of the south african national olympic committee said 
today a lot more people will listen to what we have to say 
now he said 
blacks have repeatedly demonstrated against a british cricket 
teams that is touring south africa in defiance of the international 
ban on sports teams competing here today 7000 people gathered 
outside a cricket stadium in pietermaritzburg to protest the team 
english captain mike gatting walked out to a truck where protest 
leaders handed him a petition members of the crowd hurled stones 
and insults as he left but no injuries were reported 
notices were published today in the government gazette making 
official the lifting of 30yearold bans on the anc the 
panafricanist congress the south african communist party and 
other organizations 
anc leaders have been cautious about an invitation by de klerk 
for exiled black activists to return home even with the groups 
legalized they say there are many security laws and emergency 
regulations in effect that could be used to arrest leaders of the 
anc and other groups 
the government repealed laws that banned 175 people including 
anc president oliver tambo now recovering from a stroke in sweden 
and the ancs chief spokesman tom sebina the leader of the south 
african communist party 
it removed stateofemergency prohibitions on travel and public 
speaking on another 200 people 
the citizen a progrovernment newspaper said if the atmosphere 
remained calm the 71yearold mandela might be freed by next 
weekend 
de klerk had said concerns about mandelas safety and other 
issues would delay his release from a life prison term for sabotage 
and plotting to overthrow the whiterun government 
the state president is very fluid and moves very fast judging 
by his speech in parliament mr mandelas release could happen any 
day now the newspaper quoted an unidentified government source 
as saying 
on friday the anglican archbishop desmond tutu winner of the 
1984 nobel peace prize called de klerks speech incredible 
what he said has certainly taken my breath away tutu said 
we could say that we are probably seeing history in the making in 
south africa 
the exiled anc said de klerks announcements go a long way to 
creating the climate conducive to negotiations but the 
zambiabased group said more changes are needed before talks could 
begin 
the anc was outlawed in 1960 after 48 years of nonviolent 
campaigning for black rights in 1961 it launched a guerrilla war 
the anc and all leading antiapartheid groups demand a 
oneperson onevote democracy which de klerk opposes saying it 
will result in the 28 million blacks dominating the 5 million 
whites 
de klerk since taking office in august has said he envisions 
some type of system in which no single racial group would dominate

surgeons have implanted into a human an 
experimental device consisting of a slender bundle of fibers that 
works like a lung in bringing oxygen to the heart lds hospital 
said 
the device the intravascular oxygenator or ivox is not a lung 
replacement but a temporary mechanism to give patients with lung 
damage time to heal the food and drug administration has approved 
its use for up to seven days 
the salt lake tribune said the hospital is apparently the first 
to insert the device 
hospital spokesman tim madden said friday that the twohour 
procedure had taken place that afternoon he said he could not 
confirm the age sex or condition of the patient in accordance with 
the wishes of the patients family 
the tribune quoting an unidentified hospital source reported 
today that the recipient is a 16yearold girl 
dr roger c millar performed the operation which involved 
inserting the device a long bundle of tubes as thin as hairs 
into the inferior vena cava the large vein that brings blood to 
the heart from the body 
in september the fda granted approval for limited testing of 
the device 
the device consists of hollow fibers through which oxygen is 
delivered and carbon dioxide removed two intravenous tubes 
attached to the bundle leave the body one to deliver oyxgen the 
other to remove carbon dioxide 
developers of the device say it could help patients recover from 
acute respiratory failure caused by inhalation of smoke or other 
noxious fumes or by drugs severe pneumonia and scores of other 
ailments 
the only alternative for people with acute lung failure is an 
extracorporeal oxygenator a large machine that requires pumping 
the blood outside the body 
dr jd mortensen the devices inventor said the device 
performs much like the natural membranes in the air sacs in the 
human lung 
the developer of the new device cardiopulmonics inc a salt 
lake city biomedical technology company announced jan 11 that the 
ivox would be tested in 10 patients at four us medical centers 
other centers approved to use the ivox are penn states hershey 
medical center the university of michigan medical center in ann 
arbor and the los angeles countyuniversity of southern california 
medical center 
the ivox is to be tested on patients with acute respiratory 
failure who have little chance of survival using previous treatment 
methods 
madden said doctors at lds hospital and the hershey medical 
center have been evaluating patients who might qualify for the 
first clinical trials several centers in europe and japan also 
have been selected to try the procedure 
the product was the outcome of membrane technology that makes 
much higher concentrations of oxygen available using polypropylene 
tubes the width of a hair 
the temporary artificial lung is threaded through a vein in the 
leg or neck into the bodys main vein and can be removed the same 
way it has been tested on dogs and sheep 
a spokesman at cardiopulmonics said friday he had been asked not 
to comment on the medical procedure

rival christian forces fought with tanks 
and gunboats for a fifth day today violating a vaticanbrokered 
truce after just three hours shellfire killed 25 people and 
trapped 500000 in shelters 
the renewed artillery barrage caught unprotected civilians who 
had emerged from shelters to inspect damage inflicted on their 
property in moslem west beirut and the citys eastern christian 
sector 
it was the sixth failed attempt to stop the fighting between 
gen michel aouns army and the lebanese forces militia for control 
of lebanons christian enclave the lebanese forces led by samir 
geagea is the main christian militia 
aoun and geagea had announced they accepted a ceasefire called 
by the vatican through papal nuncio pablo puente and maronite 
catholic patriarch nasrallah sfeir spiritual head of the maronite 
community 
aoun and geagea belong to that sect 
the big guns fell silent shortly after the 115 pm deadline 
but shellfire resumed three hours later with about six shells 
falling every minute a police spokesman said 
it was not immediately clear who had broken the ceasefire 
geagea said in an interview broadcast live by the christian 
voice of lebanon radio that his militia was fully abiding by 
the ceasefire 
aouns command in a statement broadcast by his radio lebanon 
said the generals positions were being shelled the short 
statement did not elaborate 
no clear victor emerged from the earlier fighting which sent 
shells crashing into highrise apartment buildings schools 
hospitals power plants water pumping stations and fuel tanks 
police said 25 more people were killed overnight and 70 wounded 
bringing the overall toll to at least 152 dead and 586 wounded in 
the showdown between the rival militias casualty figures from the 
latest fighting were not immediately available 
fires burned out of control earlier today as snipers kept 
firefighters from battling the blazes police appealed to civil 
defense squads to race to the rescue of trapped tenants in three 
burning apartment buildings in east beiruts main residential 
district of ashrafiyeh 
the lebanese forces claimed it had brought most of christian 
east beirut under its control with a mass defection by enemy 
soldiers at beiruts port and along half the citys threemile 
dividing green line 
this brought the bulk of east beirut under lebanese forces 
control the statement claimed it did not say how many soldiers 
had defected 
if the claim is accurate aouns forces would have lost their 
only sea outlet for replenishing supplies the beirut harbor 
aoun denied the claim in a statement he said lebanese forces 
militiamen shot the soldiers in the back while they defended 
the green line 
there was no independent confirmation of the claims 
police said at least half of the christian enclaves 1 million 
people had been huddled in basements and bomb shelters before the 
ceasefire today with rapidly dwindling food and water and no 
lights 
the warring forces had ignored earlier appeals by the 
international red cross for a humanitarian ceasefire to allow 
evacuation of casualties on the streets and to send food to trapped 
residents hospitals appealed for blood plasma oxygen and water 
supplies 
aoun 54 insists on disbanding the 6000member lebanese forces 
to strengthen his hold on the christian enclave but geagea 40 
has vowed to fight to the death to defend the militia that has 
borne the brunt of the fighting against the moslems in lebanons 
15yearold civil war 
aoun who has been dismissed as army commander but clings to 
command of about 20000 soldiers attacked tuesday to gain full 
control of the enclave north and east of beirut 
aoun was fired by president elias hrawi who was elected in 
november under the terms of a peace plan brokered by the arab 
league the plan was aimed at increasing political power of the 
moslem majority and ending the civil war which has left 150000 
people dead 
aoun complains that the plan approved by parliament in october 
provides no fixed withdrawal timetable for syrias estimated 40000 
troops they came in 1976 under an arab league peacekeeping 
mandate but aoun says they are simply fighting as an ally of 
moslem militias 
geagea has neither accepted or rejected the peace accord but he 
has recognized hrawi as president syria the united states and 
much of the international community also recognize hrawis 
government

elderly people who were taught transcendental 
meditation lived longer than their peers in a new study that 
experts called the first direct scientific evidence that meditation 
can prolong life 
the technique worked better than two others for lowering blood 
pressure and improving several aspects of mental function as well 
as extending lifespan researchers reported 
its a rather dramatic finding said psychologist arthur 
aron of the university of california at santa cruz who was 
familiar with the work i think its very impressive 
two other psychologists who study meditation said they suspect 
the outcome was due to factors other than transcendental meditation 
itself they also suggested that other techniques might do as well 
or better 
the work done at harvard university is presented in the 
december issue of the journal of personality and social psychology 
which is published by the american psychological association 
the study included 73 volunteers with an average age of 81 
from eight homes for the elderly they were assigned randomly to 
learn transcendental meditation another technique called 
mindfulness training a simple relaxation program or no training 
at all 
three years later all 20 of those taught transcendental 
meditation were still alive survival rates in the other groups 
were 88 percent 65 percent and 77 percent respectively 
transcendental meditation or tm was taught in the 1960s and 
70s by the indian maharishi mahesh yogi a guru to the beatles and 
other celebrities 
tm induces a a distinctively deep state of rest while the 
mind is alert but in a very settled quiet state said study 
coauthor charles alexander now an associate professor of 
psychology at maharishi international university in fairfield iowa 
students there practice tm as part of the curriculum alexander 
said 
the mindfulness training used in the study was not the buddhist 
technique of the same name instead it was designed to stimulate 
creation of ideas or new perspectives through a verbal exercise and 
a challenge to think about topics in new and creative ways 
each technique was practiced for 20 minutes twice daily with the 
eyes closed during the 12week experiment 
alexander attributed the studys outcome to tms combination of 
high wakefulness which he said combats atrophy of the mind and so 
the body and deep restfulness which he said releases stress from 
the nervous system and leads to reduced wear and tear on mind 
and body 
he said the study suggests tm should be combined with standard 
western medicine not replace it 
some other meditation researchers suggested different 
explanations for the outcome 
michael maliszewski director of behavioral medicine at the 
diamond headache clinic in chicago said tm instructors may have 
differed from the instructors of the other techniques in terms of 
motivation or other factors that could have given their teachings 
more impact the tm group had fewer dropouts than the other groups 
he noted 
he also said he suspected that chinese taoist meditative 
techniques which he said were designed to increase longevity 
might do so better than tm taoism has not been studied 
experimentally so far he said 
alexander replied that a survey covering most dropouts found 
their decision had nothing to do with the quality of the 
instructors he also said other studies have found tm superior to 
alternative techniques in improving aspects of physical and mental 
health even though the commitment of the instructors of other 
techniques was presumeably as high as that of the tm instructors 
jonathan c smith director of the roosevelt university stress 
institute in chicago said the result could have come from 
combining relaxation with the idea of connecting to something 
larger than oneself tms notion of a consciousness underlying all 
beings any relaxation technique with what he called such religious 
undercurrents might have done as well he said 
alexander said instructors for each of the techniques strongly 
downplayed philosophical considerations in the training only one 
tm student said he perceived tm in spiritual terms alexander said

with revolution in eastern europe accelerating 
and germans driving to reunite secretary of state james a baker 
iii is off this week on a diplomatic journey that tests the 
influence of the superpowers to shape these fastpaced events 
in bakers bulging briefcase are a dozen tough problems ranging 
from the german issue and the sometimes nasty turns the changes in 
eastern europe have taken to the lingering 12year war in 
afghanistan between the sovietbacked marxist government and 
usarmed rebels 
the centerpiece of bakers nineday trip which begins monday 
evening is a facetoface session with soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev toward the end of the week in moscow that will give 
baker a firsthand account of the course the kremlin is taking on 
german reunification and of how gorbachev is addressing soviet 
political and economic problems 
rumors last week that gorbachev might surrender his post as 
general secretary of the communist party at a central committee 
meeting monday and tuesday renewed us interest in his personal 
fate and the course of soviet reform 
both president bush hailing in his state of the union speech 
the new era in the worlds affairs launched by gorbachev and 
baker praising the reformers in testimony to the senate 
foreign relations committee are making a calculated effort to 
bolster gorbachev as he tries to overcome resistance to his program 
of perestroika 
baker is taking new offers of technical cooperation to moscow 
and in three days of talks with foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze hopes to remove some of the remaining roadblocks to 
completion of a treaty to reduce us and soviet longrange nuclear 
missiles submarines and bombers by 30 percent to 50 percent 
the idea is to have a treaty ready for bush and gorbachev to 
sign at a washington summit meeting in june bakers talks with 
shevardnadze which begin wednesday night are intended as 
preparations for the event 
baker also is prepared to extend the promise of trade 
privileges provided the soviets codify their recent easing of 
emigration restrictions 
at the same time though the bush administration has to assess 
ways of encouraging democratic trends in the soviet union and 
eastern europe in the event gorbachevs powers ebb 
there seems to be little doubt however that the bushbaker 
team is determined to cooperate with gorbachev the question that 
hangs over bakers mission apart from the slow response of the 
soviet economy is how much influence the two superpowers working 
together can have on world events 
the accelerating drive by east and west germans to form one 
country again and the tremors this causes among some europeans 
apparently is only slightly responsive to us and soviet wishes 
gorbachev last week softened his opposition saying unification 
was not in doubt but must come as part of a revision of europes 
political and military structure 
baker meanwhile reiterated us support for reunification but 
steered clear of picking and choosing among the approaches that 
have surfaced 
among them is one by hans modrow the east german premier for a 
neutral single state that would belong neither to nato nor the 
warsaw pact and another by west german foreign minister 
hansdietrich genscher that would keep germany in nato but leave 
the east german region demilitarized 
baker met with genscher on friday night on the german question 
and planned a session with french foreign minister roland dumas at 
shannon airport in ireland early tuesday while bakers jet is being 
refueled 
pursuing a fast pace baker will then fly to prague for 27 hours 
in the capital of czechoslovakia the central european ally of the 
soviet union that is in the midst of an untroubled transition to 
democracy 
during that brief visit baker will meet with president vaclav 
havel and other leaders of the new government and make a speech in 
which he is expected to strengthen his qualified endorsement of a 
35nation european summit meeting this year a gorbachev formula 
for easing eastwest tensions 
bush set the tone for bakers trip in his state of the union 
speech with a proposal to cut us and soviet troops in europe to 
225000 with a limit of 195000 in central europe 
that meshes with calls on gorbachev by czechoslovakia poland 
and hungary to remove soviet forces and with gorbachevs apparent 
willingness to comply while leaving tens of thousands in east 
germany 
what the bush initiative may do to negotiations in vienna is not 
clear nato and the warsaw pact are in the midst of completing a 
treaty to cut the troop levels to 275000 as bush proposed last 
june along with reductions in tanks and other weapons 
the spokesman for the soviet foreign ministry gennady 
gerasimov welcomed the new troop cut proposal on thursday as a 
step in the right direction but a more complete response is 
expected when baker sees shevardnadze 
in this area too the influence of the superpowers has its 
limits 
while both the united states and the soviet union want to make 
deeper cuts some of the us allies particularly britain are 
edgy about withdrawing around 100000 american soldiers from 
europe administration officials acknowledge that if there is a 
hangup it will be with the allies although so far most of them 
seem to be going along 
on saturday at the end of his visit baker will make an 
unprecedented appearance and answer questions before the 44member 
international affairs committee of the supreme soviet the nations 
chief legislative body 
he will make a brief opening statement and then answer questions 
for 90 minutes in the presence of american and soviet reporters 
on the way home baker will stop in ottawa canada to attend a 
meeting feb 1213 of nato and warsaw pact officials to discuss an 
open skies proposal that would open us and soviet territory 
to overflights 
there is room on his schedule before then to squeeze in another 
east european stop or to hold a meeting somewhere in europe with 
foreign ministers moshe arens of israel and esmat abdelmeguid of 
egypt 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said baker had no 
other stops planned but said she could not rule anything out 
anything is possible she said

incidents 
hundreds marched on the local police precinct thursday night to 
protest the shootings in the bushwick section of brooklyn on 
friday residents remained angry 
people are tired of this manuel vasquez 38 said were 
supposed to be more afraid of the criminals than the cops its 
getting not that way anymore 
its just murder plain old murder said one marcher at the 
demonstration where three people were arrested after rocks and 
bottles were thrown at police in riot gear 
residents of bushwick which has one of the highest murder rates 
in the city have seen the number of people killed by police climb 
in recent years 
when they see you with gold right away cops think youre a 
drug dealer said george ponce 20 as he stood friday across 
from the police precinct

jose louis lebron who was killed wednesday in front of a candy 
store after he was shot behind the right ear by officer frank 
albergo

he saw lebron reaching into his jacket for a weapon acted within 
police guidelines police have promised a thorough investigation 
police said lebron had robbed someone of 10 
four days earlier and five blocks away louis liranso 17 was 
shot in the back and killed by officer hyda hernandez after 
liranso who was unarmed allegedly lowered his hands and turned 
toward the officer 
hernandez has been suspended and a grand jury is examining the 
case 
residents mince no words about the shootings 
killer cop albergo was painted on a blue badge on a wall 
near the slaying scene 
and on the sidewalk where lebron died were the words killed 
by a man in blue 
but one officer who spoke on the condition of anonymity said 
lebron was a neighborhood tough who bullied others and was always 
on the street hanging out and drinking 
the hispanic officer who described walking the beat in bushwick 
as wearing a uniform standing around and hoping nothing goes on 
around you said local youths wont back down if theyre with 
one another not even to an officer 
lebron was the seventh person fatally shot by police in january 
six of the shootings have occurred in brooklyn in 1989 30 people 
were killed by police in 1988 25 died and 14 died in 1987 
on friday police fatally shot a teenager carrying what turned 
out to be an unloaded gun and 35 vials of crack after he attempted 
to hold up a man said sgt nick vreeland a police spokesman 
police shot robert cole 13 as he approached officers and was 
warned three times to drop his handgun vreeland said 
lebron was recalled as a happy kid 
he was always smiling said his 22yearold brother ruben 
wiping a tear from his cheek he was the clown of the block if 
this tragedy happened to someone else hed make us laugh

don edwards got a good look at the house 
unamerican activities committee when he arrived in the nations 
capital nearly three decades ago he never wanted to see anything 
like it again 
edwards 75 is now in his 14th term as a democratic 
representative from california during those years this onetime 
young republican and former fbi agent has acquired a reputation as 
one of the houses most outspoken yet effective civil libertarians 
conservatives grumble that he has thwarted them on abortion 
school prayer and a wide range of other potentially explosive 
issues liberals meanwhile have come to venerate him for his 
willingness to speak out when others fear the political 
consequences 
when president bush launched his war on drugs for example 
edwards warned that the presidents proposals would move the 
country ever closer to a police state 
in a free society values are not imposed by wholesale arrests 
and imprisonment of minor offenders he declared 
he blasted bush as trigger happy in panama much as he had 
called the us invasion of grenada under ronald reagan 
international outlawry 
this year edwards is a chief sponsor of legislation to 
counteract supreme court rulings on job bias that dismayed civil 
rights forces last year 
he also is pushing a bill to erase the impact of a 1989 ruling 
that widened the power of states to restrict abortions he concedes 
that chances of approval this year are not the best but plans 
fullscale hearings in his judiciary subcommittee anyway doubtless 
with an eye to driving home the electionyear message 
if anticrime legislation currently in the senate reaches the 
house the spotlight again is likely to fall on edwards he makes 
no bones about his dislike for a provision that would ease 
restrictions on the kind of evidence prosecutors may introduce in 
criminal trials 
despite his combative role edwards presence is far from 
fierce his affability has made him popular in the house despite 
his naysaying over the congressional recess he grew a moustache 
for the first time in his life but told an interviewer that top 
aide roberta haeberle had ordered him to shave it off i have 
to he chortled 
born in san jose the heart of the district he now represents 
edwards was educated in public schools there stanford university 
and stanford law school before coming to washington he was an fbi 
agent a naval intelligence and gunnery officer and founder of a 
title insurance business 
so conservative was edwards in younger days that he became a 
leader of california young republicans and once led a candlelight 
demonstration of support for richard nixon over the years he has 
given a variety of reasons for his 180degree political turn 
they have included his experiences in the navy in world war ii 
and the advent of nuclear weapons in an interview he suggested 
the chief catalyst was that when i got here in january 1963 i was 
terribly offended by the house unamerican activities committee 
edwards was a stern critic of the committee whose hearings into 
alleged communist subversion in the 1950s were labeled witch 
hunts by liberals it was edwards who offered the resolution in 
the democratic caucus that led to abolition of the panel whose 
name by that time had been changed to the house internal security 
committee 
i remember the day we did it in he says with evident 
satisfaction the panels once dreaded files are today locked up 
for 50 years and stored in a capitol hill basement under custody of 
the house judiciary committee 
as chairman of the judiciary committees subcommittee on civil 
and constitutional rights edwards has considerable power to block 
legislation dear to conservatives and he has done so often 
especially in the case of proposed amendments to the constitution 
he has blocked amendments to ban abortion halt school busing 
restrict the president to a single term and require a balanced 
budget among other things by locking them up in his subcommittee 
and throwing away the key as a result the proposals never reach 
the house floor for a vote 
don edwards is the guardian of the constitution says ralph 
neas executive director of the leadership conference on civil 
rights and his subcommittee has been a graveyard for regressive 
and unconstitutional legislation so he has blocked the rightwing 
agenda as well as implemented the progressive agenda on civil 
rights 
rep henry j hyde rill once complained that edwards panel 
is the bermuda triangle of proposed constitutional amendments 
in edwards view the constitution has worked just fine and 
doesnt need to be tampered with especially not with proposals to 
restrict civil and individual rights 
the subcommittee that i chair takes very seriously its 
responsibility to protect the constitution he says i think 
that it is my obligation to use every legitimate weapon that we 
have to defend the constitution 
in recent years just two proposed amendments have emerged from 
the committee one would provide the district of columbia with 
house voting rights the other is the equal rights amendment we 
think that would be beneficial edwards says 
im sure he takes heat for his outspoken ways says althea 
simmons chief lobbyist for the national association for the 
advancement of colored people because civil rights is sometimes 
in fashion and sometimes out of fashion but you can count on don 
edwards whether its fashionable or not 
not only does he almost always vote correctly from our point 
of view but he is willing to speak out on very controversial 
issues says morton halperin head of the washington office of 
the american civil liberties union 
edwards poohpoohs the political dangers he cites his first 
vote against funds for the unamerican activities committee the 
clerk was so surprised that he did a double take and called 
edwards name again 
it hit the fan back home recalls edwards but then before 
you know it people were saying well it wasnt much of a 
committee anyway 
democrats say edwardss constituents for the most part see him 
as a nice guy and dont worry too much about his crusading 
their relaxed view however was not shared by edwards onetime 
boss the late fbi director j edgar hoover he didnt like 
criticism the congressman recalls i felt it was my duty to 
criticize the agency 
some time back when edwards was going through some personal 
turmoil he considered leaving congress and went so far as to 
announce his retirement on the wall in his watergate apartment 
today is a framed copy of an fbi memo reporting his decision 
the directors comment was scrawled at the bottom good 
riddance h 
it was more than a little premature that was 20 years ago and 
edwards soon changed his mind and ran for reelection after all

if the allegations are to be believed rightwing 
extremists in the mi5 intelligence service schemed to portray two 
former prime ministers and an array of other politicians as 
terrorist dupes and soviet stooges 
these lurid tales once confined to the political fringes have 
suddenly gained a measure of credibility through a series of 
official disclosures although the allegations date back years 
before she came to power prime minister margaret thatcher finds 
herself caught in mounting clamor for an inquiry 
the basic claim is that in 197374 when britain was suffering 
from irish separatist violence trade union militancy and weak 
government secret service rightwingers plotted to destabilize any 
politician from prime ministers harold wilson and edward heath 
downward who didnt share their hardline anticommunist views 
the main source of these claims is colin wallace a former army 
press officer in his native northern ireland who says his secret 
job was to spread disinformation 
wallace 46 says he didnt mind using his natural charm and air 
of trustworthiness to spread lies about terrorists at the height of 
the provinces troubles in the early 1970s 
but he says he became uneasy when the disinformation campaign 
codenamed clockwork orange turned against politicians 
we were fabricating information that alleged that key 
individuals were corrupt in terms of their moral political or 
financial behavior through their links with communists or their 
extramarital activities wallace said in an interview 
wallace says his disenchantment grew over suspicions that 
homosexual abuse at a belfast boys orphanage was covered up to 
protect or blackmail senior unidentified figures 
in 1975 wallace was dismissed for leaking a document to a 
journalist he insists the leak was part of his job and that the 
dismissal was contrived to silence him 
wallace says this was followed by a series of attempts to 
destroy his credibility by portraying him as a fantasist in 1981 
he was jailed for manslaughter a frameup he claims 
released in 1986 he has sought to interest the media in his 
story with limited success until tuesday when armed forces 
minister archie hamilton told parliament that recently discovered 
papers suggested the possibility that wallace was indeed under 
verbal instructions to engage in disinformation 
hamilton also confirmed some of wallaces specific claims such 
as that the dirty tricks included using forged cia identity cards 
in 1973 
hamilton insisted the disinformation was directed only at the 
irish republican army and never expanded to smear politicians he 
said the operation had no clearance from senior officials and was 
shut down in the mid1970s 
but it was the first admission by a government official that a 
dirtytricks campaign existed and that wallace was part of it it 
triggered uproar in parliament and the media 
the next day mrs thatcher disclosed that several statements 
she and other ministers had made on the matter were incorrect or 
require clarification 
she said these past statements had relied on information 
provided by civil servants and that there had been errors in the 
handling of departmental papers 
but she stood by her previous statements that there was no 
evidence of politicians being smeared 
the events in question predate 1975 when mrs thatcher 
succeeded edward heath as conservative party leader but they are 
an embarrassment given her record of unwavering support for the 
security services 
wallace has a file in his handwriting which he says consists of 
notes fed to him in the 1970s by security service intelligence 
officers to be used against politicians 
the notes reproduced in a book about his case are mainly 
insinuations about alleged soviet influence over the labor party 
such as the bizarre theory that the kgb murdered party leader hugh 
gaitskell to make way for the supposedly prosoviet harold wilson 
merlyn rees the chief minister in northern ireland during part 
of the disinformation campaign displayed on television a proira 
leaflet which he said had been doctored to include his and other 
labor politicians names 
conservative party moderates including former prime minister 
heath also turn up in wallaces notes 
the conservative daily telegraph in an editorial dismissed 
wallace as a loose cannon who was being exploited to embarrass 
the government and wallaces critics say that having once been 
paid to lie he cant expect to be believed now 
wallace replies dont believe me have a look for yourselves 
all the evidence is there 
an inquiry has been ordered into whether wallace was unfairly 
dismissed but opposition lawmakers as well as a few tories want 
a much broader inquiry 
this will not go away there is no hiding place rees warned 
in parliament the next labor government will look at it and 
those who are hiding things from this government had better 
remember that

rules of decorum 
house of delegates speaker r clayton mitchell jr said friday 
that juanita d miller defied him after he refused her request to 
let a high school group sing on the house floor jan 15 
it is a disciplinary action she and everyone has to know that 
open defiance is not the way mitchell said certain things are 
followed by tradition

the prince georges county chamber of commerce he wants to make 
her behave and put her in the closet in the big house

from performing in the chamber 
not all legislators perceived racial overtones in the move 
i think its a matter of internal discipline said sen 
albert r wynn also a prince georges democrat and one of six 
blacks in the 47member senate i dont think its racial 
miller said she was told mitchell would reassign her from the 
house economic matters committee which oversees business banking 
consumer and labor laws to the judiciary committee 
the two committees are about equally prestigious although 
members of economic matters tend to receive more campaign 
contributions from industry groups they regulate 
miller noted that the house has observed st patricks day for 
decades by having a nonmember sing danny boy 
i want to see what happens on st patricks day this year 
she said is mitchell telling me as an africanamerican that 
we cant do this but they can because its been done for 20 years

thousands of americans who have stopped 
looking for work because they are discouraged are part of a 
hidden unemployment problem that some analysts say boosts the 
real jobless rate to around 8 percent 
the labor department reported friday that the nations 
unemployment rate or the number of americans actively seeking 
work held steady in january at 53 percent for the eighth straight 
month 
socalled discouraged workers however are not included in the 
departments monthly unemployment figure an exclusion some 
analysts consider misleading 
those experts also think a percentage of underemployed 
workers or those who hold parttime jobs but would rather be 
fulltime should be included to give a more accurate picture of 
the nations jobless problem 
we think including those numbers would give a truer picture of 
whats going on said candice johnson a spokeswoman for the 142 
millionmember aflcio 
the unemployment rate hides a lot of things and masks many of 
the problems with our economy we need to be taking a broader 
look said barry bluestone a political economist at the 
university of massachusetts 
because the number of discouraged workers tends to rise and fall 
with economic swings some economists believe those people or at 
least some of them should be counted in the unemployment figures 
there were about 827000 discouraged workers in the final 
quarter of 1989 the last period for which figures are available 
while 18 million americans had given up on looking for work at the 
height of the 1982 recession 
the number increases during recessions and decreases during 
good times if you believe a growth in the number of discouraged 
workers means an increase in unemployment then it should be 
counted said sar levitan an economist at george washington 
university 
discouraged workers have been overlooked as the nation enjoys a 
relatively low and steady jobless rate according to some analysts 
theres been relatively low unemployment for the past few 
years and those left behind are being forgotten by and large we 
pay very little attention to them levitan said 
in the labor departments unemployment report for december a 
quarterly report showed that had all discouraged workers been 
counted along with half of the involuntary parttimers the 
unemployment rate would have been 79 percent 
however others contend the labor department includes too many 
people when calculating the official unemployment level such as 
students and those who have been jobless only for a few weeks 
there are as many people who think we overestimate as there 
are those who think we underestimate said deborah klein an 
economist with the departments bureau of labor statistics 
some discouraged workers have lacked jobs in months and 
therefore should not be considered part of the workforce ms klein 
said 
its a state of mind two people in the same situation might 
respond differently she said 
the argument over what information to include has been going on 
since measurements for unemployment were defined in the 1940s ms 
klein said over the years outside commissions have studied and 
refined the definitions congress does not control the guidelines 
it is not willynilly though it is not mandated we would not 
feel comfortable with wholesale changes the definition is one 
thats stood the test of time ms klein said 
levitan headed the last commission to study the issue and 
recommended in 1979 that further review be given to including a 
portion of discouraged workers in the official unemployment figure 
when the reagan administration took office officials cited a lack 
of resources in turning down the request levitan said 
about half of those who classify themselves as discouraged 
workers should be counted as unemployed levitan said which would 
still put the unemployment figure above the governments official 
rate 
bluestone and a colleague labor historian jim green said many 
of the discouraged workers probably lost highpaying factory jobs 
in the recent manufacturing slump and cannot bring themselves to 
accept lower wages 
if i were in that situation i would probably also say geez 
whats the point im working only to be poor green said it 
used to be that if you worked hard and saved your money things 
would improve its not necessarily like that anymore

found scruggs letter says eventually we may need to replace 
these panels but it is imperative that we buy the stone now if we 
wait the replacement panels wont match the rest of the memorial 
our attorneys have filed a claim against the contractors but 
that may take years quite frankly your memorial cant wait 
we need to raise 376500 
of that amount said bob frank a virginia accountant who is 
treasurer of the taxexempt fund 90000 is needed to replace 
black granite panels which have developed hairline cracks and 
111000 to engrave additional names on the memorial and to replace 
misspelled names 
the remainder is to be set aside to pay the costs of arbitration 
in the attempt to persuade the contractors to absorb the cost of 
replacing cracked panels frank said 
the granite for the replacement panels has been purchased and is 
weathering at the quantico marine base in virginia in hopes the new 
panels will match those on the existing wall scruggs said in 
retrospect its something i wished wed done in 1982 he said 
from time to time names have been added when the defense 
department determined that the death of a vietnam veteran had been 
the result of war wounds or when misspellings were found 
the monument now carries 58174 names most of the errors were 
on lists provided by the defense department frank and scruggs said 
they said they hope the fund drive actually will raise between 
1 million and 15 million enough to build an endowment for 
future improvements repairs and contingencies frank said the fund 
now has 450000 in the bank 
frank declined to say how effective the mailings have been since 
they are still undergoing testing it is premature to discuss the 
outcome but we are very encouraged he said 
scruggs said however that the solicitation was drawing a 
response from about 5 percent of recipients he said that was 
encouraging because charity drives generally get only about a 2 
percent return 
the appeal is being conducted by a professional fundraising 
organization using rented list of potential donors scruggs said 
the letter was professionally written 
scruggs said previously the fund had staged rock concerts or 
sought corporate donations to meet such expenses as installing 
lights and wider walkways and adding names to the 493foot wall and 
conducting veterans day and memorial day ceremonies at the monument 
under an agreement with the national park service the fund pays 
for permanent changes to the memorial and the government pays for 
daytoday maintenance guards cleaning and the like said park 
service spokesman earle kittleman 
for a number of years the monument was the most popular 
visitors stop in washington now kittleman said the monument and 
the nearby lincoln memorial both draw about the same number of 
visitors

democrats will have to decide between major 
meetings next month in new orleans or indianapolis and the rivalry 
has more to do with philosophy than a preference for pork 
tenderloin or jambalaya 
for party chairman ronald h brown and the members of the 
democratic national committee the choice was easy theyre going 
to indianapolis to showcase indianas youthful democratic governor 
evan bayh and tout their chances of capturing the senate seat once 
held by vice president dan quayle 
another large group of democrats including many of the partys 
leading officeholders will convene at the same time in new orleans 
somehow and nobody is willing to call it anything but an 
accident the dnc and the democratic leadership council chose the 
same dates the last week in march for their meetings 
it was not some deliberate picking a fight said brown when 
asked about the conflict when we set the date i didnt know 
about the dlc meeting 
as far as i know it was inadvertent said dlc executive 
director al from who went on to suggest that the most important 
party business would take place in new orleans 
theyre the dnc not going to do anything he said its 
a routine business meeting as opposed to something that might be 
really spectacular 
from said the dlc formed in 1985 by elected officials concerned 
about what they perceived as the national partys leftward drift 
would spend its time in new orleans discussing an agenda for the 
90s that will lead this party and the country in a different 
direction 
he said that at the dnc sessions the same old activists get 
together and dance on the same ground that people lose on every 
time 
brown will not ignore the dlc he plans to address its closing 
session and deliver a tough message calling on its members to stop 
bashing the national party 
id be less than honest if i didnt think that some of the 
speeches that ive heard recently are just kind of gratuitous 
said the party chairman 
he declined to specify which speeches bothered him but an 
attack on national democrats by sen charles robb dva seemed to 
fit the bill 
robb told a dlc meeting that democrats were in a quandary 
because we have difficulty conceiving of our mission in terms other 
than federal activism 
the senator a former chairman of the dlc and one of its 
founding members described the party as in thrall to the special 
interests 
brown made it clear he was tired of attacks on the national 
party 
weve been moving in a pretty solid pragmatic commonsense 
direction this year and i think everybody acknowledges that he 
said so when folks attack the national party i dont know who 
theyre talking about 
the chairman said the message he wanted to deliver to the dlc 
was that while they and the dnc dont always agree were 
certainly moving in the same direction 
shortly after he was elected party chairman last year brown 
attended a dlc meeting and said pointedly that i know there are 
many in this room who were less than wildly enthusiastic about the 
prospect of ron brown being chairman of the democratic national 
committee 
for brown the political attraction of indianapolis was clear 
party leaders view 34yearold bayh the first democratic governor 
of indiana in 16 years as a rising star they also have their eyes 
set on republican sen dan coats appointed last year to replace 
quayle coats has yet to be tested in a statewide race 
while the dlc will talk issues the dnc members will discuss the 
rules for selecting the 1992 presidential nominee no major changes 
are foreseen 
but the dnc remains the partys governing body a fact pointed 
out to from who responded that is true they are at least at 
the moment

in a senate often compared to a club where 
members take care of their own the democratic and republican 
leaders of the ethics committee are ready to sweep aside personal 
emotions and judge the conduct of seven politically troubled 
colleagues 
chairman howell t heflin dala and vice chairman warren b 
rudman rnh said in interviews that they have an institution to 
protect and wont be influenced by close relationships or intense 
media attention 
were dealing with the reputation of individuals and the 
integrity of the institution rudman said you must find the 
truth and you must act on it you cannot be swayed by personal 
emotions the public ought to have full confidence that the members 
of this committee care about the institution more than anything 
else 
added heflin its an unpleasant task but it has to be 
performed because the constitution requires the chambers of 
congress to judge the conduct of their own members the integrity 
of the institution supersedes the clubbiness that might exist 
neither rudman nor heflin would discuss details of the cases 
before them and rudman said he agreed to be interviewed only so 
there could be a better public understanding of the committees 
work 
the most intense attention is focused on the investigation of 
five senators who received some 13 million from businessman 
charles h keating jr and who intervened with regulators on behalf 
of his nowfailed lincoln savings and loan 
the socalled keating five are republican john mccain of 
arizona and democrats dennis deconcini of arizona john glenn of 
ohio donald w riegle jr of michigan and alan cranston of 
california 
the committee also is investigating whether sen alfonse m 
damato rny steered federal housing contracts to friends and 
contributors and whether sen david durerberger rminn evaded 
outside income limits in a book promotion deal improperly charged 
the senate rent for a minneapolis condominium he partially owned 
and received improper reimbursements for trips to the boston area 
made in part to see his marriage counselor 
rudman admitted the senate is certainly a club in which 
members protect each other i suppose in a legislative way 
but he maintained the history of the senate in recent years is 
that when serious ethics matters have been brought before us the 
importance of the institution transcends personal friendship i 
would cite the harrison williams case and the talmadge case 
in october 1979 the senate voted 8115 follow the ethics 
committees advice and denounced thensen herman e talmadge 
dga for reprehensible handling of government funds 
sen harrison a williams jr dnj resigned in 1982 just as 
the senate was about to go along with the ethics committees 
recommendation of expulsion williams had already been convicted in 
the bribery and conspiracy investigation known as abscam 
one of his main accusers in the senate debate was heflin then 
the senior democrat on the committee who gave one of the final 
speeches of the debate urging expulsion 
heflin now says we have to make tough decisions all the time 
we have to say no to senators on vital issues that affect their 
reelection 
members often are assigned to the committee by their 
backgrounds so its no accident that heflin 68 headed the 
alabama ethics commission from 196971 and was chief justice of the 
alabama supreme court from 197177 
rudman 59 was attorney general of new hampshire from 197076 
other committee members are sens david pryor dark terry 
sanford dnc jesse helms rnc and trent lott rmiss 
rudman defended committee rules that place the utmost secrecy on 
the committees investigative and grand jury phases before 
exposing the trial phase to public view 
i would never ever think a preliminary inquiry or an initial 
review the grand jury phase should be publicized stepbystep 
to satisfy the public or news media he said 
if you were to trot out every allegation without having the 
chance to corroborate or carefully draw it out youd have people 
trashed all over the press who might wind up being totally 
innocent

mexico and its foreign creditor banks sign a 
historic debt reduction agreement sunday that will save the country 
17 billion a year in interest and provide a measure of security 
to the banks 
president carlos salinas de gortari has called the renegotiation 
essential to solving mexicos economic problems but warned it alone 
will not guarantee growth 
the result of the negotiation has been rational for the 
creditor banks and satisfactory for mexico salinas said in a 
speech thursday in switzerland 
the first major agreement under us treasury secretary nicholas 
f bradys debt reduction strategy will lop 7 billion off mexicos 
485 billion commercial bank debt save 17 billion a year of the 
9 billion a year the country pays in interest and bring in 15 
billion in new loans over the next three years 
mexicos total foreign debt is 92 billion down from 107 
billion in 1987 according to the government the second highest in 
the developing world after brazils 114 billion 
sundays agreement will be signed by the heads of 15 major banks 
who made up the socalled steering committee that negotiated 
the accord for all the creditor institutions 
the new plan gave 460 participating banks three options to 
reduce mexicos debt burden reduce the principal on their loans to 
the government by 35 percent drop interest to a fixed rate of 625 
percent annually or grant new loans of 25 percent of their 
outstanding mexican debt 
many banks combined options reductions of the principal account 
for 20 billion of the renegotiated debt interest reductions for 
225 billion and new loans for 6 billion 
in exchange banks picking the principal and interest reductions 
receive mexican government bonds for the remaining debt the bonds 
are backed by us treasury zerocoupon bonds and the first 18 
months of interest on them is guaranteed by a 7 billion package of 
multilateral credits and mexican funds 
i believe it helped the banks quite a lot for at least a 
couple of years more they can feel calmer about the quality of the 
mexican debt said manuel sanchez director of the private center 
for analysis and economic research 
but apart from those in the agreement few new foreign 
commercial bank loans are expected and officials and analysts say 
the next step toward economic stability is mexicos 
what we have to do and what we are doing in mexico is to 
create attractive conditions for doing business in mexico 
assistant treasury secretary angel gurria the governments debt 
negotiator said 
salinas government has opened the domestic market to imports 
stepped up the sale of stateowned enterprises to private 
ownership relaxed foreign investment controls and brought down 
inflation with an economic program that controls wages and prices 
if the government continues such steps gurria said money will 
come 
sanchez warned that the progress toward stabilization is 
precarious 
we are on a fine line very thin in which any event can make 
us fall into another crisis he said 
the agreement to reduce the debt payments followed mexicos 
efforts to repay the interest in recent months unlike other major 
latin debtors 
brazil was 44 billion behind in interest payments to private 
foreign creditors in december argentina which has a 64 billion 
debt has about 4 billion in interest overdue

restaurant patrons will no longer have to 
mix their own cocktails under a bill about to become law in utah 
but critics say the liquor law in the mormondominated state will 
be as bewildering as ever 
if they think utahs joked about now this is comical said 
kurt nelson owner of one of the states beer bars which will 
face new restrictions under the law even as things are loosened up 
for restaurants 
until 1988 restaurant diners intent on a cocktail had to order 
a mixer buy a minibottle of liquor at an inhouse package store 
return to the table and mix the drink themselves they could also 
bring in their own liquor bought at a staterun liquor store 
under the timehonored practice of brownbagging 
since 1988 waiters have been permitted to bring minibottles to 
the table but the diner still had to do the mixing only private 
clubs which sell memberships at a minimum of 5 for two weeks 
could serve a mixed drink without a meal 
the bill that sailed through the legislature hungry for tourism 
and economic growth brings utah to the brink of 
liquorbythedrink by allowing licensed restaurants as well as 
private clubs to serve cocktails at the table 
but the drinks will be weaker the bill requires that 
restaurants and clubs use bottle meters that dispense an ounce of 
liquor minibottles held 17 ounces and brownbagging will be 
prohibited in restaurants and in beer bars 
utahs restrictive liquor laws date generally from the end of 
prohibition in 1930s residents may have complained about the laws 
in the past but they adjusted its tourists that the bills 
sponsors were out to accommodate 
with tourism an increasingly important part of the economy and 
the prospect of being selected host of the 1998 winter olympics 
utah had to step into the american mainstream sponsors said 
indeed the legislation permits lounges at salt lake 
international airport to sell drinks to travelers making the 
airport the states only freepour zone 
i do think weve made a giant step forward rep stan 
smedley said friday after the bill gained final clearance in the 
house and senate gov norm bangerter said hell sign the 
legislation when it reaches his desk this week 
the bills drafters were keenly aware of the mormon church ban 
on alcohol the faith counts as members 70 percent of the states 
17 million people and more than 90 percent of its 104 lawmakers 
and the churchs world headquarters are three blocks from the 
capitol 
there was to be no change in the states philosophy of 
control availability to those who do drink and consideration of 
those who dont said sen richard carling chairman of the task 
force that fashioned the bill 
last year calls from church representatives to senators doomed 
a bill that would have allowed passengers in limousines and 
chartered buses to bring alcohol aboard 
this time church officials said they would not oppose the new 
bill virtually guaranteeing passage among its other changes the 
new legislation allows limo and bus passengers to ride and drink 
with some limitations 
but liquor opponents have much to cheer about in the new law 
besides the crackdown on brownbagging which beer bar owners 
say will eliminate their highly profitable sales of mixers the new 
law puts an end to happy hours and retail sales of beer by the 
keg 
the demise of happy hour sounds the death knoll for a lot of 
taverns said greg arata who owns one of the 415 beer bars in 
utah 
perhaps the most hardhit will be rural beer bars unable to 
afford the license and equipment necessary to upgrade their status 
to that of a private club or a restaurant said utah tavern owners 
association lobbyist randy horiuchi 
horiuchi also warned that old habits die hard and bartenders 
will find themselves in the difficult position of trying to keep 
customers from sneaking in liquor 
what laws like this do is force utahns to break the laws he 
said 
that doesnt bother tavern owner nelson whos seen too many 
customers overdo it 
but nelson said visitors will be confused if they can get a 
drink at the airport only to find themselves searching for a club 
or licensed restaurant in salt lake city or nearby ski resorts 
theyll stop at the airport have a drink then get to new york 
or la and say hey i had a drink in utah nelson said 
thats just duping the traveler

fbi agents have grilled a biblequoting 
junk dealer fingerprinted an alleged gun runner and dug up a 
septic tank looking for a typewriter but how close they are to 
solving a series of mail bombings that killed a judge and a lawyer 
no one is saying 
scores of federal agents who set up offices in a vacant bank 
building two weeks ago have made some splashy raids that provided 
grist for rumor mills but it appears no arrests are imminent in 
the december bombings 
the latest action by the fbi a daylong search friday of the 
home and print shop of an enterprise man indicted on gun 
exportation charges left investigators with more than a dozen 
boxes of confiscated documents to examine 
doug marshall an fbi spokesman in mobile said friday the 
investigation here would continue indefinitely 
the most wellknown figure in the investigation salvage store 
owner robert wayne oferrell has been closely scrutinized but not 
charged 
its time for them to bark up another tree he said friday 
brian fleming the print shop operator subjected to the search 
on friday has not been charged either 
fleming and his wife have been fingerprinted but not questioned 
in the case said their attorney john knowles knowles said 
authorities are making a futile attempt to link the bomb cases to 
flemings indictment on a charge of conspiring to export firearms 
reportedly to northern ireland 
fleming pleaded innocent and is free on 5000 bail 
oferrell said that he has made copies of court documents at 
flemings print shop but that he doesnt know fleming well 
killed in the december bomb attacks were judge robert vance of 
the 11th us circuit court of appeals and civil rights attorney 
robert robinson of savannah ga bombs were also mailed to the 11th 
circuit headquarters in atlanta and an naacp chapter in 
jacksonville fla but did not explode 
a muchcoveted clue is the typewriter used to write a letter 
signed americans for a competent federal judicial system 
claiming responsibility for the bombs and threatening more 
violence the fbi has searched pawn shops oferrells store a 
septic tank a lake schools a trash dump and fort rucker for the 
typewriter but apparently has not found it 
federal sources have said the letter received in december by an 
atlanta tv station appeared to have been written on the same 
typewriter as a document oferrell prepared in 1988 in a case 
before the 11th circuit 
vance sat on a panel that ruled against oferrell when oferrell 
sued his former employer gulf life insurance co in an employment 
compensation case in a legal brief he prepared while acting as his 
own attorney oferrell called the judicial system corrupt 
fbi officials are quick to note that the investigation is 
continuing fullscale in other cities notably atlanta 
but it is enterprise a pleasant growthconscious city of about 
20000 that is receiving most of the attention until the agents 
moved in the town was best known for a 10foot monument of a boll 
weevil 
holding court from behind the cash register at his junk shop or 
atop its loading dock oferrell a 46yearold parttime preacher 
dispenses smalltown wisdom and proclaims his innocence several 
times daily 
two people know im innocent he often says me and 
jesus 
visitors have been impressed by oferrells calmness in the wake 
of such scrutiny pressed however he acknowledges the spotlight 
has bothered his family if he is cleared oferrell said last 
week he expects an apology from the government 
they cant pay me for what theyve done to me oferrell 
said they dont have that kind of money 
at times more than 100 agents from the fbi bureau of alcohol 
tobacco and firearms and the postal inspection service have worked 
on the investigation 
federal authorities defend the numbers even though they have 
not produced an arrest 
a hundred agents on a case like this thats not overkill 
justice department spokesman doug tillett said in law 
enforcement you always should err on the side of having more than 
enough troops rather than a shortage

when don had a tough day at the office 
he didnt unwind at the health club or corner bar 
id go to a store and steal said the highly paid engineer 
who sought counseling last year to end his 20year spree of thefts 
it was my release i was good at it and it didnt take much 
time 
but the middleclass look that don credits with helping him 
avoid the suspicions of store detectives is becoming less of an 
armor as retailers and security industry executives try new tactics 
in the war on shoplifting 
don who spoke on condition his name not be used told his story 
friday at a conference of retail and security executives seeking to 
gain an edge 
shoplifting has risen 35 percent since the mid1980s and now 
equals about 2 percent of all us retail sales excluding gas and 
car purchases conference speakers said hightechnology 
surveillance and psychological methods will probably lead the 
battle to reverse the trend 
in the 1960s deerfield beachbased sensormatic electronics 
corp the conference sponsor developed the plastic tags that hang 
on many store garments today recently the company introduced tags 
that sound an alarm if tampered with other projects include a 
surveillance camera that simultaneously monitors the cash register 
and sales clerk 
some stores have tried mixing background music with barely 
audible voices socalled subliminal messages stressing honesty 
and antitheft themes and experts say cameras programmed to 
watch for known shoplifters may someday be used 
it would be programmed to recognize face patterns and analyze 
the customers as they walk in said bob mccrie editor of the new 
yorkbased publication security letter these are the type of 
things that are coming 
don epitomized one of the conferences themes shoplifters range 
from the impoverished to the elite and often steal simply for the 
emotional high 
don figures that before he sought counseling in may he stole 
more than 160000 worth of merchandise much of which he threw 
away with only 47 apprehensions and nine prosecutions he once 
spent 14 days in jail on paid vacation from work 
who would suspect me i had that middleclass look he said 
if you feel comfortable in a store you become a wrecking ball 
and could take anything you wanted 
peter berlin a former department store security chief who runs 
shoplifters anonymous in jericho ny said there is no profile 
of shoplifters ive caught them all nuns policemen attorneys 
it doesnt matter 
an estimated 20 million americans steal from a store at least 
once a year said berlin yet the thief is caught only about one in 
50 times 
theft is also a greater concern among retailers now because 
increased competition and low inflation keep stores from simply 
raising prices to cover losses called inventory shrinkage in 
the retail vernacular 
shoplifting is still mostly committed by women although crack 
addicts of both sexes have turned to stealing to support their 
habits conference participants said 
mccrie said a 1981 study in spokane wash found 59 percent of 
shoplifters were women mostly in their teens or 20s the study 
also concluded divorced separated or widowed women are more likely 
to shoplift 
many people see shoplifting as a substitute for gratification 
of unmet needs said mccrie they could be personal 
psychological revenge any number of things 
only 4 percent of shoplifters are diagnosed as true 
kleptomaniacs with an obsessive desire to steal he said 
berlin said studies indicate between 15 percent and 3 percent 
of all shoppers may attempt to shoplift but he found the rate rose 
to about 6 percent in department store costume jewelry sections 
berlin also said employee theft has become an increasing problem 
because of lower hiring standards and the takeover mania of the 
1980s that reduced job security 
theres a feeling that i better take care of myself because 
nobody else will and they are not wrong he said

president mikhail s gorbachev will ask the 
communist party leadership to break its sevendecade hammerlock on 
power and accept the possibility of competing political parties a 
soviet news agency said saturday 
the report also said the soviet leader would propose a complete 
change in the party structure and tacitly endorse the concept of 
private ownership 
the stunning disclosures came just two days before a party 
central committee meeting that is expected to be a forum on the 
future course of the nation and probably the most crucial test of 
gorbachevs five years in power 
if gorbachev does indeed ask the party to break its monopoly on 
power and the increasingly splintered party leadership agrees it 
could thrust the superpower into a cycle of change that already is 
being played out on a smaller scale throughout the east bloc 
a bitter fight over reform in expected at the closeddoor 
central committee meeting on monday and tuesday progressives are 
calling for a multiparty system and a virtual apology for decades 
of dictatorship 
diehard communists want to retain their lock on power and keep 
central planning and collective farming which have brought the 
country to economic ruin 
this is likely the last central committee meeting before local 
and republic elections in the coming weeks where hardliners could 
suffer humiliating defeats as did many of their colleagues last 
spring when the nation held its first competitive elections 
the soviet news agency interfax says gorbachev wants to trim the 
central committee from 251 members to 200 which could jeopardize 
the votes of many hardliners in the key policymaking body 
gorbachev as usual has placed himself squarely in the middle 
according to the interfax report 
he is proposing a new communist party platform where the 
multiparty principle is not rejected but is not treated as a 
panacea reported interfax a news service of radio moscow 
the platform says the party will fight for its leading role 
but assume no state or government powers nor lay any claim to 
having its role set down in the constitution interfax said 
an attempt to remove the communists guarantee of supremacy 
inscribed in the soviet constitution failed during the december 
session of parliament 
the soviet union ruled exclusively by the communists since a 
few months after the 1917 russian revolution is the last remaining 
warsaw pact nation to give the communists a guaranteed monopoly on 
power 
gorbachevs nurturing of greater social freedoms sparked the 
changes in the east bloc but the pace of reform in those nations 
have quickly outraced change in the soviet union overhauling the 
ideological landscape of eastern europe 
interfax also said gorbachevs platform does not reject the 
concept of private ownership but did not say if that includes 
ownership of land and businesses by individuals 
the central committee is expected to vote on the platform for 
presentation to a full party congress of about 5000 delegates 
scheduled for october tass said saturday some party members have 
suggested holding the party congress earlier in two parts with 
local party elections between the two sessions 
the fight in the soviet communist party comes at a time of 
stunningly rapid change since the central committee last met six 
weeks ago 
the communist split has come into the open with reformers 
threatening to form their own party if changes are not made 
the soviet union itself tumbled closer to fracturing with open 
rebellion in azerbaijan and peaceful independence movements in the 
baltics particularly in lithuania where gorbachev promised the 
people a choice on secession 
in four countries of eastern europe the price paid by 
communist hardliners has risen men who fell from power in the 
autumn are now being arrested only in poland and hungary where 
reform has come most gradually are former dictators still free 
the soviet press too has been full of portents of political 
change a letter to the editor of pravda suggested the communist 
idea is dead while moscow news reported suggestions the party be 
disbanded 
economic deprivation only worsens with each passing day as more 
daily necessities disappear from store shelves 
it has become increasingly difficult to prove that an american 
worker with 2000 a month in wages is suffering from exploitation 
while his soviet counterpart enjoys its absence with an income of 
237 rubles 395 a month said pravda this week 
gorbachev heads into mondays showdown strengthened by the 
worlds horrified reaction to a broadcast report that he might 
resign as party chief and by a series of disgraces suffered 
recently by hardliners 
gorbachev denied the report of his possible resignation after 
letting the world stew for 12 hours 
izvestia ran a frontpage article friday noting the report had 
already had its effect in washington where a cut in american 
military troops in europe had just been proposed 
progressives and even ordinary citizens sick of shortages 
worried that the alternative to gorbachev would be far worse 
the interfax report also says gorbachev is proposing a new party 
structure with an elected chairman and two deputy chairmen 
however tass on saturday said individual party members have 
suggested that delegates to the party congress which would 
formally adopt the new platform should be chosen in direct 
elections from the district level 
the interfax report also says the gorbachev platform calls for a 
new executive committee that would include representatives of the 
15 republics it was not clear if this would replace the current 
politburo 
the partys rules of unity and secrecy already being broken 
could be eased under the various proposals the gorbachev plan 
would permit minority viewpoints but not formal factions inside the 
party interfax said 
in a strong hint of impending demotions tass said saturday the 
many rankandfile communists blame the central committee for the 
slow pace of reform

with a single stunning speech 
president fw de klerk has set south africa on the road to a new 
future after decades of racial confrontation and white domination 
de klerk repudiated the white supremacist principles that guided 
his ruling national party for decades and cleared the way for 
blacks including communists and guerrilla leaders to take part 
in political life 
the aim is a totally new and just constitutional dispensation 
in which every inhabitant will enjoy equal rights treatment and 
opportunity in every sphere he told the nation at the opening of 
parliament on friday 
in a speech that would have been unthinkable one or two years 
ago the president ended bans on the african national congress and 
other antiapartheid groups that have waged a 30year guerrilla 
struggle against white minority rule repealed many repressive 
regulations and promised to end the state of emergency used to 
stifle dissent 
the speech was a remarkable change for a party that created 
apartheid to permanently exclude blacks from power hf verwoerd 
a former prime minister and the architect of apartheid set the 
tone for nationalist rule when he said in 1961 when i talk of 
the nation of south africa i talk to the white people of south 
africa 
de klerk warned that the quest for a peaceful solution would not 
be easy and the country would face many challenges he appealed to 
all south africans to work with him 
government leaders and their opponents agree that nobody knows 
just how to solve the countrys problems 
in a front page editorial saturday hailing de klerks reforms 
the cape times newspaper said we have now entered a more 
dangerous phase of the inevitable process of change where the 
situation is going to be much more volatile 
de klerk deliberately avoided many major questions facing south 
africa including the extent to which the government is willing to 
share power with blacks and the pace at which it will make reforms 
in the past de klerk has said he opposes black majority rule 
the main goal of all antiapartheid groups which say they will not 
accept anything but full democracy with no special status for any 
ethnic group 
apartheid sets up a racially segregated society in which south 
africas 28 million blacks have no vote in national affairs the 5 
million whites control the economy and maintain separate housing 
schools and health services 
major pillars of apartheid such as laws segregating residential 
areas and public amenities remain in force power and wealth are 
overwhelmingly concentrated in the hands of whites 
government ministers declined to say when apartheid laws would 
be abolished saying such changes would have to be negotiated but 
de klerk promised that the separate amenities act which allows 
local governments to segregate public facilities would be repealed 
during the current session of parliament 
while most antiapartheid leaders hailed de klerks initiative 
they warned that the government had not gone far enough 
exiled anc leaders welcomed the reforms but said there could be 
no instant peace 
an armistice can only take place once a democratic government 
is in place said an anc spokesman 
denis worrall leader of the white liberal democratic party 
said the search for a political solution could resemble the 
tortured quest for peace in northern ireland and the middle east 
the government is not in danger of collapsing and de klerk is 
offering to negotiate from a powerful position the government is 
in full control of the country black resistance is minimal and 
the anc has admitted its guerrilla campaign has been largely 
ineffectual 
the biggest obstacle facing de klerk and his allies may be white 
opposition 
de klerk as leader of the white afrikaners of dutch descent who 
dominate south african politics must maintain substantial white 
support as he attempts to work out a solution government leaders 
have expressed concern about a terroist campaign by white 
extremists 
andries treurnicht leader of the proapartheid conservative 
party reacted with fury to de klerks plans and demanded an 
immediate general election we say he has no mandate for doing 
the drastic things he intends doing the leader of the main white 
opposition party said 
de klerk will have to persuade whites to accept change 
overcoming centuries of ingrained conviction of white superiority 
and privilege most political observers say the president does not 
have much time to change the hearts and minds of whites if he is to 
maintain his momentum 
there is little sign that most whites are ready to share 
schools hospitals and other amenities with blacks or to accept a 
division of wealth and opportunity with the masses of poor blacks 
many whites reacted to de klerks speech with caution and 
concern some whites expressed fears about their future and safety 
in a black majority state 
whites are feeling a bit insecure there is reservation in the 
hearts of whites said one white businessman after hearing de 
klerks speech 
de klerk has gained respect and time from many south africans 
who hope he will now lead them to the peaceful solution he has 
promised the question he acknowledges is whether that time and 
support will be adequate to forge a solution acceptable to the 
majority

five ethnic albanian groups on 
saturday asked the government to investigate reports that police 
fired without warning on protesters in kosovo province where 
unrest has killed 25 people and injured 120 
about 300 ethnic albanians chanting democracy democracy 
rallied saturday in the town of podujevo and a smaller group was 
dispersed by riot police in the provincial capital of pristina 20 
miles to the south 
a government statement however said there were visible 
signs that the situation was calming down in kosovo thousands of 
police backed by tanks and planes maintained patrols in the 
southern province 
the ethnic albanian majority in kosovo has demanded increased 
autonomy from the largest of yugoslavias six republics serbia 
which said it tightened control over the province last year to 
protect the serbian minority from harassment 
more than 100000 kosovo residents have signed a petition 
calling for an end to the yearold state of emergency and for 
democratic elections said veton surroi head of the regional 
chapter of the yugoslav union for democratic initiative the 
petition also called for an end to the violence 
in an englishlanguage statement the five ethnic albanian 
groups said they supported the governments attempt to resolve the 
unrest and asked for talks 
a statement urged the government to investigate reports that 
police fired without cause or warning several times in the past 
week killing people in several villages 
it said authorities used classic forms of state terrorism to 
put down ethnic albanian calls for greater autonomy from serbia 
it demanded an immediate ban on the use of lethal firearms by 
police establishing a commission to investigate all alleged 
murders as a way to defuse the explosive situation that threatens 
to turn into a bloody civil war 
on friday president janez drnovsek appealed to ethnic albanians 
and serbs in the province to stop the violence which he said 
threatened the process of economic and political reform nationwide 
the government has pledged to allow a multiparty democracy and 
observe human rights according to internationally recognized 
standards 
drnovsek has said that the use of arms is in no groups interest 
and has repeatedly called for a dialogue 
but officials of serbia who accuse the ethnic albanians of 
wanting to secede from yugoslavia and join neighboring albania 
have demanded that opposition leaders first renounce any such 
intention before talks can begin 
yugoslavias liberal northern regions of slovenia and croatia 
have backed ethnic albanian calls for greater selfgovernment and 
blamed the unrest on serbian moves backed by nationalist serbian 
leader sloboban milosevic to reduce the provinces autonomy 
on saturday the official tanjug news agency said 25 ethnic 
albanians have died over the past 11 days of protests it did not 
report any new deaths overnight however and there was no 
explanation for the increase in the official death toll from 21 on 
thursday 
in addition 75 demonstrators and 45 riot policemen were injured 
in the clashes the agency said citing official sources 
the groups that made the statement were the kosovo branch of the 
yugoslav union for democratic initiative the committee for human 
rights and freedoms the democratic league of kosova the society 
of philosophers and sociologists of kosova and the initiating 
board for the youth parliament kosova is the name albanians use to 
refer to the province

a judge has ruled that boeing co took reasonable 
steps to accommodate a software engineer who was preparing for a 
sexchange operation before it fired him for wearing a necklace and 
using the womens bathroom 
superior court judge fred rasmussen affirmed friday that state 
law banning discrimination against the handicapped applied to the 
former employees psychosexual condition known as gender 
dysphoria or transsexualism 
but the judge found no discrimination by boeing against the 
plaintiff who is now a woman 
the american civil liberties union represented the 34yearold 
woman known to the court as jane doe who was employed by boeing 
computer services as a male from 1978 to 1985 the former employee 
underwent a sex change operation in 1988 
the lawsuit the first of its kind in the state accused the 
company of discriminating against doe because of her physical and 
mental handicap and of refusing to provide any reasonable 
accommodation for her disability 
doe was fired in 1985 for wearing a strand of pink imitation 
pearls does former boeing computer services supervisor testified 
during the trial that the jewelry made does attire unacceptable 
and disruptive to coworkers 
further testimony showed that doe had been warned not to wear 
the pearls but had been allowed to wear a bra stockings earrings 
and makeup 
doe admitted in testimony that she violated the dress code and 
womens restroom restriction but did it to push the company 
she said boeing had no right to set any dress code or bar her from 
the ladies bathroom 
she said her doctor and therapist had told her she needed to 
live and act as a woman full time before undergoing sexchange 
surgery 
however the judge ruled that boeing had the right to require 
doe to wear sexneutral clothing he also pointed out that doe 
intentionally violated the company dress code and prohibition 
against using the womens restroom 
the judge also pointed out that the employees doctor and 
therapist also told her that compromise was needed and that she 
didnt have to violate the dress code 
boeing spokesman paul binder said during the trial that boeing 
believed the claim did not represent a handicap under the classic 
definition and that the company tried to accommodate the employee 
prior to sexchange surgery

two downtown churches still ask god to watch over 
them but parishioners feel better that there are armed guards on 
hand too 
burglaries assaults and car vandalism have driven the churches 
to hire offduty police officers or sheriffs deputies to watch 
churchgoers and their cars on weekends 
there has been a generalized sigh of relief said the rev 
jim barnes pastor at trinity united methodist church which began 
using officers in november after suffering breakins and the theft 
of cars from a parking lot nearby 
people dont want to come downtown if they think their cars 
are going to be stolen so we decided to bite the bullet pardon 
the phrase and do it 
most downtown pastors have stories to tell of assaults threats 
and vandalism and the occasional mentally disturbed or drunken 
person who interrupts services 
the rev cb woodrich pastor of holy ghost roman catholic 
church which has employed guards for years calls it just part 
of doing business downtown it was getting to the point that 
everyone was being scared away 
armed guards at holy ghost sometimes walk women and older people 
to their cars the church spends roughly 150 a weekend on the 
guards woodrich said 
other churches are using guards but not armed ones 
st johns episcopal church hires two unarmed security guards to 
patrol parking lots on sundays there is just some crazy thing 
with me i dont want weapons on the church grounds said dean 
donald mcphail 
jim burris business manager for the basilica of the immaculate 
conception said the church took its cue from holy ghost when it 
began hiring sheriffs deputies in december the officers are 
uniformed but are not armed 
it kind of adds to the peace of mind of people coming to 
church he said

chancellor helmut kohl of west germany 
flatly rejected on saturday a soviet proposal that americans 
canadians and europeans vote on whether a united germany should be 
allowed 
kohl spoke with reporters after a onehour meeting with 
communist premier hans modrow of east germany that focused on the 
economic crisis caused by the exodus of east germans to the west 
the main topic was that both of us stressed once again the 
exceptional seriousness of the situation as the number of migrants 
remains high about 55000 in january kohl told reporters 
modrow said they discussed intragerman relations ahead of his 
feb 1314 visit to bonn 
neither official disclosed details of the talks held in this 
resort where both were attending an international business forum 
kohl said signs of economic collapse had increased in east 
germany it must be our common concern to stop this process he 
said 
the chancellor said the talks did not touch on modrows 
fourpoint plan for a united but militarily neutral germany 
unveiled thursday bonn had immediately rejected the neutrality 
idea 
kohl was asked about soviet foreign eduard shevardnadzes 
proposal that europeans americans and canadians vote to decide 
whether east and west germany should merge because they had 
suffered so much in world war ii 
i dont support that because this is a truly german issue 
kohl replied europeans would back german unity in any case he 
added 
shevardnadze made the suggestion in an interview with soviet 
reporters published friday at the same time he gave the kremlins 
strongest endorsement yet to german unification while repeating 
conditions that this must not destabilize europe or occur too 
quickly 
at the annual davos business forum west germanys economics 
minister helmut haussmann counseled caution in proceeding with 
economic and monetary ties between the two germanys 
he said talks about the relation between the two countries 
currencies will have to wait until after the east german elections 
scheduled for march 18 
haussmann was responding to comments at the conference by 
dresden mayor wolfgang berghofer a popular reformer who quit east 
germanys communist party last month on friday berghofer 
described the situation in east germany in dire terms 
an average of 2000 east germans are fleeing their country daily 
for their more affluent neighbor the exodus is draining east 
germany of skilled workers and straining west german social 
services 
berghofer said complete collapse is imminent unless workers are 
given a convertible currency this year and the steady flood of 
people leaving the country is stopped 
west german finance minister theo waigel on friday suggested 
circulating his countrys currency in east germany to prop up the 
failing economy 
modrow and kohl have proposed a common currency as one of the 
steps toward unification 
in a speech earlier saturday kohl sought to defuse soviet 
worries about the revival of a strong germany at the heart of 
europe he reiterated his stand that a united germany should be 
achieved within security structures in europe spanning both 
alliances at lower levels of armament 
he said the western alliance while it must adapt to changes in 
the warsaw pact remains indispensable and includes a 
substantial security role for the united states on our 
continent 
kohl called for increased western investment in the reforming 
economies of eastern europe provided they guarantee freemarket 
principles by law 
he said an overwhelming majority of germans want unity 
west germany will respect the decision of east germans in any 
referendum on unification he said but i have no doubt what it 
will be

longsilenced activists began 
speaking out and thousands of blacks marched in celebration 
saturday after president fw de klerk scrapped stifling 
restrictions on antiapartheid groups 
a newspaper report meanwhile said jailed african national 
congress leader nelson mandela could be freed within a week 
but de klerks decision to legalize the african national 
congress and lift a host of other restrictions brought an 
outpouring of activism elsewhere 
large crowds marched in the streets of port elizabeth the 
northern cape province desert town of graafreinet and alexandra 
a small township next to johannesburg about 7000 people protested 
the appearance of a visiting english cricket team in 
pietermaritzburg the natal provincial capital 
the african national congress meanwhile said its guerrilla 
attacks would not be suspended but would have a lower profile 
i think one can expect in the context of the legalization of 
the anc that probably other aspects of our multipronged strategy 
will receive a much higher profile than in the past said pallo 
jordan the ancs information chief at its exile headquarters in 
lusaka zambia 
jordan was one of several anc leaders who could not be quoted in 
south africa until saturday when notices were published in the 
government gazette formalizing the stunning concessions announced 
by de klerk on friday 
the government repealed laws that banned 175 people including 
anc president oliver tambo now recovering from a stroke in sweden 
the ancs chief spokesman tom sebina and the leader of the south 
african communist party joe slovo 
it removed stateofemergency prohibitions on travel and public 
speaking on another 200 people 
among those reveling in their new freedoms was 84yearold helen 
joseph the first white person ever placed under house arrest for 
antigovernment activity 
she had been officially banned restricted to the 
johannesburg area placed under curfew in her home and prohibited 
from meeting with more than a few people at a time or making public 
appearances for the first time in 30 years south african 
newspapers published her comments saturday 
this is a wonderful day i am very excited about my personal 
freedom since i am no longer a listed person said the 
wheelchairbound activist an old friend of mandelas 
above all i am excited about the return of all my friends and 
comrades and all the exiles who will be coming back home all my 
comrades who will be released from jail she was quoted as saying 
de klerk in his speech to parliament also said that mandela 
would be freed soon 
the citizen a progovernment newspaper quoted an unidentified 
government source as saying de klerk moves very fast and could 
free the 71yearold mandela any day 
if there is no sudden outbreak of violence and people react in 
an orderly fashion mr mandela could be free by next weekend 
the source was quoted as saying 
de klerks announcements met most of the conditions laid down by 
the anc to begin negotiations on a new constitution to bring the 
black majority into the nations political life 
however many activists said the government must completely end 
the state of emergency free all prisoners convicted of crimes 
related to political action and repeal laws that still would allow 
the arrest of returning exiles 
senior leaders of the anc most of them banned until this 
weekend gathered for an executive meeting saturday in stockholm 
sweden 
the anc will discuss new strategies because of the new 
situation which has arisen said david kgabang an anc official 
in the stockholm office 
de klerk announced a moratorium on executions and ended most 
emergency restrictions on the press while allowing police to 
retain control over photography and filming of political unrest and 
police actions 
zwelakhe sisulu who had been prevented for two years from 
editing his newspaper new nation was free to work and speak his 
paper carried frontpage color illustrations of the anc and 
communist party flags in a special issue saturday 
reaction to de klerks concessions in most black townships was 
subdued with no celebrations in the largest black city soweto 
home to 25 million people 
but almost half the population of the small desert town of 
graafreinet walked under anc banners from outlying mixedrace and 
black townships to the town center saturday 
mayor joan thornton accepted letters of complaint from leaders 
of the 15000 marchers about lack of electricity and sewage 
systems and a shortage of housing and water taps she handed the 
leaders a white rose as a symbol of peace in this town 560 
miles north of cape town 
the rev allan boesak mixedrace president of the world 
alliance of reformed churches said the mayors action was an 
enormous recognition of the movement and the respect with which 
they must behold the movement now that we can bring so many 
thousands of people peacefully into a town like this 
about 8000 people including many elders and children crammed 
into a stadium in alexandra a township of more than 100000 people 
near johannesburg and chanted viva anc while swaying to the 
rhythm of liberation songs 
the alexandra rally originally had been scheduled to protest 
living conditions in the squalid township and the crowd doubled as 
the protesters marched to the local council office and police 
station 
in port elizabeth townships in the eastern cape province 
several thousand people danced in the streets and blacks in pubs 
praised de klerk as bold and brave said a report from the 
south african press association about 150 blacks marched and sang 
briefly in downtown johannesburg 
the focus of the 7000 people gathered in pietermaritzburg was 
the cricket tour which violates an international sports boycott 
against south africa 
english captain mike gatting and ali bacher general manager of 
the south african cricket union walked through a 100yard gantlet

the eighthgrade history class at stephen 
decatur middle school had taken on the competitive feel of a 
television game show 
name the king of england who wanted to move away from the 
catholic church and wanted to establish his own church 
challenged teacher georgia runfola 
i know i know yelled a student swiftly flipping through a 
textbook henry the eighth 
good job responded special education teacher brenda morris 
runfola and morris are team teachers participants in a program 
in this prince georges county school designated to further the 
mainstreaming of students with mild learning disabilities into 
regular classroom environments 
only the teachers know which students have learning disabilities 
you dont make a distinction in the classroom said dawn 
deturris another team teacher teachers put the roll in 
alphabetical order and then they soon forget hopefully they try 
to meet the needs of all students as they come up whether they 
have a handicapping condition or not 
the program at stephen decatur is one of many efforts nationwide 
to help children with special educational needs a group that is 
drawing increased attention just a few miles away in the nations 
capital 
the supreme court recently let stand a ruling that all 
handicapped children even those lacking any learning ability are 
entitled to education paid for by the public schools 
president bush who pledged during the campaign to be the 
education president has promised to educate all of americas 
children 
david chavkin of the national center for clinical infant 
programs said about 41 million children classified as mentally or 
physically handicapped are being educated in federally assisted 
education programs these include more than 15 million children 
with specific learning disabilities more than 1 million with 
speech impairments nearly 1 million mentally retarded more than 
300000 with serious emotional disturbances and more than 300000 
with orthopedic impairments with vision or hearing impairments 
and with other health impairments or with multiple disabilities 
for the current 1990 fiscal year the education departments 
budget for special education and rehabilitative services programs 
is about 4 billion education for handicapped children cost the 
nations schools 16 billion last year 
an example of how that budget leaches down to the local level is 
in prince georges county the head of the program robert coombs 
describes it as highly respected and wellknown 
in prince georges 1200 teachers instructional aides 
therapists and middle managers handle about 11000 special 
education students the countys budget for the current school year 
is 53 million with only about 3 million from the federal 
government 
coombs said the program allows special education to move away 
from a mini oneroom schoolhouse environment 
the nice part about this is if you are a multilevel student 
who just cant make it in math but do pretty well in everything 
else we can pull that student for intensive work in math only 
and keep him mainstreamed for all the other subjects said coombs 
although the students anonymity is broken that way coombs and 
others said the benefits of the special work are great 
about 135 of the 800 students at stephen decatur are special 
education students most of them coming from six different areas of 
the county the middle school is one of three in the county with an 
entire wing of the building for special education students mildly 
handicapped students can receive either periodic monitoring with no 
direct service or up to at least 20 hours of special education 
service depending on need 
students pulled out from the regular class receive separate 
instructions in intensive resource classes that have 
studentteacher ratios as low as 7to1 the average class size is 
about a dozen students 
combs explained one of the things you run into in secondary 
schools that enroll mildly handicapped kids is they get very 
resistant to being labeled as different than all the other 
students 
they dont like that and they dont like to be pulled out and 
have to go down the hall for separate classes that focus on their 
special needs 
students with severe learning disabilities are taught in 
socalled selfcontained units and do not attend classes with 
regular students said coombs 
special education students get individualized instruction when 
necessary said dawn thigpen who oversees special education 
programs at several of the countys middle school the teams work 
very hard with parents to make sure the student is placed in the 
least restrictive environment 
ms thigpen said that team teaching is a favorite and teachers 
have developed a variety of strategies 
for example the teachers try to divide up the course work 
according to the strengths and weaknesses or likes and dislikes 
with each taking turns to lead class work during a period in other 
teams one teacher will take over the classroom on one day and the 
other teacher the next day 
what is neat is that you can meet the needs of regular 
education students as well as the needs of students who have 
handicapping conditions said joan harris an english and reading 
team teacher 
teacher kathy doyle added with two people you can do a lot 
of proactive behavior management where you defuse a behavior 
problem before it starts you can have one teacher take a child 
out of the classroom before he affects the others 
one drawback to the approach volunteered one eighth grader 
comes when the teachers both talk at once i get confused

foreign aid once a backwater issue that 
stirred relatively little interest on capitol hill has become a 
hot topic with lawmakers asking the bush administration wheres 
the dough 
pressing domestic needs changes in eastern europe the invasion 
of panama and a controversial proposal by sen bob dole rkan to 
slash funds to israel and egypt are spotlighting foreign aid in 
1990 
noting the general unpopularity of foreign aid senate budget 
committee chairman jim sasser dtenn said theres going to be 
some rough sledding 
a recent wall street journalnbc news poll showed 71 percent of 
americans believe the united states spends too much on foreign aid 
they supported aid but were virtually split on helping poland and 
opposed aid to east germany and the soviet union 
many lawmakers including sen bob kasten rwis a member of 
the senate committee that divvies up foreign aid and rep david 
obey dwis chairman of the house foreign operations 
appropriations subcommittee view cuts in defense the socalled 
peace dividend as the future cash cow for foreign aid 
we can easily cut another 10 billion to 18 billion from 
defense spending without jeopardizing security says sen joseph 
biden ddel a member of the senate foreign relations committee 
theres a lot more to be done within the defense department 
biden is one of a handful of democratic senators who introduced 
a bill last week to channel 500 million to eastern europe 
rep sam gejdenson dconn said the defense budget should be 
cut in favor of foreign aid there are times to buy bullets and 
times for other things he said 
lawmakers said theyve been told funds will be taken from 
defense programs and from other accounts 
but sen patrick leahy dvt chairman of the senate 
subcommittee that handles foreign aid says he wants to see the 
money first 
i told one administration official dont travel around the 
world saying the checks in the mail when i have the checkbook 
in my pocket 
im not going to move a bill that makes great promises without 
the money leahy said 
while the bush administration last week asked for 148 billion 
in foreign aid for fiscal 1991 about 1 billion over the previous 
year congress still has unfinished business for fiscal year 1990 
which began last october 
secretary of state james a baker iii has informed lawmakers the 
administration is planning to ask congress for two supplemental 
foreign aid packages for 1990 but he hasnt told them where he 
wants to cut money so the budget will balance 
the packages are 500 million for panama to help the country the 
united states invaded on dec 20 and 70 million for refugees 
the state departments refugee budget has been strained by the 
soviet unions liberalized emigration policies that have allowed 
more people particularly jews to leave the administration wants 
to admit 27000 more refugees this year 
sen paul simon dill says 30 million is to be siphoned off 
from sudan and somalia but simon chairman of a senate africa 
subcommittee says hes opposed to eliminating money for africa 
leonard h robinson jr chairman of the african development 
bank complained in an oped piece in the washington post that 
africa the worlds poorest continent has been given shortshrift 
where did the 900 million come from he asked about the 
money congress provided for poland and hungary late last year 
why did it take only days to secure as an africanist i want to 
know so do the people of africa 
others are sure to come forward with complaints about congress 
habit of earmarking setting aside money for specific 
countries the administration opposes such earmarks saying they 
eliminate flexibility 
five countries israel egypt turkey the philippines and 
pakistan receive more than twothirds of the total aid israel 
and egypt get the lions share with israel leading at 3 billion 
egypt is slated to get 22 billion 
doles proposal to eliminate as well as reduce money for 
israel has gained little public support from his colleagues but 
it has raised the sensitive issue for debate this year dole wants 
more money sent to eastern europe 
aid to israel is always delicate because of its ramifications 
with the american jewish community 
i dont support senator doles proposal although i think he 
has performed a service by calling attention to the need for 
reconsideration of the allocation of our resources for foreign 
aid said senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine 
sen john kerry dmass said the dole plan was a bad idea 
a group of house members led by rep vin weber rminn said aid 
to the middle eastern nations is an investment not a gift 
sen william armstrong rcolo predicted the dole plan will 
come to the forefront in two to six months but its not 
something the administration wants to take the heat over right 
now 
another contentious topic is el salvador where some members of 
congress have suggested tying us aid to countrys human rights 
record the administration has reduced economic aid to el salvador 
to 130 million in 1990 but proposes to increase that in 1991 
one senator with little interest in foreign aid in jesse helms 
rnc the ranking republican on the senate foreign relations 
committee 
i aint got no dog in that fight helms said of the dole 
proposal helms said he has opposed all foreign aid 
what are we doing giving away money when we have such a debt 
problem at home he said

the african national congress held its 
first meeting as a legal entity saturday and a spokesman said the 
group will not abandon its guerrilla campaign despite concessions 
made by the south african goverment 
anc leaders flew in from their headquarters in lusaka zambia 
to join veteran members recently released from south african 
prisons who were in sweden to visit ailing anc president oliver 
tambo 
on friday the anc issued a statement from stockholm cautiously 
welcoming the dramatic policy changes announced friday by south 
african president fw de klerk in cape town but said they did not 
go far enough 
in lusaka anc spokesman pallo jordan said the organization will 
not abandon the military campaign but conceded it will take a 
lower profile 
we have always said that the notion of the anc unilaterally 
abandoning armed struggle is out of the question jordan told 
reporters 
any ceasing of hostilities will have to be negotiated and will 
arise out of a mutually binding ceasefire he said 
de klerk partly rescinded the state of emergency imposed in 1986 
to quell disturbances he announced the legalization of the anc and 
about 60 other opposition groups and lifted the ban on hundreds of 
antiapartheid activists including tambo 
de klerk also promised to unconditionally free anc leader nelson 
mandela but gave no date the 71yearold mandela imprisoned 
since 1962 is serving a life sentence for helping plan the start 
of the ancs sabotage and bombing campaign against the whiteled 
government 
anc secretarygeneral alfred nzo and joe slovo head of the 
south african communist party flew to stockholm late friday to 
join walter sisulu and other anc veterans touring scandinavia on 
their first visit outside africa since being freed in october 
the meeting was an anc executive committee session to discuss 
new strategies because of the new situation which has arisen 
said david kgabang an official of the ancs stockholm office 
kgabang gave no indication of how the strategy might change 
jordan described the guerrilla campaign as part of the ancs 
multipronged strategy to end apartheid 
at particular times that aspect armed struggle has received 
a higher profile than others i think one can expect in the 
context of the legalization of the anc that probably other apsects 
of our multipronged strategy will receive a much higher profile 
than in the past he said 
kgabang said he expected the anc to reopen its offices in 
johannesburg and elsewhere in south africa the group operated 
openly for 48 years until it was outlawed in 1960 and began its 
sabotage campaign in 1961 
the arrival of nzo and slovo brought together in sweden most of 
the ancs top decision makers nzo is the groups acting president 
in place of tambo who is recuperating from a stroke in a stockholm 
clinic slovo is a former head of the ancs armed wing 
they joined thabo mbeki who is in charge of the ancs foreign 
relations sisulu and five other recently freed leaders from the 
mandela era 
this is an opportunity to discuss developments with the 
leadership which has been in the cold for so many years kgabang 
said 
meetings were expected to last until monday when sisulu and the 
other released veterans planned to return to south africa while the 
rest head back to the ancs headquarters in lusaka 
in its statement friday the anc tempered its welcome of de 
klerks speech with concern that some emergency restrictions 
remained in place including the power to detain without trial it 
called for the continued international isolation of south africa 
until apartheid is dismantled

prime minister toshiki kaifu is telling voters that 
in two weeks japan will face a crucial choice between democracy and 
socialism 
but as official campaigning for parliamentary elections began 
saturday voters didnt seem to share his concern 
i need your support he told an unenthusiastic crowd of 
several hundred people who gathered in front of a busy tokyo train 
station 
most of his audience appeared to be party supporters invited to 
the rally passersby lingered only until traffic lights 
changednearby more than 1000 people gathered to hear the leader 
of the main opposition socialist party 
the embattled prime minister one of 953 candidates vying for 
the 512 seats in parliaments powerful lower house has said he 
will resign if his liberal democratic party cannot retain a 
majority 
and for the first time in 34 years of unbroken rule the liberal 
democrats are facing the possibility that even that goal may prove 
to be too much 
kaifu said the feb 18 election will be critical and warned 
that voters will be deciding whether they want freedom and 
democracy or socialism and communism 
the world has already rendered its verdict on socialism he 
said referring to the ouster of hardline communist rulers in 
eastern europe 
at the socialist rally party leader takako doi said her party 
planned to defeat the liberal democrats 
before the last election i said the mountain would move 
said the 61yearold ms doi alluding to the liberal democrats 
loss of their majority in the upper house of parliament in july 
we will move the second mountain ms doi said the governing 
party lost in july because of its support for a 3 percent sales tax 
and because of its leaders involvement in financial and sex 
scandals 
its been seven months and they havent changed a bit she 
said the only road left is for each of you to change politics 
with your votes 
ms doi the only woman leader of a major party is widely 
credited with increasing the socialists popularity 
setsuko isobe 60 said she also was drawn to the rally by ms 
doi women in japan have been looked down on in the past but ms 
doi shows that some of us can be very powerful 
two of four candidates with ms doi at the rally were women no 
women are running for the liberal democrats 
going into the election the socialists held 83 seats in the 
lower house against 295 for the liberal democrats 
the clean government party held 54 seats the communists 26 the 
democratic socialists 25 twentynine seats were either vacant or 
held by independents and minor party members 
the socialists are only backing 148 candidates and would need 
to form a coalition with other opposition parties to wrest the 
majority away from the liberal democrats who are backing 325 
candidates 
kaifu assumed office in august after sousuke uno resigned to 
take responsibility for the election defeat in july and amid 
reports that he had an extramarital affair with a geisha 
unos predecessor noboru takeshita stepped down in june 
because of his ties to an influencepeddling scandal several other 
liberal democratic leaders resigned in the scandal in which the 
information conglomerate recruit co was accused of paying millions 
of dollars in exchange for political influence

a christian militia drove back rival 
forces loyal to gen michel aoun on saturday and seized control of 
a vital beirut port after some of his troops abandoned five days of 
fighting and began defecting 
gunboats tanks and cannons fell silent in response to a 
vaticanbrokered ceasefire but the shelling resumed after three 
hours more than 37 people were killed saturday and hundreds of 
thousands were trapped in shelters 
police said that overall 164 people have been killed and 618 
wounded in the clashes for control of lebanons christian enclave 
between aouns 20000 soldiers and the 6000strong lebanese forces 
militia the lebanese forces led by samir geagea is the main 
christian militia 
the lebanese forces emerged from the fighting in control of 60 
percent of the christian enclave with aouns troops entrenched 
only in the eastern and northern edges of east beirut as well as 
the mountainous metn province northeast of the capital 
at the start of the fighting on tuesday each side controlled 
half of the christian enclave 
civilians said the fighting in dense residential areas had 
caused some of the worst damage in 15 years of civil war 
we never had a war like this said robin haik 24 who fled 
to cyprus aboard a ferry during a lull in the fighting the 
lebanese forces put all kinds of artillery between every house to 
try to get the army and the army tried to hit them with all kinds 
of shells 
the fiveday battle has kept half a million people or half of 
the enclaves population hiding in poorly equipped basements and 
bomb shelters with no electricity or water 
the brief ceasefire was reached after police said 1000 members 
of aouns forces stationed at beiruts port and along half of 
beiruts threemile dividing green line defected six hundred 
joined geageas militia and 400 went to the lebanese army 
that stripped aoun of the beirut port and his only docks the 
loss could disrupt his supplies but both sides are believed to 
have several months worth of ammunition stockpiled 
aouns failure to achieve a swift clearcut victory over 
geageas outnumbered and outgunned men has damaged his image of 
invincibility 
although aouns troops outnumber their rivals 3to1 and were 
deeply committed to the war he fought last year against the syrians 
and their moslem allies they apparently do not have the same high 
morale fighting fellow christians many of them relatives 
geageas troops have said they are fighting for the survival of 
their group geagea also kept some lowranking army officers on his 
payroll 
the ceasefire the sixth in the latest round of fighting had 
been called by the vatican through papal nuncio pablo puente and 
maronite catholic patriarch nasrallah sfeir 
aoun and geagea both maronites accepted the ceasefire and 
said they had ordered their forces to honor it 
the fighting resumed when artillery shells crashed into 
residential districts of moslem west beirut which is outside the 
combat zone and the citys eastern christian sector 
the barrage caught unprotected civilians who had emerged from 
shelters to inspect damage and flee to safer areas carrying 
bagloads of belongings 
many sought refuge behind sand barricades others rushed toward 
west beirut on foot as aouns soldiers cocked their guns in 
preparation for battle 
at one point shells fell on residential districts at the rate 
of six per minute said a police spokesman who cannot be named in 
line with regulations 
the shelling set ablaze apartment buildings warehouses gas 
stations and supermarkets police said aouns gunners and lebanese 
forces militiamen were involved in the shelling but it could not 
be determined who provoked the exchange 
when aoun launched his offensive against the lebanese forces on 
tuesday he pledged that no militias would be allowed to operate in 
the 310squaremile christian enclave north and northeast of beirut 
geagea failed to back aoun in his confrontation with president 
elias hrawi elected under a peace plan adopted late last year by 
the lebanese parliament aoun refused to cede the presidential 
palace to hrawi calling him a syrian stooge 
syrian has the largest military presence in lebanon and backs 
the christianmoslem government led by hrawi aouns forces wages 
furious battles with syrian and moslem forces last year in an 
effort to drive out the syrians

the government on saturday lifted curfew 
restrictions for 12 hours but shops remained closed and few people 
ventured out because of a strike called by moslem separatists 
witnesses said 
a bomb went off in the city during the relaxation but a senior 
police official speaking on condition of anonymity said there 
were no casualties 
no other violence was reported 
the jammukashmir liberation front spread a strike call by word 
of mouth on friday night and early saturday local journalists 
said quoting shopkeepers in downtown srinagar and its suburbs 
the front is spearheading a fourdecadeold campaign for 
secession of jammukashmir states predominantly moslem kashmir 
valley from hindumajority india srinagar the states summer 
capital is the largest city in the valley 
at least 76 people have been killed since the government 
launched a crackdown on the secessionist movement on jan 20 and 
imposed aroundtheclock curfews most of those killed were 
curfewviolating moslems shot by the security forces 
the government reported no deaths between jan 25 and friday 
when at least four people were killed three of them died when 
paramilitary police opened fire on a mob defying curfew in the 
nearby city of sopore police officials said the fourth was a 
hindu shopkeeper who was shot by militants in srinagar 
saturdays strike in srinagar was to protest the sopore deaths 
kaiser mirza a local journalist quoted shopkeepers as saying the 
curfew relaxation began at 5 am and ended at 5 pm 
mirza said most shops did not open in the morning when curfew 
was lifted and a few shops that did open soon put down their 
shutters when owners learned of the strike call 
it was not immediately clear if the shops were closed fearing 
attacks by the militants or to sympathize with the separatist cause 
during earlier curfew relaxations which began one week ago 
vegetable shops and groceries were crowded and streets were filled 
with people and traffic on saturday morning small groups of men 
stood at street corners but there was little traffic mirza said 
the moslem militancy dates to 1947 when india and pakistan were 
partitioned on religious lines after gaining independence from 
britain the king of mostly moslem jammukashmir chose union with 
india instead of islamic pakistan 
moslem militants initially began agitating for union with 
pakistan but in recent months have been demanding independence 
instead 
india has accused pakistan of fomenting the trouble in kashmir 
a charge pakistan denies 
the two countries have fought three wars two of them over 
kashmir 
the wars have left a slice of kashmir under pakistans control 
and a unsupervised ceasefire line divides the valley into 
indian and pakistani sectors 
the indian state of jammukashmir which comprises the valley 
and the plains of jammu to the south is the countrys only 
moslemmajority state at least 64 percent of its 5 million people 
follow islam 
nationwide moslems account for 12 percent of the 880 million 
population

us national security adviser brent 
scowcroft said saturday that american forces in the future will be 
smaller but more global in their orientation 
scowcroft said the bush administration is adapting to the 
massive transformations sweeping eastern europe but added that the 
united states will remain a military power in europe 
it is the intention of the united states to remain engaged in 
europe with a substantial military and political presence he 
said we feel we are a european power with an abiding and 
permanent interest in europe security 
in a speech saturday in switzerland chancellor helmut kohl said 
future military plans would include a substantial security role 
for the united states on our continent 
scowcroft spoke at the annual wehrkunde conference in munich 
which brings together security experts lawmakers and government 
officials from north atlantic treaty organization countries and 
japan 
america will remain engaged as a global power scowcroft 
said part of the adjustment in our defense posture will be 
toward active forces that are smaller more global in orientation 
president bush already has proposed reducing superpower forces 
in central europe to 195000 troops for each side that would mean 
a reduction of about 60000 us servicemen most of them from west 
germany 
scowcroft during his address did not spell out how us forces 
would be poised to be more global in orientation 
the conference was held against the backdrop of vastly improved 
eastwest relations and european integration that many predict will 
lead to german unification 
scowcroft repeated us support for german unity and said 
germanys growing strength may be a most prominent feature of 
this new european balance 
another speaker egon bahr of the leftist opposition social 
democratic party criticized bush administration plans to develop 
more shortrange nuclear rockets 
the united states can build more shortrange nuclear rockets 
but we wont install them bahr told the american delegation 
shortrange rockets stationed in west germany are only capable 
of hitting east germany and czechoslovakia both of which are 
undergoing democratic reform

includes a meeting with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and 
talks on the upheaval in eastern europe possible german 
reunification and soviet political problems 
some have suggested that baker also may meet privately with 
foreign ministers moshe arens of israel and esmat abdelmeguid of 
egypt 
the egyptian foreign ministry source said such a meeting 
expected in geneva may depend on whether israeli prime minister 
yitzhak shamir wins a vote of confidence he has requested in his 
rightwing likud bloc 
the source who spoke on condition of anonymity has been 
closely involved with egypts daily diplomatic exchanges in recent 
months with the united states israel and the palestine liberation 
organization 
the exchanges are aimed at getting baker abdelmeguid and arens 
together to work out plans for a proposed israelipalestinian 
dialogue in cairo as a first step toward achieving peace in the 
middle east 
the ministers could discuss the composition of the palestinian 
delegation in cairo and the agenda both of which have proved to be 
divisive issues 
after intensive contacts in recent days between egypt and 
the united states the egyptian source said baker suggested a 
ministerial meeting in geneva with feb 11 a possible date 
egypt is prepared to attend the trilateral meeting as 
suggested because it believes the palestinianisraeli dialogue is 
a vital point along the road to peace in the middle east the 
source said 
baker has stepped up efforts to open negotiations talking by 
telephone this week with arens and with abdelmeguid but a senior 
us official said we are not at the point of saying such a 
meeting will be held next week 
both the official and diplomatic sources speaking in washington 
on condition of anonymity said the gap between the israeli and 
egyptian positions still was too wide to be bridged at a threeway 
meeting involving baker 
reports from israel said that arens told washington a 
ministerial session would have to be held after the likud central 
committee meeting 
shamir is pressing for a single endorsement from the 3200 
committee members for his leadership and for his plan to let 
palestinians in the occupied west bank and gaza strip elect 
delegates for talks with israel on autonomy 
his likud bloc critics led by trade minister ariel sharon who 
chairs the central committee want separate votes on the election 
plans details 
shamir has threatened to resign if he fails to win the 
committees support 
abdelmeguid held three meetings with baker in washington last 
month the foreign ministry source said the egyptian minister gave 
baker a working paper on the peace process then that had been 
closely coordinated with the plo 
the source refused to give details but said the paper outlined a 
position that was clearcut and emphatic on safeguarding the 
legitimate rights of the palestinian people 
egypt publicly supports plo demands that the organization choose 
palestinian delegates to the cairo talks and that the agenda be 
open the plo also wants the delegation to include people deported 
from the occupied territories and from israelannexed east 
jerusalem 
shamir insists on excluding the plo from the process and 
confining the talks agenda to his election plan he also opposes 
participation of palestinians from east jerusalem apparently 
fearing this would undermine the citys status as israels declared 
capital

president bush on saturday discussed global 
climate change with a newly formed presidential advisory panel 
while white house aides denied reports that his chief of staff 
toned down a speech he will make monday on global warming 
bush never intended to reveal any policy shifts in his speech to 
the opening session of the intergovernmental panel on climate 
change and the speech was tailored to reflect the official 
administration position that considerable scientific uncertainty 
remains about the seriousness of global warming one administration 
official said 
bush has been criticized for not taking a stronger world 
leadership role on global warming and his speech to the ipcc a 
united nationssponsored committee will be closely watched by 
environmental and business groups 
in it he will showcase his administrations proposals and steps 
already taken for research and protection involving global 
environment said the administration official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
officials on saturday denied reports in the washington post and 
new york times that white house chief of staff john sununu tried to 
tone down the speech because it went too far in portraying global 
warming as a serious problem 
sununu and environmental protection agency administrator william 
reilly have been at odds over the administrations policy on global 
warming the gradual increase in the earths temperature due to 
buildup of heattrapping gases emitted into the earths atmosphere 
by oil and coal combustion 
sununus deputy andrew card on saturday termed the newspaper 
reports fictitious he said sununu had not written any part 
of the speech but reviewed it as he routinely would any speech 
card said finishing touches were being put on the speech 
saturday 
the official who spoke anonymously said sununus only point 
was to be careful about the tone and make sure it reflected 
administration policy on the inconclusiveness of scientific 
research on global warming 
sununu according to the reports is not convinced of the 
reliability of computer models that project temperature increases 
of at least 4 degrees by the year 2050 and he fears the economic 
consequences of shifting abruptly from todays energy sources 
we take the issue seriously but were not prepared to make 
decisions on potential changes that are not scientifically 
proven white house spokesman steve hart said saturday science 
does not support the theories that would prompt the strong 
countermeasures environmentalists want to see 
other officials said that despite a reluctance to endorse 
expensive and sweeping steps to mitigate global warming bush in 
his speech will point out the environmental steps he is taking 
such as 
his proposal to spend 1 billion in fiscal year 1991 an 
increase of 57 percent for global change research 
sweeping clean air act changes currently being negotiated with 
congress 
a proposal to spend 175 million to begin a project of planting 
1 billion trees 
last years regulatory restrictions on electric appliances 
the us hosting of an international convention to work on a 
framework agreement on climate change next fall 
we are using this in a comprehensive way to give credit for 
all the united states is doing to show leadership on the 
environment the official said 
sununu was with bush at the presidential retreat at camp david 
md where a spokesman said global warming was among the topics 
discussed at the first meting of the presidents council of 
advisers on science and technology policy chaired by white house 
science adviser d allan bromley bromley also heads the global 
change committee within bushs domestic policy council of advisers 
bush prepared his monday address as a congressional report 
accused his administration of a leadership void without goals 
or comprehensive strategy on global climate change 
the report by the general accounting office an investigative 
arm of congress praised the government for trying to develop an 
international consensus on global warming through the un panel 
but it says the administration also should develop a national 
policy 
the president has not designated any individual or agency to 
assume overall leadership or management responsibility for global 
climate change said the report released friday without such a 
designated leadership position or focal point no identifiable 
hierarchical structure for policy and decisionmaking on global 
climate change issues has emerged 
the study was requested by house energy and commerce committee 
chairman john d dingell dmich in a letter to the white house 
the environmental protection agency and the departments of energy 
and state dingell called the findings troubling 
he urged coordinated leadership and a wise and reasonable 
approach to addressing and hopefully solving these complex and 
controversial issues in a timely manner 
the report notes that bush announced last march the united 
states would join other industrial countries in phasing out 
production and consumption of chlorofluorocarbon by the year 2000 
bush made no similar commitment to control carbon dioxide 
emissions another gas believed to be depleting the planets 
protective ozone layer the report said but he has directed energy 
secretary james watkins to develop a national energy strategy that 
will include proposals for reducing the global warming 
greenhouse gas emissions caused by energy sources

the spirit may be willing but the 
salary is weak and church officials say that finding an organist 
is getting harder 
half the parishes either arent able to pay or dont want to 
pay the musicians what they deserve so the musicians are going 
elsewhere said john hubert organist at st michaels episcopal 
church in bristol 
the holy trinity church in central falls was almost left in the 
lurch at christmas after its regular organist left for a 
betterpaying job 
i figured wed come up with somebody that it would just be a 
matter of getting in touch with one or two people said the rev 
robert m beirne it took more than 15 phone calls and in the end 
the four masses were handled by four musicians he said 
jean richard dupont placement officer for the rhode island 
chapter of the american guild of organists said saturday that holy 
trinity is not alone there is a nationwide shortage of organists 
you can look at any of our magazines they always have 
ads for organists he said 
fewer people are studying organ especially sacred music but 
the main reason is that women who dominate the field dont have 
the time anymore 
in the past they could get away with it because there were a 
lot of women who really didnt need another income and who were 
willing to do it out of love said dupont 
those women are out working in other jobs now and they dont 
want to come back to the church and work for a pittance 
the rhode island chapter of the organists guild issued a book 
last month outlining what it considers fair recompense for church 
musicians 
the book suggests salaries of 26400 to 31000 for fulltime 
church organists holding a doctorate in music and from 4700 to 
5800 per year for musicians who work 10 to 14 hours a week and 
hold a guild certificate 
dupont said guilds in other cities have issued similar books 
with wages set for each region 
the rhode island guild has about 125 members and there are at 
least 175 other organists in the state dupont said 
a 1987 survey found that of the 135 respondents the annual pay 
ranged from zero to 20000 with a median of 5200 taking into 
account time for services and rehearsals the average hourly pay 
was 982 with the highest 3397 
dupont 55 who said he puts in about 10 hours of preparation 
for the sunday service he plays at the first universalist church in 
providence said the job is more than just tickling the ivories 
you have to have training experience the ability to know 
what is good music and not good music you have to be able to 
direct a choir and in a choir you have so many personalities 
you have to be a diplomat said dupont 
the guild recommended organists should receive 50 to 75 for 
funerals and 75 to 100 for weddings the 1986 guidelines by the 
roman catholic diocese of providence recommend 30 to 50 for 
weddings

committee to oversee such a truce la prensa reported 
the paper quoted pastrana as saying that the government of 
president virgilio barco should take steps to ensure that the 
proposal leads to a permanent peace in the 30yearold insurgency 
botero said army troops would be sent to northeastern colombia 
to protect polling centers from the procuba national liberation 
army which has promised to disrupt balloting 
the congressional elections are scheduled for march 11 and

israeli troops arrested almost 100 palestinians 
in a roundup of suspected agitators in the occupied west bank and 
soldiers shot and wounded 10 arabs in the occupied gaza strip arab 
reports said 
meanwhile prime minister yitzhak shamir demanded an end to a 
barrage of criticisms by rivals in his rightwing likud bloc and 
said that his party cannot live with the public dispute 
a source in the egyptian foreign ministry said egypt expects 
secretary of state james a baker iii to invite the israeli and 
egyptian foreign minsters to a meeting in geneva next week to 
prepare for israelipalestinian peace talks if shamir wins a 
wednesday vote of confidence by party leaders 
rebel likud hawks led by industry and trade minister ariel 
sharon have been trying to undermine the foreign ministers 
meeting and shamirs efforts to implement a peace plan that calls 
for palestinian elections in the occupied lands 
the likud rebels have demanded that in place of one vote of 
confidence at the party meeting the 3200 delegates vote 
separately on each of the plans details 
likuds coalition partner the leftleaning labor party decided 
saturday to leave the government if shamir loses the vote israel 
television reported 
shamir accused the rebels of undermining israels security by 
making the dispute public 
to put on a display before hostile and enemy elementsis 
destructive he said this phenomenon must be dismissed from 
the life of the likud 
in the occupied west bank on saturday troops imposed curfews on 
the towns of ramallah elbireh and the kalandia refugee camp and 
detained almost 100 palestinians as part of a security sweep an 
army spokesman said

disturbances and taking part in violent antiisraeli activities

transportation ground to a halt to observe a general strike ordered 
by the fundamentalist islamic jihad organization 
arab reports said soldiers wounded 10 palestinians during

the secret shin bet security agency suspended two interrogators 
in december after an independent autopsy revealed that ali 27 
died of internal injuries sustained during a beating

the revolutionary government bowed to 
opposition pressure on saturday and revamped the ruling council to 
give a minority role to 29 opposition parties 
the national salvation fronts council transformed itself into 
the nucleus of a new council of national unity a 180member panel 
that will rule until may 20 elections the front will hold 93 of 
the seats 
the front unelected and serving by decree since the december 
revolution that ousted communist dictator nicolae ceausescu has 
been under pressure to become more democratic 
the front includes several former leading communists and has 
been accused of plotting to restore a dictatorship in addition 
the opposition had complained that no fair elections would be 
possible if the front both organized and participated in the may 
elections 
the new council of national unity will have 90 seats for 
political parties and 90 for prominent front members including 
those who fought in the revolution workers farmers youth and 
ethnic minorities 
the 90 political seats will be split among the front and the 29 
opposition parties with each group getting three seats 
starting today the national salvation front takes a new 
form interim vice president cazimir ionescu told repoters he 
referred to the action as a reshuffle rather than a 
dissolution 
dissolution would have meant a void in state power he said 
adding that a continuation of power was necessary to ensure 
stability and avoid a worsening of the already chaotic economic 
situation 
last week the front announced it was transforming itself into a 
political movement with no links to its governing council in order 
to run in the elections the first free vote since 1946 the front 
has refused to become a political party calling itself a mass 
political organization instead 
the 1946 elections were won by the national peasant party now 
the largest opposition group but were overturned by the communists 
experts from the front and the political parties also met to 
discuss a draft electoral law promulgated by the front earlier this 
week it provides for a twochamber parliamentary system 
interim president ion iliescu said in a state radio interview 
that the temporary council of national unity will function as a 
preparliament without detailing what its structures or powers 
would be 
the national salvation front as a political organization with 
a structure and platform that is consistent will take part in 
the elections at the same level as all the other political 
organizations iliescu said in another interview in saturdays 
edition of the daily adevarul 
iliescu is likely to retain his post of president until the may 
elections ionescu said 
the fronts political platform will be announced soon he said 
the ruling fronts agreement to a council of national unity came 
at a meeting thursday with the 29 opposition parties 
three historic opposition parties had originally demanded that 
the selfappointed ruling council of the front step down 
altogether claiming it had no legitimacy 
but in recent days the opposition parties have resigned 
themselves to powersharing with the front holding the dominant 
position their leaders said that at least until the elections 
this arrangement was the only viable alternative to being totally 
locked out of power 
what was announced today was in step with the decisions to 
build a provisional council of national unity said iftene pop 
vice president of the national peasant party the new council 
better mirrors the real balance of political forces existing in 
romania and ends the fronts monopoly on power 
more precisely it bars the way to dictatorship and a new 
oneparty system he added

a bush administration report to congress 
complains in unmistakable terms about human rights abuses in china 
following last years crackdown on the prodemocracy movement 
there according to sources who have seen the document 
the state departments annual assessment of repressive practices 
around the globe doesnt pull any punches when it comes to 
china one source said another said it describes every human 
rights crime you can think of regarding the beijing government 
the unambiguity of the section on china surprised some 
congressional figures particularly those who have charged the 
president himself with softpeddling the issue and catering too 
much to the communist government 
the report is not scheduled for public release until feb 21 
when robert schifter assistant secretary for human rights is 
scheduled to testify on it before the house foreign affairs 
committee 
murders disappearances executions suppression of labor 
rights religious persecution of catholics and buddhists slave 
labor camps in western china you name it its in there said 
one source who discussed contents of the report on condition he not 
be identified 
another source who also declined identification said we 
expected they might go somewhat easy on the chinese in light 
of the recent missions to beijing by national security adviser 
brent scowcroft but they didnt he said the report doesnt 
pull any punches 
a state department spokeswoman sondra mccarty declined comment 
saturday on the new human rights report saying it would be 
premature to do so before schifters testimony to the house panel 
some members of congress have complained that bush and secretary 
of state james a baker iii were far too muted in their criticism 
of the chinese regime after last summers bloody suppression of 
student demonstrators in tiananmen square 
and most democrats and even many republicans were particularly 
upset when bush last month vetoed a bill protecting an estimated 
40000 chinese students in the united states from deportation 
the president argued he had accomplished the same objectives 
through administrative action the students meanwhile expressed 
fear that he might revoke his executive order in some future 
bargain with beijing 
referring to the presidents veto sustained in the senate a 
week ago house speaker thomas s foley dwash declared it was 
wrong for the bush administration to yield to pressure from a 
communist dictatorship in beijing one lesson of the past 45 
years is that no congress and no president should be timid in the 
defense of freedom 
bush at a news conference following the senate vote repeated 
his pledge that no chinese student who is in this country is 
going to be sent back against his or her will he added that we 
will continue to urge the peoples republic of china to recognize 
the human rights of its citizens 
at the same time bush pronounced himself very pleased that 
beijing had lifted martial law had stopped harassing the us 
embassy and had released 573 people from prison 
ive very pleased theyve lightened up on the areas where i 
think we can really move things forward including peace corps 
and fulbright scholarship exchanges he said 
nbc news which reported first on the stillunreleased human 
rights report quoted this passage from it as of years end 
there were continuing reliable reports of beatings of political 
detainees in the beijing area by security forces prisoners 
both criminal and political are subjected to severe psychological 
pressure to confess 
earlier this week baker went before the senate foreign 
relations committee with a prepared text which named cuba and china 
as countries who try to shut out democratic values but he 
omitted the reference to china in his spoken testimony

a deafmute spared himself from a possible 
death sentence with a signlanguage confession to murdering a 
14yearold boy after what he said was a video arcade fight over a 
dollar 
i pushed him into the car and i started choking him brian 
hodge said in the confession i kept choking and choking him he 
went back and grabbed me in the crotch and it really hurt so i 
choked him harder 
he was pushing me in the face and saying stop stop it was 
too late he should have paid me back before he said through a 
signlanguage interpreter 
the videotaped confession was made as part of a bargain with 
prosecutors in which hodge pleaded guilty friday to murder and 
attempted rape in the july slaying of karl phillip heiland 
in exchange he was spared the possibility of the death penalty 
and will receive life in prison plus 15 years 
the defense had intended to argue that the 25yearold 
electrical worker committed seconddegree murder because he never 
meant to kill the boy 
but prosecutors said they would have tried to prove that hodge 
killed karl while trying to rape him not by accident in a fight 
over the dollar 
michael benito an assistant state attorney said he would have 
put on evidence that hodge followed a different boy the day before 
he killed karl 
on the videotape hodge distanced himself from the sexual 
attacks 
i didnt do it the devil did it he said thats when the 
devil was calling me to have sex 
six weeks after the slaying karls mother cathy lee heiland 
committed suicide near his grave by running a hose from her exhaust 
pipe to the inside of her car police found her next to photographs 
of karl

jesse jackson saturday appealed to president fw 
de klerk to follow the example of abraham lincoln and john f 
kennedy and press ahead with his reforms regardless of any 
threatened backlash from white conservatives 
the us black civil rights leader expressed hope and 
caution about south africa as he prepared to revisit the nation 
after being refused entry for a decade 
jackson said he hoped that in giving him a visa for the first 
time since 1979 south africa was sending yet another signal of a 
commitment to openness 
jackson visited with black cultural groups in london saturday 
and he was to attend two public meetings sunday on monday he is to 
meet with prime minister margaret thatcher 
he flies to zambia later on monday and to south africa on 
wednesday and he said he hoped to meet de klerk as well as jailed 
black leader nelson mandela in or out of prison 
de klerk on friday legalized the african national congress the 
main guerrilla group fighting white rule and lifted restrictions 
on 60 opposition groups and 374 individuals 
he also promised mandelas imminent release 
jackson mentioned president lincolns emancipation of the slaves 
and president kennedys desegregation drive in the southern united 
states and so mr de klerk must be encouraged to move most 
people in the world are pulling for him to go farther and dont 
stop now 
jackson said de klerk must not be deterred by any threatened 
backlash 
great leadership does not follow opinion polls it molds 
opinion he told reporters mr de klerk is now in a position 
to mold opinion and make things happen and should not let this 
moment pass he must seize this moment to do the right thing 
he should free mandela and abolish the remaining pillars of 
apartheid like the group areas act which segregates residential 
rights by race jackson said 
jackson hitherto a fervent supporter of economic sanctions 
against south africa was noncommittal about whether the west 
should continue to apply them 
sanctions is not the central issue he said noting that de 
klerk had not made their removal a condition for reform and that 
president bush had said it was premature to talk of lifting 
sanctions 
sanctions should be part of the negotiating process therefore 
not a precondition jackson said and to put the focus on 
sanctions rather than apartheid is to shift the focus away from the 
need to encourage mr de klerk to continue and what we heard 
yesterday was reason for hope and caution 
but he said south african blacks now saw economic sanctions the 
same way the west sees nato now that eastern europe is free of 
soviet domination nato is both a deterrent on one hand and a 
stimulus to democracy on the other

a family of bald eagles has moved into the 
path of the planned orlando beltway and developers are seeking an 
exception to a ban on building near the threatened birds nest 
the mother eagle and her two eaglets have settled on a flattop 
pine just 50 feet west of where cars will zoom onto the beltway 
where it crosses over lake jesup in seminole county 
usually state and federal agencies do not allow development 
within 750 feet of a nest of the threatened species but the 
expressway authority is seeking a firsttimeever exception to 
their policy which wildlife officials fear could set an unwelcome 
precedent 
once we do it then everybody will want to do this said don 
wood endangered species coordinator for the florida game and fresh 
water fish commission 
bald eagles are an endangered species in most states but are 
classified only as threatened in florida which has one of the 
largest groups of the birds in the nation florida prohibits any 
disturbance molestation harm or harassment to the eagles 
violators can be fined up to 50000 and sentenced to three years 
in jail 
wood acknowledged that the uniqueness of the situation should 
make it virtually impossible to duplicate 
first the nest appears to have been built in the past month 
long after the seminole county expressway authority plotted where 
its beltway section would run through the county 
second the eagles appear to be plentiful around lake jesup in 
fact the expressway route across the lake was selected 
specifically to bypass two other eagle nests and eagle expert 
doris mager has plotted at least 11 active nests around the lake 
were going to consider there are a lot of eagles in the 
area wood said the loss of one nest would not be as 
significant because of that 
moving the toll road farther east would place it in the 
environmentally sensitive black hammock to the west the route 
would pose further engineering problems said beltway environmental 
consultant w michael dennis 
state and federal officials are asking the expressway authority 
for certain safeguards before it could allow the road to be built 
so close to the nest 
the authority would be required to prove the nest was new leave 
a belt of trees between the nest and the road halt construction 
during the oct 1 through may 15 nesting season ensure that lights 
do not hit the nest and monitor the birds reaction to the 
construction 
gerald brinton executive director of the expressway authority 
said meeting those constraints would likely raise the cost of the 
158 million project

with the realization that apartheid is far from ended archbishop 
desmond tutu said saturday 
tutu visiting to confer with other opposition leaders and us 
officials said the fight for equality is not over and urged 
continued political and economic pressure on the south african 
government to dismantle apartheid 
we have not yet the complete dismantling of apartheid and this 
is the pinpoint of the sanction program we want apartheid totally 
dismantled said tutu the 1984 nobel peace prize laureate 
the anglican archbishop said his initial joy over the lifting of 
some political restrictions against blacks friday was tempered 
later by the realization that apartheid still is far from over 
he said his change of heart came after having pinched myself 
and convinced myself it wasnt a dream and it was real of 
course you see apartheid is still in place 
tutu said he is looking forward to relinquishing his position as 
south africas preeminent opponent of apartheid now that mandela 
is to be released from prison 
i said long ago i was just an interim leader until he 
mandela comes out he said hes been making us work too 
hard 
tutu was accompanied by patrick lekota publicity secretary for 
the united democratic front they were met at logan international 
airport by themba vilakazi head of the bostonbased fund for a 
free south africa just returned from zambia where the african 
national congress is based 
the group was met by zenani mandela dlamini 30 eldest daughter 
of nelson and winnie mandela and a political science student at 
boston university 
their arrival came less than 24 hours after south african 
president fw de klerk announced in a speech to parliament that 
mandela would be released unconditionally although he set no date 
de klerk also lifted bans on more than 30 opposition groups 
after three decades of underground activity against white rule 
including the african national congress outlawed in 1960 
the announcements appeared to clear the way for talks on a new 
constitution that would end the black majoritys exclusion from 
national politics 
tutu a member of harvard universitys board of overseers was 
here to attend a meeting at the school lekota said he planned to 
attend a meeting of the albert einstein institute a cambridge 
think tank that advocates the use of nonviolent sanctions to solve 
political unrest 
mandelas daughter greeted fondly by tutu told reporters she 
was skeptical of the recent changes in south africa despite the 
news her father would be released 
this has been going on for 300 years she said what 
happened friday im not overly excited about it release some 
political prisoners to me thats nothing we want total majority 
voting in south africa until that happens i will not be 
satisfied 
her husband thumbumuzi dlamini 39 is a prince from swaziland 
one of the sons of the late king sobhuza ii his brother is now the 
king of swaziland an independent country almost completely 
surrounded by south africa they live in the boston area with their 
three children 
lekota who was recently released from prison was more positive 
about the changes he predicted members of the white minority in 
south africa who resist change will eventually be forced to accept 
the idea of equality with blacks 
they cannot stop us he said we are unstoppable now 
lekota said he also planned to meet with sen edward m kennedy 
dmass and state department officials to give the south african 
black perspective on the recent turn of events

parliament on saturday elected an 
economist to replace a hardline communist as premier and the new 
leader promised immediate reforms to combat bulgarias social and 
economic crisis 
a leader of the emerging democratic opposition described the new 
premier andrei lukanov as a good choice and left open the 
possibility that some opposition members might join a coalition 
government 
the election the latest development in a wave of changes came 
one day after the communist party expelled many of the old orthodox 
communists and picked another advocate of change as party chief 
lukanovs government is to hold power until free elections are 
held in may 
the national assembly unanimously chose lukanov as premier after 
accepting the resignation of former premier georgi atanassov and 
his 22member cabinet 
lukanov a 51yearold economist with years of experience in 
government and party politics said he was accepting the post at a 
time of moral and economic crisis 
he later told reporters that his new government would liberalize 
the news media he asked for constructive criticism by the 
press and complete objectivity 
apparently to underline the new leaderships more open media 
policy filip bokov announced his resignation as head of state 
radio and television a position he has held for less than three 
months 
the official news agency bta said the reason for his resignation 
was his appointment to the new communist party presidium 
apparently to avoid a conflict of interest 
lukanov and his reformminded colleagues new party chief 
alexander lilov and president petar mladenov face public 
skepticism about their commitment to reform as well as their 
ability to handle a flagging economy hobbled by unprecedented labor 
unrest 
we have to make fundamental economic reforms and we have to 
do it immediately he said the social and economic crisis is 
now the most important thing and it is the most important task to 
come out of the crisis he said he would detail his recovery plan 
in a speech to the national assembly on thursday when lawmakers 
will swear in the new government 
it was not clear if lukanov lilov or mladenov would have the 
most substantive power in the new government mladenov on nov 10 
replaced hardline leader todor zhivkov after 35 years in power 
and he promised free elections and oversaw the end to guaranteed 
communist supremacy in bulgaria 
lukanov has been the main negotiator for the party at broad 
talks with the opposition and is perceived by many bulgarians as 
the most trustworthy communist leader 
lukanov said the government must be rejuvenated and said he 
would move beyond career technocrats to choose a cabinet with 
clever professionals and welltrained people 
he said he was hopeful that opposition groups would support an 
interim coalition government 
petar beron a leader of the opposition union of democratic 
forces said earlier saturday that his group would not take part 
but later indicated that some coalition members might do so on 
their own 
he said lukanov was a good choice 
he said the communists have not said how much power they will 
share and he predicted little chance of a real opposition role as 
long as the national assembly is controlled by the communists the 
oppositions participation would be like a muppet show beron 
said 
whatever its composition the new government could not be 
worse than it has been up to now beron said 
blagovest sendov president of the academy of sciences said 
only private initiative could pull bulgaria out of its economic 
crisis 
lukanov did not reject private ownership outright but said this 
was one of various approaches to be considered in reforming the 
economy

the company hired by the city of new orleans 
to screen its employees for drugs has lost its certification to 
test federal workers 
laboratory specialists inc is the first such lab in the nation 
to lose federal approval according to the national institute on 
drug abuse in bethesda md 
since jan 24 the belle chasse company has been forbidden to 
test federal workers or those on federal contracts 
the company is still allowed to test city employees and pursue 
other drugtesting contracts 
officials at the federal national institute on drug abuse wont 
say why they rescinded lsis certification other than that the lab 
failed to maintain standards to conduct urine drug testing for 
federal agencies 
city personnel director michael doyle said its not clear what 
effect the decertification would have on the citys new drug 
testing program 
new orleans police firefighters and other employees have been 
subject to random drug testing since jan 1 but the results of 
testing or any resulting disciplinary or rehabilitation measures 
have not been announced 
twenty police officers per day have been selected randomly by 
computer for the past week and given about an hours notice police 
union members said 
when you are dealing with someones livelihood i think you 
should go with the ultimate accreditation and thats the federal 
government said michael conn treasurer of the police 
association of new orleans 
he did not say whether the union would challenge the testing 
program because of the decertification 
lsi was chosen in december partly because it was the only lab 
in the state with federal approval doyle said a spokeswoman at 
nida said lsi was the first of 42 laboratories nationwide to lose 
federal certification 
we are working with them to have it reinstated nida 
spokeswoman mona brown said the federal agency which charges 
17000 a year for certification inspects the labs twice a year 
and tests quality control every other month 
lsi has been in the drug testing business for 11 years the 
company has 500 to 600 customers nationwide lab director pat pizzo 
said in november 
i want to make it clear this is a suspension not a 
revocation said lsi president arthur r peterson 
he said he did not know what caused the suspension of the labs 
federal certification but that his company has been continuing 
talks with the federal agency to obtain reinstatement 
peterson said he had heard from some lsi clients but had not 
discussed the matter with the city of new orleans

senate republican leader bob dole on saturday 
lamented lebanons long night of death and destruction saying 
all foreign forces should leave the wartorn country 
for too many in washington lebanon has fallen off the screen 
the only issues list that it tops is the list of those issues to 
avoid in the future the kansas senator said 
dole said that factional strife among christians in east beirut 
together with the continued presence of syrian forces in the middle 
eastern country does not point toward a peaceful resolution 
lebanons long night of death and destruction continues he 
said 
in a speech prepared for a dinner sponsored by the american task 
force on lebanon an organization of some 100 prominent americans 
of lebanese descent he called on christians to end their bloody 
test of might and will 
a copy of doles los angeles speech was released by his 
washington office 
as violence escalated last year the united states withdrew 
ambassador john mccarthy and other americans on the us embassy 
staff only lebanese remain at the embassy 
dole urged appointment of a special american envoy someone 
who will devote full time and attention to lebanon someone who 
will make it clear that the united states is serious about 
lebanon 
president bush has deplored the increasing incidences of 
violence in lebanon and the administration went into federal court 
to win the ouster of lebanese gen michael aouns ambassador in 
washington abdallah bouhabib 
the state department argued that his continued occupation of the 
building was causing increasingly serious adverse consequences 
for the nations foreign relations 
the state department sought bouhabibs ouster at the request of 
lebanons new government led by president elias hrawi who was 
elected in november with the backing of the 22nation arab league 
the united states recognized the hrawi government last november 
and had been conducting its business with a hrawiappointed 
ambassador rather than with bouhabib even before before the embassy 
was turned over to hrawi representatives friday under a federal 
court order 
aoun who controls lebanons christian sector with about 1 
million residents refuses to recognize the hrawi government and 
continues to hold out with 20000 troops at the presidential palace 
in beirut the state department has called for aoun to step down 
dole said the united states should put pressure on syrian 
president hafez assad to remove forces from lebanon and said the 
arab league should press assad for a troop withdrawal timetable 
he also said that secretary of state james a baker in talks 
with soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze in moscow this 
week should say that as long as moscow gives assad the green 
light for aggression in lebanon the united states will keep out 
the yellow caution light on the path of ussoviet relations 
i do believe it is my responsibility as someone who cares 
deeply about lebanon to plead with every faction and every 
lebanese leader to end the senseless killing he said

tens of thousands of people 
exercised their new freedom saturday by forming a 100mile human 
chain to protest a hydroelectric dam project on the danube river 
the government news agency said 
the ctk news agency said 100000 people from czechoslovakia 
hungary and austria formed the chain across territory in all three 
nations 
meanwhile thousands of west germans and czechoslovak citizens 
formed a 25mile human chain across their common border in a 
gesture of triumph over the waning divisions between east and west 
ctk said 
tens of thousands of them passed through the border crossing 
where the chain was formed drawing attention to the absurdity of 
the iron curtain ctk said 
hardline communist regimes have been replaced by reformist 
governments in czechoslovakia and hungary in the past two years 
that have opened their borders with the west while much of eastern 
europes iron curtain has been torn down the continent remains 
divided by the nato and warsaw pact military alliances 
among those taking part was czechoslovakias foreign minister 
former dissident jiri dienstbier he was quoted as saying that a 
joint commmission to discuss the opening of new border crossings 
between the two countries would meet next week 
in the hydroelectric dam protest ctk said that up to 100000 
people helped form a human chain along the danube over a span of 
about 100 miles from the town of hainburg in austria across to 
bratislava in czechoslovakia and to komarom in hungary 
hungarys parliament already voted to scrap its part of the 
joint dam project with czechoslovakia and the new prague 
leadership has said it will review the environmental consequences 
of its part of the power plant at gabcikovo 
activists read aloud a letter addressed to czechoslovak 
president vaclav havel requesting his support for the demands that 
the project be stopped mti reported participants also called for 
austria hungary and czechoslovakia to create a nature reserve 
along the danube mti said 
in the hungarian town of visegrad andras szekfue of the 
hungarian green party told about 100 people that since the 
hungarian part of the project at nagymaros had been scrapped they 
must help the czechoslovaks stop the dam at gabcikovo a 
participant told the associated press 
 
referring to the democratic revolutions that have swept the east 
bloc szekfue added the good thing is that we no longer need to 
work in secret but can pursue our aims with democratic means 
in the hungarian city of esztergom activist csaba paska noted 
the danube links the people of the three countries and this 
dam which divides us was the work of politicians 
among placards and banners carried by protesters was one 
reading build bridges not dams 
austrian and hungarian environmentalists had long opposed the 
mammoth project maintaining it would destroy unique wildlife and 
have other irreparable consequences for the danube 
the project was agreed on by the communist governments in prague 
and budapest in the 1970s austria had agreed to finance part of 
the hungarian project in exchange for electricity 
the chain across the west germanczechoslovak border was formed 
between the czechoslovak town of zlezna ruda and the west german 
border town of bayrisch eisenstein about 100 miles northeast of 
munich

mayor tom bradleys political mentor received 
336000 in federal funds through the city to renovate a building 
he owned through a nonexistent corporation the los angeles times 
reported saturday 
the city council granted loans to bishop h hartford brookins 
between 1982 and 1985 apparently in violation of city bidding 
procedure and despite brookins refusal to provide financial 
information on some occasions the times reported citing city 
officials and government records 
in addition an aide to bradley repeatedly asked two city 
administrators to grant special help to the bishop the officials 
said 
a spokesman for brookins referred questions about the matter to 
attorney j stanley sanders who said he did not know enough about 
it to comment 
bradley declined to be interviewed about brookins but the 
mayors spokesman bill chandler said bradley never spoke about 
the brookins loan and said it never came to his attention until 
after it was repaid in 1988 
the money came in the form of federally funded contracts 
administered by the citys community development department to 
renovate a threestory building brookins owns in southwest los 
angeles 
loan records indicate the building today is worth about 1 
million 
brookins used some of the money to pay off 30000 in personal 
obligations according to district attorney investigative reports 
cited by the times 
in july the district attorneys office dropped a twoyear 
investigation into the loans because the statute of limitations for 
fraud and embezzlement had elapsed 
last month the us department of housing and urban development 
referred the brookins case to its regional office of inspector 
general for possible investigation of misuse of government funds 
hud spokesman scott reed said 
brookins was the regional bishop of the african methodist 
episcopal church from 1976 to 1984 he engineered bradleys first 
campaign for city council in 1963 and has been chairman or 
cochairman of every campaign since 
i mean literally if i may i almost handcarried bradley up 
his whole political career brookins said in a 1985 interview 
brookins currently is ame church bishop for maryland virginia and 
washington dc 
the building was owned by the southern california african 
methodist episcopal church inc of which brookins is listed as 
sole corporate director but the secretary of states office said 
the firm was never incorporated in california 
in 1982 the city council instructed the community development 
department to loan 238000 to the company to renovate the 
building no competing projects were considered said douglas s 
ford the cdds former general manager 
the reality was that brookins was politically connected and 
the contract came down through those channels and we were in a 
position where we had to implement it cdd analyst arnold c 
garcia said 
brookins received more money from the city council when the 
project ran out of funds in 1985 bringing the total to 336000 
records show 
cdd analyst richard gallegos said supervisors ordered him to 
release the additional funds even though brookins had failed to 
provide property deeds loan papers and other required documents 
for the contract 
i was told pressure was coming from the mayors office and we 
got to get this contract out he said

police blocked a march by the largest 
opposition party saturday the first anniversary of the military 
coup that toppled dictator alfredo stroessner 
on the day that commemorates the end of an oppressive 
dictatorship they prohibit us from freely walking in the 
streets said domingo laino who was jailed and exiled by gen 
stroessner but won a seat in congress in national elections last 
may 
the government did not say why they banned the peaceful 
demonstration by several hundred members of the authentic radical 
liberal party 
the march is prohibited by the ministry of the interior and i 
have precise orders to act to bar it said police gen francisco 
sanchez 
no clashes or injuries were reported 
the police action was at odds with the generally improved 
climate of civil liberties since stroessner was overthrown by his 
top general andres rodriguez on feb 3 1989 three months later 
rodriguez overwhelmingly was elected president 
in interviews last week political labor and human rights 
leaders said the rodriguez government was upholding civil rights 
and democratic liberties although it was clear stroessners 
colorado party and the armed forces still dominate government and 
commerce 
we enjoy freedom of thought and expression said eduardo 
escobar a leader of the pro demos human rights group that is an 
important achievement and an essential element in the process 
toward democracy 
people are exercising their liberties calling radio stations 
about abuses complaining about increased bus fares this didnt 
happen before said benjamin arditti a political analyst my 
concern is that political leaders arent moving as fast as the 
desire for change 
rodriguez 66 began the coup the night of feb 2 1989 
stroessner surrendered before dawn the next day after he was 
pinned down by tanks at the presidential escort battalion and 
several hundred soldiers defending him had been killed 
on friday rodriguez urged paraguayans to bury any bitterness 
they may have for the past 
in brief comments to reporters rodriguez said the anniversary 
is a day for reflection i would like people to raise a 
prayer for the fallen 
i hope we may forget rancors hatreds jealousy selfishness 
and passions in order to live in peace and harmony he said 
may our prayers serve as a just remembrance for those who offered 
their lives for the liberty and democracy paraguayans now enjoy

the chief executive of the american medical 
association was one of four top staff members of the organization 
who benefited from a decade of moneylosing financial deals 
according to a published report 
the chicago suntimes reported in early sunday editions that the 
ama lost 45000 when it purchased the suburban inverness home of 
dr james h sammons the association paid 280000 for the home in 
1984 and sold it the next year for 235000 
sammons the associations chief executive officer later moved 
into a chicago highrise condominium owned by the ama where he 
paid belowmarket rent the newspaper reported citing unidentified 
sources 
the ama lost 23000 after purchasing the wheaton home of joe d 
miller for 170000 in 1980 and selling it later for 147000 
miller retired at the end of 1982 
relocation experts said corporations expect to lose 5 percent to 
6 percent buying and reselling a house but the ama lost 16 percent 
on sammons home and 135 percent on millers home the newspaper 
said 
the amas board of trustees released a statement friday that 
said the purchases of millers and sammons residences were 
authorized by the board of trustees at prices arrived at by 
independent outside appraisals and they were for the convenience 
and benefit of the association 
the newspaper quoted unidentified ama trustees who served in 
1980 and 1984 saying they did not recall being told the group was 
buying the homes of sammons and miller 
sammons has been under fire in recent months following the 
disclosures of various financial decisions in december the ama 
board of directors curtailed sammons broad financial discretion 
and announced that he would retire in 1991 
in a 1987 deal the ama reimbursed its chief operating officer 
whalen m strobhar 353000 to cover stock market loses to his 
pensionfund investments strobhar resigned and later repaid the

more than 40000 high school and university students 
marched through rome on saturday to demand reform in the italian 
educational system 
we want to study we want jobs so the schools must change 
the students shouted 
the peaceful demonstration was organized by a group of naples 
high school students angered by the decision of the national 
education ministry not to include many students in a convention on 
the italian school system 
many of the naples students belonged to the youth group of the 
communist party italys biggest opposition party newspapers 
reported 
the students demanded that studies be updated to reflect changes 
in society and that the government not reduce its commitment to 
schools under a new plan granting them more autonomy 
the plan would allow businesses to become more involved in 
higher education and the protesters say private industry 
utlimately would have too much influence at staterun universities

the irish republican armys political 
wing on saturday discussed how to broaden its voter appeal while 
demonstrators outside brought a coffin and signs saying the ira 
kills democracy 
the annual convention of the sinn fein party came a week after 
an ira bomb accidentally killed a 16yearold boy in londonderry 
northern ireland 
although sinn fein president gerry adams said a year ago that 
such mistakes were retarding the cause of a united ireland 
there was no repeat this year of his call for the ira to be 
careful and careful again 
instead adams asserted that the mainly catholic ira was winning 
in its 21yearold battle to end british rule in 
protestantdominated northern ireland and unite it with the 
republic of ireland he called on the british government to open 
unconditional negotiations 
peter brooke britains top official in northern ireland a 
british province said recently that talks could be considered only 
after the ira campaign ended 
outside the mansion house where irelands first legislature met 
in 1919 the armed campaign was denounced by members of the irish 
peace council and new consensus a group that was formed to protest 
ira bombings of the dublinbelfast railway line 
one percent is no consent said one placard referring to 
sinn feins share actually 12 percent in last summers 
elections in the republic of ireland 
within northern ireland sinn feins share of the vote has 
slipped from 134 percent in 1983 to 113 percent in 1989 it 
consisently runs behind the social democratic and labor party in 
competition for votes from the provinces roman catholic minority 
we need to consider why we are not as strong as we could be 
adams told the convention we have not done and are not doing 
sufficient political work 
the party was midway through a threeday debate on a political 
report that proposed a more active publicity effort to defeat 
black propaganda about republicanism and to emphasize to 
protestants that they would not be excluded from a united ireland 
it proposed to support divorce which is outlawed in the 
republic and is a sore point between protestants and catholics 
the report said the underlying cause of poverty unemployment 
and emigration is british imperialism and partition of our 
country 
party officials say they have been hurt by being banned from 
appearing on british tv and radio they are also banned in ireland 
but they admit that ira killings of innocent civilians have hurt 
since adams appeal last year the iras victims have included a 
20yearold woman killed when a bomb exploded prematurely a 
52yearold belfast man mistaken for someone else a 26yearold 
german wife of a british soldier and a 6monthold baby shot to 
death in the arms of her soldier father in west germany 
a week ago 16yearold charles love was fatally injured by a 
piece of stone dislodged by a bomb 500 yards away on the city wall 
of londonderry he was attending a march commemorating 13 people 
shot to death by the british army in 1972 during a civil rights 
march

masked gunmen bound and gagged unarmed 
guards early saturday at herculaneum a roman city destroyed when 
mount vesuvius erupted in 79 ad and stole hundreds of treasures 
news reports said 
baldassare conticello the superintendent of the archaeological 
areas of herculaneum and nearby pompeii said the inventory of the 
stolen goods was still incomplete the italian news agency agi 
reported

earrings a first century bronze vase in the form of a womans head 
and a 32inch silverandcopper inlaid bronze statue of bacchus he

watchmen at their station agi quoted investigators as saying the 
custodians were forced at gunpoint to turn over the keys to a 
building that houses hundreds of artifacts the news agency said 
it said the custodians were tied up and their mouths taped with 
bandages after a few hours one of the guards was able to free 
himself and sounded an alarm 
conticello said sale of the stolen goods would be difficult

the us supreme court will be asked to 
review this citys progress in desegregating its schools after the 
landmark 1954 brown vs board of education decision declaring 
segregated schools unconstitutional it was announced saturday 
board of education members told a news conference they will 
appeal a lower court ruling that held topeka schools were not 
sufficiently integrated 
the board decided to appeal because it felt the district was 
integrated and wanted to maintain local control of the school 
system said superintendent gary livingston 
children want the right to go to school where they live 
livingston said 
plaintiffs attorney richard jones said he was disappointed by 
the decision 
the supreme court ruled in 1954 that segregated schools deprived 
black children of equal educational opportunities and reinforced 
the concept that blacks were inferior 
a black railroad worker oliver brown had sued the school 
district because his daughter was not allowed to attend an 
allwhite school near their home 
the case was reopened in 1979 by the parents of 17 black 
schoolchildren who alleged the district had not desegregated 
schools 
us district judge richard rogers ruled against the plaintiffs 
in 1987 but was overruled by the 10th us circuit court of 
appeals 
the school board said it feared a court would order busing in 
the district if the appeals court ruling was not appealed 
i think thats a possibility said joe zima attorney for 
the board were not there yet but if we dont appeal it well 
be there

a teenage girl was in critical condition 
saturday after becoming the worlds first recipient of an implant 
consisting of a slender bundle of fibers that works like a lung in 
supplying oxygen to the body 
the 20inch device designed to give damaged lungs a chance to 
rest and recover before it is removed was implanted in a twohour 
operation friday at lds hospital one of four us centers approved 
for testing of the intravascular oxygenator 
this patient could live and the device could be useless dr 
alan morris the hospitals director of pulmonary research said at 
an afternoon news conference she could pass away and it could be 
a perfectly useful device 
morris emphasized that it was far too early to evaluate the 
devicess performance there is a grave risk of 
misrepresentation he said if the mechanism is seen as anything 
more than an experiment 
the ivox is not an artificial lung but could lead to development 
of such a device said its developer dr jd mortensen 
the family insisted that no details about the patient be made 
public but sources confirmed the recipient was a teenage girl 
with acute respiratory failure the salt lake tribune reported she 
is 16 
morris described the patient as a suffering individual whose 
privacy must be protected at all costs for research protocol and 
ethical reasons 
hospital spokesman richard nash said only that the patient was 
in critical condition the device was implanted by dr roger c 
millar 
although he assisted in the surgery mortensen would not discuss 
particulars of the implant which involved insertion of the device 
via the neck or groin into the inferior vena cava the large vein 
that brings blood to the heart 
two tubes the diameter of a soda straw are attached to the 
bundle and leave the body one delivers oyxgen to the body from a 
hospital oxygen system or tank the other removes carbon dioxide a 
waste product of breathing 
mortensen said the initial experiments will involve only 
patients with acute lung disease such as pneumonia or smoke 
inhalation not longterm chronic disorders such as cystic 
fibrosis or emphysema 
the only alternative for people with acute lung failure is an 
extracorporeal oxygenator a large machine that requires pumping 
the blood outside the body 
guidelines approved by the us food and drug administration in 
september limit the implants to seven days in people with acute 
respiratory failure who have little other chance of survival 
in patients with acute lung failure the natural lungs can 
recover in four to five days if given a chance to rest mortensen 
said if they do not recover by then they probably arent going 
to you have dead lungs 
the developer of the ivox cardiopulmonics inc of salt lake 
city announced jan 11 the device would be tested in 10 patients 
at lds hospital penn states hershey medical center the 
university of michigan medical center in ann arbor and the los 
angeles countyuniversity of southern california medical center 
several centers in europe and japan have applied to test the device 
mortensen said about eight of the 10 initial human recipients 
were expected to die from their illnesses 
mortensen said the ivox acts much like the natural membranes in 
the air sacs of the lungs the device is an inchwide bundle of 900 
to 1200 hollow fibers each about the thickness of a human hair 
the polypropylene fibers have porous walls the bundle is covered 
with a superthin plastic membrane 
as the ivox floats in the blood flowing through the vena cava 
oxygen passes through the fiber walls into the oxygenpoor blood 
meanwhile carbon dioxide passes from the blood through the fiber 
wall into the hollow fiber 
mortensen said the initial human experiments are to determine 
ivoxs safety not effectiveness 
these are extremely sick patients that have advanced lung 
disease whose lungs are unable to support life and are in the 
process of dying from their lung disease he said were trying 
to see if the device will cause further complications for the 
patient 
if it does not then the fda will release it for testing on 
healthier patients 
the ivox was made possible by membrane technology that allows 
much higher concentrations of oxygen through the tiny polypropylene 
tubes in animal tests lasting up to 19 days the ivox did not 
damage the blood or organs of 150 sheep and dogs 
lds hospital once named latterday saints hospital when it was 
owned by the mormon church is a few miles from the university of 
utah health sciences center where doctors in 1982 implanted the 
worlds first permanent artificial heart in a human

jury selection went faster than 
expected for the trial of joseph hazelwood the excaptain of the 
exxon valdez blamed for the nations worst oil spill clearing the 
way for opening arguments monday 
the 12 jurors and three alternates are to be sworn in monday for 
the criminal trial of hazelwood who was in command of the tanker 
when it struck a prince william sound reef last march and spilled 
nearly 11 million gallons of oil 
attorneys for hazelwood and the state had expected jury 
selection would take two weeks because of publicity about the 
accident that polluted pristine waters tarred shorelines killed 
wildlife and disrupted fishing 
but by lunchtime friday the fourth day of jury screening the 
court had a panel of 12 members from among 52 candidates questioned 
in hazelwoods criminal trial 
he faces a felony charge of criminal mischief and misdemeanor 
charges of reckless endangerment negligent discharge of oil and 
operating a vessel while intoxicated conviction on all charges 
could produce a maximum penalty of seven years three months in 
prison and 61000 in fines 
some prospective jurors were excused immediately after they said 
they held opinions about hazelwood others were eliminated after 
questioning which determined they could not set aside their 
conclusions about the case 
superior court judge karl johnstone said toward the end of the 
selection process that the number of candidates whose acceptability 
went unchallenged by attorneys was high of 44 people questioned 
27 were in that category he said 
although everyone questioned knew of the oil spill most said 
they had little or no opinion about it johnstone said he found 
that hard to believe but added that such statements made under 
oath had to be accepted as the truth 
the judge granted attorneys for both sides extra peremptory 
challenges that allowed them to rule out candidates without saying 
why 
hazelwood attorney dick madson said he needed additional 
challenges in part because two of the potential jurors were so 
familiar with the case they practically qualified as witnesses 
in granting the state an extra challenge johnstone said he 
detected an undercurrent of feeling by jurors that perhaps there 
are others who are responsible for this exxon valdez incident 
including the state 
district attorney brent cole had not used his extra challenge by 
the time the jury was chosen 
madson said the jury represents a good crosssection of the 
anchoragearea population occupations of jurors include mail 
carrier cook homemaker business executive engineer grocer 
real estate agent and childcare worker the trial that began with 
preliminary matters last monday and then moved into jury selection 
could last six weeks or more 
it originally was scheduled for october in valdez the port from 
which the tanker sailed just hours before the crash the trial was 
moved to anchorage in the interest of obtaining a fair proceeding 
although madson proposed fairbanks or palmer as better locations 
in deciding the venue johnstone said that if oliver north could 
get a fair trial despite the vast publicity his case received then 
hazelwood could get a fair proceeding in anchorage 
lawyers for hazelwood who was absent from the tankers bridge 
when the vessel ran aground are expected to argue that he left 
adequate instructions for crew members and cannot be held 
criminally responsible for their actions the states attorneys 
refused to discuss the case and cole has not revealed his plans

flagwaving crowds vied 
goodnaturedly in the streets of this capital as costa ricans got 
worked up for sundays presidential election a civic fiesta 
it is very satisfying to return to costa rica especially as 
an election observer said joao baena soares secretary general 
of the organization of american states 
baena soares arrived friday from neighboring nicaragua where 
the bitter and controversial election campaign sharply contrasts 
with costa ricas friendly democratic tradition 
rafael angel calderon of the social christian party was 
considered a slight favorite over carlos manuel castillo of the 
incumbent national liberation party the winner will take office on 
may 8 
five minor candidates together are expected to garner less than 
5 percent of the vote 
voters will also elect 57 national assembly delegates and 525 
mayors more than 80 percent of the nations 16 million registered 
voters are expected to cast ballots 
luis fishman a top calderon aide said saturday that the latest 
party poll indicated a substantial victory for his candidate while 
castillo said he would win by a slim 25000 votes 
by another of the many gentlemens agreements that rule costa 
rican politics no independent poll has been conducted since dec 
10 when calderon had a 5 percent lead with 20 percent undecided 
the candidates were clearly reluctant to speak ill of each other 
during the campaign although calderon brought up embarrassing ties 
to drug traffickers and castillo mentioned that calderon was born 
in nicaragua 
in the narcotics case a former national liberation president 
admitted accepting more than 100000 from an indicted drug 
trafficker the case was thought to have hurt castillo but fishman 
said calderons main advantage is simply that national liberation 
has won the last two elections 
no party has won three presidential elections in a row since 
1948 noted fishman costa ricans dont like to leave one party 
in power too long 
castillo partisans counter that the country has experienced 
eight years of good government under presidents luis alberto monge 
and oscar arias including a recovery from economic doldrums in the 
early 1980 
both major candidates support arias efforts to promote peace in 
central america efforts that won him the nobel peace prize he 
cannot run again however 
the social christian party appeared to be better organized and 
funded for getoutthevote efforts a national computer center was 
prepared to tell uncertain voters where their precincts were 
located 
also planned was a national youth poll in which children vote 
at local schools and go through exactly the same process as their 
elders in an exercise to reinforce their understanding of and 
commitment to democracy 
on saturday cars swept through the city bearing partisans of 
the major parties with the greenandwhite flags of national 
liberation or the redandblue of the social christians waving from 
windows 
every evening for the last week crowds have gathered on the 
streets to wave flags chant cheer and jeer with the weekend 
festivities lasting into the early morning hours

the angolan army saturday claimed its 
forces recaptured a strategic airstrip from usbacked rebels 
after bitter fighting in southeastern angola the portuguese news 
agency lusa reported 
lusa quoted an angolan army statement and said it was the first 
official admission of any military action near the mavinga 
airstrip the communique said the marxist governments troops were 
continuing punitive actions to the south of the town lusa 
reported 
in a dispatch from the angolan capital luanda lusa quoted the 
statement as saying government forces dislodged the bands of 
unita from mavinga friday evening 
the acronym stands for national union for the total independence 
of angola the rebel group 
mavingas airstrip is considered vital for control of the 
southeastern region and the key for any government attack on rebel 
headquarters at jamba more than 120 miles farther south toward the 
namibian border 
rebel leader jonas savimbi denied in a statement released in 
lisbon saturday that mavinga had fallen 
the situation is difficult but mavinga has not fallen into 
the hands of the mpla government forces and unita cannot at any 
price allow them to occupy mavinga savimbi said in the 
statement 
mpla or the popular movement for the liberation of angola is 
the party of president jose eduardo dos santos 
norberto de castro the rebels spokesman in lisbon said 
savimbi was directing operations in mavinga under heavy air 
bombardment savimbi cut short a fivenation european tour on 
tuesday to lead the fighting 
an estimated 10000 government soldiers began the drive on 
mavinga late in december 
washington has urged dos santos government to halt the attack 
and some us congressmen have proposed an increase in military aid 
to the rebels who reportedly already receive 50 million a year 
diplomats in luanda and lisbon say the government would likely 
use mavinga to pressure the rebels in a new round of direct peace 
talks rather than push the military offensive toward jamba 
a first round of negotiations that began after dos santos and 
savimbi agreed to a truce in june collapsed within weeks amid 
renewed fighting 
the rebels have been fighting for a powersharing agreement 
since angola gained independence from portugal in 1975 
they are demanding free elections but dos santos government is 
offering amnesty and integration of the rebels into a singleparty 
state

the government saturday declared the greek 
consul general in istanbul persona non grata and asked him to 
leave the country within a week in retaliation for athens 
expulsion of a turkish consul 
the turkish consul ordered to leave was in komotini a town in 
the greek region of western thrace troubled by ethnic unrest by the 
120000strong moslem minority there 
both sides gave a week for the departure of the turkish consul 
kemal gur and the greek diplomat elias klis 
the reprisal for komotini is istanbul turkish foreign 
minister mesut yilmaz was quoted as saying saturday 
greece said friday that the turkish consul was persona non 
grata for referring to the moslem minority as fellow 
countrymen turkey had said earlier that gurs phrase was 
misunderstood because of a translation difficulty 
a foreign ministry announcement on the issue said greeces 
decision to expel gur was unjust and without any sound basis and 
impossible to find reasonable 
the entire responsibility rests with greece for our decision 
which we took reluctantly and with regret it said 
racist attacks against the turkish minority in komotini will 
not be forgotten it added 
turkey insists the minority in western thrace is moslem and of 
turkish origin greece recognizes them only as a religious minority 
under the 1923 lausanne treaty ending a fouryear turkishgreek war 
the recent troubles began when a komotini court sentenced two 
local moslem politicians ahmet sadik and ibrahim sherif to 18 
months in prison each for using the forbidden turkish reference in 
their latest election campaign 
moslems protesting the sentences clashed with christians in 
komotini monday and scores of shops belonging to moslems were 
damaged 
two years ago greece and turkey longfeuding neighbors started 
a period of rapprochement when former premiers turgut ozal and 
andreas papandreou agreed to try to negotiate their disputes which 
center on deciding the future of the mediterranean island cyprus 
the island is divided into greek and turkish sectors 
turkish papers claimed saturday that the reconciliation had died 
after the recent developments

exhorted a crowd of more than 16000 to stop the killing as he 
spoke in the wake of a clash between local black muslims and 
authorities that left a man dead 
farrakhan called for creation of a civilian review board to 
investigate incidents like the jan 23 one between sheriffs 
deputies and muslims in which oliver beasley was shot to death 
sheriffs officials said beasley 27 was killed during a 
struggle for a deputys gun but farrakhan said beasley was 
executed 
i have talked to eyewitnesses theyve told me that oliver 
beasley was lying on the ground he was bleeding and the sheriffs 
deputy looked down on him and blew his brains out farrakhan said 
friday night at the los angeles sports arena 
our subject is stop the killing stop the killing said the 
national muslim leader from chicago theres so much disrespect 
for the single gift of life that it is sad in 1990 that someone has 
to come along and ask us to stop those who have delighted in 
killing us 
farrakhan who entered the arena to a standing ovation called 
on blacks to stop killing one another in violent streetgang 
battles 
why can we take the trigger and pull it at each other he 
asked we are killing ourselves in the name of life we are 
worshipers of death 
earlier friday the los angeles county coroners office released 
an autopsy report on beasley saying he died of a gunshot would to 
the head fired at pointblank range 
sheriffs lt frank merriman said that supported investigators 
contentions that beasley was killed as he tried to take a deputys 
gun away 
the incident following a routine traffic stop was the latest in 
a series of confrontations that has strained relations between the 
south sides black communities and law enforcement officials 
a 15foothigh picture of beasley hung behind the dias during 
farrakhans speech and beasleys family sat on stage 
in suggesting a police review board he recommended it include 
black white hispanic and american indian representatives 
if you do this youll save the city from eruption 
farrakhan said if you do not people will say enough is enough 
if we reach a point where we can tolerate this abuse no longer 
we will rise up against your authority and we would rather die 
than live like dogs under your roof 
security was tight more than 50 police officers were on hand 
and those entering the arena had to pass through metal detectors 
and submit to patdown searches by nation of islam members

a coast guard cutter that chased and fired on 
a cubanoperated freighter returned to port saturday and the 
skipper said he was too cautious in failing to stop the ship for a 
drug inspection 
the chincoteague tailed the 250foot hermann for 335 miles 
beginning early tuesday when the cutter spotted the ship about 120 
miles north of merida on mexicos yucatan peninsula 
the chase ended 26 hours later with the hermann escaping into 
mexican waters near tampico after being hit about 50 times with a 
volley of machinegun fire from the us ship 
cuban dictator fidel castro last week called the incident a 
grave provocation but the chincoteagues captain said he 
should have done more to stop the freighter 
i was probably too cautious i took too long said lt todd 
gentile commander of the 110foot cutter gentile said coast guard 
intelligence had told him the hermann was carrying more than six 
tons of cocaine 
cuban officials have said the hermann operated by the guamar 
shipping co of cuba but registered in panama carried 10 tons of 
chromium mexican officials who searched the freighter at the 
request of us officials said they found no drugs 
secretary of state james a baker iii called the us ships 
actions a legal law enforcement activity 
gentile said the intent was not to hurt any of the 12 crew 
members aboard the hermann but to stop the ship for a drug search 
no one aboard the hermann was injured 
at the news conference the coast guard released a videotape of 
the chase 
i will be firing across the bow of your vessel gentile is 
heard saying over a bullhorn it is not my intention to harm you 
you must stop your vessel immediately 
the videotape shows the chincoteague opening fire on the 
hermann with shots pelting the ships rudder and propeller area 
the videotape also shows crew members using large hoses to shoot 
water at the hermann in an attempt to flood its engine 
capt larry hyde commander of the chincoteagues mobilebased 
group said an initial review showed the cutters 16man crew acted 
properly 
jack odell a coast guard spokesman in washington previously 
said officials from the state department defense department and 
national security council held three meetings before giving 
permission to open fire 
gentile said he was told he could fire on the freighter until it 
was 15 miles off the coast of mexico 
we could have stopped the vessel if wed wanted to if we 
didnt have to worry about the saving of lives hyde said

armenian and azerbaijani negotiators emerging from 
their first talks saturday expressed hope for a peaceful settlement 
of their ethnic dispute but remained far apart on thorny 
territorial claims 
the representatives agreed to seek the release of all hostages 
by march 1 and to establish permanent relations between the 
azerbaijani popular front and the armenian national movement 
we have made the right first step sabit bagirov one of the 
two azerbaijani negotiators said after the talks in the latvian 
capital of riga 
there is a certain success we know each other better said 
ashot manucharian one of the three armenian negotiators 
the negotiators met for more than nine hours on friday and early 
saturday with mediators from the baltic council which groups 
leaders of the three peoples front movements in the western 
republics of latvia estonia and lithuania 
the azerbaijani and armenian teams later convened for their 
first facetoface talks without the baltic mediators in the 
writers union building in riga 
the talks continued into saturday evening rihard stankovs of 
the information center of the latvian peoples front said by 
telephone from riga he said he did not know what the two sides had 
discussed 
the talks held without the participation of the soviet 
government were called after about 17000 soviet troops were sent 
to the azerbaijani capital of baku to quell ethnic violence that 
erupted on jan 13 
at least 214 people have been killed in clashes in the past 
month and thousands of ethnic armenians were chased from their 
homes in azerbaijan ethnic violence over the past two years has 
created nearly 500000 refugees in both southern republics 
both sides agreed late last month to truces along the border 
between armenia and nakhichevan an azerbaijani territory bounded 
by armenia iran and turkey and along a tense battlefront on the 
armeniaazerbaijan border soviet media reported warring 
nationalists began pulling back from the borders last week the 
reports said 
both parties agreed before the peace talks not to raise the 
issue of nagornokarabakh the mostly armenian district located 
inside azerbaijan armenia wants to control the enclave azerbaijan 
refuses to surrender it 
but the issue dominated the first session of the talks which 
had been expected to focus on the presence of soviet troops in the 
two republics refugees and humanitarian issues 
despite efforts of the baltic mediators to bring the 
azerbaijanis and armenians closer together on territorial issues 
the two sides failed to reach any agreement on nagornokarabakh 
the armenians said that they wanted representatives of the 
armenian and azerbaijani communities in nagornokarabakh to join 
the talks the azerbaijanis have refused to negotiate with 
armenians from the region 
it was not easy latvian popular front leader dainis ivans 
one of the mediators told a news conference after the first 
session of talks sometimes we felt we were in the mountains 
baltic mediators are concerned about the precedent set by 
military intervention in the southern republics and fear more 
violence in the caucuses could threaten their own peaceful march 
toward independence and democracy 
in a joint communique issued after the first round of talks the 
azerbaijanis and the armenians agreed to exert all possible effort 
to settle the conflict in the caucuses in a peaceful manner 
the azerbaijanis and the armenians agreed to use their authority 
and influence to secure the release of hostages held by each side 
by march 1 and agreed to establish permanent relations between the 
azerbaijani popular front and the armenian national movement 
by feb 15 they agreed to try to determine the number of 
hostages held by each side 
both sides also agreed that the communique would be submitted 
for consideration to the leadership of their respective movements 
and would take effect only if approved by those bodies 
life remains difficult in both republics as a result of the 
conflict 
azerbaijani communist party chief ayaz mutalibov appealed to the 
population to put the tragedy behind and return to work in a speech 
to collective workers in baku on saturday the tass news agency 
reported 
no matter how deeply we grieve over what has happened we 
should work increasingly actively to return life into its normal 
channel and get involved in work mutalibov said 
the official soviet news agency tass said that 152 of 255 
factories in baku were working on friday 
police and army authorities continued confiscating weapons from 
the population especially since six children were seriously 
wounded when a bottle with a flammable mixture they had found 
exploded tass said 
two men were sentenced to nine and 10 years in a labor camp for 
resisting arrest when police found them in possession of firearms 
and explosives 
strikes continued in other major cities in azerbaijan the 
agency reported

author salman rushdie said nearly a year in 
hiding has been lonely with his only company people with guns 
his protectors 
rushdie went into hiding last feb 14 after the late ayatolluh 
khomeini of iran condemned him to death for his book the satanic 
verses which many moslems believe blasphemes islam 
in a telephone interview with newsweek magazine he said he 
originally didnt expect his seclusion to last more than a couple 
of weeks 
it was only gradually that i began to feel that the damage 
that had been done was so huge that it was going to take an awful 
lot of undoing rushdie said i think one of the problems of 
unleashing this quantity of hatred is that its very difficult to 
put it back in the box 
the interview is to appear in newsweeks feb 12 issue 
available on newsstands monday 
rushdie living under the protection of scotland yard said he 
fled with just the clothes on his back though he has since 
received books and personal belongings 
after initial weeks glued to a television set rushdie returned 
to writing book reviews but says that for three months he wrote 
little else except for some poems and a journal he then began 
writing a previously planned fable for children 
rushdie said hes lucky to be accustomed to spending long 
periods alone his days are spent mostly working he said he misses 
things like grocery shopping and going to movies 
i find myself watching a lot of bad television and videos 
he said and thats about it except that instead of being 
entirely by myself ive got a number of guests around people with 
guns 
hes learned to become chatty on the telephone noting that 
he can choose whom he calls though the chosen often need to be 
convinced its really him 
rushdie said his wife american novelist marianne wiggins who 
left their hiding place to return to public life in july has 
actually taken more of the weight of this than any other human 
being and in many ways still is 
rushdie said he feels a paperback edition of the satanic 
verses should be issued i see this as an innocent book 
wrongly accused and much persecuted he said 
he also said he has no intention of trying to change his 
identity 
i simply will not accept that this is going to be the rest of 
my life i have to remain an optimist in the sense of believing 
that solutions are possible

massive corrosion has weakened the 800mile 
transalaska pipeline prompting federal officials to investigate 
possible safety violations by the pipelines operators the los 
angeles times reported 
alyeska pipeline service co the oil industry consortium that 
operates the pipeline has begun making repairs to the crudeoil 
pipeline the times reported in sundays editions 
if left unchecked corrosion could eventually weaken the 
halfinchthick steel wall of the pipe which is pressurized and 
could rupture conceivably spawning an oil spill requiring a costly 
pipeline shutdown 
but alyeska officials maintain that the corrosion poses no 
immediate danger to its operations or to the environment the 
pipeline carries crude oil from alaskas north slope to valdez 
where the crude is transferred to tankers for shipment to 
refineries 
we have sufficient early warning in this case said bill 
howitt alyeskas manager for engineering we dont have pipeline 
integrity problems 
officials at the federal office of pipeline safety arent so 
sure 
the extent of it we dont know but its big enough that it 
could affect the integrity of the pipeline said jack overly the 
agencys western regional division chief 
alyeska may have violated federal safety regulations by failing 
to adequately maintain portions of its systems designed to retard 
corrosion according to agency staff reports 
the office of pipeline safety part of the department of 
transportation could decide by spring whether to cite alyeska for 
violating federal guidelines the newspaper said 
pipeline inspection reports show that safeguards against 
corrosion often were incomplete or faulty to begin with the times 
reported 
most of the corrosion was caused by the failure of a protective 
coating and tape wraps which many critics earlier had warned were 
flawed the newspaper said 
before pipeline operations began in 1977 preparations for 
laboratory tests of corrosion were set up at the national bureau of 
standards but those tests were never conducted the times said 
alyeska has said that repairs on weakened portions of the line 
can be completed without disrupting oil flow for more than 2 days 
over the next 18 months until repairs can be completed pressure 
in the line has been reduced by 20 percent in key locations 
the pipeline rehabilitation plan could cost operators 15 
billion over the next five years and under a complex formula used 
to determine royalties paid to alaska the state could lose 22 
million this year alone said alaska attorney general douglas b 
baily

the head of a plo faction on saturday said 
a ranking soviet official has assured the palestine liberation 
organization that jews leaving the soviet union will no longer be 
flown directly to israel 
the soviets assured us they would stop all direct flights 
between moscow and tel aviv said nayef hawatmeh 
secretarygeneral of the marxistoriented democratic front for the 
liberation of palestine after plo discussions with soviet deputy 
foreign minister gennady tarassov 
hawatmeh who spoke to reporters after a threeday meeting of 
the plos executive committee at its headquarters in tunis said 
direct flights are a method that leaves no other choice of 
destination for soviet jewish emigration candidates 
a stop in vienna austria he said by way of example would 
allow immigrants a freedom of choice to pick other countries in 
which to settle 
there was no immediate confirmation from tarassov who met in 
recent days with plo officials in the tunisian capital 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir indicated last month that 
israel needed to keep the occupied lands to settle an expected wave 
of immigrants which israel says may total 300000 in the next 
three years moscow broke diplomatic ties with israel over its 
occupation of arab territory in the 1967 middle east war 
in late january the head of a soviet diplomatic delegation 
visiting israel georgi martirosov blamed shamir for the delay in 
approving an agreement between aeroflot and israels el al airlines 
for regularly scheduled direct flights between the nations 
including transport of immigrants 
israel in october announced a preliminary agreement some such 
flights have occurred since then but were not regularly scheduled 
and only one carried immigrants 
last thursday azzam alahmed the palestinian ambassador to 
iraq said the plo will send a delegation to moscow soon to ask 
that jewish emigration to israelioccupied territories be 
restricted 
the 22nation arab league expressed concern at a meeting friday 
that sovietjewish immigration to israel will spill over to augment 
the illegal settlements in the occupied west bank and gaza 
strip 
hawatmeh also said the plo will not use guns in its strategy in 
the 2yearold uprising against israeli authority in the occupied 
lands he said protesters will continue to use rocks and firebombs 
the organization remains committed to its engagement not to 
use firearms in the occupied gaza strip or the west bank 
hawatmeh said 
our arm is the intefadeh uprising of the palestinian people 
who are following it in a peaceful way throwing stones and molotov 
cocktails he said 
hawatmeh said the executive committee had decided to call a 
meeting of the central council soon to examine the development of 
the mideast situation since the last central council meeting in 
october in baghdad iraq he did not disclose a date or a site for 
the meeting 
the 150member central council is the representative body 
between the executive committee and the palestine national council

american funds bought madeinindia general 
purpose utility vehicles for the opposition political party in 
nicaragua according to statements friday by angry lawmakers from 
auto industry districts 
the workers of our country whose taxes finance this assistance 
surely deserve more consideration said reps marcy kaptur 
dohio and jim jontz dind in a letter of protest to the 
organizations that handled part of the money appropriated for 
helping nicaragua hold fair elections 
kaptur represents toledo where chrysler corp makes jeeps and 
jontz represents kokomo ind where chrysler makes transmissions 
the entire aid package was 9 million of that 18 million 
went to the united nicaraguan opposition opposing nicaraguan 
president daniel ortega about 743000 was spent on cars trucks 
and fourwheeldrive vehicles said ken wollack executive vice 
president of the national democratic institute for international 
affairs 
a total of 93 vehicles was purchased including 50 indianmade 
utility vehicles 
wollack said his organization which is affiliated with the 
democratic party would have preferred to buy americanmade jeeps 
for nicaraguas opposition but with the election scheduled for 
feb 25 and grant agreements uncertain until last december there 
was no time to move usexported vehicles through all the required 
clearances 
the vehicles purchased were already in nicaragua waiting to 
clear customs wollack said 
because of the us trade embargo there were no american 
vehicles to be bought in nicaragua he said the only way to 
purchase the equipment and get it to nicaragua in time was to 
buy equipment already in nicaragua 
further complicating the politics of the utility vehicle 
purchase the us trade representative has cited india for unfair 
trading practices 
jontz said india requires 98 percent local content for autos to 
qualify as indianmade imported cars bear a 140 percent tariff and 
imported trucks are taxed at 190 percent 
it is ironic under these circumstances that american tax 
dollars are being used to purchase vehicles from india said the 
protest letter 
the lawmakers both of whom voted against the 9 million 
nicaraguan aid package wrote regardless of how one feels about 
the aid to begin with certainly this particular use of funds 
is most objectionable

more than 1000 southeast asians marched in a 
downtown park friday to protest government attacks on villages 
opposed to communist domination in laos and pressure the united 
states to intervene 
bundled in heavy coats and scarves hmong originally from the 
northern foothills of laos walked through 3 inches of fresh snow at 
ziedler park chanting us we need your help laos needs 
democracy 
they said many hmong in laos have been killed by bombs and 
chemical weapons in assaults launched recently by communist forces 
in vietnam and laos 
their animals have been killed their food has been destroyed 
they are without shelter they have no shovels to bury those that 
are killed and no medicine to treat those that are wounded 
demonstrator nao shoua xiong said 
he said hmong are the target of a brutal offensive which began 
after free lao a resistance movement declared a provisional 
government dec 5 free lao is dedicated to freeing laos from 
vietnamese domination and establishing a democracy in the country 
xiong said 
xiong 42 like many hmong was recruited to help the us 
military during the vietnam war he served as an interpreter then 
fled the country 15 years ago first on foot through thailand 
the vietnamese dont like us they want to exterminate all the 
people who fought against them in vietnam the lao government does 
what the vietnamese government tells them the vietnamese should 
withdraw from laos completely and let the laotians determine their 
future he said 
more than 16000 hmong who fled laos to escape communist 
persecution now reside in wisconsin officials said an additional 
14000 live in neighboring minnesota and 50000 in california 
less than a quarter of laos 38 million people are hmong 
xiong said hundreds of hmong villagers have been killed and many 
hundreds more poisoned and maimed in the northern and central 
provinces of laos 
the protesters called for international condemnation of the 
attacks and urged the united states to withhold funds from the 
laotian government designated for antidrug work and searches for 
us soldiers missing in action 
if the us government doesnt support us we have no where 
else to turn said 18yearold chee vang moua from milwaukee 
we have heard that a lot of people have died i dont think 
they should send the drug money until this is resolved said mai 
yong vang 22 a milwaukee nurse 
the demonstration was one of several planned for friday and 
saturday in many us cities including one outside the laotian 
embassy in washington 
according to a report issued wednesday by the republican task 
force on terrorism and unconventional warfare fighting in laos 
during january was aimed at destroying the civilian population in 
the mountainous northern region 
the report said the bombings by the vietnamese were endorsed by 
the laotian government and that the results of some attacks pointed 
to the use of chemical weapons

president bushs proposed budget could gut 
efforts to fight illegal drug trafficking along the usmexico 
border contrary to adminstration promises to step up law 
enforcement on the front lines area democrats contended friday 
the southwest borders four democratic senators said bushs 
budget seeks personnel reductions in three federal law enforcement 
agencies that could seriously affect their operations along the 
border 
bush released his budget monday four days after declaring the 
southwest border houston los angeles miami and new york city 
were high intensity drug trafficking areas eligible for 
hundreds of additional law enforcement agents and millions of 
dollars in additional federal aid 
but sen lloyd bentsen dtexas said the benefit of being 
targeted for more help has been undercut by the presidents budget 
which seeks reductions for the immigration and naturalization 
service the customs service and the bureau of alcohol tobacco 
and firearms 
according to bentsen and fellow sens alan cranston dcalif 
dennis deconcini dariz and jeff bingaman dnm a total of 
636 positions would be cut from customs 423 from the ins and 185 
from the atf the lead agency on the border for gang enforcement 
and firearms investigations 
the senators in a letter friday to william j bennett director 
of the office of national drug control policy ask his help in 
restoring these law enforcement positions to federal agencies 
which are this nations front line forces in the war on drugs 
we believe cuts of this magnitude will have a serious adverse 
impact on each of these agencies operations in the southwest 
the senators said 
the presidents new drug control strategy however recommends 
an additional 174 border patrol agents and 175 customs inspectors 
for the southwest border which the adminstration described as the 
principal corridor for moving drugs especially marijuana cocaine 
and heroin into the country

head up fractionally from 437 million last year and up 1 percent 
from 1988

a new device designed to detect plastic 
explosives in airplane luggage is deficient and probably could not 
have discovered the bomb which destroyed pan am flight 103 over 
lockerbie scotland members of a presidential terrorism commission 
said friday 
panelists at a hearing of the presidential commission on 
terrorism aviation security and terrorism sharply questioned plans 
by the federal aviation administration to require the airline 
industry to buy hundreds of the bomb detecting devices complaining 
that they have not been adequately tested 
but monte belger the faas associate administrator for aviation 
standards said he believes the sophisticated detection device is 
the best of its kind in the world has been adequately tested and 
should be deployed 
in a threehour hearing the commission also was told that the 
device which employs a technique called thermal neutron analysis 
or tna will cost far more than original estimates of between 
700000 to 1 million each 
belger said the first five tna machines actually will cost a 
total 15 million or about 25 million each because of the rush 
nature of the order 
a tna system an 18foot high 20000ton machine is at work 
inspecting baggage at kennedy international airport in new york a 
second system was installed at miami international airport last 
week and is being calibrated a third tna machine is to be 
installed at gatwick airport near london next month and site 
planning is under way to place one at washington dulles 
international airport 
i think there is a lot of flim flam going on said sen 
alphonse damato rny a commission member the tna looks good 
but it does not do what it is supposed to do congress has been 
sold a bill of goods 
there is a reduced ability to detect plastic explosives at the 
levels believed to have been used at lockerbie the senator said 
investigators believe the lockerbie crash on dec 21 1988 was 
caused by less than a pound of plastic explosives secreted inside a 
portable tape player the crash killed 259 people aboard the boeing 
747 aircraft and 11 people on the ground 
science magazine which first reported in august that the tna 
machines would not be able to detect a lockerbiesized bomb said 
the devices are being set at a sensitivity that will detect about 
25 pounds of explosives 
the tna machines use neutrons a type of subatomic particle 
to probe luggage for the presence of nitrogen a major component of 
explosives a problem with the tna system is that some types of 
fabric leather and such things as plastic ski boots can have 
nitrogen densities as high as explosives 
hadi bozorgmanesh vice president of science applications 
international corp also defended the device his company developed 
and said it has established a high success rate of detecting all 
sizes and designs of bombs he said an accusation that the tna 
machine cannot detect a bomb as small as two pounds is absolutely 
false 
we would like to get closer to 100 percent and to detect 
smaller amounts of explosives with better accuracy he said and 
added i totally agree that the system is not perfect but its 
far better than anything else that can be demonstrated 
he said the company is working to make the device smaller 
faster cheaper and more accurate 
damato said calibrating the tna device to detect a 
lockerbiesized bomb would set off so many false alarms that you 
would have a system which is inoperative 
belger said i am convinced the tna machine has been tested 
sufficiently for the us government to want to deploy it it is 
not perfect and we know it 
a vigorous drive is under way to identify and develop other 
technologies which will more efficiently detect bombs in luggage 
and breakthroughs are expected soon belger said 
in the meantime he said the safety of the traveling public 
demands that the tna machines be widely deployed 
commission member thomas c richards a retired air force 
general told belger it is your responsibility to prove the 
technology before you go to industry and tell them to buy a pig in 
a poke 
belger replied it would be a mistake not to continue to 
deploy it it is wrong to wait for the perfect machine 
representatives of airport operators also expressed objections 
to the tna device 
siegbert b poritsky vice president of the airport operators 
council international said the faas requirement that explosive 
detection systems be installed at major airports is causing more 
confusion than security 
as a result the only approved equipment to date tna is too 
slow and large to accommodate in a manner which will do the most 
good too heavy for most airport terminal floors and has a 
substantial false alarm rate which causes long delays in baggage 
screening and causes personnel to be complacent in responding to 
alarms he said

flames shooting from an engine forced a 
northwest airlines dc10 to return to los angeles airport early 
friday but the 99 passengers and ninemember crew were uninjured 
northwest spokesman bob gibbons said the flames in the left 
engine were caused by a compressor stall a problem that can occur 
when the even flow of air to the engine turbine blades is 
interrupted causing too much jet fuel to accumulate 
a dc10 has three engines but can safely land on two said rich 
tornquist federal aviation administration regional duty officer 
northwest spokesman kevin whalen said flight 84 arrived in los 
angeles from honolulu mechanics examined the engine and repaired 
the problem he said 
the minneapolisbound passengers went to a nearby hotel to rest 
after the landing at 220 am and then boarded a later flight

hungary said the soviet union agreed to 
continue work on a timetable for removing all 50000 soviet troops 
from the country during an initial twoday session that ended 
friday 
in the course of the talks the sides set forth their position 
and agreed that the withdrawal of soviet troops will be carried out 
on the basis of an intergovernmental agreement to be concluded 
within the shortest possible time the foreign ministry said in a 
communique 
the communique carried by the official mti news agency said no 
date was set for a second round of talks but that two sides had 
agreed to continue efforts at working out the timetable for the 
pullout 
there was no immediate soviet comment 
the talks were the second of their kind in eastern europe since 
a wave of democratization last year started loosening the soviet 
grip over its warsaw pact allies 
the first held in prague on withdrawing troops from 
czechoslovakia ended inconclusively early this month a second 
round is set for next week 
the head of the hungarian delegation and secretary of state in 
the foreign ministry ferenc somogyi said thursday night that his 
country is seeking a withdrawal by the end of the year or early 
1991 
the hungarian communique said the talks with the soviet 
delegation led by soviet deputy foreign minister ivan aboimov 
were held in an objective constructive atmosphere 
the estimated 50000 soviet troops in hungary and 70000 in 
czechoslovakia are stationed on the basis of temporary 
agreements the kremlin reached with the two countries after 
quashing a revolt against stalinism in 1956 in hungary and reforms 
in czechoslovakia in 1968 
the new leaderships of the east bloc have echoed calls for troop 
withdrawals in poland solidarity leader lech walesa made the 
appeal to the soviet ambassador although the noncommunistled 
government has not started negotiations 
moscow began reducing its troop presence in hungary last april 
as part of soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs program of 
cutting 50000 soldiers from the red army in eastern europe

authorities on friday began checking 
whether the states suspended revenue director altered or destroyed 
any documents related to an investigation against her 
florida department of law enforcement inspectors interviewed 
department of revenue employees friday about a scrap of paper found 
on the desk of director katie tucker and visits she made to her 
office two at night 
the night visits prompted brian ballard director of operations 
for gov bob martinez to have the locks changed on department 
doors thursday 
from now on whenever she goes over there shes going to have 
an escort ballard said either officials from a cabinet agency 
or the florida department of law enforcement will accompany her 
inspectors confiscated 10 to 20 documents and a typewriter from 
tuckers office said jere moore spokesman for the department of 
revenue 
they took the files they thought were appropriate for their 
inquiry moore said 
the latest investigation came after sam alexander the assistant 
director of the department was shown a scrap of paper bearing his 
initials that had apparently been cut up alexander said friday 
that another employee found the scrap on ms tuckers desk and 
brought it to him 
ms tucker is serving a 10day suspension with pay ordered by 
martinez and the cabinet because of a 1988 tax investigation of 
tallahassee businesman donald g resha a political rival of ms 
tuckers husband 
martinez has called for her resignation from the appointed 
position 
there was no answer at ms tuckers home on friday but when 
contacted by the st petersburg times on thursday she said this 
is crazy 
it is a thirddegree felony to alter public documents under 
florida law 
ms tucker has visited the office several times to look through 
documents to back up her contention that the tax probe was part of 
a sweep of video stores like those owned by resha said moore the 
revenue department spokesman 
resha unsuccessully ran against her husband daniel miller for 
state aflcio presidency in 1985 
alexander took the paper to cabinet officials thursday he said 
he was concerned the paper could be used to superimpose his name on 
possibly forged documents using a copy machine 
thats one of the things the fdle is looking into whether 
there were documents destroyed or altered said alexander who 
was interviewed by investigators thursday 
he said ms tucker told aides thursday she had found a document 
expressing her concern that the probe was centered on resha such a 
document would back her claims that she never intended resha to be 
the sole target 
previous fdle reports have found nothing to indicate such a 
sweep was conducted saying resha alone was targeted for the tax 
investigation on ms tuckers orders 
she has said she will decide by monday whether to step down or 
face the governor and cabinet at its meeting tuesday 
she also faces a 4 million defamation lawsuit filed thursday by 
resha in leon circuit court

prime minister yitzhak shamir said friday he 
will demand a vote of confidence from his rightwing likud bloc 
because of a barrage of criticism by hawkish party rivals who 
oppose his peace moves 
the likud power struggle which has halted middle east peace 
efforts has increased in intensity daily with shamir and his 
allies trading barbs and trying to outmaneuver each other before 
next weeks central committee party meeting 
for too long i have been insulted by slanderous and attacking 
voices from within my own movement shamir said on israel 
television this is not a normal phenomenon 
because of this i believe that the central committee must 
adopt a decision on confidence in the prime minister and the head 
of the movement 
the showdown will take place next week when shamir hopes to get 
a single vote of confidence from the 3200 committee members for 
his leadership and for his plan calling for elections in the 
occupied territories as a first step toward peace 
the party rebels led by central committee chairman and trade 
minister ariel sharon demand that likud members instead vote on 
separate motions on the plans details such as barring 
palestinians from arab east jerusalem from voting in the elections 
shamir aides said they fear sharons voting procedure would 
place unnecessary constraints on shamir in his peace negotiations 
with the united states and egypt that are expected to lead to the 
elections 
shamir wants a vote of confidence he wants to prove that the 
majority stands behind him and wants to be able to maneuver freely 
in the diplomatic arena said the likud official speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
shamir has threatened to resign if he does not win the support 
of the central committee 
if the central committee does not accept my ways and does not 
accept my recommendations and does not give me its full faith i 
will have to draw conclusions shamir said 
sharon aides could not be reached for comment friday but the 
trade minister and his allies have daily heaped insults on the 
prime minister he has been called a rotten apple a complete 
failure and a conman 
in one instance sharon accused foreign minister moshe arens a 
shamir ally of avoiding battle during israels 1948 war of 
independence arens denied the allegations 
when asked to respond to sharons insults in fridays television 
interview shamir said he talks too much 
the innerparty battle has been waged for two weeks halting any 
movement in the peace process because washington has become 
convinced there is no point in pushing ahead until shamir has 
reestablished his leadership 
the confrontation further escalated thursday when shamir sent 
out invitations for the feb 7 central committee meeting that

erich honeckers doctor and lawyer both 
contended friday that criminal interrogation of the ousted east 
german communist leader was endangering his life 
the oncepowerful 77yearold honecker was judged this week to 
be too ill to withstand imprisonment and was freed from an east 
berlin jail after about 36 hours detention 
honecker is to be tried next month on a charge of high treason

wolfgang vogel and dr friedrich wolff protested the interrogation 
of their client 
vogel said criminal investigators questioned honecker friday 
morning in preparation for the trial against him 
this unannounced investigation session and the previous 
imprisonment contrary to doctors advice has led to a worsening of 
his health condition in the view of dr peter althaus adn 
quoted vogel and wolff as saying in their written statement 
althaus was the surgeon who operated on honecker jan 8 to 
remove a malignant kidney tumor 
vogel and wolff said investigators were aware of the influence 
their questioning was having on honecker 
dr peter althaus believes that police interrogation at this 
time could endanger the patients life they stated 
lutheran church officials have taken in honecker and his wife 
margot as the honeckers were stripped of their former residences 
and are in effect homeless 
honecker was released from east berlins charite hospital on 
monday and was immediately arrested

joining the un food and agricultural organization could benefit 
the soviet unions economic reforms especially in farming 
eight soviets arrived in rome on thursday for meetings with fao

delegation leader konstantin p ovchinnikov told reporters friday 
our goal is to raise the economic sufficiency of our country 
ovchinnikov deputy director of the foreign ministrys 
department of international economic organizations said membership 
in fao would mean access to the agencys technical assistance as 
well as scientific knowhow 
ovchinnikov an economist said the fao could profit from soviet 
expertise and the soviets could benefit from membership in the 
agency 
he said faos statistical and other scientific methods could 
prove valuable in reforming the soviet economy other benefits 
could come in biotechnology lifestock and botany he said 
ovchinnikov said any actual fao aid projects in the soviet union 
would be very modest 
moscow is not seeking to divert financial resources from 
fao he said 
as a founder of fao in 1945 the soviet union does not have to 
seek formal approval of member status fao directorgeneral edouard 
saouma has welcomed the prospect of soviet membership the soviet 
union currently has observer status

a swiss company agreed friday 
to buy 60 percent of genentech inc one of this countrys leading 
biotechnology companies 
roche holding ltd a large swiss pharmaceutical company said 
it had agreed to invest 492 million in genentech and buy half its 
outstanding stock for 36 a share 65 percent higher than 
thursdays closing stock price 
other features of the transaction which has a total value of 
21 billion would give roche 60 percent of genentechs stock the 
swiss company would have the option to buy the rest of genentechs 
stock for higher prices over the next five years 
the deal was approved by the genentech board friday and will be 
submitted to the shareholders for approval in april the companies 
said 
genentech founded in the mid1970s as one of the first

most of its revenue from two products a genetically engineered 
heart drug called activase and a human growth hormon sold as

analysts suggested roche was seeking a bigger foothold in the 
us market and that the infusion of cash would enable genentech 
to expand its efforts

consulting company hambrecht amp quist in san francisco said roche 
clearly bought the most aggressive product development company in 
the industry 
denise gilbert an analyst who follows the company for

get the money and market influence to begin trying to buy the 
rights to develop or market drugs developed by other biotechnology 
companies 
genentech now is in a very good market position and many of 
the other biotech companies including roche itself which found 
they had niches to themselves may find genentech as a competitor 
gilbert said

washington state is seeking clarification from 
the federal government on whether the state can kill some sea lions 
that annually devastate a run of seagoing trout officials said 
friday 
while the state waits for an answer it plans to truck the worst 
offenders to their california breeding grounds and harass the 
remainder with firecrackers and rubbertipped arrows among other 
devices 
as many as 40 sea lions have gathered annually near the ballard 
locks for the last eight years to dine on the wild steelhead that 
must negotiate a fish ladder there on their spawning migration from 
puget sound to inland streams 
the sea lions werent considered a problem until 1985 when they 
caught 30 percent of the wild fish run last year they ate an 
estimated 65 percent of the run allowing just 687 fish out of a 
run of 1973 to pass the fish ladder 
at that rate the run would be extinct within a decade curt 
smitch director of the state department of wildlife said friday 
this year officials hope 816 of 2093 fish will survive to 
spawn 
the sea lions are protected under the federal marine mammal 
protection act the steelhead are protected under state not 
federal law 
within a month federal authorities will begin gathering public 
comment on whether the marine mammal act allows killing protected 
animals in cases where they are destroying other wildlife rolland 
schmitten northwest regional director of the national marine 
fisheries service said friday 
washington state had asked the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration which enforces the act for the ruling last fall 
the public comment period should last between 60 and 90 days and 
a federal ruling on the question should be made by years end in 
time for next years steelhead run schmitten said

north korea said friday that the united 
states encouraged south korea politically and financially to build 
a concrete wall to bar free travel between the two koreas and 
perpetuate national division 
at the 454th military armistice commission meeting north korean 
army maj gen choe ui ung showed a videotape and photographs he 
said proved the wall existed he demanded it be pulled down 
without delay to ensure free travel and open doors fullscale 
south korea says the wall is actually a series of cement tank 
traps and bunkers 
us navy rear adm larry g vogt chief united nations command 
delegate to the armistice commission refused to discuss the issue 
saying the structure was built outside the demilitarized zone and 
not within the scope of the commission 
at the twohour meeting in this truce village vogt said the 
north was trying to mislead the world public into thinking that 
the south is solely responsible for a lack of free travel across 
the border he said the north should take its grievances up 
directly with south korea 
choe said the barrier was erected south of the 150milelong 
military demarcation line at us instigation he said washington 
gave massive funds to seoul in 1978 and 1979 to finance its 
construction to prolong korean division and block unification of 
the two koreas split since 1945 
the demarcation line divides the 2milewide dmz into the 
communistcontrolled northern side and un commissioncontrolled 
southern side 
vogt showed a videotape of alleged north korean barriers some 
of which he said were built inside the dmz in violation of the 
korean armistice agreement which ended the korean war in 1953 choe 
did not comment 
vogt proposed that a joint observer team should visit both sides 
to settle the dispute

they swallow deadly drugs plunge out of 
windows smash their cars and hang or shoot themselves at an 
alarming rate and they do it because suicide seems better than the 
alternative dying of aids 
you have no control over this illness at all so it gives me 
some kind of control when i can say i can end my life any time i 
want to said chuck sporeman a 43yearold nurse who has aids 
sporeman tried to kill himself twice in december 1988 two 
months after his male companion of 13 years died of aids he said 
he might try again when the disease leaves him unable to care for 
himself but participation in a support group helps at least for 
now 
there are days where i wish i had done it but there are other 
days when its a beautiful day the wind is blowing through the 
trees i can go watch the waves crashing on the beach and im glad 
i didnt do it he said 
the author of a 1988 cornell university study estimates about 
1000 aids patients in the united states will kill themselves by 
1991 the study found people with aids are 66 times more likely to 
commit suicide than the general population 
it definitely happens all the time said andrew weisser 
spokesman for aids project los angeles a service agency where five 
of 2100 aidsinfected clients killed themselves in december 
the relatively small number of aidsrelated suicides reported 
publicly is just the tip of the iceberg weisser said 
theres no way for us to keep track said los angeles county 
coroners spokesman bob dambacher if someone comes off a 
building we dont know if they have aids if they shoot 
themselves we dont know 
such suicides graphically illustrate that mental health budget 
cuts and discrimination leave many aids patients without adequate 
counseling weisser asserts many aids patients who discuss suicide 
are calling out for help he said but hopelessness makes 
others kill themselves 
a 28yearold aids patient in san diego drank all day stole a 
car swerved down the highway without headlights then triggered a 
sixcar accident that killed him and injured three others in april 
1988 paul james curry was dying slow i think he chose to die 
fast a friend said 
two men who authorities said had aids tied themselves together 
then jumped 35 floors off their new york apartment building in 1985 
philip saylor 40 took a revolver into los angeles 
cedarssinai medical center on jan 2 shot and killed his longtime 
companion 35yearold aids patient steven jenkins then killed 
himself police said saylor also was infected by the aids virus 
after that tragedy several experts said suicide can be a 
reasonable alternative if aids patients are thinking clearly and 
fully informed of all options 
people have a right to kill themselves not early on when 
people first find theyre infected but when they have become 
sufficiently sick that the quality of their life is not 
satisfactory to them said dr neal schram a member of the 
california medical associations aids task force 
rabbi allen freehling a member of the los angeles county 
commission on aids advises aids patients against killing 
themselves saying suicide is a selfish act that can compound the 
grief of family and friends 
in ecclesiastes it says there is a time to live and a time to 
die and i dont think the author of that statement meant we should 
decide when that time is freehling said 
a cornell university study published this month found that 
people who have just learned they are infected by the aids virus 
but dont yet have symptoms are no more likely than other people to 
have suicidal thoughts if they receive proper counseling 
dr peter marzuk author of the earlier cornell study found 
patients face the greatest risks just after they are diagnosed and 
again when aids effects on the brain cause depression delirium or 
other treatable psychiatric disorders 
if you treat the depression frequently these people will feel 
better and not feel driven to suicide said dr geoffrey 
newstadt a cedarssinai psychiatrist 
marzuks study published in the journal of the american medical 
association in 1988 found 12 suicides among 3828 aids patients in 
new york city in 1985 he called it striking that three of them 
jumped from hospital windows an act repeated in 1986 by aids 
patients at hospitals in eureka calif and dallas a cedarssinai 
aids patient jumped to his death a year ago newstadt said 
two other suicides in marzuks study had lovers who earlier died 
from aids which newstadt said can spur the depression that leads 
to suicide 
sporeman said he took care of his companion for the last year 
and a half of his life and when he died i being ill saw no 
reason to go on after the funeral everybody goes back to 
their lives and youre left all alone 
a study similar to marzuks found california men with aids are 
up to 21 times more likely than other men to kill themselves the 
study conducted by californias department of health services 
counted 13 aidsrelated suicides in 1986 
marzuk wrote that many aidsrelated suicides go uncounted 
because some people kill themselves without revealing they have the 
disease while others might be cloaked as overdoses of prescribed 
medications or illicit drugs 
sporeman tried to inject a fatal air bubble and overdose of 
medicine in his first failed suicide attempt days later he 
swallowed valium and percodan pills and downed alcohol as he walked 
around his house writing a will a friend walked in and stopped him 
before he could swallow a fatal amount 
schram said it still is more common for aids patients to refuse 
heroic medical treatment to let themselves die than to commit 
suicide 
there is a very thin line between maintaining a life and 
taking a life freehling said that line can be hard to define 
especially when aids patients often recover from repeated 
infections before they die 
some aids patients ask friends or lovers to help them commit 
suicide 
in august john cleaves 43 of san diego was sentenced to 15 
years to life in prison after being convicted of seconddegree 
murder for strangling dennis eaton 40 cleaves contended he helped 
eaton commit suicide 
the development of azt and other lifeextending drugs may change 
the way aids is viewed from a fatal disease to a manageable 
chronic disease like some cancers that could lower suicide 
rates schram said 
aids patients have a right to decide to commit suicide newstadt 
said but the problem is whether they have all of the information 
available to them about treatment possibilities 
of suicide sporeman said before the virus hits my brain or 
im unable to do things for myself i want to be able to do it i 
still have a plan to do it even if i dont do it i feel i got 
control over the disease because i can say stop

a cold windswept plain in tibet populated with 
scores of birds plants and animals found nowhere else on earth has 
been proposed as the worlds largest nature reserve 
the chang tang reserve named from the tibetan words for 
northern plain would encompass an area the size of california 
the proposed territory covers onesixth of the tibet autonomous 
region and adjoining parts of the chinese provinces of qinghai and 
xinjiang said george schaller an american biologist who has 
explored the region and helped negotiate an agreement signed just 
days ago 
its one of the last almost unexplored places on the face of 
the earth said schaller of wildlife conservation international 
in new york it survives intact almost as it was 100 years ago 
schaller one of the worlds leading wildlife biologists has 
done pioneering studies on gorillas pandas snow leopards and 
other endangered animals 
he is one of the very few westerners to have entered the chang 
tang region few local people have been there either despite its 
size it has a human population of no more than several hundred 
wandering herdsmen who live there for only a few months each year 
when he returned from chang tang in late january he brought 
with him an agreement with the tibetan environmental protection 
agency that outlines the steps to be taken to establish the reserve 
an area of 100000 square miles about the size of colorado 
will be set aside in tibet the tibetan epa will coordinate the 
effort with funds from wildlife conservation international and 
tibetan and national agencies proposed additions in adjoining 
provinces would bring the size of the reserve to about 150000 
square miles an area the size of california 
we want to in the next few years find out whats there and 
the areas of particular importance schaller said he plans to 
return in july the research will be conducted with the tibet 
institute of plateau biology 
the agreement calls the area a unique animal and plant 
community which includes such spectacular creatures as wild yak 
tibetan wild ass tibetan wild sheep tibetan gazelle tibetan 
antelope and tibetan brown bear all of which occur only on the 
tibetan plateau 
when asked to describe the region he paused searching for 
comparisons to convey the vastness and austere beauty of an area 
unlike any other 
it has the aura of the serengeti in east africa he said 
you travel and travel toward a distant horizon and the world 
seems to expand in front of you 
the reserve is a highaltitude steppe at an elevation of about 3 
miles it is covered with scrub grasses no more than 6 inches high 
lakes too salty to drink from and jagged inhospitable mountains 
winter temperatures can drop to 40 or 50 degrees below zero 
snow can fall any day of the year and the winds schaller 
said oh how the winds can howl across there 
four hundred species of plants have been found on the plateau 
along with 60 species of birds wild yak gather in herds of 100 or 
150 its a real desert area but it has oases around which 
animals congregate by the thousands he said 
access to the reserve is normally by way of lhasa the tibetan 
capital a weeks drive south of the proposed reserve ive gone 
in from the north by camel caravan but you cross such desolate 
country its difficult schaller said 
the trip from lhasa isnt a simple excursion either you need 
two cars and a truck to carry gas he said because of the need 
to carry gas expeditions normally last no more than three months 
he said 
my preference would be to just have a herd of yak animals and 
live in there for a few years he said but politically thats 
not feasible schaller is willing but most of the local people 
have families and they dont want to be out he said 
in an area so remote is the establishment of a nature reserve 
really necessary 
there is no such thing as a remote area any more schaller 
said its known there are minerals there near there oil has 
been discovered 
recalling the bison that once roamed the american plains in 
uncounted numbers he said they destroyed the bison in 15 
years

corporate titans and government officials cringe 
before them 
these two wall street companies are far from household names 
but when they flex their muscles they can influence businesses to 
sell divisions lay off employees or slash spending 
the companies are the two major creditrating agencies moodys 
investors service inc and standard amp poors corp several recent 
events again have demonstrated their power over corporate america 
because a credit rating affects the rate of interest a company 
must pay to borrow money it is a powerful weapon by threatening 
to lower a companys rating moodys and sampp can influence it to 
take steps to strengthen its finances 
moodys and sampp have a similar influence over state and local 
governments that issue bonds and when a government has to pay more 
interest it may be forced to increase taxes or cut services 
recently moodys showed its strength by persuading shearson 
lehman hutton inc to restructure its operations 
shearson threatened with a rating downgrade announced it would 
raise about 850 million through private stock placements to 
bolster its finances the brokerage also sold a financial 
counseling subsidiary to american express co shearsons largest 
stockholder netting 56 million 
the power of the creditrating agencies was shown more 
graphically late last month when moodys downgraded its rating of 
debt issues of rjr nabisco the food and cigarette giant taken 
private in a record 2453 billion buyout last year in addition 
moodys assigned a lowerthanexpected rating to an upcoming 125 
billion rjr nabisco bond issue 
moodys action sent rjr nabiscos junk bonds into a tailspin 
reducing the market price of some issues by 10 percent it also 
rattled the entire highyield bond market and briefly depressed 
stock prices 
harold goldberg chairman of moodys corporate rating committee 
said the company does not consider the potential market impact of a 
ratings change but he said it is not oblivious to that factor 
our role in the marketplace is that of an independent provider 
of credit opinions he said if we were to withhold information 
that we think is relative we would be abusing our role 
the market reaction to ratings changes usually is predictable 
goldberg said however with rjr nabisco we did not expect the 
impact on the markets we saw 
marshall blume a professor of finance at the university of 
pennsylvanias wharton school said the impact of a ratings change 
depends on whether it is anticipated by the markets 
many changes are expected based on information a company has 
disclosed publicly so the price of its bonds already reflect the 
expected upgrade or downgrade he said but changes that come out 
of the blue pack the wallop of the rjr nabisco move 
companies pay the ratings agencies to judge their securities 
they also provide the agencies confidential information on their 
finances and business projections 
when moodys has concerns about a company it rates it notifies 
it and asks what its plans to do about it goldberg said once the 
company responds we would give them feedback 
i dont call that a negotiating process myself but rather an 
interchange of information he said its based on mutual 
trust 
once a ratings decision is made it is released to the company 
and public simultaneously he said goldberg said there is no 
appeal process but that all ratings are continuously reevaluated 
goldberg said moodys is aware of its influence in the 
marketplace 
we wouldnt be providing these opinions if we had no 
influence he said he said the ratings process has been 
tested its been relied upon and its quite material to the total 
capital formation process we take this role quite seriously 
goldberg said the two major ratings agencies are not a monopoly 
major buyers of securities and brokerages have their own inhouse 
ratings systems he said in addition several smaller rating 
agencies provide competition 
also he said ratings are just one factor that determines the 
price and market for securities 
the treasurer of a major corporation who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said his company often disagrees with ratings agencies 
over facts and interpretations of his companys finances he said 
the agencies are not always open to such discussions and that some 
appear arrogant about their role 
the function that they perform performed right is a useful 
one he said i get a little concerned about the fact that 
somebody who doesnt know your business very well can have that 
much power over it 
blume said the ratings agencies are kept in line by the need to 
maintain their reputations 
if they were to abuse their power they would no longer be 
credible he said theyre not capricious 
still they are not spared criticism the wall street journal 
editorialized last year that the agencies were asleep while the 
finances of massachusetts crumbled 
the journal said the credit agencies failed to give investors in 
massachusetts bonds advance warning of the states impending 
financial crisis which eventually resulted in a drastic lowering 
of its bond rating the journal cited similar delays in foretelling 
the doom at the washington public power supply system whose 
default on 225 billion in bonds in 1983 was the largest in 
municipal bond history 
the journal said the credit agencies suffer from a fundamental 
conceit that they are smarter than the marketplace

after welcoming the decade in high style with 
the dow jones industrials hitting a record the stock market 
sputtered and ended the month with hardly a benefit from the 
socalled january effect 
except for the first and last trading days and a few sessions in 
between cashrich institutional investors who sold stocks last 
year for tax purposes did not put their money back to work on wall 
street as in many januarys past 
disappointing corporate profits rising interest rates and 
uncertainty about the federal reserves credit policy were some of 
the reasons investors apparently decided to sit it out 
we ended the year thinking a soft landing was a guaranteed 
phenomenon followed by the fed easing and lower interest rates 
said alfred e goldman vice president for ag edwards amp sons inc 
in st louis 
instead data suggested the economy was weakening further and 
the feds ability to loosen credit was slowed by concern about the 
dollar and keeping it competitive against other currencies said 
goldman 
the january effect we had two days of it in december 
goldman said january basically turned into a disaster one of 
the worst on record 
in fact some wall streeters said the january effect wasoffset 
by the japanese effect the ability of the japanese market to 
influence if not decide the outcome of the us market 
us stocks virtually duplicated a downturn on the tokyo 
exchange the first clear indication that tokyo may now be calling 
the tune in new york standard amp poors economists wrote in their 
jan 31 edition of the outlook 
the bank of japan raised its discount rate the interest it 
charges for loans to commercial banks four times in late 1989 to 
cool the local economy and curtail inflation that shook the 
japanese stock and bond markets and sent tremors all the way to 
wall street 
economist edward yardeni with prudentialbache securities inc 
said the japanese interest rate hike undoubtedly contributed to the 
slump in the us stock market 
our market was vulnerable because in the last year bullish 
props had fallen apart yardeni said 
those props ranged from a slump in the takeover speculation 
buoying stocks to a realization that corporate profits are weak 
yardeni said 
although investor concerns about the business outlook were felt 
in the stock markets last sessions in january the market ended 
the month and started february on a slightly more upbeat note 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials showed a net gain for 
the week of 4347 points closing at 260270 still thats more 
than 200 points lower than where it began in january 
among broader averages the new york stock exchange composite 
index was 254 higher than the previous week ending at 18275 the 
nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market edged up 
088 to 42221 and the american stock exchange market value index 
gained 269 to 35356 
however the gains came on lighter volume as many big 
institutional investors remained cautious and noncommital 
big board volume averaged 16909 million shares a day down from 
an average 18119 million the week before 
the japan markets impact on us trading reflects an integrated 
global marketplace and does not necessarily suggest that us 
markets are now taking their cue from japan some analysts say 
sometime ago the tokyo market seemed to follow the us 
market now everybody is watching everybody else said theodore 
tung senior vice president with national city corp in cleveland 
its very much a mutual effect its hard to say that one is 
determining the other 
despite the external influences january effect is viewed by 
some as an indicator of how the rest of the year will stack up 
historically if the market in general and small stocks in 
particular do well in the early stages of the year as the effect 
suggests the rest of the year will go well 
yale hirsch an old tappan nj investment adviser and 
publisher of the annual stock traders almanac says the direction 
stock prices take in january has foreshadowed the full years 
outcome correctly all but three times since 1950 
while many wall streeters might not place much faith in the 
january effect its record over the years gives some people pause 
to consider on the other hand in the 23 years that the super bowl 
has been played a victory by a team from the original nfl has 
always been followed by an up year for stock prices 
if the rest of the year rest of year is going to go the way 
january went i feel very bad said hugh johnson senior vice 
president for first albany corp on the other hand if it follows 
the super bowl effect then it should go very well

the announced departures of shearson lehman 
hutton inc chairman peter cohen and new york stock exchange 
chairman john phelan seemed to parallel their extracurricular 
pastimes 
skiing enthusiast cohen raced downhill and crashed phelan is 
sailing into the sunset 
both men had in many ways come to symbolize the most turbulent 
times in wall street history their prominence was partly due to 
the great rise and then crash of the bull market and the securities 
industrys struggle to readjust 
their decisions to leave both announced this past week brought 
two very different stories to a coincidental close 
cohen 43 piloted shearson through an enormous expansion that 
made it the secondlargest us investment bank behind merrill 
lynch amp co much of the growth stemmed from its 1 billion 
acquisition of ef hutton group inc the sickly brokerage that 
practically collapsed after the 1987 crash 
the hutton purchase gave cohen his first prolonged public 
exposure once considered a shy workaholic with a penchant for 
skiing he came to be regarded as a shrewd strategist in what was 
then a world turned upside down by the crashrelated uncertainties 
of investing 
later cohen embellished his reputation as a gutsy financial 
brawler by launching shearson into the risky but lucrative business 
of corporate takeovers for a while shearson was bankrolling more 
leveraged buyouts and other debtfinanced deals than most rivals 
cohens hubris seemed to grow in proportion 
in hindsight that may have been part of his demise when 
shearson emerged as the financier for a group seeking to buy rjr 
nabisco inc in the biggest lbo of all time cohen angered skiing 
buddy henry kravis head of the leading firm specializing in lbos 
kravis outmaneuvered him and bought rjr for 25 billion 
the rjr humiliation hutton indigestion a slumping stock market 
and severe decline in the takeover business combined to wallop 
shearsons earnings and stock price the companys swollen size 
once considered a strategy of strength now seemed part of its 
weakness 
brash arrogant and increasingly isolated cohen alienated 
subordinates and parent company american express co he quit under 
pressure and a conservative american express appointee replaced him 
for phelan 58 the finale looks almost as serene as a gentle 
breeze on the long island sound where he goes sailing 
after announcing that he will retire at the end of the year 
capping nearly seven years at the helm of the nations largest 
stock market phelan was widely complimented for his management 
skills quiet tenacity and eventempered handling of the black 
monday panic in 1987 
perhaps more important phelan was credited with modernizing the 
big boards communications and technology promoting the idea of 
global securities markets and helping guide the exchange through an 
era of dramatic expansion 
still phelan will leave his post with some important issues 
unresolved one of the most contentious is how to control 
computerized program trading a strategy that can instantly flood 
the market with sell or buy orders 
critics say it has injected scary volatility into the market and 
is keeping many investors from buying stocks defenders say its 
influence is negligible 
phelan preferred to take the middle ground on this and other 
controversial issues striking a delicate balance between competing 
interests 
markets and the exchange are the kinds of institutions where 
you cannot press a button and resolve them overnight he said 
in other business and economic news this past week 
federal reserve chairman alan greenspan told congress the risk 
of recession has declined his remarks were interpreted by the 
financial markets as a signal that the central bank wont ease 
credit despite other evidence of economic weakness 
some prominent american industrial corporations such as 
cocacola and usx reported sharply higher earnings but much of the 
corporate outlook elsewhere looked bleak especially in the 
automobile business where bad news bearers ranged from corporate 
headquarters to federal court chrysler said it was closing a plant 
that would sharply reduce its capacity ford lost a windshield 
wiper patent infringement suit that could prove costly to all 
automakers 
america discovered the descendants of bolsheviks go for burgers 
and beardbusters mcdonalds opened its celebrated jointventure 
in moscow and gillette co said it would establish a 50 million 
soviet razor blade factory
