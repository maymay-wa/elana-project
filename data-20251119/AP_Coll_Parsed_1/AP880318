a sixyear study of the largest population ever 
contaminated by the toxic chemical dioxin found no apparent 
increase in birth defects 
the study published in fridays journal of the american medical 
association focused on babies born in and around seveso italy 
from 1977 through 1982 
a 1976 chemical accident ata factory in the area released a 
cloud of dioxin that contaminated more than 37200 residents in 
seveso and the neighboring towns of meda cesano maderno and desio 
the study said that if there is any increased risk related to 
dioxin the overall risk is unlikely to be large or might be 
limited to very rare and specific birth defects 
still more important the study concluded is the fact 
that no infant with a major malformation was identified in the most 
highly contaminated zone 
dioxin a byproduct of pesticide manufacture causes cancer in 
laboratory animals it has not been directly linked to cancers in 
humans 
in the italian study doctors considered as defects only those 
congenital malformations obvious at birth congenital problems that 
manifest themselves later in life such as mental retardation were 
not considered 
the seveso congenital malformations registry established 
shortly after the accident found that in 15291 births 742 
infants were born with deformities a rate of 485 per 1000 
the prevalence of deformities over the same period in a nearby 
uncontaminated area used as a control was 488 per 1000 births 
the study found 
the quantity of dioxin released into the environment seemed to 
be enormous but was never precisely determined according to the 
study 
levels of dioxin concentration found on the ground in the area 
surrounding the factory were nearly 1000 times higher than the 
levels termed safe by state and federal officials after a cleanup 
at times beach mo 
times beach is now deserted and hundreds of families have filed 
lawsuits against companies and individuals over their exposure to 
dioxin contained in waste oil sprayed on their streets to control 
dust in the 1970s 
questions about the effects of exposure to dioxin have lingered 
since the vietnam war dioxin is in agent orange a defoliant used 
during the war 
some veterans have sought government compensation contending 
their exposure resulted in cancers rashes headaches and other 
side effects as well as birth defects in their children 
the veterans administration has contended numerous studies have 
found no link between exposure and reported symptoms

planeloads of us soldiers 
streamed into this air base thursday in a show of strength ordered 
by president reagan to counter what he called an invasion by 
nicaraguan forces 
in northern nicaragua warplanes dropped bombs near a sandinista 
military headquarters thursday but no casualties or damage 
resulted reporters at the scene said the explosives fell on the 
honduran side of the border 
nicaragua and a us official said earlier that the raid was 
aimed at the military post 
the american troops were to engage in joint exercises with the 
hondurans but the us airlift was so hastily arranged that 
american commanders were left scrambling to develop training 
exercises to keep the men busy 
hundreds of soldiers bedded down in dusty fields near the 
airstrip awaiting orders for training missions which normally are 
arranged months in advance 
the american troops were told to expect to spend about 10 days 
in honduras but spokesmen said there was no official timetable yet 
for them to leave 
two battalions from the renowned 82nd airborne division of fort 
bragg nc and two battalions from the 7th light infantry 
division of fort ord calif were combined into a task force of 
3000 troops 
a honduran official said his government had given the 
sandinistas 24 hours to get out of the country which they entered 
in pursuit of contra rebels 
president daniel ortega of nicaragua responded that his army was 
ready to combat and liquidate the famous forces of the 82nd 
airborne division 
maj gen carl w stiner commander of the 82nd airborne said 
he knew of no plan to have us troops enter into the battle 
between the sandinistas and the usbacked contras 
we have not been told to do so he said before leaving fort 
bragg he said the force was capable of that if needed 
stiner also said there was no plan to use the troops if more 
trouble broke out in nearby panama 
the american forces began arriving at palmerola at 1015 am as 
part of what the pentagon called operation golden pheasant 
the 26 c141 transport planes landed in the intense heat at 
30minute intervals at this air base headquarters of us military 
operations in honduras 40 miles northwest of tegucigalpa 
the deployment was about 125 miles west of the area where reagan 
administration officials say the nicaraguan sandinista army has 
chased rebel contra forces over the border into honduras 
col manuel suarez benavides a honduran armed forces spokesman 
said the deadline for the sandinistas to leave was final 
he said 2000 nicaraguan soldiers had crossed the border and 
penetrated about six miles in pursuit of contra rebels a military 
intelligence source said earlier the nicaraguans were surrounded by 
about 4000 honduran troopers 
suarez benavides would not comment on pentagon reports of new 
nicaraguan attacks inside honduras 
the sandinista movements did not appear to be a fullfledged 
invasion stiner said adding that he saw the us operation as a 
deterrent 
ortega would not say whether his soldiers had crossed the border 
in pursuit of the ussupported rebels 
here the question is not if army troops penetrated honduran 
territory or not but that we have dozens of camps of mercenary 
forces in honduran territory in view of and tolerated by the 
honduran government he said at a news conference in managua 
he said nicaraguan soldiers would not withdraw from the border 
area ortega called the us troop deployment a dangerous act 
and demanded a meeting of the un security council 
a spokesman for the nicaraguan foreign ministry said before the 
news conference that nicaragua had begun pulling its troops back 
from the frontier region after driving about 2000 contra rebels 
back into honduras the defense and foreign ministries denied that 
nicaraguan troops entered honduras 
nicaraguan presidential spokesman manuel espinoza enriquez later 
said that air attackers fired at least five rockets thursday at the 
nicaraguan military headquarters at bocay near the honduras 
border sandinista gunfire forced the planes to turn back he said 
reporters saw two planes entering nicaraguan air space from 
honduras they saw nothing to support a report from a us official 
in washington that a sovietbuilt helicopter had been destroyed 
manuel suarez a honduran spokesman in tegucigalpa denied the 
honduran air force crossed the border and said it dropped at least 
five bombs inside honduras along the border near bocay 
heavy fighting was reported wednesday in the olancho border 
province about 125 miles east of palmerola 
included in the american forces are two battalions from the 82nd 
airborne and two from a new division organized for quick movement 
around the world the 82nd airborne and 7th light infantry are 
based at opposite ends of the country 
the final 800 us troops are to arrive friday by parachute 
weather permitting 
in addition to the c141 aircraft a giant c5a transport was 
loaded with helicopter gunships for the exercise 
the honduran intelligence source who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said we will not allow the sandinistas to move 
farther into the interior of our territory we want to avoid a 
large conflict but if it isnt possible we will have to face the 
invading troops 
secretary of state george p shultz said in washington the 
soldiers were being sent to get peoples attention to what is 
happening in central america and say to the honduran government 
we are your friends 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the complete 
deployment would take about 27 hours the defense department said 
nine helicopters and two light tanks were also sent 
it was the the most dramatic show of us force since the 
contras began fighting in nicaragua six years ago and it came in 
response to a request for help from president jose azcona hoyo of 
honduras 
since 1981 honduras has been a key us ally in central america 
and a major element in reagan administration policy of fighting 
nicaraguas leftist government 
about 1100 american soldiers normally are stationed at several 
military installations in honduras in addition other national 
guard and army troops rotate through for joint exercises 
roadbuilding and other projects

churches were given increased protection 
from libel suits in matters of religious doctrine thursday when 
californias supreme court refused to reinstate a 126 million 
verdict 
the high court in a 52 vote refused to hear an appeal by a 
woman who sued the worldwide church of god after a minister 
proclaimed her one of the enemies of gods church 
the courts action returns the case to los angeles superior 
court for a retrial based on a new legal standard whether the 
minister knew his statements were false or spoke in reckless 
disregard of whether they were false 
that standard already applied to libel suits filed by public 
figures and government officials against newspapers and other news 
media 
in a precedentsetting decision that now has statewide effect a 
lower appeals court said the freedom of religion requires the same 
constitutional protections to churches and their officials when 
discussing religious doctrine 
the suit was filed by leona mcnair of pasadena former wife of 
raymond mcnair deputy chancellor of the churchrun ambassador 
college 
she was a prominent church member who later became associated 
with a dissident faction and was divorced by mcnair in 1976 after 
20 years of marriage 
the court said their divorce and mcnairs remarriage the next 
year prompted criticism within the church which recognizes divorce 
in only a few instances 
in a 1979 speech to about 1000 people at the churchs annual 
meeting in tucson ariz roderick meredith the churchs director 
of pastoral administration sought to explain why the mcnair 
divorce was justified by desertion by an unconverted mate one 
ofthe grounds recognized by the church 
mrs mcnair he said had left the church and was virtually 
cursing mcnair spitting literally in peoples faces and as 
hateful as a human being can be 
she departed so far that she is one of the major enemies of 
gods church in southern californiahe said 
meredith returned to the subject several months later in a 
written report repeating some of his previous accusations and 
saying mrs mcnair had refused to be a wife to mcnair for over 
two years before the divorce 
in the suit against the church meredith mcnair and others a 
jury found that the statements were false and that the pastors 
report had caused mrs mcnair extreme emotional distress 
the appeals court overturned the verdict because jury was not 
asked to find that the statements were intentionally or recklessly 
false 
the right to free exercise of religion is a constitutional 
guarantee of equal significance to freedom of the press the 
appeals court said adding that merediths remarks however 
personal were made while he was explaining church doctrine on 
divorce

a missile attack on a tanker in the 
persian gulf early friday set the ship on fire killed one sailor 
and critically injured three shipping executives and hospital 
officials said 
iran was suspected in the attack on the 4127ton maria ii 
which flies the panamanian flag 
as many as 19 korean crewmembers who had jumped off the vessel 
which was laden with highly explosive liquefied gas were plucked 
from the water and from lifeboats by salvage tugboats the 
executives said 
hospital officials identified the dead man as a japanese citizen 
the tanker was sighted on fire just after midnight in the 
southern gulf about 10 miles from the port of dubai said the 
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
they said the fire was put out after about 90 minutes and that 
it was apparently the result of an iranian attack although they 
were unsure whether it was from air or sea 
three salvage tugboats that rushed to fight the blaze reported a 
hole on the starboard side indicating the vessel had been hit by a 
missile 
the executives said the dead mans body was found floating in 
the water 
the survivors were taken to dubais alrashid hospital where 
officials said three were in critical condition and six were being 
treated for less serious injuries they said the rest had suffered 
minor bruises and were treated and released 
one hospital official quoted the survivors as saying they had 
thrown themselves overboard once the ship was bombed he said 
they were not sure what had struck the ship 
iran usually attacks commercial ships in the southern gulf in 
retaliation for iraqi strikes on its own tanker lanes the two 
belligerents at war since september 1980 have concentrated in 
recent weeks on attacking each others cities 
there had been a lull in the socalled tanker war except for 
two confirmed iraqi strikes this month iranian retaliation is 
usually on a shipforship basis more than 400 ships of different 
nationalities have been hit or damaged by both sides 
the destination of the ship was not immediately known nor where 
it had picked up the shipment

the city agreed thursday to restrict police 
in their search for a sexualassault suspect after the police 
department was accused in an aclu suit of detaining hundreds of 
black men without cause 
the agreement signed by city attorneys and the american civil 
liberties union prohibits officers from detaining anyone merely 
because he matches the race or age of the man suspected of 
attacking eight women in the past five weeks 
however the agreement allows police to stop anyone to seek 
their voluntary cooperation in the investigation 
a similar dispute involving a police department dragnet in an 
hispanic neighborhood ended with the city paying a 45000 
settlement to about 80 people in 1985 
barry steinhardt executive director of the aclu in 
pennsylvania applauded the agreement saying police commissioner 
kevin tucker recognized that the investigation should not become 
the occasion for the random mass questioning of black 
philadelphians 
in the suit filed earlier thursday the aclu sought a federal 
court injunction to prevent police from stopping frisking 
questioning and detaining black men in the search for the 
socalled center city stalker 
the suit filed on behalf of two men charges that several 
hundred men were questioned without probable cause 
attorneys for the aclu and deputy city soliciter ralph teti met 
thursday with us district judge james mcgirr kelly who approved 
the agreement 
aclu legal director stefan presser said we do believe that a 
large number of people were illegally detained and we will now 
pursue the question of damages 
teti could not be reached for comment thursday night 
earlier in the day the police commissioner defended the conduct 
of the police 
obviously our feeling is we have a composite sketch and we 
feel were following proper guidelines tucker said if the 
courts think were doing things differently then we will abide by 
their ruling 
the center city stalker has generally approached victims leaving 
an elevator an empty hall with a gun he has directed victims into 
an empty room robbed them tied their hands hands and ankles and 
sexually assaulted them 
the attacks have created fear among women in downtown office 
buildings leading to an increase in the sale of chemical mace 
in 1985 police questioned 125 hispanics after a police officer 
was shot to death in his patrol car in an hispanic neighborhood 
a federal judge ordered the department to stop the disgraceful 
activities and unlawful conduct in rounding up hispanics 
indiscriminately and the city later agreed to a monetary 
settlement

women who smoke half a pack of cigarettes 
a day are twice as likely to have a stroke as women who have never 
smoked and those who smoke two packs a day have six times the risk 
of a stroke researchers say 
their study presented thursday at a meeting of the american 
heart association is the first to show a conclusive link between 
smoking and strokes in women said the studys principal author 
dr graham colditz of the harvard university school of medicine in 
boston 
taken in conjunction with the results for men this clearly 
implicates cigarette smoking as a risk factor for strokes in 
women colditz said 
before 1984 smoking was not considered a risk factor for strokes 
in men or women in 1984 however the american heart association 
listed cigarette smoking as a possible risk factor for strokes 
little has been known about the effect of smoking on strokes in 
women however earlier less definitive studies had suggested it 
increased the risk some had found no effect and one had found that 
smoking decreased the risk colditz said 
heart disease and stroke have been studied less extensively in 
women than in men possibly because those diseases are less common 
in women than men but heart disease and stroke taken together 
are the leading cause of death in women as they are in men 
the heart association estimates that 500000 americans have 
strokes each year in 1985 the latest year for which figures are 
available 152700 americans died from strokes 
colditz said his results are more convincing than those of 
previous studies largely because of the number of subjects in his 
study almost 120000 they are nurses who were recruited in 1976 
for a huge study attempting to correlate various aspects of diet 
health family history and such things as height and weight with 
the occurrence of disease 
in a separate finding reported thursday analysis of the nurses 
drinking habits showed that even modest amounts of alcohol can 
lower the risk of coronary heart disease marked by clogging of the 
coronary arteries that supply blood to the heart 
this effect has been observed in men but it has not been as 
thoroughly studied in women 
a couple of drinks a week is enough to lower the risk 
colditz said 
meir stampfer of harvard the principal author of the alcohol 
study said analysis of the alcohol intake of 87566 of the nurses 
showed that as little as two drinks a week could lower the risk of 
coronary heart disease by 40 percent 
there is a catch however alcohol has been shown to raise the 
incidence of cancer and that effect begins to occur with the 
consumption of three drinks a week colditz said 
most authorities believe that the question of alcohols effect 
on health has not been answered well enough yet for them to 
recommend that people drink moderately 
alcohols hazards are well known and public health officials 
worry that some people might conclude for example that if two 
drinks are good four drinks are better

the deadly earthquake that shook the los 
angeles area in october led scientists to accept a theory that says 
the region is more prone to damaging jolts than once believed 
a study of the quake published today in the journal science 
concludes buried faults hidden by folds in earths crust present 
additional potential earthquake hazards to the los angeles 
metropolitan area 
the theory by consulting geologist thom davis was publicized in 
november when scientists met to discuss the oct 1 whittier narrows 
quake which measured 59 on the richter scale with its 
aftershocks it caused eight deaths more than 200 injuries and 
358 million in damage 
the new study in which 17 scientists joined davis as 
coauthors says the hidden fault system running directly under 
dodger stadium and downtown los angeles is capable of generating 
moderatesized destructive earthquakes 
we all sort of knew in the back of our minds that there had to 
be hidden faults there but the whittier narrows earthquake kind 
of brought it home said the studys chief author university of 
southern california seismologist egill hauksson 
now we can no longer ignore the geologists like thom davis who 
said these faults extend along the whole northern edge of the 
los angeles basin he said 
the studys coauthors include researchers from the us 
geological survey usc the california institute of technology and 
the california division of mines and geology 
while davis quietly studied the hidden fault hazard nobody 
else was even thinking about the problem because they focused on 
the seismic threat from known visible faults said usgs 
seismologist lucile jones a coauthor of the study and haukssons 
wife 
when the whittier narrows earthquake occurred on exactly the 
kind of fault he said should be there we listened more closely 
she said the idea that a system of faults capable of earthquakes 
underlies the northern los angeles basin is becoming generally 
accepted 
hauksson said the whittier narrows quake was small compared with 
quakes that might be generated if the hidden faults are 
interconnected and rupture at once if that happens were going 
to have a much bigger disaster on our hands he said 
such a quake could measure up to 75 on the richter scale of 
ground motion jones said previous studies have shown a 
magnitude65 in los angeles would be more damaging than an 
8magnitude great quake on the more distant san andreas fault 
officials have said a great quake on the southern san andreas could 
kill up to 14000 people and cause 17 billion in damage 
jones said the hidden system of faults runs west to east from 
the santa monica mountains above malibu through the beverly and 
hollywood hills to dodger stadium and downtown los angeles and then 
toward the whittier area 
richard andrews the california office of emergency services 
assistant director for southern california said the california 
earthquake prediction evaluation council met march 11 in los 
angeles to discuss the study in science 
the council was unable to make any recommendations on how the 
added hazard should be incorporated into emergency plans because 
not enough is known about how often such quakes will occur or how 
strong they will be andrews said

the chairman of the house judiciary committee 
and two other lawmakers thursday introduced a resolution to impeach 
convicted federal judge walter l nixon jr of mississippi 
judiciary chairman peter w rodino jr dnj acted just two 
days after receiving a recommendation from the judicial conference 
the governing body for federal judges 
the conference certified to the house that nixon had engaged in 
conduct which might constitute grounds for impeachment judges are 
appointed for life and can only be removed by congress in an 
impeachment proceeding 
the house votes for impeachment articles similar to an 
indictment and the senate then conducts a trial 
my family and i are very upset at this time nixon said in a 
telephone interview from his home in ocean springs miss beyond 
that i have no further comment any other comments i may have must 
come through my attorney 
nixon was convicted in february 1986 of two counts of perjury 
before a federal grand jury he had been acquitted of bribery 
charges by a federal jury regarding his business relationship with 
wiley fairchild a wealthy investor who sold three oil well 
properties to nixon in 1980 at bargain prices 
but the grand jury convicted him of lying when he denied 
discussing drug charges against fairchilds son with the elder 
fairchild and with a mississippi prosecutor 
the supreme court last jan 19 refused to review the conviction 
nixon is scheduled to go to prison next wednesday 
nixon the chief judge for the southern district of mississippi 
said on jan 20 he would not resign he stopped hearing cases after 
he was indicted but continues to draw his annual judicial salary 
of 89500 
sponsoring the resolution in addition to rodino were reps don 
edwards dcalif chairman of the judiciary subcommittee on civil 
rights hamilton fish of new york ranking republican on the full 
committee and rep f james sensenbrenner jr rwis 
rodino said in view of the fact that judge nixon has been 
convicted of a serioius federal crime and his direct judicial 
appeals have been exhausted it becomes incumbent upon the house of 
representatives to initiate impeachment proceedings 
the last impeachment was about 18 months ago when the senate 
convicted and removed us district judge harry e claiborne of 
nevada

illegal aliens are depressing wages and 
worsening working conditions for legal immigrants and native 
americans in lowskilled and lowwage jobs the general accounting 
office says in a new report 
citing empirical data and several case studies the 
congressional watchdog agency said both usborn and legally 
documented immigrants are being hurt especially those working as 
janitors and farm and food processing workers 
the report identified restaurants and companies producing auto 
parts shoes and clothing as others that often employ illegal 
aliens 
the willingness of illegal aliens to work in lowskill jobs for 
less than the minimum wage in those industries has depressed wages 
and benefits for comparable native and legal immigrant workers the 
gao said 
but it also concluded that the low wages paid to illegal aliens 
allow some of the businesses to grow or survive foreign 
competition indirectly expanding job opportunities and wages for 
higherskilled workers in the same trades 
without a pool of flexible illegal immigrants willing to work at 
sewing machines in highfashion garment plants or as shoemakers 
the gao said many companies would shut down or move out of the 
country 
it also said a growing practice by restaurants of using illegal 
immigrants as dishwashers and busboys allowed the businesses to 
keep their prices low and thus expand providing more jobs for more 
highly skilled waiters and chefs 
the labor department disagrees with those conclusions saying 
none of the studies surveyed by gao offered any concrete evidence 
of a positive effect from using illegal workers it said the only 
evidence came in comments from employers 
in a formal reply to the report the department also disputed 
gaos premise that legal workers wont take many of the lowwage 
jobs particularly in the shoe and garment industries 
the fact is that large numbers of native and legal us 
workers are in the same labor market as illegal workers the 
labor department said furthermore if wages were not depressed 
by illegal workers even greater numbers of native and legal 
workers would be in that labor market 
the gao said the 1986 immigration reform law and its fines for 
hiring illegal aliens if successful will force wages up for legal 
immigrants and natives and cause considerable stress 
financially for growers and shoe and garment manufacturers 
congress asked the gao to survey all available studies and data 
on illegal immigrants impact on native and legal immigrant workers 
in 1985 when it was weighing the employer sanctions that were 
adopted a year later 
the gao has now finally submitted the study to congress saying 
that after examining 230 academic and other treatises on the issue 
it found scarce useful information the biggest problem the gao 
said is that illegal aliens are a hidden population making it 
hard to identify them for use in any empirical study 
about two dozen case studies however suggested that employers 
use of illegal aliens has displaced native workers and legal 
immigrants from their jobs and driven down wages of those who 
remain 
the most dramatic examples were among janitors and farm and food 
processing workers in california 
for example janitors in downtown los angeles office buildings 
most of them black or legal hispanic immigrants had won wage and 
benefits reaching a peak of 12 an hour by 1983 under labor 
contracts negotiated by the service employees international union 
however in the 1980s a group of aggressive nonunion janitorial 
services hiring predominantly illegal immigrants began wresting the 
best building contracts away from the unionized firms driving the 
union scale back down to 4 an hour and below 
of 2500 black janitors working under highwage contracts in 
1977 only 100 still enjoyed comparative wages by 1985 the union 
still had 600 working members but 500 of them had suffered large 
pay cuts 
similar events occurred in the southern california citrus and 
tomato fields where farm labor contractors using illegal 
immigrants drove down wage and benefits of legal migrant crop 
pickers from mexico by 18 percent between 1975 and 1985

the agriculture department thinks its 
40yearold national school lunch program should have had at least 
a walkon role in a forthcoming nbc television movie about hunger 
among children 
as it is the networks hourlong movie a place at the 
table will be broadcast the night of march 20 without mention of 
the school lunch program department officials are giving the movie 
less than rave reviews 
curt block nbc vice president for media relations said the 
purpose of the films producers was to take a broader focus of 
the problem of hunger among children and to get across to the 
public how pervasive the problem is 
block said the intent was also to show that there are a number 
of ways we can get food to children 
assistant secretary john w bode who oversees school lunch and 
food stamp programs said in a statement that despite the 
laudable public service aspects of the movie it contains serious 
inaccuracies about hunger 
in the movie children are encouraged to donate their brown 
bag lunches to classmates who are so hungry they attend a soup 
kitchen after school bode said the film does not acknowledge 
the existence of the national school lunch program which provides 
free school lunches to children of lowincome families 
further he said preschool breakfasts are also provided in 
schools which participate in the usda program 
school lunch is only one of a number of federal food 
assistance programs including food stamps which provide more than 
20 billion worth of help a year to needy americans bode said 
that figure translates into 56 million a day in food help 
further he said the school lunch program is one of the largest 
food service providers in the country serving more than 24 million 
children daily nearly half of whom receive lunches free of charge 
since 1980 the federal budget for school lunches has increased 
21 percent to the current annual level of 34 billion bode said 
according to usda budget officers about 3 billion in cash 
subsidies will go to schools to help with lunch programs in the 
fiscal year that began last oct 1 an additional 400 million in 
surplus food commodities also is being distributed 
students from families with income of less than 130 percent of 
the federal poverty line 14560 for a family of four qualify for 
free meals the usda pays a subsidy of about 154 per meal for 
those about 103 million students are in that category 
reducedprice meals costing no more than 40 cents are available 
to about 16 million students from families with incomes between 
130 percent and 185 percent of the poverty level between 14560 
and 20720 for a family of four the usda subsidy is about 114 
per meal about 164 million students participate 
full prices are paid by student from families above 185 percent 
of poverty those with incomes of more than 20720 for a family of 
four nearly 128 million children pay full prices but those 
meals are also subsidized by usda at the rate of about 26 cents per 
meal

farmers are continuing to make a strong 
financial comeback from the pounding they endured in the early 
1980s according to a new agriculture department report 
cash income still is expected to recede from last years 57 
billion to between 50 billion and 55 billion in 1988 the 
departments economic research service said thursday 
the projected decline will result from lower livestock receipts 
rising expenses and lower government payments the report said 
those will more than offset a rise in 1988 crop receipts 
net cash income is the difference between gross cash income and 
cash expenses in the calendar year 
the income and debtservice problems that plagued agriculture 
during the 1980s have largely been weathered although financial 
problems persist for some producers who acquired longterm debt at 
high interest rates the report said a major contributor to 
increased cash flow is a marked reduction in interest expenses 
since the difficult 198083 years 
economists said receipts from crop sales are improving as a 
result of increased domestic and export demand for major 
commodities including wheat and corn 
receipts from livestock sales should be off slightly as red 
meat and poultry production expands almost 2 percent and prices 
falter the report said fruit prices this spring will be below 
a year ago as larger supplies come to market

consumers can bite into some bargains at fresh 
fruit counters these days says a senior agriculture department 
official 
j patrick boyle head of the departments agricultural 
marketing service said large harvests of apples and winter pears 
have helped dampen prices the leading variety of us apple is the 
red delicious and the most abundant winter pear is the anjou he 
said 
the agency estimated that the 1987 apple harvest was up 25 
percent while winter pear output climbed 21 percent 
barring unexpected developments consumers will continue to 
find apples and winter pears of excellent quality at attractive 
prices in their grocery stores for several more months boyle 
said thursday

the first step in bailing out texas largest 
bank holding company is raising concerns about the longterm health 
of the fund that insures deposits in most of the nations 
commerical banks 
the federal deposit insurance corp said thursday it was loaning 
1 billion to banks owned by first republicbank corp of dallas for 
six months in a move to reassure depositors worried about the 
banks shaky real estate loans 
the infusion represents only about 5 percent of the fdics 
insurance fund which backs deposits of 100000 and less at 13600 
banks but bank analysts believe it could turn out to be the first 
big hit of a bad year for the fund 
fdic chairman l william seidman isnt saying how much he 
believes his agency ultimately may have to spend to rescue the 
332 billion holding company the largest in texas and the 13th 
biggest in the country 
the analysts however are suggesting that the first 
republicbank loan is in effect a down payment on a 2 billion to 
4 billion problem 
first republicbank is about the same size that continental 
illinois corp was in 1984 when it required the largestever 
government bank bailout of 45 billion 
and more bad news is likely from other banks particularly in 
texas where mcorp a 21 billion moneylosing bank holding 
company has been exploring restructuring options 
but seidman says the situations of continental and first 
republicbank are not the same and he points with hope to fdic 
conversations with private investors and to signs that texas 
economy is rebounding 
he notes his funds survival during 1987 the worst year for 
commercial banking since the great depression both in terms of low 
profits and the number of bank failures 
despite the rescue of first city bancorporation of houston and 
the failure of 184 banks in 1987 the fdic fund still managed a 
modest increase to 183 billion 
therefore we dont see anything that we are going to do this 
year that is going to cause a substantial decline in the fund i 
mean by substantial 25 percent he said 
however bert ely an alexandria va financial consultant 
said my sense is they are going to lose money 
the funds income from interest and from premiums paid by member 
banks 33 billion last year is increasing at a slower rate 
than deposits he said the ratio of fdic assets to insured 
deposits has fallen from more than 120 per 100 in 1981 to close 
to 110 
still the fdic fund is in far better shape than its sister fund 
for the thrift industry the federal savings and loan insurance 
corp unlike fslic the fdic probably would still be in the black 
after accounting for all of the problems suffered by its member 
institutions ely said 
industry experts are skeptical of the chances for fdics efforts 
to attract private investors to take on some of the risks of 
operating a restructured first republicbank 
im sure there probably are people who are kicking the tires 
and have expressed an interest to the fdic said stephen skaggs 
a senior analyst for sheshunoff amp co an austin texas consulting 
firm 
but i just dont see that theres any great appetite for 
investments like first republicbank unless the fdic is willing to 
assume substantially all of the risk 
according to sandy flannigan an analyst with paine webber inc 
in houston the search for private capital for first republicbank 
does not improve the chances for other texas banks such as mcorp to 
attract new investors 
first city which is getting 500 million from a private 
investment group in addition to the fdic money was first to the 
well she said they are in far better shape than those who 
follow there isnt an infinite number of investors interested in 
texas banks 
ironically the deepening bank crisis comes amid signs that 
texas economy is improving 
the whole thing is just a very sad situation said paul 
getman senior financial economist of the wefa group a 
philadelphiaarea consulting firm just when people thought the 
situation in texas might turn around it has in fact worsened 
the overall economic situation has picked up a bit it has just 
not improved fast enough to help these banks its just too 
little too late 
the scary thing is that if right now these banks are doing 
so poorly with an economy that is doing fairly well nationally 
what will happen to them if the national growth turns sluggish for 
the next few years he asked

two unidentified jets from 
honduras roared into nicaraguan territory on thursday and dropped 
bombs near a sandinista military encampment along the border 
two bombs fell in nicaragua and a third landed across the coco 
river in honduran territory sandinista officers said there was no 
damage or injuries 
the raid came a day after honduras accused nicaragua of sending 
thousands of soldiers across the border in pursuit of 
ussupported contra rebels 
a honduran armed forces spokesman in tegucigalpa the honduran 
capital said the bombs were aimed at sandinista forces that 
crossed into the neighboring country he denied the planes entered 
nicaraguan airspace 
more than 3000 american soldiers began arriving in honduras in 
a show of support thursday ortega declared his army ready to 
combat and liquidate the americans and said his soldiers will 
not withdraw from the border region 
nicaragua has committed an estimated 6000 soldiers to an 
antirebel operation in an area running from the central region to 
the border with most at the frontier 
about 25 reporters most of them americans watched as the jets 
roared into nicaragua at about noon thursday the journalists dived 
for cover but were not hurt as the bombs exploded as close as 70 
yards away 
the leftist sandinista government flew the journalists to the 
region for a briefing on its offensive against the ussupported 
contra rebels 
none of the five sovietmade helicopters used in the area for 
movement of troops or evacuation were hit by the bombs in 
washington sources who spoke on condition of anonymity claimed 
that one sovietmade helicopter on the ground had been damaged the 
soviet union supplies the sandinistas with military hardware and 
training 
the sandinistas opened fire at the planes with antiaircraft 
guns but apparently did not hit either of them 
some military officials in nicaragua described the planes as 
frenchmade mysteres while others said they were usmade f5s 
the honduran air force has both 
a us official in washington said two usbuilt f5s and four 
supermystere attack jets of the honduran air force carried out the 
raid 
this was totally a honduran operation the official said 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
upon hearing of the raid ortega abruptly left a meeting with 
opposition politicians called to discuss their differences with the 
government a presidential source who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said ortega held an urgent meeting with his military 
chiefs 
later foreign minister miguel descoto said he had sent a 
diplomatic note to secretary of state george p shultz formally 
and energetically protesting the attack which he blamed on the 
united states 
the government voice of nicaragua radio also said thursday that 
unidentified planes from honduras buzzed corinto nicaraguas main 
port and antiaircraft batteries fired on them 
the broadcast gave no details corinto is on the pacific about 
70 miles northwest of managua 
honduras has one of central americas smallest armies and relies 
on air superiority for defense it and mexico are the only nations 
in the region with jet fighters 
ortega called the dispatch of us troops to honduras one more 
escalation of the war against nicaragua at nicaraguas request 
the un security council will meet in urgent session friday on the 
nicaraguanhonduran border crisis and on the dispatch of us 
troops to honduras 
in managua ortega said we logically are going to maintain 
our offensive we are not going to withdraw our troops now that 
we have recovered our territory 
we are ready to combat and liquidate the famous forces of the 
82nd airborne division 
earlier a foreign ministry spokesman said nicaragua already had 
begun withdrawing troops from the border region after driving about 
2000 contra rebels back into honduras 
the operations have succesfully been concluded and we dont 
plan to stay along the border region the spokesman alejandro 
bendana said on nbcs today show 
the 3200 us soldiers who began arriving in honduras on 
thursday include two battalions from the 82nd airborne at fort 
bragg nc 
ortega accused the united states of pressuring honduras into 
asking for the american presence 
the c141 planes carrying the us troops were arriving every 30 
minutes at palmerola air force base the main center of us 
military operations in honduras the base is about 125 miles west 
of the border where heavy fighting was reported wednesday 
bendana denied us and honduran allegations that sandinista 
troops entered honduras ortega himself wouldnt say if sandinista 
troops crossed the border 
but honduran military officials who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said about 4000 honduran soldiers were surrounding 
about 2000 nicaraguan soldiers thursday the sources said the 
entire honduran military was on alert 
ortega told reporters the nicaraguan invasion only exists in 
the warped imagination of the north american leaders 
we demand that the united states withdraw its troops from 
honduras immediately and with this contribute to the meeting that 
is going to be held in sapoa march 21 having positive results he 
said 
government and contra representatives are scheduled to begin 
three days of peace talks monday in sapoa a town in southern 
nicaragua near the border with costa rica 
ortega said the united states would use the current situation to 
give the contras logistical and military aid not approved by 
congress 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar called for 
restraint in the conflict but had not decided whether to send in an 
observer team

nicaraguan officials 
apparently wanted to show reporters how quiet this junglecovered 
border region was when they flew them here thursday following a 
major offensive against contra rebels 
but as officials were briefing about 25 journalists at a 
military base two unidentified jet planes from honduras roared 
into nicaraguan territory and dropped bombs along the border 
the reporters dived into the dirt for cover no one was hurt 
some military officials in nicaragua described the planes as 
frenchmade mysteres while others said they were usmade f5s 
the honduran air force has both 
the bombs landed along the coco river which marks the border 
between the two countries puffs of black smoke curled over the 
banana trees 
lt col javier carrion the deputy chief of the sandinista 
armys general staff said two bombs landed in nicaraguan territory 
and one in honduras 
the journalists briefing came after reagan administration 
officials had claimed that nicaraguan troops had penetrated 
honduran territory in pursuit of the usbacked rebels nicaragua 
and honduras share a long ill defined border 
as the jets roared in thursday drowning out the lapping of the 
slowmoving river and the chirping of crickets journalists and 
soldiers threw themselves against the earth 
some of the bombs exploded about 70 yards away from where they 
lay 
maj rosa pasos the defense ministry spokeswoman lost her 
eyeglasses in the weeds but quickly found them she wore an 
americanmade uniform that had apparently been taken from a contra 
rebel 
the sandinistas opened fire at the planes with antiaircraft 
guns they apparently didnt hit either of them 
none of the five sovietmade helicopters used in this area 175 
miles from managua was hit in washington sources who spoke on 
condition of anonymity claimed that one sovietmade helicopter on 
the ground had been damaged the soviet union supplies the 
sandinistas with military hardware and training 
carrion who had been conducting the offensive against the 
contras said that jets had buzzed the coco river earlier in the 
day 
asked whether sandinista troops had crossed the border in their 
offensive carrion replied well no 
there are sectors in the mountains here where you can get 
lost its easy to confuse the topography 
however carrion displayed a map showing where sandinista troops 
had destroyed contra camps along a sixmile route on both sides of 
the coco river 
thursdays attack came hours after 3200 american troops arrived 
in honduras in a show of force 
nicaraguan officers said the air attack appeared to be aimed at 
harassing the sandinistas

senators are pressing the reagan 
administration with a host of worries about how plywood potatoes 
and other homestate products would fare under the us and 
canadian agreement to phase out tariffs 
the outpouring of concern came thursday at a senate finance 
committee session with treasury secretary james a baker iii and 
us trade representative clayton k yeutter 
dropping potato tariffs under the plan will magnify the 
importance of canadian potato subsidies and a canadian ban on maine 
potatoes declared sen george j mitchell dmaine 
will you gentlemen explain to me and maine potato farmers why 
this agreement is good for them mitchell said 
before i fully support a freetrade agreement i must make 
sure that it will not hurt coal said sen jay rockefeller 
dwva 
were being moved out of their markets even without the 
agreement said sen david durenberger rminn and it is wheat 
and it is potatoes and it is corn 
sen donald w riegle jr dmich said that of the nations 
13 billion trade deficit with canada last year nearly half of 
that is in auto and truck activity 
i must say to you that i have very serious reservations about 
that section of the treaty riegle said 
finance committee chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas told the 
administration officials that they must not merely dismiss the 
questions as narrow concerns that skirt the big picture 
baker declared that the agreement is in the national economic 
interest or we wouldnt have sent it up here for approval 
it is unlikely that well ever negotiate a utopian 
agreement yeutter said 
sen bob packwood rore called for approval of the 
uscanada treaty but he expressed concern that canada already 
has violated the agreement by failing to retest us plywood that 
canada says cracks in extreme cold 
theyre used in nome theyre used on the north slope in 
alaska he said they dont crack where theyre used 
and bentsen expressed impatience when yeutter said energy 
provisions of the agreement will be valuable to the united states 
in the long run 
the oilstate senator who has been concerned about sagging 
petroleum prices replied that in the long run well all be 
dead 
im concerned about whats happening while were all still 
around here bentsen said i have a state thats in a

bush has almost finished raising as much money as he can legally 
spend and still has more than 4 million available to spend at 
this time a spokeswoman said gop rival pat robertson has spent 
nearly to the 27 million limit and has to dramatically scale back 
his campaign 
among democrats sen paul simon of illinois and rep richard 
gephardt of missouri both are looking for enough cash to keep their 
campaigns afloat beyond caucuses on march 26 in michigan and 
primaries march 29 in connecticut and april 5 in wisconsin 
the democratic money leader massachusetts gov michael dukakis 
has an active april fundraising schedule and remains in good 
financial shape his campaign said 
democrat jesse jackson whose fundraising has trailed that of 
opponents has been picking up money through an aggressive mail 
program and will appeal for money in california this weekend

sufficient amount of money to do what we need to do said

ads 
bush plans to shut down his fundraising operation by the end of 
april after a handful of highticket dinners and one final mailing 
to his faithful contributors said campaign treasurer fred bush 
who is no relation to the candidate 
at that point bush will have raised the 27 million plus 
another 2 million or so for legal and accounting costs which are 
exempt from the limit however he has not spent the limit so he 
can continue campaigning 
as bush continues the road to allbutcertain nomination this 
summer people are flocking to give him money and two dozen had to 
be refused tickets to a 1000aperson dinner at a private home 
this week the treasurer said 
robertson is in a different situation having spent nearly the 
limit he says he will rely heavily on volunteer efforts to see him 
through the rest of the campaign 
sen bob doles spokeswoman dale tate said the kansas 
republicans poor showing on super tuesday and in illinois did not 
result in a dramatic decrease of contributions although were 
not bathing in dollars

and gephardt spokesman mark johnson said its a daytoday 
thing he said the campaign was aggressively seeking money and 
gephardt was putting in personal calls to contributors

traffic fatalities in the united states last 
year were the lowest in history based on miles driven 
according to the department of transportation 
the department reported on thursday that fatalities dropped 
significantly in 1987 and attributed the decline to increasing use 
of seat belts and a reduction in drunken driving 
the department said its characterization of the 1987 fatality 
rate as the lowest in history used as a yardstick the number of 
deaths per 100 million miles of travel for 1987 that figure was 
24 deaths the highest number was the 2408 deaths per 100 million 
miles in 1921 the first year the calculation was made 
the departments national highway traffic safety administration 
also released figures estimating that 8035 lives were saved and 
95500 injuries prevented by seat belts since 1983 
the rate of deaths per 100 million miles of travel dropped from 
25 in 1986 and 33 in 1980 about 40 percent of the fatalities 
last year involved drunken driving a drop from the 46 percent 
three years earlier 
the department said 32 states and the district of columbia have 
mandatory seat belt laws and estimated 1350 lives were saved in 
1987 alone because of the laws in effect

an avianca jetliner smashed into a 
mountain minutes after takeoff triggered a landslide and burst 
into flames killing all 137 people aboard officials and witnesses 
said 
among the 131 passengers were a roman catholic auxiliary bishop 
and more than 30 soccer players officials said there were no 
americans aboard they said 
the boeing 727 clipped trees before hitting the snowcovered 
mountain 50 miles away near zulia witnesses said 
the craft took off in heavy fog at 116 pm thursday from 
cucuta 250 miles northeast of bogota on a domestic flight to the 
caribbean port of barranquilla 
rescue workers who reached the wreckage thursday night said 
there were no survivors col miguel benedetti civil defense 
director for the state of north santander said in a interview by 
radiotelephone from zulia 
the impact of the plane against the mountain was so violent 
that it caused a landslide which buried part of the aircraft 
said benedetti 
work crews some using helicopters were to return to the crash 
site today said col edgar lozano spokesman for the civil 
aeronautics agency rain snow and rough terrain hampered rescue 
efforts thursday 
airport officials lost radio contact with the plane four minutes 
after it took off although no problems had been reported up to 
that point said lozano 
lozano said the plane apparently was unable to get enough 
altitude to fly over the 8000foot mountain 
zulia police said three witnesses reported that the plane 
clipped some trees then slammed into the mountain and burst into 
flames 
we heard a tremendous noise and ran toward the mountain 
where we saw the ruins of the plane said victor pineda 
villamizar a schoolteacher in an interview with the radio network 
rcn 
he said local rescuers could not reach the crash site because of 
the rough terrain 
avianca and the government air agency reported the plane was 
carrying 131 passengers and six crew members they both had had 
given different numbers earlier 
the agency said the passenger list included monsignor horacio 
olave velandia 44 who was named auxiliary bishop of tibu in 
february and at least 31 soccer players from two teams who were 
flying to a tournament in cartagena 
the soccer teams were affiliated with the state petroleum 
company ecopetrol 
colombias last major air crash occurred july 27 1985 when an 
air force transport plane went down in the amazon jungle killing 
74 people the military plane was carrying civilian passengers 
because of an airline strike

peace talks scheduled to begin monday between the 
contra rebels and the nicaraguan government are off unless 
sandinista troops withdraw from honduras a contra leader says 
if this situation does not take a radical turn we will not 
attend aristides sanchez a member of the fiveperson 
directorate of the nicaraguan resistance said thursday the group 
has its headquarters in miami 
sanchez said the contras would attend the meeting only if the 
sandinistas withdraw at once from honduras there could be 
changes in the next four days but i doubt they will be positive 
he said 
nicaraguan government officials maintain their troops didnt 
advance into honduras but the reagan administration claims they 
did and dispatched 3200 american soldiers to honduras because of 
their presence 
the sandinista government of daniel ortega and contra 
representatives are scheduled to begin three days of talks monday 
in sapoa a town in southern nicaragua near the border with costa 
rica 
if mondays meeting is held it will be the first on nicaraguan 
soil between the two sides 
a contra spokeswoman in miami said intense fighting continued 
thursday with 2000 sandinista troops still in honduras 
the intention of the sandinistas was to weaken our position at 
the negotiating table marta sacasa said its also timed to 
coincide with the end of united states aid 
preliminary reports indicated 10 contra rebels were killed and 
56 wounded in the sandinista offensive she said 
they have been able to overrun certain of our positions and we 
have had to disperse ms sacasa said were trying to avoid a 
frontal engagement and rely on guerrilla tactics 
contra leaders had no comment on the american troops airlifted 
to honduras in a show of support for the central american nation 
ms sacasa said 
the united states troops did not go to honduras to involve 
themselves with the fighting in any way so we have no comment 
she said

the dollar closed at 12835 yen up 092 yen from thursdays 
close but down from its 12865yen opening 
the opening jump was in reaction to sharp rises in the dollar 
recorded on the new york and london markets due to the us trade 
figures said a foreign exchange dealer who requested anonymity 
with a major bank 
another dealer who also asked not to be named said the dollar 
later receded because of selling pressure from exporters and 
insurance companies 
figures released thursday in washington by the us commerce 
department indicated the us trade deficit for january rose to 
1244 billion from 122 billion the previous month but although 
the gap widened by 19 percent imports to the united states 
declined by 6 percent during the month

israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir urged 
american jews to close ranks behind israel as it tries to quell 
riots by palestinians in the occupied territories of the west bank 
and the gaza strip 
when unity breaks down then our enemies exploit every 
critical statement to their own end shamir said to enthusiastic 
applause from 1600 american jews at a fundraising banquet on 
thursday 
he apparently referred to criticism by some jews of the israeli 
armys use of beatings and live ammunition to quell riots in the 
occupied territories at least 100 palestinians have been killed in 
more than three months of violence 
shamir also warned israels supporters not to compare the 
palestinian protests to a civil rights struggle 
these are not passive civil rights marches these are another 
expression of the arab refusal to accept israel to coexist with 
us and to recognize that israel is a permanent feature in the 
region shamir said 
if there were some excesses they were isolated cases that 
were blown way out of proportion by the media he added 
those attending the 60aplate benefit at the century plaza 
hotel agreed to pledge at least 1000 to either the united jewish 
fund or israel bonds during the coming year 
earlier thursday at a ceremony dedicating a cornerstone for a 
museum commemorating the holocaust shamir told about 1500 people 
that americans and europeans may wrongly interpret the arab 
rebellion 
they cry palestine is arab and openly declare that all of 
palestine is theirs he said 
shamir also was scheduled to address a luncheon meeting today of 
the los angeles world affairs council he is scheduled to leave los 
angeles on saturday evening 
the prime minister fresh from his meeting with president 
reagan secretary of state george p shultz and congressional 
leaders in washington reiterated his opposition to an american 
plan for peace in the middle east that calls for an international 
conference

president reagan toasted seamus wright 
among other adversaries during a capitol hill luncheon after paying 
a surprise visit to a tavern in a celebration of st patricks day 
standing thursday at a table covered with a green cloth and 
decorated with green carnations the president wished house speaker 
jim wright warm words on a cold evening and a full moon on a dark 
night 
wright who wore a green jacket and green tie declared that 
weve buried all differences that might exist between political 
parties and branches of government on this day of st patrick he 
toasted reagan 77 for his youthfulness 
wrights greatgrandmother grace hannington emigrated from 
county dungannon ireland in 1837 the irish for james is seamus 
reagan traces his irish roots to his greatgreatgrandfather 
michael oregan who left county tipperary during the potato famine 
of the 1840s 
before he arrived at the capitol reagan paid a surprise visit 
to irelands own a noisy pub in suburban alexandria va where he 
sipped beer and sampled corned beef and cabbage with columnist 
james j kilpatrick 
the president a moderate drinker left most of the beer in his 
glass but joined the tavern crowd in singing when irish eyes are 
smiling and clapping to guitar and fiddle music 
reagan who like most presidents is seldom seen handling money 
reached in his pocket for some currency and paid his own check when 
he left 
on a more serious note reagan issued a statement urging 
concerned americans to refuse financial or moral support to irish 
terrorists 
northern ireland continues to suffer from senseless violence 
which tragically we have seen repeated in recent days and high 
unemployment he said 
we can best address these problems by supporting those who 
seek peaceful settlements to disputes and rejecting those who seek 
solutions through terror 
meantime members of congress commemorating st patricks day 
said britains refusal to prosecute certain cases of criminal 
conduct by its forces in northern ireland is intolerable and 
tarnishes britains international reputation 
we call on the british government to prosecute any member of 
the security forces who has engaged in criminal conduct in northern 
ireland said a statement issued by friends of ireland in 
congress a 160member bipartisan group 
it is intolerable not to pursue and bring to justice 
individuals known to have perverted justice 
the statement did not mention a recent string of violent 
incidents that started march 6 when british troops in gibraltar 
killed three unarmed irish republican army guerrillas who allegedly 
were on a bombing mission 
another congressional group the ad hoc congressional committee 
for irish affairs which includes 41 house and senate members from 
both parties called for a new investigation of the royal ulster 
constabulary the british police force in northern ireland 
both groups urged britain to enact laws to help stop 
discrimination against the roman catholic minority in northern 
ireland that has resulted in jobless rates of more than 50 percent 
among catholic men in some areas

there are two ways perhaps more of looking 
at the results of president reagans sixyear effort in support of 
the contra rebels 
in the administrations view the contras have kept the focus of 
nicaraguas leftist government on surviving preventing it from 
promoting the spread of revolution elsewhere 
as a result the administration says each of nicaraguas 
neighbors has been able consolidate or at least make a beginning on 
building democratic institutions 
reagans worstcase scenario for the region a belt of 
prosoviet states extending from the panama canal to guatemala with 
the possibility that mexico itself ultimately will be threatened 
has not been borne out he believes the contras deserve much of the 
credit 
but the other view is that the costs of the policy have been 
exorbitant far outweighing the benefits 
administration critics maintain that american backing for the 
contras has led to tens of thousands of dead and wounded and set 
back the nicaraguan economy by a generation 
and nicaragua has been in some ways a wrecker of reputations 
playing the same role that vietnam did two decades ago 
on wednesday the same day that reagan decided to send us 
troops to honduras a federal grand jury indicted former national 
security adviser john m poindexter lt col oliver l north and 
two of their associates richard v secord and albert hakim 
as independent counsel lawrence e walsh described it the 
heart of the case against the four was their role in diverting 
funds from iran arms sales to the contras 
poindexter and north two of the most influential figures in 
government less than a year and a half ago face the prospect of 
extended jail terms because they are alleged to have disregarded 
the law in their zeal to support the contras 
the contra cause has divided american public opinion more than 
any other issue during reagans presidency no other dispute has 
generated more distrust and acrimony between the administration and 
the congress 
while reagan has compared the contras with americas founding 
fathers sen claiborne pell dri calls them our 
terrorists both sides believe the others policies will lead 
inevitably to an american troop commitment in the region 
the us policy has fluctuated over the years the contras took 
up arms with american encouragement but now live month to month 
without knowing whether they can count on continued us backing 
their latest setback had its origins in the feb 29 cutoff of 
us aid within days the sandinistas began preparations for an 
offensive against a rebel concentration in the bocay valley near 
the honduran border 
as described by bosco matamoros a contra spokesman the rebels 
were left virtually without food and other supplies and the means 
to evacuate their wounded the sandinistas whose offensive got 
under way in earnest on tuesday claim the contra death toll is in 
the hundreds 
reagan administration officials say that if the sandinistas 
succeed in destroying a key supply depot in the area the impact on 
the remaining 10000 or so contras deployed elsewhere in nicaragua 
could be decisive both materially and psychologically 
administration critics say none of this would have happened if 
reagan had not been so foolish as to believe the contras could have 
prevailed against the sandinistas in the first place or to think 
that such a small poor country could represent any threat at all 
to us security 
the administration counters that congress is to blame and that 
reliable us support for the contras would have eventually 
produced a sandinista surrender ushering in peace and democracy in 
central america 
the administrations problem all along has been that it cant 
prove its worstcase scenario unless it happens 
if indeed the collapse of the contras leads to the communization 
of central america and a new security situation for the united 
states reagan will have been proven correct 
but if that day ever comes reagan will be long gone and a 
successor administration will have to deal with the consequences

colorados roy romer is ready for a brokered 
democratic convention im going id like to have a voice but 
arkansas bill clinton is not so sure about a deadlocked meeting in 
atlanta as the democratic governors worry about their partys 
still unresolved presidential battle 
it depends entirely on how all the major players conduct 
themselves said clinton who considered entering the 1988 race 
himself if it turns out to be a really divisive fight waged in 
front of the entire american people on national television it 
could be devastating 
the democratic governors are major players in the 1988 
democratic nomination battle for they make up part of the 645 
unpledged super delegates to the atlanta convention in july 
with the democratic race still confused and lacking a clear 
frontrunner after a month of primaries and caucuses the governors 
also now take on the role of leaders who can nudge the party to 
unify behind one candidate or to take the race to atlanta 
there will be brokering new york gov mario cuomo said 
thursday the question is when and how either you broker at the 
convention and the whole united states will see you in the 
grubby business of cutting deals i say thats no way to do it 
lets do it when theyre not watching 
one of the governors own michael dukakis of massachusetts 
leads jesse jackson narrowly in the race for national convention 
delegates but both are far short of a majority of those chosen 
dukakis sought to widen his delegate lead thursday by working 
capitol hill where he picked up several endorsements he visited 
with sen bill bradley of new jersey who is said to be leaning 
toward endorsing the massachusetts governor 
colorados romer who recently endorsed dukakis with favorite 
son gary hart out of the race was one of the few governors who 
has made his choice who still likes the brokered convention idea 
it is possible it wil be undecided by the time we get there 
and i dont think thats bad he said it helps in the sense it 
keeps the excitement going 
romer brushed aside democratic party chairman paul kirks 
suggestion that party leaders get together after the primary ends 
in june to unite the party behind the leading candidate at that 
point 
wait a minute if you have three people pretty close and ones 
a little bit higher than the other i dont think you can make that 
decision before the convention why do you have a convention 
im going id like to have a voice he said 
but maryland gov donald schaefer said trying to guide ones 
delegation at a multiballot convention would be dangerous im 
going to step in with a light toe 
minnesotas gov rudy perpich doesnt think a brokered 
convention where no candidate has a majority of the delegates and 
compromises must be sought to decide on a nominee would be so 
bad and he does not agree with kirks call for the party leaders 
to step in a month before the convention 
clinton said kirks idea might work if one of the candidate has 
more than 1400 delegates at the end of the primary process of 
the 2082 needed to win the nomination 
cuomo who is the oftmentioned whiteknight candidate to be 
tapped by a deadlocked convention said the nominee must be decided 
in advance of atlanta 
there are other people who say no lets do it in the 
convention in the open the way we always have historically we 
havent always done it that way carter didnt do it that way 
mondale didnt do it that way he said 
both jimmy carter in 1976 and walter mondale in 1984 picked up 
enough delegates outside of the caucus and primary process to win 
the nominations 
i think thats the way we ought to do it again but i dont 
think my position is a particularly popular one and im afraid that 
it may come out that youll wind up brokering at the convention 
said cuomo 
cuomo said he expected to play a part in any brokering just by 
virtue of the place i occupy as governor of the state were the 
largest state with a democratic governor 
reaction to kirks idea was varied connecticut gov william 
oneill said that it is too early to be talking about such moves 
and marylands schaefer said circumstances in june will shape such 
possibilities it all depends thats a nice theory but youve 
got to be practical 
hawaii gov john waihee and vermont gov madeleine kunin join in 
fearing a brokered convention in part because both are dukakis 
backers 
tennessee gov ned mcwherter a strong supporter of sen albert 
gore of tennessee said he believes gore is in a strong position 
to get the nomination by the time the convention begins so 
brokering wont be a factor 
wyoming gov mike sullivan thinks that a brokered convention is 
a good possibility and that it is too early to judge its impact 
i dont think you can answer that good or bad he said i 
think it would depend on how it was handled during the convention 
it certainly is going to generate some enthusiasm that will be 
absent in the republican convention 
dukakis has 4645 delegate votes just ahead of jackson with 
46055 gore has 354 and sen paul simon of illinois 1715 rep 
richard gephardt of missouri has 145 delegates a total of 27265 
are uncommitted 
among the super delegates dukakis has 425 votes gephardt 21 
gore 198 jackson 1955 simon 155 and uncommitted 23765

surgeon general c everett koop says he fears 
the tendency of the young to believe health warnings are not 
intended for them could lead to the aids virus spreading among high 
school and collegeage americans 
my greatest concern is with the group aged 15 to 24 koop 
told a convention of hospital administrators thursday 
officials may have a better idea of the extent of the aids virus 
among college students by the end of the year as more colleges go 
along with a centers for disease control request to conduct blind 
blood testing koop said 
under such procedures already used by hospitals in about 40 
cities blood drawn for other purposes is tested for aids without 
the sample being identified by patient 
he noted that sexually transmitted diseases in general are 
rising at the steepest rate in 16 years in spite of the 
tremendous educational campaign in 1987 where for the first time 
in history we were discussing in the print media and on television 
very blunt statements about aids and sexually transmitted disease 
if there is hiv the aids virus out there and we know there 
is then there cant help but be some infection going on that were 
not going to see until we get down the road about five years he 
told the federation of american health systems 
it can take five years or more for aids to develop after a 
person contracts the virus 
so with teenagers who think that theyre immortal who 
always think the health message is meant for the person next to 
them who have sort of a sense that risktaking is sort of fun we 
have our most difficult target group especially with regard to 
heterosexual transmission 
earlier the federal official who oversees the medicare and 
medicaid government health programs for the elderly and poor told 
the hospital executives they have been given an almost impossible 
task controlling physician decisionmaking 
in the coming years the challenge of cost constraint will 
continue unabated but the focus will have to shift from hospital 
to physician payment reform said dr william l roper head of 
the health care financing administration 
there is deepseated ambivalence in america about intruding on 
physician decisionmaking said roper but we cannot have both 
physician autonomy and cost constraint

severe cutbacks are devastating the coast 
guards drug interdiction and search and rescue operations the 
agencys chief said in asking congress for an immediate transfer of 
60 million from other accounts 
we have coast guard cutters sitting at docks and planes on the 
runways said adm paul a yost commandant of the coast guard 
congressional approval of the reprogramming request would let us 
put those ships and planes back to work patrolling the high seas 
president reagan on thursday asked congress to transfer money 
from highway mass transit and amtrak funds to restore the patrols 
which were ordered cut back by the administration last month to 
help make up for a 103 million budget shortfall 
the coast guard eliminated routine search and rescue patrols 
cut drug patrols by 55 percent eliminated 1100 jobs closed down 
nearly 30 coast guard installations and severely reduced other 
stations 
none of the jobs or installations would be restored with the 60 
million that money would be devoted exclusively to restoring 
patrol levels to their precutback levels yost said 
before the cutbacks yost said 90 percent of the agencys drug 
seizures came from routine patrols last year 3 billion in 
cocaine alone was seized by the coast guard he said 
the commandant said it was too early to quantify the cutbacks 
impact on drug seizures or rescue missions but he predicted it was 
heavy 
yost said he and transportation secretary james burnley 
conferred with lawmakers before making the recommendations 
i will do everything i can to work with congress to get it 
passed yost said 
the request would not increase overall spending since the money 
is already appropriated 
under the administrations plan 253 million would come from 
federal highway administration funds that are not earmarked for 
specific projects 173 million from mass transit grants 124 
million from a 2 percent reduction in amtraks budget and 5 
million from last years coast guard research and development funds 
yost said even if congress approves the administrations budget 
proposal for fiscal year 1989 in full a 200 million increase 
from this year there are no plans to reopen the closed 
installations or rehire employees

action on air quality legislation 
the lowkey uprising led by rep al swift dwash came to a 
seemingly harmonious head thursday when the selfproclaimed group 
of nine unveiled a compromise plan to escalate the battle against 
urban pollution 
their effort drew applause from the targets of their endrun 
around the committee system chairman john dingell dmich and 
rep henry waxman dcalif chairman of the health and the 
environment subcommittee the details of their plan didnt 
swift and his allies effectively took over the committees air 
quality deliberations last december after months of fruitless 
wrangling between dingell and waxman the sponsor of an air quality 
bill endorsed by environmentalists but deadlocked in his 
subcommittee with a 1010 split 
its a legislative product swift told a news conference 
none of us is happy with every last detail this is a good 
piece of environmental policy and its cost effective 
their plan in many ways is similar to waxmans bill and one 
produced last year by the senate environment committee but still 
awaiting a call to the floor by a major foe majority leader robert 
byrd dwva 
each proposal calls for stricter emissions controls on industry 
and automobiles in an effort to reduce the carbon monoxide and 
smogproducing ozone that the environmental protection agency says 
have reached unhealthy levels for some 100 million people living in 
60 or so metropolitan areas 
the groups plan however would give states and localities more 
time to come up with plans to cut pollution from three to 16 
years depending on the severity of their problems 
the plan would leave most remedies up to epa and the states but 
at minimum a city falling short of clean air standards would have 
to institute a vehicle inspection and maintenance program 
swift and rep dennis eckart dohio said group members would 
begin working next week on an acid rain plan which has also been 
divisive 
dingell from an automaking district has been firm against 
calls for cleaner vehicle exhausts saying the retirement of older 
vehicles lacking emissions controls will cause vehicular pollution 
to continue to decrease 
in a prepared statement dingell said the group of nine plan is 
a vast improvement over waxmans bill and has a real 
opportunity to gain my full support 
waxman called the proposal a very constructive step 
earl mallich chairman of industrys clean air working group 
said the proposed tailpipe standards may not be technologically 
achievable rg ensz spokesman for the american petroleum 
institute said that a proposal to make fuel less evaporative was 
not cost effective 
the motor vehicle manufacturers association of the united states 
said the plan for cleaner exhausts would have imperceptible 
benefits to the nations air 
spokesmen for the sierra club and environmental action said they 
were pleased the plan called for tighter controls on industries and 
vehicles but said the pace of controls was too slow 
other members of the swift group are mike synar dokla phil 
sharp dind jim cooper dtenn jim slattery dkan bill 
tauzin dla and rick boucher dva

the deadline set by secretary of state george 
p shultz for arab and israeli replies to his mideast peace plan is 
passing with the outlook for eventual acceptance bleak 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir wound up four days of 
talks thursday critical of shultzs call for an international 
conference 
he didnt say yes and he didnt say no to the plan which also 
anticipates israel yielding at least part of the west bank and gaza 
in exchange for arab recongition 
but most of what shamir had to say during his visit was critical 
of the proposal especially its call for an international 
conference hosted by the united states the soviet union and the 
three other permament members of the un security council china 
britain and france 
the other major player in the shultz scenario king hussein of 
jordan has not replied to the us plan a jordanian official 
speaking this week in amman on condition of anonymity said he 
doubted there would be a definitive reponse for 10 days 
an indication of arab reservations came thursday from clovis 
maksoud the arab leagues representative here he criticized the 
exclusion of the palestine liberation organization and urged the 
united states to demand a total israeli withdrawal from the west 
bank and gaza 
at least 100 palestinian arabs have died in a little more than 
three months in clashes with israeli forces shultzs proposal 
would lead to selfrule for three years with negotiations on an 
overall settlement to begin by december 
israel took control of the territories from jordan and egypt in 
the 1967 sixday war shamir and other likud bloc leaders have 
vowed not to surrender any of the land 
shultz submitted his plan for negotiations two weeks ago to 
israel jordan and also syria which would be participate in the 
talks on an overall settlement he asked for a reply by midmarch 
as you know i in general think that deadlines are good 
things in trying to get people to make up their minds shultz 
told reporters on his mideast shuttle so we have pointed out the 
fact that the situation carries inherent in it a certain sense of 
deadlines 
and yet shultz noted philosophically you cant push people 
if they dont want to be pushed 
shamir headed for los angeles from washington he and the other 
senior members of the israeli cabinet will take up the us 
proposal next wednesday a vote by the full cabinet would be likely 
on sunday march 27 
if israel and jordan both say yes by then the shultz plan 
could take off but there would be little room if any to make 
changes 
president reagan and shultz both have ruled out revisions 
reagan said he would neither slice the plan apart nor abandon 
it shultz told the senate budget committee on thursday the 
united states will not permit any aspect of its proposal to be 
eroded or compromised 
but shamir clearly is hoping for at least one major change he 
wants to replace the international conference with a ceremony 
held by the united states and the soviet union afterward israel 
and the arabs would negotiate directly 
shultz is trying to win shamir over with reassurances 
he told the senate committee after a final meeting with the 
prime minister that the united states would not attend or remain 
at a conference designed to replace direct arabisraeli 
negotiations 
the conference will be specifically enjoined from imposing 
solutions or vetoing what had been agreed bilaterally shultz 
said 
maksoud of the arab league called meanwhile for a us 
commitment at the outset of negotiations backing arab demands that 
israel yield all the territory captured in the 1967 war 
in a speech maksoud also reasserted the arab position that the 
plo is the sole legitimate representative of palestinian arabs 
some 15 million live on the west bank and gaza which were 
controlled until 1967 by jordan and egypt 
shultzs plan does not insist that israel relinquish all of the 
territory also it excludes the plo from the negotiations 
palestinians approved by the plo would be in a delegation with 
jordan 
maksoud said an international conference must have the power to 
settle disputes between israel and the arabs it cannot be a 
ceremonial opening or an event or some sort of an international 
framework he said taking direct aim at shamirs proposal 
maksoud also criticized reagans appeal to both sides to accept 
the us initiative without modification 
in light of what he called bitter arab experience he said 
we find ourselves unwilling to be rushed into a timetable 
presented on a takeitorleaveit basis

a group of people living on the georgiasouth 
carolina line says theres nothing wrong with strom thurmond unless 
its the name of a lake shared by the two states 
the group met privately with the veteran south carolina 
republican for 35 minutes thursday to present petitions signed by 
42000 people who want the senators help in restoring the lakes 
original name lake clarks hill 
of the signatures 30000 came from the georgia side and a 
legislative proposal to repeal the new name is sponsored by eight 
democratic congressmen from that state 
thurmond said he would stay out of the dispute which began in 
december when congress renamed the 42yearold army corps of 
engineers lake quickly and with no public hearings 
he told them he feels the matter is settled and since he did 
not instigate it or push for it he feels it would be inappropriate 
for him to get involved now press secretary christopher simpson 
said 
the meeting also was attended by a group of south carolina 
legislators who want to keep the thurmond name were disturbed 
that this is going to be an embarrassment to sen thurmond said 
state sen john drummond of greenwood 
drummond said the south carolina lawmakers told the citizens 
group that it would be an embarrassment for thurmond to ask the 
whole congress and the president to reverse what theyve done 
thurmond himself had nothing to say referring all questions to 
simpson 
roy giles a lincolnton ga restaurant owner and one of the 
leaders of keep our lake clarks hill said the petitions 
presented thursday propose a compromise that would restore the name 
of the lake to clarks hill but would retain the new strom thurmond 
name for the dam and road 
sen thurmond will have his monument and the people will have 
their lake back giles said of the compromise which has been 
incorporated into a bill that rep doug barnard an augusta ga 
democrat has introduced in the house with the backing of the other 
seven democrats in the georgia house delegation 
giles said he was surprised when the south carolina lawmakers 
showed up at the meeting because thurmond originally had agreed to 
meet privately with representatives of the citizens group opposed 
to the name change 
giles said the name change will cause financial hardships for 
businesses around the lake that have built their reputations using 
the clarks hill name and he vowed that the group will continue its 
fight even without thurmonds help 
were going to continue to get signatures he said were 
not going to let up this was just an opportunity to present our 
case to sen thurmond and ask for his help

oliver north former national security adviser john poindexter and 
two arms dealers all four were involved in the diversion of 
profits from iran arms sales to the nicaraguan contra rebels 
israel is seeking immunity from prosecution for four israelis 
involved in the sale of us antitank missiles to iran in 1985 and 
1986 said an israeli official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
walsh in turn wants records of israeli transactions with north 
and the two indicted arms dealers richard secord and albert hakim 
the official said 
yossi gal a spokesman for the israeli embassy said a meeting 
today was aimed at finding an acceptable solution for cooperation 
between the two governments 
israel is seeking immunity for amiram nir a israeli 
antiterrorism official david kimche the former foreign ministry 
director and businessmen yaacov nimrodi and al schwimmer all 
worked with north on the iran arms sales 
gal also said that rafael vardi a retired israeli general who 
compiled a chronology of israels role in the arms sales to iran 
met with walsh on thursday several israeli lawyers accompanied 
him according to the israeli official who spoke anonymously 
elyakim rubinstein a top aide to israeli prime minister yitzhak 
shamir is expected to join vardi today for talks with walshs 
staff gal said 
rubinstein who has been in the united states with shamir for 
discussions on a middle east peace plan also will meet with reagan 
administration officials about the case gal said he refused to 
discuss the meetings further 
james wieghart walshs spokesman said he knew nothing of the 
meetings but confirmed that walsh has been negotiating with the 
israelis for a long time about access to the records on the swiss 
accounts 
the israeli official who spoke on condition he remain anonymous 
said walsh is seeking bank account records to corroborate other 
evidence about israels transactions with north secord and hakim 
walsh angered israel last year by issuing subpoenas against nir 
kimche nimrodi and schwimmer meaning they could be arrested if 
they visited the united states and refused to testify 
under pressure from the united states rubinstein and vardi 
compiled classified historical and financial chronologies that were 
provided to the congressional irancontra committees last year the 
documents detailed the role israel played in shipping us missiles 
to iran as part of a plan to secure freedom for american hostages 
in lebanon 
during the congressional hearings israel refused to allow the 
four israelis involved in the arms sales to testify but agreed to 
let vardi answer questions the congressional panels did not call 
vardi saying they were satisfied with the written chronologies

fbi director william sessions is coming under 
increasing fire on capitol hill in connection with the racial 
harassment case of black fbi agent donald rochon 
on thursday rep john conyers dmich accused sessions of 
sidestepping and engaging in a classic stall by promising 
to give a full report to congress at a later date on rochon and 
equal employment matters 
i am frankly deeply disappointed in your lack of candor and 
outrage about the terrorism that is going on conyers said in 
referring to the rochon case and other allegations of 
discrimination within the bureau 
rochon is suing the fbi and the justice department alleging 
racial discrimination harassment and death threats from fellow 
agents and supervisors when he worked at fbi offices in omaha 
neb and chicago the federal equal employment opportunity 
commission has upheld rochons racial discrimination allegations in 
connection with his stay in omaha in 1983 and 1984 
there has been no sidestepping at all none responded 
sessions who has been fbi director for four months 
he said he was in almost total agreement with conyers 
concerns and said he is committed to seeing that the bureau is 
precisely what it strives to be an organization which has no 
racism 
however sessions said that with lawsuits pending he cannot 
conduct a detailed discussion during this awkward period of 
time 
in addition to the rochon case hispanic agents have filed a 
classaction suit in el paso texas accusing the fbi of racial 
discrimination 
blacks and hispanics each make up slightly more than 4 percent 
of the bureaus more than 9000 agents

legislation to double the maximum amount of 
disaster aid to households and provide money to combat erosion and 
flooding along the great lakes faces an uncertain future in the 
senate after passing the house 
the disaster relief amendments opposed by the reagan 
administration as too expensive passed the house thursday by a 
vote of 36813 a companion bill with 27 cosponsors has languished 
in the senate since its introduction there last year 
under the amendments the federal emergency management agency 
would be barred from paying less than a 75 percent share of aid to 
local governments qualifying for public repair projects following a 
disaster the amendments also would add guidelines to speed the 
distribution of postdisaster aid and permit federal funds to be 
used for local projects to lessen the effect of disasters before 
they strike 
the cap on grants for states disaster preparation programs 
would climb from 25000 to 50000 and the maximum on awards to 
individuals to rebuild households and clear away debris would go 
from 5000 to 10000 with the amount to be adjusted according to 
the economy 
in addition the legislation would provide for the first time 
a mechanism to appeal decisions on eligibility for disaster and 
emergency assistance 
the legislation has its roots in the federal response to 
tornadoes that raced through western pennsylvania ohio and 
surrounding areas in 1985 killing 88 people 
fema agrees that finetuning is needed to the 1974 act 
establishing a coordinated federal program to prepare for and 
respond to hurricanes tornadoes storms and floods but the 
administration has pushed for legislation that wouldnt increase 
costs to the federal government 
the congressional budget office has estimated the cost of the 
house easure at 50 to 100 million per year in addition to 
updating the disaster response program the legislation would 
provide grants and army corps of engineers assistance for flooding 
and erosion prevention in great lakes states 
highwater levels have caused an estimated 200 million in 
damage to shoreline houses and communities the northeastmidwest 
congressional coalition said states would be required to put up 30 
percent matching share of the federal grants 
us rep tom ridge rpa the principal sponsor of the bill 
said the 1985 tornadoes that killed 65 people in pennsylvania alone 
made him painfully aware of shortcomings with fema 
disaster victims were waiting in line for temporary housing up 
to six weeks ridge said during thursdays floor debate 
i was touring demolished home sites arguing with federal 
officials about debris removal he said they werent concerned 
about debris removal they were concerned about the specific 
inflexible application of regulations regardless of the impact on 
public health and safety

the worlds business and financial communities 
should be encouraged by the ease with which the house budget 
committee has approved a 11 trillion federal budget for the 1989 
fiscal year the panels chairman says 
chairman william h gray iii dpa made the remarks thursday 
after his committee approved the budget resolution with support 
from lawmakers of both parties 
i think its good in terms of helping the volatility out there 
in the equity markets and sending a signal to our trading 
partners that were willing to work cooperatively in terms of 
addressing the deficit gray said 
the budget plan meets the spending and tax strictures 
established by last years budget summit pact between congress and 
president reagan that accord was sparked by octobers stock market 
crash and the resulting calls to slash the governments deficits 
which have surpassed 200 billion in recent years 
the spending document would leave a deficit of 1341 billion 
according to the budget panel enough to avoid automatic spending 
cuts under the grammrudman budgetbalancing law 
but to get to that figure lawmakers adopted the white houses 
economic forecasts and abandoned gloomier estimates produced by 
their own congressional budget office that would have added 35 
billion in red ink to the deficit projection 
under grammrudman the deficit target for fiscal 1989 which 
begins oct 1 is 136 billion spending would be cut to that level 
automatically if the deficit exceeds the target by 10 billion 
the document expected to be considered by the full house next 
week reduces reagans request for science and space and allocates 
the money to urban and social programs 
the budget resolution was pieced together over the last several 
days during closeddoor meetings between committee republicans and 
democrats the panel approved the document on a voice vote with no 
objections during a fiveminute public session 
rep willis d gradison jr of ohio senior committee republican 
at the meeting said the resolution had been written in an 
excellent spirit of bipartisanship and had very strong 
support from gop lawmakers 
the bipartisan camaraderie was in stark contrast to last year 
when republicans walked away from the budget resolution process and 
the bickering lasted for months 
the budget pact reached last november between reagan and 
lawmakers locked in new taxes and spending levels for fiscal 1988 
and 1989 for defense foreign affairs and overall domestic spending 
lawmakers are proving eager to avoid reopening those questions 
and sparking potentially bitter fights in an election year thus 
the main fight has been over distributing the 1692 billion the 
summit allows for the domestic programs that congress directly 
oversees and are not financed under automatic formulas 
i think the summit agreement basically set the tone for the 
year said rep leon panetta dcalif 
in the 1989 budget he presented to congress on feb 18 reagan 
proposed a 20 percent increase in spending on space and science 
programs to 131 billion the budget panel looking to restore 
proposed cuts to several other domestic programs pared that 
increase to 122 billion 
the committee felt that was a realistic figure for nasa to 
carry out its mission gray said 
where reagan proposed cutting deeply into programs such as mass 
transit assistance and eliminating other programs such as federal 
aid to amtrak the passenger railroad the budget committee would 
retain current levels of spending or reduce it by 1 percent or 2 
percent 
for programs for lowincome people such as job training and 
child health care the budget panels proposal would allow enough 
of a spending increase to keep up with inflation expected to reach 
4 percent this year 
the committees budget also rejects 12 billion in savings in 
medicare that reagan had proposed spends 15 billion for aids 
research slightly more than the president proposed and retains 
previously planned levels of spending for education fighting drugs 
and providing aid to the homeless 
the panel also proposed a 3 percent pay raise for federal 
workers and civilian employees of the military gray said lawmakers 
will have to decide later this year whether members of congress 
would qualify for the salary increases 
the committees budget leaves intact the summit agreement 
spending levels of 294 billion for military programs for the 1989 
fiscal year and 14 billion in new taxes mostly on corporations 
the senate plans to write its budget resolution next month the 
resolution does not need the presidents signature and it serves 
as a blueprint for actual spending legislation to be enacted later 
in a separate action the white house sent congress a 
supplemental spending request for this fiscal year that would 
increase spending by 11 billion mostly for veterans 
another 57 million would pay for raises for federal court 
employees and 54 million more would be for disability payments to 
people with black lung disease 
the measure would allow an additional 42 billion to be 
transferred among agencies

a frustrated congressman had to turn to the 
japanese embassy this week to find out exactly what the senate was 
proposing to do on trade legislation 
that is just not the way to do business rep tom downey 
dny said thursday following a closeddoor caucus at which 
grievances over the incident got a fullscale airing 
at the caucus rep william frenzel rminn expressed outrage 
that he had to rely on the japanese embassy to get a copy of the 
senate proposal on how best to crack down on japanese barriers to 
american exports 
pat eveland frenzels administrative assistant confirmed that 
the congressman was disturbed about the delay in transmitting the 
senate report to the house and raised the issue at the closeddoor 
session 
we think it would be nice if the senate would decide to give 
us the trade offer first before the private sector and the press 
she said frenzel himself was not available to discuss the matter 
she added 
the document was a compromise offer from senate members of a 
housesenate conference committee that is trying to merge rival 
versions of a 1000page trade bill passed by the two houses last 
year 
among other things the senates offer proposed to erase from 
the bill the controversial trade plan sponsored by democratic 
presidential hopeful richard gephardt dmo his plan calling for 
10 percent yearly rollbacks in japanese trade surpluses is 
contained only in the house version 
the senates alternative proposal would require the us trade 
representative to draw up a list of japanese barriers to american 
products and then either negotiate an end to them or retaliate 
eveland said she was on the telephone with a japanese embassy 
official early wednesday morning discussing the senates offer 
when to her surprise it became evident that they had a copy of 
it 
she said she asked the japanese for a copy and they immediately 
duplicated theirs and sent it by messenger to frenzels office on 
capitol hill she said a version was not available from the senate 
finance committee until 1230 pm wednesday 
it remained unclear just how the japanese managed to obtain 
their copy of the offer 
when eveland was told that several copies were distributed to 
reporters who worked late in the senate press gallery on tuesday 
night she said well now well know where to go

henry kissinger may be called to testify at lyndon 
larouches trial to rebut charges by larouches lawyers that the 
government launched a vendetta against the political extremist a 
prosecutor says 
larouches attorneys who contend the federal charges against 
larouche were fabricated showed the jury letters thursday in which 
kissinger as secretary of state requested an fbi investigation of 
larouche groups 
kissinger may be called to testify that he was a target of 
protests and harassment by larouche followers and was justified in 
seeking the probe assistant us attorney john markham said 
larouche lawyers said they would welcome an opportunity to 
crossexamine kissinger whom the fringe politician has labeled a 
soviet spy 
larouche six aides and five larouche organizations are charged 
with conspiring to obstruct a grand jury investigation of alleged 
credit card and loan fraud by larouches 1984 presidential 
campaign four of the organizations are charged with fraud 
also thursday richard welsh an accountant and treasurer with 
several larouche groups testified that larouches two campaign 
organizations budgeted up to 125000 a month to pay back credit 
card charges that cardholders claimed were unauthorized 
prosecutors allege the campaign relied on fraudulent charges to 
stay afloat when legitimate fundraising stalled knowing it would 
take several weeks before unauthorized charges would be deducted 
from the campaigns bank account 
the campaign allegedly misused the chargecard numbers given by 
contributors for donations or by people who bought books and other 
literature from the larouche groups 
the defendants contend evidence of widespread fraud and 
obstruction was fabricated by fbi and cia infiltrators as part of a 
reagan administration effort to ruin larouche and cripple his 
highly successful fundraising 
admitted as evidence to the jury thursday was a series of 
letters between kissinger thenfbi director william h webster and 
oliver revell the fbis executive assistant director discussing 
larouche organizations 
in an august 1982 letter to webster kissinger complained that 
larouche supporters had become increasingly obnoxious in their 
criticism of him and asked whether the fbi could investigate 
larouche groups 
revell responded with two letters saying the agency would 
investigate kissingers complaint and that there appeared to be 
some evidence of illegal telephone use by larouche supporters to 
harass kissinger 
no larouche followers ever were charged with harassing or 
threatening kissinger 
the defense contends revell later directed fbi infiltration of 
larouche groups at the request of lt col oliver north the former 
white house national security aide indicted wednesday for his role 
in the irancontra affair 
larouche contends he has been the target of a 20year government 
vendetta that climaxed in 1984 because of his outspoken criticism 
of reagans contraaid programs 
last week the defense was given two declassified documents one 
a memo to north from another pivotal figure in the irancontra 
affair discussing apparent efforts to collect information against 
larouche 
the discovery of those documents 60 days into the trial prompted 
keeton to order an extensive search of government records 
including those of the white house and vice president george bush 
for any evidence of infiltration or harassment of larouche groups 
the searches are expected to be completed by next week

the army battalions ordered to honduras by 
president reagan include two from the renowned 82nd airborne 
division and two from a newly activated light division 
organized for quick movement around the world 
the 82nd airborne and the 7th light infantry division are based 
at opposite ends of the country fort bragg nc and fort ord 
calif respectively and are assigned to different corps 
but the two divisions and their battalions share a common 
emphasis and mission maintain a high state of readiness and be 
ready to operate on short notice in virtually all parts of the 
world 
the 82nd airborne as its name implies is trained to drop in 
uninvited by parachute when combat requires the 7th light 
infantry on the other hand doesnt use parachutes but can arrive 
even more quickly 
the 82nd is renowned because of its combat record and its role 
as the one army unit that is on constant alert 
during world war ii the unit participated in six different 
campaigns including sicily and the normandy invasion its 
commanders included gens omar bradley and matthew ridgway 
it was during and immediately after normandy that the 82nd 
really made its mark taking horrendous casualties but preventing 
the germans from moving forward to stop the invasion 
the 82nd also has fought in vietnam and grenada and some of its 
units have served with the peacekeeping force in the sinai within 
the united states it helped keep the peace during the integration 
battles in the south quelled riots in detroit in 1967 and kept 
order during the republican national convention in miami in 1968 
the 7th was the first of what the army hopes will be four 
activeduty light divisions with about 10500 soldiers assigned to 
it instead of the 17000 assigned to a normal mechanized division 
the 7th is full of riflemen carries no heavy vehicles and is armed 
with only modest amounts of artillery and antitank weapons 
the idea behind the light divisions was to provide a president 
the option of using a fairly large force that could be moved 
rapidly around the world 
for example a normal heavy division such as those assigned to 
europe would require about 2850 flights of a c141 to deploy the 
82nd airborne if the entire division moved out would require 
about 1500 a light division could show up with just 500 flights 
theres just so much more mobility noted lt col greg 
rixon an army spokesman the tradeoff is you cant leave it in 
a battle zone on its own for very long it has to be resupplied 
and sustained 
the pentagon said thursday it expected the four battalions from 
the 82nd and 7th to link up on the ground in honduras as a brigade 
task force for a readiness exercise codenamed golden pheasant 
to be conducted in cooperation with honduran troops 
the task force is commanded by army brig gen daniel r 
schroeder of the xviii airborne corps and a deputy brig gen 
james j johnson of the 82nd 
besides the four battalions of infantry the task force is 
bringing with it a small helicopter cavalry unit with eight 
aircraft three batteries from field artillery units and a brigade 
headquarters company 
normally army units sent to honduras for exercises report to 
joint task force bravo a small headquarters unit based in honduras 
to coordinate us troop activities as of thursday for example 
the pentagon said about 2050 national guard and reserve engineers 
were on temporary duty in honduras

trenton nj am new jersey senate democratic leader john 
lynch says he will abandon a proposal to send a slate of 
uncommitted delegates to the democratic national convention 
lynch said thursday he will drop a movement he headed and bow to 
the request of sen bill bradley dnj 
bradley met with democratic leaders wednesday and asked them to 
drop their efforts toward an uncommitted slate saying the drive 
could be interpreted outside the state as a movement to back him as 
a presidential candidate 
senator bradley feels the uncommitted movement would be 
perceived as a stalking horse for a candidacy at a brokered 
convention lynch said 
lynch has said an uncommitted slate could enable new jersey to 
play a decisive role at the convention if no democratic candidate 
wins a majority of delegates in the primaries

a close friend of attorney general edwin meese 
iii said meese interceded on wedtech corps behalf to gain federal 
approval for financing a witness testified at the racketeering 
trial of rep mario biaggi 
the witness former wedtech vice chairman mario moreno said 
meeses lawyer and friend e robert wallach told him at a 1983 
meeting across the street from the white house that meese had asked 
thencommerce secretary malcolm baldrige to sign the necessary 
documents 
moreno said thursday he was told that baldrige balked at signing 
because the matter was too hot politically but two or three 
days later the matter was resolved 
moreno recounted the meeting with wallach in his third day of 
testimony at federal court in manhattan where biaggi and six 
others are on trial on charges of turning wedtech into a 
racketeering enterprise through an alleged series of bribery and 
extortion schemes 
wedtech a nowbankrupt defense contractor at the time was 
delinquent on two loans of more than 2 million each one from the 
commerce departments economic development administration the 
other guaranteed by eda 
the company in 1983 wanted eda approval to refinance the loans 
with a new bank 
but the eda chief assistant commerce secretary carlos campbell 
resisted pressure from former white house political director lyn 
nofziger and his lobbying partner mark bragg to approve the plan 
moreno one of four exwedtech officials who have pleaded guilty 
to bribing public officials and other crimes testified wallach 
said he was going to a national security meeting at 6 am and 
told me to wait in lafayette park across from the white house 
moreno said he saw wallach enter the white house and when he 
emerged two hours later wallach said he talked to his friend 
over there 
moreno said he understood that wallachs friend was meese who 
was then presidential counselor 
wallach said they would try to get another assistant commerce 
secretary besides campbell to approve the financing and moreno said 
he was told to call bragg 
moreno said he was told that no assistant secretary could sign 
the papers legally but there was a vacancy in the department and 
perhaps a new assistant secretary could sign two or three days 
later the problem was resolved he said 
nofziger was convicted last month of illegal lobbying for 
wedtech and other companies the conviction is under appeal 
last december a special prosecutor said there was insufficient 
evidence to charge meese in the wedtech case

a steady stream of air 
transports brought us soldiers and equipment in a show of force 
so hastily arranged that american commanders scrambled to develop 
training exercises to keep them busy 
a dramatic air drop of 800 paratroopers of the 82nd airborne 
division was scheduled for early today 
planes later in the day were to bring 1100 more soldiers from 
the 7th infantry division in fort ord calif completing the 3000 
man deployment ordered by president reagan to counter what he 
called an invasion by nicaraguan sandinista troops 
hundreds of soldiers on thursday bedded down in dusty fields 
near the airstrip awaiting orders for training missions which 
normally are arranged several months in advance for such exercises 
this exercise got popped on us two days ago said maj mike 
nason public affairs officer for the 82nd airborne were having 
to compress all the training arrangements 
an example of how the operation was being altered because of the 
lack of planning was todays scheduled parachute drop normally 
that would be the first wave of an airborne assault but nason said 
the army needed to use carefully the limited air transport that was 
available on such short notice 
army commanders met through the day thursday with their honduran 
counterparts and made plans for the first of a string of joint 
exercises 
troops were told to expect to spend about 10 days in honduras 
but military spokesmen said there was no official timetable yet for 
them to leave 
the first joint exercise a helicopter movement scheduled today 
would take the us troops 25 miles closer to the area where the 
white house claims the nicaraguans have invaded however they 
would still be more than 100 miles west of the area of reported 
fighting 
commanders insisted their orders barred them from getting near 
the scene of the fighting however they said they were prepared to 
take action if the orders were made the troops appeared eager for 
action 
we wait for this said pfc dallas hutchison of germantown 
md who was manning an m60 machine gun guarding the bivouac site 
officers were eager to take advantage of the training exercise 
in a year when budget constraints forced them to cancel maneuvers 
maybe at the highest echelons of the government they have some 
political reasons for us to be here but we see it as a blessing in 
disguise nason said 
nason said the divisions training budget had been cut 25 
percent and plans for exercises in panama had been canceled

a highranking sandinista 
officer flew about 25 journalists most of them american to this 
rugged outpost on the honduran border his troops retook from contra 
rebels in a major offensive 
the reporters were brought in thursday to see it was quiet in 
the jungle region about 175 miles from managua and told the 
offensive had ended 
about noon two unidentified jet planes roared in from honduras 
and dropped at least five bombs the journalists and their hosts 
dived for cover the bombs exploding as close as 70 yards away 
no one was hurt and nothing at the sandinista military 
encampment damaged 
the region is where the white house claims nicaraguan troops 
entered honduras in pursuit of the ussupplied rebels and the 
attack came just hours after the first of 3000 american troops 
began arriving in honduras in response to the alleged incursion 
honduran said it had mounted the attack but claimed it had 
targeted only sandinista forces in honduran territory 
the bombs landed along the narrow coco river which marks the 
border between the two countries puffs of black smoke curled over 
the banana trees 
lt col javier carrion the deputy chief of the sandinista 
armys general staff said two bombs landed in nicaraguan territory 
and one in honduras 
he said the attack appeared more harassment than an attempt to 
hit any specific target none of the five sovietmade helicopters 
in the area were hit 
in washington reagan administration sources who insisted on 
anonymity claimed one sovietmade helicopter was damaged on the 
ground in nicaragua the soviet union suplies the sandinistas with 
military hardware and training 
carrion said jets had similarly buzzed the coco river earlier in 
the day 
he denied that sandinista troops had crossed the illdefined 
border but said there are sectors in the mountains here where 
you can get lost its easy to confuse the topography 
president daniel ortega has refused to confirm or deny whether 
an incursion had occurred military officials in honduras said 
their troops were surrounding about 2000 sandinista soldiers in 
honduran territory on thursday 
standing in a jungle clearing carrion showed the reporters on a 
map where he said sandinista troops had used artillery to destroy 
contra camps along a sixmile route on both sides of the coco river 
he said the offensive begun march 8 was halted on wednesday on 
ortegas instructions after the sandinistas had pushed 1800 rebels 
back into honduras carrion said his troops received air support 
from sovietmade helioptergunships and an46 propellerdriven 
planes with bombs attached 
the sandinistas killed 92 contras and wounded 300 but no 
prisoners were taken during the eightday offensive carrion said 
he said it would be difficult for the contras to return to the 
area which they had used since last year for makeshift camps 
carrion said sandinista troops destroyed 120 plastic and wood 
shacks that the rebels had been using to store supplies for 
sleeping and as clinics

bettereducated people are more likely to return 
to work within a year of their first heart attack says a study 
that found the severity of the attack and the nature of the 
victims job to be less important factors 
the study published in todays issue of the journal of the 
american medical association tracked 151 patients ages 24 to 70 
for one year after they suffered their first heart attack and noted 
whether they returned to work 
it seemed to us that many doctors assumed bad heart attack 
he doesnt return to work good heart attack he does thats just 
not so said dr g richard smith one of the studys two authors 
if the patient is welleducated and has a job that is not 
physically stressful theres a good chance theyll go back within 
the first year said coauthor diane orourke 
smith and ms orourke said their study was designed to test the 
predictive value of factors raised in previous studies of 
heartattack patients the study did not find why the level of 
education made such a difference they said 
but smith a psychiatrist and professor at the university of 
arkansas for medical sciences said his clinical sense is that 
people who finish high school and beyond are able to persevere 
and are adaptable all of those areas come into play in health 
while there may be some truth to the notion that bettereducated 
people have less physically taxing jobs the study was adjusted to 
account for those factors said ms orourke an assistant 
professor at the university 
the profile developed by smith and ms orourke ranked factors 
according to their predictive value 
educational level was followed by the physical activity demanded 
by the job the severity of the heart attack and the patients 
perception of his health after the attack 
of the 109 patients who returned to work 78 had at least a high 
school education and a job that demanded only low levels of 
physical activity just 15 patients fitting that description did 
not return to work within the first year 
on the other end of the spectrum 27 patients who failed to 
complete high school and had physically taxing jobs did not return 
to work within the first year however 31 patients in the same 
group returned within the year

thousands of peole 
prayed cheered danced beat drums and observed other traditions 
today as a total eclipse of the sun darkened a wide area of 
indonesia and the southern philippines 
the sun was blacked out by the shadow of the moon for up to four 
minutes along a 108mile swath that moved from the indian ocean 
across indonesia and the southern philippine island of mindanao 
a partial eclipse was visible across a wide area of asia as far 
west as india including southeast asia china japan and new 
guinea as well as parts of australia and the pacific islands 
scientists said the eclipse would end at sunset in the gulf of 
alaska 
clouds obscured the solar spectacular in jakarta indonesia 
hong kong and in the eastern mindanao city of davao where 
thousands of tourists and scientists had gathered to observe the 
eclipse 
but it was visible for about 3 minutes in this city about 650 
miles southeast of manila despite early scattered clouds president 
corazon aquino flew in to witness the event 
richard fisher of the high altitude observatory in boulder 
colo said that despite scattered clouds scientists were 
confident they had taken useful pictures of the eclipse 
in jakarta wilson sinambela of the national institute of 
aeronautics said a total eclipse was observed in several parts of 
the country including by about 1000 tourists in the south sumatra 
capital palembang 
he said thousands of indonesians prayed and beat drums to herald 
the start of the eclipse which began in southwestern sumatra 
before heading on to the philippines 
in kuala lumpur where a partial eclipse blocked out about 80 
percent of the sun some malaysian hindus visited temples to pray 
for protection against harm during the eclipse 
in kurukshetra india an estimated 1 million pilgrims dipped 
into the waters of the sacred sannihit and brahmsarover tanks after 
a public address system announced the start of the eclipse hymns 
were chanted and conch shells blown during the ceremony about 90 
miles north of new delhi 
clouds blocked the first moments of the eclipse in general 
santos city but the cloud cover broke setting off wild cheering 
among the thousands who watched the phenomenon in a scorching 
tropical heat 
street lights switched on and members of the naragcas tribe in 
the city for a festival danced in the streets to the beat of drums 
in baguio city 130 miles north of manila pregnant women of the 
local ilocano community rinsed their hair during the eclipse with 
water dripped from burned rice straws in a traditional ritual 
according to local superstition babies conceived during or 
shortly before an eclipse will be deformed unless their mothers 
practice the ritual 
many other filipinos marked the eclipse by going to church the 
philippines is asias only predominately christian country 
this phenomenon is a clear reminder from god for mankind to 
repent its sins said theresa teopengco a government employee 
officials said about 20000 tourists and scientists from around 
the world had come to the southern philippines to watch the 
eclipse the last one expected here for at least 50 years 
scientists said the area afforded the best opportunity to 
witness and study the eclipse because skies are usually clear this 
time of year 
but in davao city 60 miles to the northeast morning clouds 
sent hundreds scurrying to the airport for flights to general 
santos 
church bells in davao tolled while police and civilians set off 
firecrackers and fired weapons in the air to mark the eclipse 
in manila thousands turned out under clear skies to see the 
partial eclipse that blocked about 75 percent of the suns surface 
at its height 
police said four people were injured when a passenger bus 
collided with a jeep during the eclipse 
the drivers were probably looking skyward when the accident 
occurred said policeman ricardo manansala its impossible to 
gaze at the sky and drive a vehicle at the same time 
solar eclipses occur when the moon positions itself between the 
earth and the sun the chinese first recorded a total solar eclipse 
in 2137 bc regarding them as signs of a battle to death between 
the sun and the dragon

demonstrate skills that could come in handy in this northeast 
alaska town but might not go over too well on national tv 
first the teamaking contest each of the young women must 
build a fire on the snow melt enough snow to make one cup boil 
the water and brew the tea 
then theres the snowshoe race theres not much call for 
threeinch heels in this secluded yukon river community of less 
than 700 people 
finally queen candidates must show their prowess at skinning a 
snowshoe hare known in some parts of alaska as a lowbush 
moose not surprisingly the event is not a favorite of most

government lawyers say that deception by a 
former fbi agent led to claims by teamsters president jackie 
presser that the fbi authorized him to start a union 
payrollpadding scheme 
the justice department lawyers said thursday they believe a 
trial jury should determine whether the fbi gave presser and two 
other union officials authorization to allegedly embezzle money 
from his own union locals treasury as pressers lawyers contend 
the government has taken the position that fbi agents never 
authorized any embezzlement the justice departments organized 
crime strike force said in documents filed thursday in us 
district court it also said the socalled authorization defense 
raises factual issues which only a trial jury may resolve

scheduled to stand trial with presser on july 12 
the indictment alleged that presser in his capacity as a local 
507 officer masterminded a 700000 scheme to pay four people who 
received union money without doing any work for the union 
pressers lawyers say the fbi told presser who was an fbi 
informant to pay certain people who had connections to organized 
crime so the agency could obtain information from them through 
presser 
in documents filed with the court march 7 pressers lawyers 
said the government has supplied statements written in 1985 by 
former clevelandbased fbi agents patrick j foran and martin p 
mccann jr that say the agency authorized presser to make the 
payments 
but prosecutors william s lynch stephen h jigger and bernard 
a smith referred to a finding last week by a federal appeals court 
in washington that the authorization defense is a tangled web of 
deception and is the product of a calculated lie 
the appeals courts finding came in the federal prosecution of 
robert s friedrick a former clevelandbased fbi agent who was 
fired after an indictment alleged he concocted a scheme to avert 
the indictment of presser 
most of the evidence against friedrick was ruled invalid when a 
judge found that justice department lawyers misled him by making 
him believe he was immune from prosecution

alderman joe lanahan may no longer have to 
worry about which side of the bed he sleeps on 
lanahans right to retain his city council seat has sparked 
heated debate in this st louis suburb of 3800 people since just 
after christmas when he told the council he had his land surveyed 
and found that about half his house was in the city and half in 
madison county 
lanahan said he sleeps in the city however because the line 
falls across one corner at the foot of his bed he also pays city 
taxes 
the troy city council on thursday unanimously approved an 
ordinance requiring city officials to live entirely within city 
limits but all members agreed that if lanahan annexed the rest of 
his property to the city he could remain an alderman 
lanahan said he was pleased with the decision and will seek to 
have the section annexed a crowd of about 50 supporters applauded 
when the agreement was finally reached 
this has been a real hassle for us he said im glad to 
see the support of the people you really dont know how many 
friends you have till something like this happens 
three petitions supporting lanahan containing 380 signatures 
were presented to the council before the vote

terrorist violence in northern ireland briefly cast a pall over 
st patricks day celebrations in new york boston and other 
cities but for most of the more than 15 million paradegoers the 
usual high spirits flowed freely 
new yorks traditional parade up fifth avenue began in midtown 
thursday with somber words from political and religious leaders 
but soon the bands sunshine and some surreptitious sipping 
produced the usual festive atmosphere among the more than 1 million 
marchers and watchers 
more than 200000 people crowded the sidewalk in downtown 
chicago to watch the 40000 marchers 50 floats and 45 bands that 
made up the annual parade portions of the chicago river were dyed 
green for the day of revelry 
in kansas city mo 70000 irish and wouldbe irish 
paradegoers braved a wet snowfall while 321000 people thronged 
the streets of savannah ga in the 164th edition of that citys 
st patricks day procession the secondlargest behind new yorks 
new yorks cardinal john j oconner in his homily at a mass 
preceding the parade reflected on a terrorists 
grenadeandgunfire attack on an irish republican army funeral in 
belfast northern ireland that left three dead and 68 wounded the 
day before 
i hope everyone marching will remember those killed catholic 
or protestant said oconnor who reviewed the parade from the 
steps of st patricks cathedral the violence is insane 
oconnor said new yorks parade was not canceled because 
thats not the irish way 
in boston where the parade is scheduled for sunday mayor 
raymond l flynn said the root of the violence in northern ireland 
was the utter despair that british rule has perpetrated 
the crowds in various shades of green and varying stages of 
sobriety were generally wellbehaved and few arrests were 
reported in new york 15 summonses were issued for drinking in 
public and only one person was arrested for disorderly conduct

words on a cold evening and a full moon on a dark night

the aids virus could spread among american 
high school and college students because the young tend not to 
believe health warnings are meant for them according to surgeon 
general c everett koop 
my greatest concern is with the group aged 15 to 24 koop 
told a convention of hospital administrators thursday 
officials may have a better idea of the extent of the aids virus 
among college students by the end of the year as more colleges go 
along with a us centers for disease control request to conduct 
blind blood testing koop said 
under such procedures already used by hospitals in about 40 
cities blood drawn for other purposes is tested for aids without 
the sample being identified by patient 
he noted that sexually transmitted diseases in general are 
rising at the steepest rate in 16 years in spite of the 
tremendous educational campaign in 1987 where for the first time 
in history we were discussing in the print media and on television 
very blunt statements about aids and sexually transmitted disease 
if there is hiv the aids virus out there and we know there 
is then there cant help but be some infection going on that were 
not going to see until we get down the road about five years he 
told the federation of american health systems 
it can take five years or more for aids to develop after a 
person contracts the virus 
so with teenagers who think that theyre immortal who 
always think the health message is meant for the person next to 
them who have sort of a sense that risktaking is sort of fun we 
have our most difficult target group especially with regard to 
heterosexual transmission 
earlier the federal official who oversees the medicare and 
medicaid health programs for the elderly and poor told the hospital 
executives they have been given an almost impossible task 
controlling physician decisionmaking 
there is deepseated ambivalence in america about intruding on 
physician decisionmaking said dr william l roper head of the 
health care financing administration but we cannot have both 
physician autonomy and cost constraint

a professor pleaded innocent to charges he 
lied about the dalkon shields safety when he testified for ah 
robins co in its attempt to disprove a womans claim that the 
contraceptive device made her sterile 
dr louis g keith remained free on a 10000 appearance bond 
after entering his plea here thursday he said he voluntarily took 
a leave of absence from northwestern university in chicago where 
he teaches obstetrics and gynecology until the case is resolved 
keith testified as an expert witness for ah robins the 
richmond vabased manufacturer of the device during trial of the 
lawsuit brought against the company by linda harre of tampa five 
years ago 
the 53yearold professor told the jury he had conducted 
experiments that verified the safety of the intrauterine device 
but a federal indictment announced march 3 contends that keith 
did not design direct conduct or do the scientific experiments 
about which he testified 
keith is charged with obstruction of justice and lying eight 
times on the witness stand if convicted on all counts he faces 45 
years in prison and 85000 in fines 
the case is being prosecuted by attorneys from the us justice 
department in washington 
mrs harre 39 alleged the shield made her sterile but she 
lost her 125 million lawsuit she won a new trial in march 1985 
when the 11th circuit court of appeals in atlanta issued an opinion 
that attacked the veracity of keiths testimony 
five months later robins filed for protection from its 
creditors in federal bankruptcy court in richmond due to the more 
than 14300 lawsuits filed against the company by women who claim 
to have suffered pelvic infections sterility or spontaneous 
abortions from using the dalkon shield 
the bankruptcy filing barred future action on the pending 
lawsuits 
ann c tighe of the chicago law firm representing keith said 
my client has proclaimed his innocence we will expect him to be 
vindicated 
after the brief hearing thursday us magistrate thomas wolfson 
set the trial for may before judge william castagna

a black man went to the 
gallows alone today after a judge granted a stay of execution to 
the sharpeville six who were aided in their appeal by an 
international clemency campaign 
the predawn hanging of tsepo letsoara 24 concluded without 
fanfare while world leaders clergymen and politicians continued 
to plea with the government to save the sharpeville six 
letsoara was convicted of the murder of a black woman in a port 
elizabeth township in october 1985 during nationwide racial 
unrest the victim grace mvetye was killed by the necklace 
method in which a gasolinesoaked tire was placed around her neck 
and set ablaze 
the sharpeville six five black men and a woman would have 
joined letsoara on the gallows today had pretoria supreme court 
justice willem human not granted a onemonth stay of execution 
thursday human made his decision after defense lawyers presented 
evidence of perjury by one of the prosecutions chief witnesses 
human granted the convicts four weeks to apply for a retrial 
the case was controversial because the six were convicted under 
the principle of common cause which held them responsible for 
the september 1984 death of town councilor jacob dlamini because 
they among a mob of 100 that stoned and burned dlamini to death in 
sharpeville 
dlamini was killed on the first day of riots that lasted nearly 
three years and claimed more than 2500 black lives 
president pw botha had ignored pleas from leaders of most 
western nations and from countries and organizations around the 
world to stop the executions the government said humans decision 
proves the wisdom of the state president and his ministers in 
deciding not to impede the due process of law 
the government also indicated a link between the scheduled 
hangings and a car bomb that exploded thursday in krugersdorp 
killing three black people and injuring 20 people the explosion 
occurred in a magistrates court where the sharpeville six had been 
held briefly between their arrest and trial 
police offered a 25000 reward for information leading to the 
arrest of a white man they say is a member of the outlawed african 
national congress the man was described as the prime suspect in 
the bombing 
deputy minister of information stoffel van der merwe said 
neither pressure from overseas nor car bombs would persuade the 
government to interfere in a court case 
the star an independent johannesburg newspaper reported today 
that botha granted clemency three weeks ago to a black policeman 
who was sentenced to death for murdering a youth two years ago in 
mamelodi the black township outside pretoria 
a spokesman for the department of justice said botha commuted 
constable george john sindanes death sentence to eight years in 
prison the spokesman said sindane was one of five people whose 
death sentences were commuted this year 
in other developments thursday 
attorneys said a 225 million wrongful arrest lawsuit was 
begun against the ministry of law and order after charges of 
sedition and subversion were dropped against a black roman catholic 
nun and 13 others who lived in black townships outside krugersdorp 
sister bernard ncube president of the federation of transvaal 
women spent 16 months in detention including 13 in solitary 
confinement after being charged the state alleged that the group 
established kangaroo courts campaigned against the police and 
initiated a boycott of whiteowned shops and buses 
the charges were dropped thursday after the prosecution refused 
to supply a court with details of the alleged acts 
also the attorney for freed african national congress leader 
govan mbeki said the government denied his request for a passport 
which he sought to visit his three children living in exile 
attorney priscilla jana said no reason was given for the denial 
mbeki was freed from prison in november after serving 24 years 
of a life sentence for treason and sabotage in connection with his 
activities as national chairman of the anc his oldest son thabo 
is an executive member of the anc in exile in lusaka zambia 
since his release from prison mbeki has been restricted to the 
port elizabeth area and banned from giving public speeches or news 
interviews

banana slug backers defeated abalone 
admirers in an california assembly battle to name the official 
state mollusk 
assemblyman trice harvey tried in vain thursday to add the 
abalone to a bill that would give the mollusk title to the banana 
slug his amendment failed 3637 
i feel there should be a sharing of this harvey said the 
banana slug could be the inland mollusk the abalone can be the 
marine mollusk 
he said the abalone was deserving because it is working hard 
to try to save the endangered sea otter 
the banana slug is yucky abalone is delicious he added 
assemblyman byron sher author of the banana slug bill opposed 
the amendment but said i respect mr harvey and enjoy abalone 
or is it the other way around 
he said the amendment would be a disservice to the dynamite 
bluebird troop of redwood city which did the research and 
convinced him to carry the slug bill 
also he said the abalone is not an accessible mollusk not 
only does it live underwater but it costs 38 a pound

tokyo is on a major western pacific fault and is 
earthquakeprone most temblors are mild causing little or no 
damage 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on

five income levels were established by the study published 
thursday by the us centers for disease control as income 
increased the study found there was a decrease in years of 
potential life lost a statistic that assumes each victim would 
have lived to age 70 
the study found that those in census tracts with a median 
household income of less than 12100 per year had a rate of 
years of potential life lost that was 50 percent higher than 
the overall rate and nearly twice as high as the rate for the 
highest income group above 19300 a year 
the greatest difference between the groups was found in deaths 
attributed to alcoholism the lowest income groups rating for 
years lost to alcoholism was 35 times greater than average and 
117 times higher than that of the most affluent group 
i think to the extent that portland and oregon are like the 
rest of the country we can conclude that people in low incomes 
have higher rates of premature mortality overall and in particular 
alcoholism and alcoholrelated mortality said dr gus birkhead 
a cdc epidemiologist 
they also found that chronic obstructive lung disease which 
probably means cigarette smoking is more prevalent in the poorer 
group 
birkhead said drinking and smoking may be higher among 
lowerincome people because of a lack of education about the 
dangers of those activities or it could be as a way to escape 
the frustrations of life 
poorer people also have less access to medical care he said 
the oregon study noted that past studies of alcholism and income 
have prompted theories that doctors are less likely to report 
alcholism on the death certificates of affluent people 
however the authors said the oregon center for health 
statistics questions doctors about any cause of death possibly 
related to alcohol the reported death rate for alcoholic liver 
disease and cirrhosis was twice as high in oregon as the national 
average in 1984 
birkhead said the study suggests that education programs need to 
be focused on lower income groups especially programs about the 
health dangers of cigarettes and alcohol

retired army maj gen richard secord under 
indictment in the irancontra affair today said he absolutely 
doesnt expect to serve time for his role in the secret weapons 
deals 
i think the legal system itself is going to see the merit of 
our case and will dismiss this indictment very quickly he said 
on abctvs good morning america 
asked if he expected to do time on the charges secord said 
absolutely not 
i dont see any merit whatsoever to the case thats been 
brought by the special counsel secord continued 
he said his lawyers will argue that independent counsel lawrence 
walsh is running amok and without authority in prosecuting the 
case 
i think that this is a completely uncontrollable and probably 
illegal independent counsel trying to justify the expenditure 
of millions and millions and millions of dollars of taxpayers 
money and 15 months of effort on a witch hunt secord said 
secord said that in return for doing his duty and responding to 
requests from the white house he finds himself trapped by a set 
of circumstances which none of us dreamed could ever be 
criminalized 
i guess if i were to write a book id proably entitle it if

approach to developing your skills as an artist as long as 
precautions are taken to avoid exposing people who do not wish to 
be exposed

arts classes and that warning signs must be posted on classroom 
doors in addition the panel also voted to require students 
between ages 15 and 18 to obtain written parental consent before

tamil rebels armed with pick axes 
swords and daggers killed 13 villagers military and police sources 
said today 
the attack thursday occurred near the historic buddhist temple 
town of digawapi in ampara district about 125 miles east of 
colombo said the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
more than 110 people most of them members of the sinhalese 
majority have been killed in the past 18 days in a series of 
attacks and reprisal attacks authorities have blamed the violence 
on the liberation tigers of tamil eelam the largest tamil militant 
group 
at least six women and two infants were among the victims of the 
massacre some reports said the toll could be 15 the sources said 
tamil extremists used swords and daggers to kill the villagers 
because gunshots would have alerted two sri lankan military camps 
nearby the sources said 
the tigers have been fighting for a separate homeland in the 
northern and eastern provinces where most of the tamils live 
the attack came hours after a sri lankan minister gamini 
dissanayeke returned from india and announced indian and sri 
lankan troops will patrol together in the east 
the tigers oppose an indiansponsored peace accord signed last 
july the accord was designed to end the 4yearold tamil guerrilla 
war against the sinhalesedominated government and the sinhalese 
ethnic group 
it would grant some autonomy to minority tamils in the north and 
east more than 50000 indian troops are in sri lanka to enforce 
the indiasri lanka peace pact and disarm the tigers 
under the accord sri lankan security forces were confined to 
their barracks and only indian troops were dealing with the tamils 
both tamil and sinhalese militants oppose the accord the tamil 
tigers have refused to surrender their arms as called for in the 
pact many sinhalese say the accord makes too many concessions to 
tamils 
india and sri lanka both have accused tamil militants of killing 
sinhalese in retaliatory attacks that began march 2 with the 
killing of 18 sinhalese in morawewa village in eastern trincomalee 
district 
on march 4 tamil rebels used land mines to blow up a crowded 
truck in the same area at least 26 sinhalese died in the explosion 
a band of men suspected of being sinhalese extremists then 
killed 22 tamil bus passengers near horawapotana village also in 
trincomalee district 
the predominantly hindu tamils make up 18 percent of sri lankas 
16 million people 75 percent of whom are sinhalese buddhists 
tamils say they are discriminated against by the sinhalese

a cloud of dioxin spread over an area of italy by 
an industrial accident in 1976 apparently caused no significant 
increase in birth defects according to a sixyear study 
the study reported in todays edition of the journal of the 
american medical association focused on babies born in and around 
seveso italy from 1977 through 1982 another study in todays 
journal reported that a blood test developed in sweden might 
simplify the job of determining how many vietnam veterans have been 
exposed to the defoliant agent orange 
the blood test is less expensive and less invasive than the 
standard test of fat tissue which requires surgery said wayne p 
wilson executive director of the new jersey state commission on 
agent orange 
a team led by dr peter c kahn of rutgers university compared 
both tests in a study involving 27 men and found little difference 
in the results 
although the tests now can be performed only in sweden and at 
the us centers for disease control wilson on thursday urged 
their increased use 
dioxin a byproduct of pesticide manufacture causes cancer in 
laboratory animals but has not been directly linked to cancers in 
humans 
the july 1976 accident at a chemical factory exposed more than 
37200 residents of seveso and three neighboring towns in northern 
italy to dioxin the largest population ever contaminated by the 
chemical 
the six physicians who performed the sixyear study wrote that 
it confirms previous analyses which concluded that if there is any 
increased risk related to dioxin the overall risk is unlikely to 
be large or might be limited to very rare and specific birth 
defects 
the italian doctors considered as defects only congenital 
malformations that were present and obvious at birth congenital 
problems that manifest themselves later such as mental 
retardation were not considered 
the seveso congenital malformations registry established 
shortly after the accident found that in 15291 births 742 
infants were born with malformations a rate of 485 per 1000 
the prevalence of malformations over the same period in a 
nearby uncontaminated area used as a control was 488 per 1000 
births the study found 
the quantity of dioxin released into the environment seemed to 
be enormous but was never precisely determined according to the 
study 
still more important the study concluded is the fact 
that no infant with a major malformation was identified in the most 
highly contaminated zone 
levels of dioxin concentration found on the ground in the area 
surrounding the factory were nearly 1000 times higher than the 
levels termed safe by state and federal officials after a cleanup 
at times beach mo 
times beach is now deserted and hundreds of families have filed 
lawsuits against companies and individuals over exposure to dioxin 
contained in waste oil sprayed on their streets as a dustcontrol 
measure in the 1970s 
agent orange used in vietnam to eliminate ground cover for viet 
cong and north vietnamese troops contained the most toxic form of 
dioxin 2378tcdd 
questions about the effects of agent orange exposure have 
lingered since the war some veterans have sought government 
compensation contending their exposure resulted in cancers 
rashes headaches infertility and other side effects as well as 
birth defects in their children 
the veterans administration has rejected the claims saying 
numerous studies have found no link between exposure and reported 
symptoms

racing legend mickey thompson and his wife 
may have been murdered in retaliation for thompsons testimony in a 
murder trial that led to the conviction of their slain nephews 
killer a prosecutor said 
orange county deputy district attorney tom goethals called the 
coincidence between the thompson murders wednesday and that of 
scott campbell six years ago absolutely incredible 
first his nephew is murdered executionstyle then thompson 
and his wife are hit executionstyle the connection just knocks 
you right out of your chair goethals said 
authorities called the killings of the millionaire couple an 
assassination and said they had no motive for the crime and no 
suspects in custody thursday 
investigators are seeking a cyclist who abandoned his bicycle 
and flagged down motorists for a ride shortly after thompson 59 
and his wife trudy 41 were fatally shot at dawn wednesday 
outside their home in bradbury 20 miles northeast of los angeles 
detectives recovered the 12speed bike and are checking for 
fingerprints and other clues sheriffs deputy van mosely said 
sheriffs officials refused to say whether the man being sought 
was one of the cyclists seen fleeing the thompsons house a third 
participant in the slayings or had some other connection to the 
case 
thompson the first person to drive a car faster than 400 mph 
was a key witness in the murder trial of larry cowell who was 
convicted in 1982 of having thompsons nephew pushed from an 
airplane during a soured drug deal 
cowell currently is serving a 25yearstolife prison sentence 
for campbells death don dimascio who was hired by cowell to kill 
campbell was convicted last summer of firstdegree murder and was 
sentenced to life imprisonment without parole goethals said 
knowing the type of people involved in campbells murder 
retaliation against thompson is very possible goethals said 
certainly it is an angle that will be explored 
friends told police that thompson said he had received several 
death threats but sheriffs investigators said he never reported 
them 
a racing trade group on thursday put up a 30000 reward for 
information leading to the arrest of those responsible for the

police detained a white man and 
black man participating in a churchsponsored interracial exchange 
program an organizer said today 
murray hofmeyr who is white and sandy lebese who is black 
were picked up thursday night in mamelodi the main township 
outside the capital of pretoria according to rev kevin cochrane 
one of the program organizers 
police had no immediate comment 
in an unusual attempt to break down racial barriers more than 
200 black and white christians are trading places with each other 
this week 
hofmeyr was among 170 whites who moved in wednesday for four 
days with black families in mamelodi in turn 40 blacks are living 
with whites in pretoria 
hofmeyr 29 a doctoral candidate in theology was staying with 
lebese 31 a field worker with the pretoria council of churches 
in a fourroom township house which he shares with nine others 
lebese spent seven years in prison from 1977 to 1983 on a 
sabotage conviction 
cochrane said hofmeyr was released this morning but that lebese 
was still being held he said he had no information on why they 
were detained 
security forces set up a roadblock thursday evening outside a 
meeting hall where the group participants had gathered the 
security forces were checking the identity of all people entering 
the area 
one of the principal organizers of the exchange is the rev nico 
smith a dutch reformed minister who has served in mamelodi since 
1982 two years ago however he moved into his parish becoming 
the first white permitted by the government live in a black 
township 
the only difficulty has been getting everyone to the right 
place smith said thursday before lebese and hofmeyr were 
detained but everyone is getting along just fine 
smith said the goal of the program was to teach both races about 
life on the other side of the apartheid barricade 
apartheid is south africas legal and traditional system of 
racial segregation under it the minority 5 million whites control 
the government and the economy and maintain separate districts 
schools and health systems the 26 million blacks have no vote in 
national affairs 
before he was detained hofmeyr described a night on the town 
with lebese 
we went to several discos last night and at one place they 
even introduced me over the loud speaker he said i didnt 
have to pay for a single drink all night 
lebese said it was important that whites experience a taste of 
township life 
a lot of whites dont even know if its legal for them to come 
to mamelodi said lebese they think were a bunch of dangerous 
radicals this week everyone has a chance to talk in a relaxed 
environment 
most south african blacks know more about how whites live than 
vice versa because blacks often work at white homes and in white 
businesses whites seldom venture into black townships 
the whites said they were concerned about living in the 
townships but that their hosts were instantly friendly and open 
said the rev ivor jenkins an aide to smith the blacks said 
its great to be comfortable 
edgar molefe a 20yearold from soweto johannesburgs main 
township said he had little trouble adjusting to his new 
environment 
we had a nice long talk and a great dinner he said 
recalling his healthy appetite during the meal 
henry lederle a white theology professor conceded that the 
participating whites are those already committed to a 
nonsegregated south africa 
the whites still need this type of exposure said lederle 
42 its one thing to say you want to end apartheid its another 
to learn about the problems it creates 
the fourday exchange program includes socializing bible study 
and prayer trips throughout the townships it will culminate sunday 
evening with a barbecue and church service 
this isnt going to solve all south africas problems said 
lebese but it will help a few people understand the situation a 
little better

affect geicos guideline nationwide 
geico vice president august alegi called the ruling bizarre 
and shocking adding the company will seek an injunction 
against raimondis order and also will appeal in baltimore circuit 
court 
i cant believe that the state is telling people to go out and 
kill people and that we cant do anything about it alegi said 
geico which insures about 220000 drivers in maryland has 
received only three complaints in maryland about the guideline he 
said 
the maryland ruling stemmed from a 1987 complaint by an 
ohiobased trade association representing makers and sellers of the 
devices the ruling was the first in the country on the issue a 
lobbyist for the trade association said 
the auto insurance industry in recent years has become more 
concerned about radar detectors especially since the new 65mph 
speed limit became effective in some areas said john cook vice 
president of the insurance institute for highway safety an 
industryfinanced study organization 
geico was believed to be the first large insurer to institute 
such a guideline industry groups said most companies still assess 
risk based on driving records and convictions said harvey seymour 
vice president of the industryfunded insurance information 
institute 
an estimated 80000 motorists in maryland and 4 million 
nationally use radar detectors the devices are illegal only in 
washington dc connecticut and virginia

theyre fitting big stan with suspenders to 
keep his outerwear on when the hard wind blows after all you 
cant have someone 1136 feet tall shedding 275pound marble slabs 
big stan is the nickname of the downtown amoco corp 
headquarters formerly the standard oil building its the worlds 
fourthtallest building and is in danger of losing some of its 
sheathing officials say 
as a result amoco will install steel suspenders to keep the 
white marble in place engineering manager shelby pierce said 
thursday 
the sheathing slabs are starting to curl or bow after 15 
years in place said pierce the slabs are 1inch thick and 
measure 4 feet 2 inches by 3 feet 9 inches beginning next week 
workers will begin installing boltedin stainless steel straps 
onesixteenth of an inch thick and 2 inches wide at the southeast 
corner of the building at a minimum cost of 1 million 
were looking at an area where the most severe bows occur 
he said the southeast corner gets most exposure to sun and 
thermal cycles and heavy wind 
pierce said company officials first noticed the problem in 1979 
by last november the condition of the marble began to worsen and 
officials decided to reinforce the marble 
while workers spend six weeks reinforcing the southeast corner 
engineers will be checking the rest of the building to see if more 
drastic measures need to be taken if the strapping doesnt work 
amoco may have to strip the building of its gleaming white facade 
he said

the soviet union today praised the 
practice of socialist selfmanagement pioneered by yugoslavia and 
said it should prove useful in modernizing the soviet economic 
system 
in a joint declaration issued as soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev ended a fiveday visit to yugoslavia the two nations 
also signaled other eastern european nations they are free to 
follow any paths to socialism without fear of soviet 
intervention 
no one has a monopoly over the truth the document declared 
echoing similar pledges gorbachev made in speeches in prague a year 
ago and in moscow last november the two sides declare that they 
have no pretensions of imposing their concepts of social 
development on anyone 
it said the success of any path to socialism is tested by 
practice 
this was the first time that view had been outlined in a formal 
written statement of policy 
under socialist selfmanagement yugoslavia has begun 
decentralizing its economy giving plants and other enterprises 
local control 
the unsigned document was exchanged by gorbachev and yugoslav 
president lazar mojsov on tuesday but was withheld until today it 
supersedes landmark declarations issued in 1955 and 1956 formally 
acknowledging communist yugoslavias independence from the soviet 
bloc 
the late josip broz titos determination to pursue a nonaligned 
foreign policy led to his break with moscow in 1948 and an economic 
blockade of yugoslavia until after the death of soviet dictator 
josef stalin in 1953 
gorbachevs visit is the first by a soviet leader here since 
titos death in 1980 it gave him a firsthand look at a 
decentralized economic system that has been developing for more 
than 35 years along the lines he is seeking to implement in the 
soviet union 
the declaration constitutes his first formal acknowledgement 
that the system has applications at home in its formative years 
selfmanagement was denounced by the kremlin as heresy and proof 
that yugoslavia was embarked on a revisionist road 
the two sides consider the development of socialist 
selfmanagement in keeping with the specificities of each country 
to be of the highest importance the document said it ensures 
the genuine authority of the people and the freedom of the 
individual 
earlier in the week gorbachev expressed some reservations about 
giving enterprises too much independence from central authority 
at a plant that exports robots to the united states and the 
soviet union gorbachev told the factorys workers council which 
has nominal control of the plant that we have to maintain a 
regulatory role at the center to safeguard us against mistakes 
particularly because the country of the soviet union is so large 
but in the declaration the two sides paid particular tribute to 
selfmanagement without corresponding mention of soviet economic 
reforms those reforms are known as perestroika or 
restructuring 
yugoslavias experience it said gained in the 
development of the political system of socialist selfmanagement 
and the orientation to consistently put into practice the 
principles of socialist selfmanagement by the people of the soviet 
union open up new possibilities for benefitting from each others 
perceptions on the contemporary forms and methods of functioning of 
selfmanagement 
the two sides also called for a radical reform of 
international economic relations 
without making specific proposals the declaration cited the 
problem of the enormous foreign debt of most developing countries 
discrimination against them in the field of trade and their limited 
access to technical and technological achievements 
yugoslavia is engulfed in its worst economic crisis since world 
war ii in part due to the 20 billion it owes western creditors 
after delaying his departure for an hour to do some sightseeing 
in dubrovnik a famed resort city on the adriatic gorbachev and 
his wife raisa left yugoslavia to return to moscow 
earlier gorbachev toured a 17th century cathedral in what was 
believed to be his first visit to a roman catholic church at least 
since taking over as soviet leader three years ago as a communist 
gorbachev is officially an atheist although his mother is said to 
be russian orthodox and reportedly attends church regularly in her 
home village in southern russia

scientists have found they can create 
highly accurate animal versions of human diseases by inserting 
scrambled genes into unborn mice 
the new technique should allow researchers in some cases to 
create animal models on demand 
such laboratory animals have long been important tools for 
studying and curing illnesses but until now they have been 
developed only by breeding animals to bring out naturally occurring 
defects 
in the latest experiments researchers from the whitehead 
institute for biomedical research at massachusetts institute of 
technology produced socalled transgenic mice animals with an 
extra mutant copy of a normal gene 
this bad gene contained the same genetic error that causes a 
fatal human birth defect called osteogenesis imperfecta type ii as 
a result the mice were born with rubbery and missing bones just 
like humans with this disorder 
a report on the research directed by dr rudolf jaenisch was 
published in the march 10 issue of the british journal nature 
this study constitutes the first example of the generation of 
an animal model of a human genetic disease by introducing precisely 
defined alterations into the normal gene and then transferring the 
mutant gene into transgenic mice the researchers wrote 
at the university of washington dr peter byers said the new 
technique should help researchers understand diseases that cause 
short stature and a variety of other disorders resulting from 
defective genes 
you now have the potential to do that with almost any other 
gene in which you can make mutations byers said its a way of 
finding out more about other genes and their functions 
although many diseases are thought to arise from genetic 
defects the precise genetic causes are still unknown 
researchers say it should be possible to tinker with specific 
mouse genes put them into unborn mice and then see if the animals 
have diseases that resemble human ailments 
the mit research was conducted on the gene that produces type 1 
collagen a material essential for healthy bones and tendons 
the human collagen molecule is a chain of 1000 amino acids of 
these 333 are the amino acid glycine if just one glycine in this 
chain is replaced by another amino acid the collagen is defective 
and the disease osteogenesis imperfecta results 
the blueprint that the body uses to assemble these amino acids 
is contained in one gene if this code is garbled by a single 
random mutation the gene can instruct the body to build collagen 
incorrectly putting glycine in the wrong place 
the researchers made this kind of mutation in the gene that 
produces type 1 collagen in mice they transferred the genes into 
singlecell mouse embryos 
the genes produced defective collagen and the mice were born 
with the same defects as babies with osteogenesis imperfecta 
some of them were dramatic jaenisch said they were 
missing bones you poke their heads and there is just no bone in 
them 
having an animal model for osteogenesis imperfecta should help 
researchers learn more about the disease but it isnt likely to 
produce a way to treat it because the defect does its lethal damage 
before birth 
one potential use of the technique jaenisch said would be to 
learn how the body uses other kinds of collagen 
there are 20 different collagens and nobody knows what the 
functions of these collagens are he said in an interview for 
any of these collagens this approach will be perfectly suited

demonstrators after moslem prayers today in the occupied gaza strip 
and killed one arab the army said hospital officials said another 
18 were wounded 
in the occupied west bank city of ramallah two young protesters 
suffered bullet wounds in a clash with troops following noon prayer 
services a doctor at ramallah hospital said 
one was shot in the abdomen and was in serious condition while 
the other was shot in the leg 
in all protests broke out today in a dozen towns and refugee 
camps following moslem noon prayers repeating a pattern 
established during the demonstrations which began dec 8 
a prominent arab attorney was detained in gaza prompting 
protests from israeli liberals and two senior cabinet ministers 
urged defense minister yitzhak rabin to impose tougher measures 
against palestinian protesters 
security forces detained two israelis found with an arsenal of 
weapons and suspected of planning antiarab attacks police said 
the two were identified as moshe vinokor of rishon lezion and 
gershon luxemburg of jerusalem both 44 
in the gaza strip army spokesmen confirmed one palestinian was 
killed in a clash at the shati refugee camp officials at shifa 
hospital identified the victim as 24yearold hani abu hamam 
the fatality brought to 101 the number of palestinians killed in 
more than 14 weeks of unrest in the israelioccupied territories 
according to un figures 
shifa officials said they treated 14 other palestinians wounded 
by gunfire at shati officials at nearby ahli arab hospital said 
they treated three other gunshot cases from shati and one from gaza 
city 
the army spokesmen said initial reports showed three 
palestinians were wounded in shati but they were checking hospital 
reports of additional woundings 
an arab reporter said he saw troops in shati fire tear gas 
rubber bullets and live ammunition at hundreds of palestinians who 
threw rocks at soldiers after coming out of the noon prayers at 
main algharbi mosque 
he said an army helicopter also dropped tear gas on the crowd 
which had been aroused by morning clashes between troops and young 
arabs in the narrow streets of the camp 
the daily haaretz quoted transport minister chaim corfu as 
saying troops should shoot stonethrowers through the heart 
minister without portfolio yitzhak modai told the daily maariv 
the disturbances never would have gained strength if soldiers had 
fired directly on protesters from the start 
mohammed abu shaban the vice president of the gaza bar 
association was picked up late thursday after a tel aviv protest 
gathering israeli officials alleged he was involved in subversive 
activities 
abu shaban has represented several gazans in appeals to the 
israeli supreme court tel aviv university professors and the 
leftwing citizens rights movement protested the detention and 
demanded his release 
economic boycotts by palestinians appeared to be having some 
effect haaretz reported that revenues from a sales and service tax 
paid by palestinians had dropped by 20 percent during the last two 
months 
on thursday two masked palestinians armed with a pistol and a 
sovietdesigned kalashnikov assault rifle shot and wounded an 
israeli civilian in the gaza strip for the first time since the 
unrest began 
also thursday israeli media said secretary of state george p 
shultz may return to the region by early april to promote his

delegates of south koreas two main 
opposition parties ran into trouble today as they tried to forge a 
united front against the government 
they were seeking a merger after kim daejung quit as president 
of the party for peace and democracy thursday kim youngsam had 
resigned as leader of the larger reunification democratic party in 
february 
both men ran in decembers presidential election dividing 
opposition votes and allowing victory for government candidate roh 
taewoo the two kims had been under pressure since then to step 
down and clear the way for a united opposition 
but the reunification democratic party insisted today it should 
have the right to name the main opposition leader and to pick the 
lions share of candidates for national assembly elections 
expected on april 26 the smaller party however insisted on a 
strong voice in picking candidates and leadership 
announcing its own candidates today for the upcoming election 
the ruling democratic justice party dropped several hardline 
legislators party leaders said they were cut in efforts to end 
authoritarian rule and advance democracy 
roh a former general helped former president chun doohwan 
take power in 1980 with military backing roh has vowed to 
introduce full democracy 
meanwhile the government today stepped up its rhetoric against 
communist north korea it warned that another provocation like the 
december bombing of a south korean civilian airliner for which it 
blames north korea would be viewed as a declaration of war 
we will consider a similar incident like this a declaration of 
war against us and mete out strong punishment defense minister 
oh jabok told local reporters 
ohs statement was one of the strongest warnings against north 
korea since the bombing of a korean air jetliner near burma on dec 
29 all 115 people on board the flight were killed 
oh said 650000 troops under his command were fully prepared to 
crush any north korean provocation or attack across the border

defense secretary frank c carlucci said today 
that us soldiers will conduct exercises in honduras for about 10 
days and reiterated that there are no plans for them to engage in 
combat 
a pentagon spokeswoman capt nancy laluntas said that 1062 
troops were on the ground in honduras thursday night and that all 
3126 were expected to be in place by tonight carlucci said on 
abctvs good morning america that only 300 had arrived in 
honduras but the spokeswoman said that figure was wrong 
troops being flown to honduras included the 82nd airborne from 
fort bragg nc and the 7th light infantry division based at 
fort ord calif 
the plan is for the exercise to last approximately 10 days 
carlucci told abc 
there are no plans for these troops to engage in combat and 
we never comment on contingency plans of course he said 
fighting continues between nicaraguan government forces and the 
contra rebels with the usbacked rebels forced to pull back from 
some of their positions carlucci said 
we dont have an accurate count of casualties but people are 
being wounded and killed he said 
carlucci said it was also difficult to tell how many sandinista 
troops had crossed the honduran border because the incursion was 
taking place in a remote area he said 1500 to 2000 sandinista 
troops have been amassed in the border area since march 1 
asked if there had been any significant victories or defeats in 
the fighting carlucci said no i wouldnt characterize it in 
those terms although the freedom fighters have had to fall back a 
bit theyve had to abandon some of their positions and move to 
other positions 
he said there were no plans to move any other us land sea or 
air forces into the area 
carlucci said he was confident the honduran troops would take 
whatever measures they consider appropriate to defend themselves 
we stand by to be helpful and we are showing our moral support

bob dole battered by vice president george bush in a string of 
republican contests laid off more campaign workers and threw a 
capitol hill party to thank staff and supporters but was 
tenaciously clinging to his longshot presidential bid 
meanwhile the democratic presidential contenders intensified 
their criticism of the reagan administration for deploying us 
forces in central america 
and democrat richard gephardt dispatched some troops of his own 
today sending dozens of congressional colleagues to stump for him 
in michigan in a bid to shore up his faltering campaign 
michigan holds democratic caucuses on march 26 and gephardt 
badly needs a win however a new poll suggested gephardt trailed 
rivals jesse jackson and michael dukakis in the state 
the survey of 328 likely democratic voters conducted for the 
detroit free press and wxyztv indicated jackson and dukakis each 
had 32 percent 15 percent were undecided and gephardt had 9 
percent tennessee sen albert gore jr had 6 percent and paul 
simon 5 percent according to the telephone survey which had a 
margin of error of 54 percentage points 
in washington dole campaign spokeswoman dale tate said about a 
dozen national staff members were told thursday their jobs would 
end at the weeks end and top aides were working without pay 
however she said dole was still in the race 
absolutely positively nothing has changed said tate the 
senator is on the record about that 
after losing the illinois primary to bush on tuesday dole 
indicated he would stay in at least until wisconsins primary on 
april 5 
on the senate floor thursday dole defended the dispatching of 
troops to honduras saying nicaraguas contra rebels were being 
slaughtered by the hundreds 
the us troops were sent to conduct exercises as a show of 
strength after nicaraguan forces chased contras into honduras 
does it make sense even as thousands of communist troops 
cross the border of a free country in this hemisphere for members 
of congress to make excuses for nicaraguas aggression while 
accusing the president of the united states of fueling the fires of 
war in central america the republican leader asked 
dole said reagan should immediately resubmit a request for 
military aid to the rebels the democratic contenders sharply 
disagreed 
our policy in central america has been one of the worst 
fiascos of this administration dukakis said as he campaigned in 
stratford conn in advance of the states march 29 primary 
there is no reason to have troops down there 
sending in the troops was excessive and unnecessary jackson 
said at a news conference in detroit 
we are being told we have to be saved from the sandinistas 
jackson said adding sardonically there are no sandinistas in 
detroit 
gore accused the administration of failing to share sufficient 
information with congress about the military move 
we need to know more about what our forces will be doing 
there the tennessee senator said as he campaigned thursday in 
wintry kansas which holds democratic caucuses on saturday gore 
headed today for balmier climes puerto rico which holds its 
primary sunday 
gephardt also blasted the administrations actions in central 
america 
in pursuit of its failed policy of support for the contras 
the administration has lost its sense of direction abandoned the 
rule of law and failed to protect american national interests in a 
troubled region he said 
several dozen of gephardts house colleagues were campaigning 
for him today in michigan echoing a tactic used in iowa when his 
congressional supporters fanned out around the state prior to the 
feb 8 democratic caucuses gephardt won in iowa scoring his 
biggest campaign success to date 
the missouri congressman was also using another strategy 
credited with helping him in iowa tough trade talk 
at a union hall in dearborn mich the home of ford motor co 
gephardt sounded a familiar theme criticizing south koreas trade 
practices a ford taurus he said would sell for 73000 in south 
korea as a result of tariffs imposed by that nation 
were not selling too many of these cars in south korea i 
wonder why he said 
while gephardt was in michigan dukakis was in washington 
making the rounds on capitol hill 
the massachusetts governor picked up the endorsements of sens 
barbara mikulski of maryland and patrick leahy of vermont 
dukakis also dropped in on sen bill bradley of new jersey who 
said he was leaning toward supporting dukakis 
jackson at an islamic center in detroit talked about the 
turmoil in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip 
there is no peace and justice about occupation he said 
let the peoples have their land let both peoples have their 
peace and give peace a chance

producers of a new cbs television comedy show 
plan to defy a writers strike and continue making the show even 
after they run out of unionwritten scripts 
cbs made the announcement about the smothers brothers comedy 
hour thursday just two days after the writers guild of america 
rejected pleas from tv producers for special permission to continue 
work during the strike 
the 9000member union went on strike against the alliance of 
motion picture and television producers on march 7 over residuals 
from foreign distribution creative control and a management 
proposal to restructure residuals for onehour tv shows sold into 
syndication 
a session with a federal mediator last weekend failed to end the 
dispute and no new talks are scheduled 
a cbs spokesman who talked on condition he not be identified 
said six smothers brothers shows were planned and three scripts 
were in hand when asked what would happen if the strike were still 
in progress when it came time for the fourth show the spokesman 
said i can only stand by the statement 
production will continue he said but the nature of the

a baby with a fatal birth defect whose 
vital organs doctors had hoped to give to others has been removed 
from a respirator because he showed no signs of brain death within 
a sevenday period 
the baby born with a fatal condition known as anencephaly in 
which most of the brain and skull are missing was taken off a 
respirator thursday said loma linda medical center spokewoman 
anita rockwell 
he is being kept comfortable and is being given fluids she 
said 
meanwhile a second anencephalic youngster known as baby 
cassandra entered her second day on a respirator thursday and ms 
rockwell said she was beginning to show signs of impending brain 
death 
loma linda has developed the nations first medical guidelines 
for preserving anencephalics hearts and other vital organs to be 
transplanted to critically ill infants however no anencephalic 
donor babies have met the hospitals criteria 
under the hospitals donor guidelines infants are placed on 
lifesupport systems for seven days if doctors determine an infant 
is brain dead within that time the hospital will alert organ 
procurement agencies nationwide and a search for a suitable 
recipient will begin 
ms rockwell said the criteria for brain death requires that an 
infant show an absence of eye reflexes have dilated pupils be in 
a coma and be unable to breathe on his or her own 
the lifesupport system helps prevent the infants heart liver 
and other vital organs from deteriorating until doctors have 
determined that the baby is brain dead 
the hospitals guidelines including the sevenday limit on 
lifesupport machines was devised to address ethical questions 
surrounding the use of doomed anencephalics as organ donors 
if the infant is not declared brain dead within seven days it 
is taken off the respirator and allowed to die naturally without 
further consideration as a donor 
ms rockwell said anencephalic youngsters die very quickly after 
being removed from lifesupport systems

a federal employee fired for refusing to wear a 
coat and tie for an identification photograph says hell appeal 
arguing that the dress requirement is discriminatory 
roger arnold whose dismissal from his 36000ayear job was 
effective today said the controversy was solely over the 
photograph not his attire on the job he said he has not worn a 
coat and tie at work since the late 1970s and last wore a tie at 
his sons wedding in 1983 
ties just dont serve any purpose in my life said arnold 
50 of duxbury an employee of the bureau of alcohol tobacco and 
firearms who checked wineries distilleries and firearm 
manufacturers for federal license compliance 
arnold a 17year atf employee said his objection to the dress 
requirement was based on his dislike for business attire and the 
fact that no clothing requirement was placed on female atf 
employees posing for identification photographs 
personally it was a matter of principles said arnold 
but when i looked at the regulations it was apparent they were 
discriminatory it placed all the clothing burden on men 
arnold said he will appeal the dismissal to the merit systems 
protection board and the equal employment opportunity commission 
dot koester an atf spokeswoman in washington dc said arnold 
is the first atf employee to be fired over a clothing issue 
koester said the government requires coats and ties for 
identification photographs but does not have a specific dress code 
for the atf 
we just expect our employees to look and dress like the 
professionals they are said koester 
she said the issue of arnolds dress was raised only last year 
because a change in atf identifications required new photographs be 
taken 
arnold was reprimanded in writing and suspended without pay 
twice before his dismissal after he was first asked to wear a coat 
and tie in january 1987 said koester 
this is not something that just came up she said mr 
arnold has been fighting us for quite a while 
its good to stand up for your principles said arnold 
but with no job things are going to be tight

a black man who was scheduled 
to hang with the sharpeville six today went to the gallows 
alone after a judge granted a stay of execution for the six 
the predawn hanging of tsepo letsoara 24 concluded without 
fanfare world leaders clergymen and politicians continued to plea 
with the government to save the five condemned black men and one 
woman 
barbed wire and police armored vehicles lined the road to 
pretoria central prison today 
the government had ignored an international appeal for clemency 
and left the case in the hands of a pretoria supreme court judge 
who on thursday granted the six a month to appeal for a new trial 
attorney prakash diar said today the defense team had already 
begun preparing a substantive application to reopen the trial and 
requestion government witnesses including one whose admission of 
perjury was the basis for the stay of execution 
police gave no explanation for the increased security around the 
prison letsoara was convicted of the murder of a black woman in a 
port elizabeth township in october 1985 during nationwide racial 
unrest the victim grace mvetye was killed by the necklace 
method in which a gasolinesoaked tire was placed around her neck 
and set ablaze 
police have not said whether the slaying was politically 
motivated 
pretoria supreme court justice willem human granted the stay for 
the six after defense lawyers presented evidence of perjury by one 
of the prosecutions chief witnesses 
the case is controversial because the six were convicted under 
the principle of common cause which held them responsible for 
the september 1984 death of town councilor jacob dlamini because 
they were among a mob of 100 that stoned and burned dlamini to 
death in sharpeville 
dlamini was killed on the first day of riots that lasted nearly 
three years and claimed more than 2500 black lives 
president pw botha had ignored pleas from leaders of most 
western nations and from countries and organizations around the 
world to stop the executions the government said humans decision 
proves the wisdom of the state president and his ministers in 
deciding not to impede the due process of law 
the government also indicated a link between the scheduled 
hangings and a car bomb that exploded thursday in krugersdorp 
killing three black people and injuring 20 others the explosion 
occurred in a magistrates court where the sharpeville six had been 
held briefly between their arrest and trial 
police offered a 25000 reward for information leading to the 
arrest of a white man they say is a member of the outlawed 
antiapartheid african national congress the man was described as 
the prime suspect in the bombing 
deputy minister of information stoffel van der merwe said 
neither pressure from overseas nor car bombs would persuade the 
government to interfere in a court case 
the star an independent johannesburg newspaper reported today 
that botha granted clemency three weeks ago to a black policeman 
who was sentenced to death for murdering a youth two years ago in 
mamelodi the black township outside pretoria 
a spokesman for the department of justice said botha commuted 
constable george john sindanes death sentence to eight years in 
prison the spokesman said sindane was one of five people whose 
death sentences were commuted this year 
in other developments thursday 
attorneys said a 225 million wrongful arrest lawsuit was 
begun against the ministry of law and order after charges of 
sedition and subversion were dropped against a black roman catholic 
nun and 13 others who lived in black townships outside krugersdorp 
sister bernard ncube president of the federation of transvaal 
women spent 16 months in detention including 13 in solitary 
confinement after being charged the state alleged that the group 
established kangaroo courts campaigned against the police and 
initiated a boycott of whiteowned shops and buses 
the charges were dropped thursday after the prosecution refused 
to supply a court with details of the alleged acts 
also the attorney for freed african national congress leader 
govan mbeki said the government denied his request for a passport 
which he sought to visit his three children living in exile 
attorney priscilla jana said no reason was given for the denial 
mbeki was freed from prison in november after serving 24 years 
of a life sentence for treason and sabotage in connection with his 
activities as national chairman of the anc his oldest son thabo 
is an executive member of the anc in exile in lusaka zambia 
since his release from prison mbeki has been restricted to the 
port elizabeth area and banned from giving public speeches or news 
interviews

police said today they recovered 
nearly all of the 8 million that disappeared last month from a 
plane carrying the money from the united states to argentina 
were counting the money and very little is missing said 
nilo augusto batista the police official in charge of 
investigating the theft 
one person was arrested before dawn in connection with the 
disappearance and that arrest led to several others batista said 
the official said all in custody were brazilians and that their 
names would be released later 
the money was part of a 52 million shipment from the federal 
reserve board in new york to the central bank of argentina that was 
stolen sometime between feb 4 and 5 said marven moss a spokesman 
for brinks inc based in darien conn 
the money was shipped through brinks on a routine flight aboard 
a commercial airliner in 13 bags and was made up of new 
consecutively numbered 100 bills moss said 
the theft was discovered when the airliner arrived in buenos 
aires and authorities found only 11 bags the two missing bags 
contained 8 million moss said 
apparently what happened is that some people who were working 
at the airport on a temporary basis took the bags and didnt 
realize what they took they thought it was music cassettes 
then they get home and realize they have 8 million moss said 
batista said the first break in the case came from the narcotics 
department of the rio de janeiro state police 
even though this case was technically not in the drug area 
our people followed the tip and the result was nearly total 
success batista said 
he said the missing dollars were traced to several brazilian 
states where the thieves tried to exchange them apparently for 
other american dollars or for foreign currency 
they didnt get a chance to spend much the official said 
but moss said brazilian drug agents recovered virtually all the 
cash today during a drug but those who stole the money apparently 
used some of the cash to buy drugs he said the spokesman didnt 
have any more details on the arrest nor the exact amount of cash 
recovered 
the recovered money belongs to brinks since its insurance 
repaid the federal reserve board for the theft moss said 
the 8 million heist was the largest in brinks history moss 
said

military commanders say their 
troops around this strategic southern garrison town have repelled 
three major offensives since december by combined south african and 
unita rebel forces 
the officers also told reporters visiting the front that they 
were confident of holding the region despite daily longrange 
shelling by south african artillery 
the officers said wednesday that they expect more than 7000 
enemy troops to mount another major offensive soon from positions 
about 15 miles south of cuito cuanavale the town is 190 miles 
north of the border of south africaruled southwest africa also 
known as namibia 
enemy troops include guerrillas of the national union for the 
total independence on angola or unita black soldiers from 
southwest africa and south african soldiers 
angolan commanders said fighting has died down since their 
forces pushed back the south africanled army early this month 
angolan troops now respond with artillery fire to regular barrages 
of south african shells 
a group of foreign reporters was caught in one such barrage on 
wednesday when it visited a badly damaged steel and wooden bridge 
over the cuito river a mile south of town 
fighting picked up around cuito cuanavale in december said 
lt col ngueto the towns military commander then the south 
africans brought in mechanized units for their most recent 
offensive from feb 25 to march 1 
the enemy has not given up the idea of taking cuito 
cuanavale he said the same units are still here 
government forces were everywhere in the former farming 
community manning antiaircraft batteries tank positions 
defensive trenches and sophisticated radar and communications 
equipment 
ngueto said the main objective of the south african and unita 
forces was to capture cuito cuanavales military airport a key 
facility for ferrying government troops and heavy equipment to the 
southern front from luanda the angolan capital is 590 miles to the 
northwest on the atlantic coast 
unita backed by south africa and the united states has been 
fighting an increasingly effective bush war since 1975 against 
angolas cuban and sovietbacked government 
this airfield can handle an awful lot of traffic and they want 
to control it to launch attacks further north in cuandocubango 
province and up to central angola ngueto said 
he said south african and unita patrols already had traveled 
north along narrow corridors through the bush to launch attacks in 
the cuemba region of central bie province 
cuemba 190 miles north of cuito is the farthest south african 
troops are thought to have penetrated into angola since 1976 when 
they fought alongside unita in the civil war that broke out after 
independence from portugal the previous year 
pock marks on the walls of buildings in cuito indicated they had 
been sprayed by small arms fire but the town has not been taken by 
south african or rebel forces despite long months of siege 
in december south african forces blew up two sections of the 
cuito river bridge which is made of heavy timbers and reinforced 
concrete pilings the angolans have replaced them with makeshift 
ropes and planks that sag down to water level 
after speaking to government sentries on the east bank of the 
river wednesday reporters were heading back across the bridge when 
the first shell hit about 40 yards away sending up spray from the 
marshy bank 
seven more shells exploded as the party scrambled back to an 
armored vehicle and drove back through the town 
the south africans shoot here off and on every day maj 
armindo moreira said as the shells went off he added that some 
residents have had to move away from the river 
angolan soldiers and cuban support troops were seen on the road 
out of town for about 15 miles supporting government statements 
that cuban troops are in the area at the rear of angolan lines 
about five miles from the front 
about 40000 cuban soldiers are based in angola supporting the 
government of president jose eduardo dos santos

a nursing home owner has pleaded guilty to 
inducing 11 irish nationals to quit their jobs and illegally enter 
the united states to work for him as nurses aides and orderlies 
as part of a plea agreement announced thursday peter h starr 
will be allowed to withdraw his guilty plea if us district judge 
john j mcnaught rejects a government recommendation that starr 
receive a suspended prison sentence and be placed on probation for 
three years 
the deal also calls for starr to be fined 40000 and to perform 
1000 hours of community service mcnaught scheduled sentencing for 
may 10 
starr 34 owner of the queen anne nursing home was indicted 
march 2 and charged with inducing the workers to come to the united 
states he recruited the workers after being warned it was highly 
unlikely that they would be issued working permits the indictment 
said 
despite the warning starr who had recruited the workers with 
an advertisement in a dublin newspaper assured them their work 
visas were being processed and that the only problem was a delay 
caused by passage of the new federal immigration law 
because of that purported delay starr convinced the 11 workers 
to enter the united states on vacation visas to obtain those the 
workers had to lie and say they never had requested permission to 
work in the united states 
the indictment stemmed from a labor department investigation 
that began last year after one of the irish aliens was involved in 
a local police investigation 
the 11 workers cooperated with the investigation and were given 
permission to stay in the united states through august they can 
apply for residency status during that period

living by a canadian who was supposed to help win the release of 
peter c kilburn the librarian at the american university in 
beirut who was kidnapped dec 3 1984 the washington post reported 
today 
kilburn was killed by a libyan terrorist group in april 1986 in

of the president of the united states according to a copy of the 
letter obtained by the post 
in support of this mission he has the authority to transport 
and disburse as necessary us 100000 the letter said in 
the event of emergency or clarification please contact oliver l 
north 
perot had provided the money at norths request and coburn 
needed the north letter in case us customs service agents stopped 
him at the border the post said 
perot said thursday night that he never questioned his employee 
concerning details of the cash delivery and didnt learn until much 
later the name of the hostage for whom authorities were negotiating 
he told the dallas times herald the request for the money came 
from the nsc but that he didnt seek to know details 
this is a small event in a very active life he said they 
asked me for it i delivered it to them and i didnt ask for any 
details theyve been calling me on things like this since 1969 it 
doesnt matter to me whos president i did it for a simple reason 
there was an american over there who needed help 
travelers must file a disclosure statement if they take more 
than 10000 out of the country failure to file is punishable by 
up to 250000 in fines and five years in prison 
coburn got into canada without difficulty and in montreal he 
gave the money to a canadian citizen who had provided proof of 
contact with kilburns captors

it he could arrange kilburns release for 1 million more said 
the post which did not identify the man 
the canadian contact took the money but never came through with 
his end of the deal and was later observed by the cia in damascus 
spending the money on high living the post said citing 
unidentified sources for the information 
the post said that a senior fbi official has told congress that 
thenfbi director william h webster who is now cia director 
approved the fbis participation in the plan the newspaper said

superiors for his actions but the white house has said reagan had 
no knowledge of any efforts to ransom us hostages in lebanon

a foreign ministry spokesman indicated 
today that crossborder air raids by honduras could lead to war 
between nicaragua and the united states and government media said 
young men were volunteering to fight 
newspapers called on nicaraguans to maintain a combat alert in 
case us troops invaded from honduras where 3200 american troops 
began arriving thursday 
the foreign ministry blamed the united states for a honduran 
attack on sandinista army targets and formally protested to 
washington the raid came less than two hours after the first 
american troops landed in honduras 
contra leaders said ceasefire talks scheduled monday with the 
government were off unless the sandinistas left honduras 
nicaraguan radio reported that antiaircraft batteries fired on two 
unidentified aircraft spotted flying in from honduras on thursday 
night 
barricada the official newspaper of the ruling sandinista 
national liberation front said neighborhood defense committees 
held meetings and renewed arms instruction 
the order of the day intensify combats read a headline in 
barricada newspapers also reported that young nicaraguan men were 
volunteering for military service 
alejandro bendana secretarygeneral of the nicaraguan foreign 
ministry told cbs this morning the hondurans attacked 
bombed our position yesterday this is one step that could lead to 
another those american troops are not there on a sightseeing 
mission 
if we dont defend the central american peace plan if 
honduras does not shut down the contra operations and the united 
states does not end its military involvement one step could lead 
to another he said in an interview from managua 
president daniel ortega said thursday his army was ready to 
combat and liquidate us troops if america engaged the 
sandinista forces but the united states has said american troops 
wont go near the area of hostilities along the 
hondurannicaraguan border 
sandinista officers said two bombs fell in nicaragua and a third 
landed across the narrow coco river in honduran territory on 
thursday afternoon reporters taken to the area by a sandinista 
official saw at least five bombs fall but it was impossible to say 
which side of the border they landed on 
a reagan administration source in washington said the honduran 
air force had carried out the attack 
in tegucigalpa a honduran armed forces spokesman said rockets 
were fired at sandinista forces in honduran territory not in 
nicaragua 
the journalists dived for cover as the jets roared in and the 
bombs struck as close as 70 yards away 
the raid occurred one day after honduras and the united states 
accused nicaraguan troops of crossing into honduras in pursuit of 
contra rebels 
bendana and defense ministry officials have denied the 
allegation and ortega has neither denied nor admitted it 
the us soldiers were deployed in what the united states called 
a measured response to the alleged nicaraguan incursion 
ortega said sandinista troops would not withdraw from 
nicaraguas border and were maintaining an offensive begun march 8 
in which an estimated 2000 contras had been pushed out of 
nicaraguan territory 
foreign minister miguel descoto said ortega sent a diplomatic 
note to secretary of state george p shultz formally and 
energetically protesting the thursday attack 
the note assails what it calls the raids terrorist 
character saying the raid put in danger the lives of numerous 
journalists including north american citizens 
later staterun voice of nicaragua radio reported that at least 
two unidentified aircraft flying in from honduras were spotted over 
the pacific coast port of corinto about 71 miles northwest of 
managua at 705 pm 
it said antiaircraft batteries opened fire on the planes 
in miami on thursday a contra leader says truce talks scheduled 
to begin on monday are off unless sandinista troops withdraw from 
honduras 
if this situation does not take a radical turn we will not 
attend said aristides sanchez a member of the fivemember 
directorate of the nicaraguan resistance the contra umbrella 
organization

the state department said today that saudi 
arabias acquisition of chinese missiles that can carry nuclear 
warheads is a disturbing development that could harm the 
security of all states in the middle east including israel 
the missile system would have a range which would include all 
areas of the middle east spokesman rudolph boone said it is 
another part of a disturbing regional trend in surfacetosurface 
missile proliferation 
the sum total of the proliferation is a degradation of the 
security of all states in the region he said 
boone said saudi arabia has confirmed it is acquiring the 
missile system which another official speaking on condition of 
anonymity said were chinese css2class rockets with a range of 
2200 miles and the ability to carry nuclear warheads 
several of the missiles are being installed but it will be some 
time before they are operational the washington post reported 
state department spokesman charles e redman said the saudi 
government has assured us categorically at the very highest level 
that saudi arabia does not have nor does it intend to acquire any 
nuclear capability 
redman told the washington post that the government of china 
has stated categorically that it will not export nuclear weapons to 
any government we accept these assurances in both cases 
according to sources quoted by the post the saudis began 
negotiating to purchase the missiles from beijing in 1985 after it 
became apparent that the united states the kingdoms principal 
weapons supplier would be prevented by congressional opposition 
from selling saudi arabia up to 48 f15 jet fighters 
congress agreed late last year to permit the sale of 24 f15s on 
a replacement basis to keep saudi air strength at its current 
levels 
the css2 is believed to be an offshoot of the rocket used by 
china to launch its first satellite in 1970 the chinese have been 
developing various military versions since 1979 its different 
models have ranges running from about 1000 miles to 2200 miles 
and the sources said the saudis are believed to have acquired the 
most advanced type

residents of the capital walked 
to work or paid inflated fares on crowded gypsy vehicles today as a 
guerrillacalled transit strike took hold two days before 
nationwide elections 
the usbacked government promised to ensure safe transport in 
the face of threats by the leftist insurgents trying to disrupt 
sundays legislative and municipal voting 
but none of the privately owned buses and few cars braved 
the streets of san salvador for what would normally be the morning 
rush hour 
a few pickup and van owners however offered rides for up to 
six times the normal bus fare of about 10 cents 
army trucks loaded with soldiers rumbled through town and 
troops with assault rifles guarded gas stations the guerrillas 
said gas stations selling fuel during the strike would be 
considered military objectives 
the guerrillas have also declared polling places military 
objectives and warned people to stay away 
the indefinite nationwide strike began at midnight police said 
two buses headed for the eastern city of usulutan were stopped by 
guerrillas before dawn emptied and burned 
the transport ban is the latest chapter in a violent guerrilla 
campaign against the elections 
the rebels say peace should come before elections they demand a 
share of power in exchange for laying down their arms but the 
government of president jose napoleon duarte rejects this 
the defense ministry has said it will deploy 53000 of its 
56000 troops to safeguard the voting defense minister gen 
eugenio vides casanova said his men could guarantee voter security 
at 244 of the nations 262 polling places 
the threat against polling places and service stations came in a 
statement from one of the leader of one of guerrillas new urban 
units the pedro castillo urban command 
the command is a unit of the peoples revolutionary army one of 
five guerrilla groups united in the faribundo marti national 
liberation front it was not clear if the rebel leader spoke for

due to the presence of troops they will be considered military 
targets

the federal government announced today that it 
will give illegal aliens who file applications in the last month of 
the amnesty program 60 additional days to submit documentation to 
support their applications 
the move is designed to counter criticism from congress over the 
us immigration and naturalization services refusal to extend the 
may 4 deadline for submitting applications 
at a news conference attorney general edwin meese iii said the 
60day extension on submitting supporting information will give all 
eligible aliens ample opportunity to take advantage of the chance 
to become legal us residents it would apply to applications 
submitted between april 4 and may 4 
it is our hope that on may 4 every single person who is 
eligible for legalization will have applied meese told reporters 
at an immigration office in arlington va 
but under the simplified filing policy announced by meese and 
immigration commissioner alan nelson applicants will not be 
required to produce timeconsuming supporting documentation or 
medical information for at least 60 days 
nelson said that applicants would be scheduled for an interview 
after july 5 and that at that time documentation would be required 
the application can be completed in less than 30 minutes 
nelson said without the requirement of immediate documentation 
there is no reason for any qualified applicant not to file by the 
may 4 deadline 
with six weeks to go the amnesty program has received just over 
1 million applications and will fall short of its early estimate of 
2 million 
legislation has been introduced in congress to extend the 
deadline for one more year 
ins officials oppose any extensions 
under the program illegal immigrants who have lived in the 
united states since jan 1 1982 can be granted amnesty if they 
provide documentation supporting their claim of living here for the 
past six years 
meese and nelson also announced another change in the program 
which would give private groups more time to locate aliens who are 
eligible for amnesty 
in the past these private groups assisting the immigration 
service collected fees only after they had completed filling out 
forms for an applicant a process that can take three hours or 
longer 
under the change the groups will be given a referral fee for 
each applicant after they have directed an alien to an ins 
legalization office

fourteen weeks of 
unrest and israeli attempts to quell it have slowed to a trickle 
the traffic on this rickety wooden lifeline between palestinians 
and the arab world outside 
both civilian and commercial traffic on the allenby and nearby 
adam bridges which span the jordan river and connect the occupied 
west bank with jordan is down by about 30 percent to 40 percent 
since the start of what palestinians call the uprising 
according to a senior israeli military official 
many west bank merchants striking under plo orders are staying 
home to conserve money in addition israeli officials have begun 
restricting palestinians from the territories from crossing the 
bridges and some talk of banning crossings altogether until the 
unrest subsides 
to close the bridges to prevent travel to jordan to prevent 
the flow of money from jordan thats tremendous pressure 
arieh shalev former military commander of the west bank said on 
israel radio 
about 1 million people a year ride buses between israeli and 
jordanian army emplacements on opposite sites of this 25yardlong 
bridge many are palestinians from both sides who were separated 
from their families when israel captured the west bank of the 
jordan in 1967 
bent old women in long black dresses and white headscarves visit 
children young palestinians in jeans travel to jobs in jordan or 
the persian gulf west bank businessmen tend to shops and bank 
accounts across the border together they carry in hundreds of 
millions of dollars yearly for the west bank economy 
each day as many as 120 trucks rumble across the bridges with 
west bank building stones vegetables and gaza citrus the exports 
bring about 100 million a year to the territories 
in 1968 shortly after israel captured the west bank from jordan 
and the gaza strip from egypt in the 1967 middle east war israels 
thendefense minister moshe dayan announced the open bridges 
policy 
for 20 years the bridges have remained open between two states 
still technically at war for israel they symbolize the desire to 
maintain normal life for the 15 million arabs under occupation and 
to coexist with jordan 
but since the uprising israeli officials have begun demanding 
that residents of the territories present proof of tax payment 
before granting bridge permits or export licenses in order to 
dissuade palestinians from following plo orders not to pay taxes 
officials banned crossbridge exports of stone from the west 
bank village of qabatiyeh to punish residents there for lynching an 
arab suspected of collaborating with israel the arab had opened 
fire on a crowd killing a child 
israel has also limited the amount of money people can bring in 
from jordan without prior permission to 400 jordanian dinars or 
1000 the restrictions are aimed at preventing palestine 
liberation organization funds from reaching arab activists in the 
territories 
but the new rules are ominious signs for west bank money 
changers who are vital to the areas economy as well as for 
families there who depend on funds sent home by hundreds of 
thousands of relatives working in kuwait saudi arabia and jordan 
many west bank residents have bank accounts and business 
interests in jordan most still carry jordanian passports 
but even with permits travelers from either side must endure 
five israeli and jordanian checkpoints as well as rigorous israeli 
inspections of their luggage 
many palestinians in jordan say they refuse to cross the bridge 
because they fear being humiliated by inspectors who they say 
often subject arrivals to stripsearches 
but israeli officials say the searches are necessary to prevent 
palestinian activists from smuggling in weapons which can be 
hidden in toys food or clothes they say they only conduct body 
searches on those who appear suspicious 
you have to see the context of it said an army spokesman 
who escorted reporters through the terminal israel and jordan 
are at war and yet this bridge traffic is still going on 
at the barnlike israeli inspection post near the bridge 
reporters recently saw soldiers sifting through packages of 
medicine throat lozenges necklaces and hair combs they had 
confiscated from arabs a roman catholic nun who refused to give 
her name said inspectors had confiscated church candles and a 
rosary 
the vast structure often teeming with people was almost empty 
soldiers chatted idly over cups of coffee five palestinians sat 
waiting to be questioned by authorities about their trips 
we are treated like animals at the bridge complained 
jerusalem physician jawad ghoshe 45 who said he had visited his 
mother and brothers in jordan i have been waiting for two hours 
and nothing is happening

the white house today denied nicaraguan 
charges that the united states was behind a honduran bombing raid 
on the remote border area where sandinista troops were skirmishing 
with the usbacked contra rebels 
asked whether the thursday bombing raid indicated that the 
united states had asked honduras to take a more active role white 
house spokesman marlin fitzwater said we havent asked them or 
instructed them to do anything we have offered our support and we 
have sent our forces there in defense of that 
a nicaraguan foreign ministry spokesman in managua blamed the 
united states for the attack formally protested and warned such 
raids could lead to war 
in congress lawmakers were condemning nicaraguan president 
daniel ortega as they became convinced he had ordered a military 
incursion into neighboring honduras an action that renewed calls 
for us aid to the antisandinista rebels 
theres a feeling that mr ortega is pretty damn stupid 
indeed said rep dan glickman dkan a member of the house 
intelligence committee who was briefed thursday on the border 
incursion against the contra rebels 
this socalled final offensive against the contras may have 
made sense militarily but it was bad politics said sen 
claiborne pell chairman of the foreign relations committee 
briefings for members of congress by top reagan administration 
officials portrayed the sandinista military action as a 
longplanned and skillfully executed attack that was threatening a 
contra command center a few miles northwest of bocay nicaragua 
just inside the honduran border 
several moderate democratic house members who were behind a 
failed march 3 attempt to provide strictly humanitarian aid to 
the rebels said the move gave new impetus to the effort to pass an 
aid package 
but while there was unanimity that the managua government had 
made a grave political miscalculation opinions were mixed on the 
wisdom of president reagans decision to deploy a 3200man task 
force to palmerola air base in honduras 
defense secretary frank carlucci reiterated today that the 
troops were there only for moral support and that they would be 
kept away from combat during their 10day training exercise 
of the border clash carlucci said information remained sketchy 
because of the remoteness of the area he said fighting had 
resulted in casualties but he did not know how many 
interviewed on abc television carlucci was asked whether there 
had been any significant victories or defeats in the fighting 
no i wouldnt characterize it in those terms although the 
freedom fighters have had to fall back a bit he said theyve 
had to abandon some of their positions and move to other 
positions 
pell dri said the move to deploy us troops tended to 
reduce honduras to the status of a us client state and may well 
be a greater threat to honduran sovereignty than the border 
incursion 
and sen john mccain rariz said reagans response had 
distracted attention from the sandinista military thrust and cost 
the president some political leverage 
a senior republican on pells committee sen richard lugar 
disagreed he said the troop deployment indicates we are still 
alert to the situation in central america 
lugar predicted that the request for military support will not 
be the last from central american democracies 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the armed services committee 
said the deployment was obviously designed to impress the 
sandinistas i hope they get the message 
there was conflict too on how the developments would affect 
ceasefire talks scheduled to resume monday in the nicaraguan town 
of sapoa near the costa rican border 
house speaker jim wright said he had high hopes after talking 
to both sides that the discussions would lead to a ceasefire 
lugar however said the talks have become more and more an 
academic exercise 
in a series of briefings on capitol hill senior administration 
officials and intelligence officers said the united states first 
detected preparations for the sandinista incursion late last month 
primarily by observing troop and supply buildups at a base in 
northern nicaragua 
roughly a week ago movements were observed toward bocay a 
nicaraguan town in a remote and mountainous area on the honduran 
border it is unclear exactly when the troops first crossed the 
coco river into honduras but contra forces defending a rebel 
command center northwest of bocay began to encounter government 
troops early this week according to interviews with more than a 
dozen participants in the briefings 
with greaterthanusual precision some 2000 sandinista troops 
had by thursday taken positions to the north east and south of the 
contras jungle command and supply post which was being defended 
by about 1300 rebel troops the administration said 
lawmakers were promised that the us troops sent from the 82nd 
airborne at fort bragg nc and the 7th infantry at fort ord 
calif would remain far from the fighting and would not be 
involved in combat 
the administation said sending the forces was a symbolic gesture 
of support for honduran president jose azcona in response to a 
direct request from him wednesday night after several days of 
consultations 
had we said no you can imagine what it would have done for 
our credibility in central america said assistant secretary of 
state elliott abrams 
some in congress questioned the administrations credibility 
anyway noting that azconas written request for help was dated 
tuesday and the administration had been telling lawmakers that no 
such request had been made as recently as wednesday afternoon 
asked today about the complaints fitzwater said they were 
told exactly what happened that options were being considered and 
no decision had been made 
we feel the consultations were thorough and appropriate he 
said a lot of this is just politics and nothing can be done 
about that our people felt they were fully responsive 
abrams said the administration is considering a request for new 
aid for the rebels on feb 3 reagan narrowly lost a house vote on 
his last such request and a democratic alternative was defeated 
216 to 208 a month later a handful of votes tilted one way or the 
other typically determines the outcome on the longstanding and 
polarized issue

boost their salaries to levels comparable to workers at ford motor

local 3000 members who voted thursday supported the contract which 
covers more than 2000 workers at the plant in flat rock south of 
detroit the workers make the mx6 for mazda and the probe for ford 
the agreement reached monday went into effect march 7 and will 
run through march 3 1991 it will give mazdas us workers wage 
parity with ford workers by 1991 the uaw said 
we are pleased with the results of our negotiations said 
henry g schultz mazda director of labor relations

constructively with anyone who chooses to invest in america and who 
seeks a constructive relationship with us said uaw president 
owen bieber

said 
in addition beginning in 1989 mazda workers will receive 
annual lumpsum payments equal to 3 percent of their wages the 
union said the average worker should receive about 2500 
ford workers will receive the 3 percent bonuses in the second

like the ford contract the mazda contract also includes 
costofliving adjustments the mazda pact also contains a 
commitment to provide job security as long as the company remains 
competitive the union and company said 
if ford workers win a wage increase in 1990 negotiations mazda 
workers salaries will be adjusted to match 
employees with three months service prior to negotiation of the 
agreement will receive a signing bonus of 750 other employees 
will get 250

millions of asians 
prayed pounded drums and danced in the streets friday to greet 
total eclipse of the sun that drew a curtain of darkness across 
land and sea 
young filipinos shot rifles and tossed firecrackers at the 
blackened sky in northern india thousands of naked men and women 
jostled their way into huge sacred pools to cleanse their souls in 
a massive hindu ritual 
i am at peace today said ram avtar dripping beads of 
sacred water in kurukshetra india 
the 27yearold businessman had journeyed 450 miles to the site 
of the two holiest pools to fulfill his late fathers final wish a 
dip in sacred waters to seek salvation for his forefathers 
about one million people waded or dived into kurukshetras holy 
water 
the eclipse was the most spectacular along a 108mile swath that 
moved from the indian ocean across indonesia and the southern 
philippine island of mindanao during the morning hours 
but a partial eclipse could be seen as far west as india and 
eastward into parts of australia new guinea and the pacific 
islands scientists said the eclipse would end at sunset in the 
gulf of alaska 
along the 108mile path the shadow of the moon darkened the sun 
for up to four minutes clouds obscured the view in jakarta 
indonesia hong kong and in the eastern mindanao city of davao 
where thousands of tourists and scientists had gathered to observe 
the eclipse 
philippines president corazon aquino flew to general davos city 
where it was visible for about three minutes 
wilson sinambela of indonesias national institute of 
aeronautics said a total eclipse was observed in several parts of 
his country he said thousands of indonesians prayed and beat drums 
to herald the start of the eclipse 
in hong kong hundreds of chinese went to the space museum to 
view the eclipse through telescopes but clouds prevented them from 
doing so instead the museum showed video tapes of previous 
eclipses 
in baguio city 130 miles north of manila pregnant women rinsed 
their hair with water dripped from burned rice straws 
local superstition has it that babies conceived during or 
shortly before an eclipse will be deformed unless their mothers 
practice the ritual 
in kurukshetra amid the chanting of hymns and the blowing of 
conch shells 3000 naked hindu holy men were the first to enter 
the pools at 630 am 
massive waves of men and women some clothed others naked 
followed the bathers pushed and shoved their way into the pools 
that can accommodate only about 125000 people at a time the 
eclipse lasted only half an hour 
the scene was repeated in smaller numbers at rivers and pools 
across india but kurukshetra was the most popular because legend 
says the hindu god lord krishna once appeared there during an 
ancient battle 
prasanni devi said she came to kurukshetra against the wishes of 
her children 
my children do not believe in the holy dictum said the 
68yearold widow who traveled 235 miles to the holy town 
throughout my life i had wanted to come here in the company of my 
husband but he left me alone to get salvation 
divers and lifeguards in boats kept watch over the bathers but 
no trouble was reported 
in general santos city the eclipse set off wild cheering among 
the thousands who watched the phenomenon in a scorching tropical 
heat 
armed troops surrounded the twostory town hall where teams of 
scientists had set up telescopes and cameras friday was the 20th 
anniversary of the moslem rebel moro national liberation front 
which operates in this area 
in zamboanga city in western mindanao hundreds of people fired 
weapons in keeping with a superstition that loud noise will scare 
the sun from devouring the moon police said there were no injuries 
in manila police said four people were injured when a passenger 
bus collided with a jeep 
the drivers were probably looking skyward when the accident 
occurred said policeman ricardo manansala its impossible to 
gaze at the sky and drive a vehicle at the same time 
solar eclipses occur when the moon positions itself between the 
earth and the sun the chinese first recorded a total solar eclipse 
in 2137 bc and regarded it as a battle between the sun and a 
dragon 
the eclipse friday was the last one in southern asia for at 
least 50 years

the spring equinox is near an event that in 
centuries past marked the new year for everyone and still does in 
spirit for many 
the vernal equinox is a marker on the great wheel of time a 
reassurance of order in a world where confusion and disorder too 
often seem to have the upper hand observed the late nature 
writer hal borland 
it is a promise of predictable change certain as sunrise 
from the rigors of winter to the benevolence of spring it is 
variety in a time of doubt and uncertainty borland wrote in his 
book twelve moons of the year 
the actual moment of the grand event occurs this year at 439 
am est sunday according to astronomers at the us naval 
observatory here 
thats the moment that the sun is directly above the equator and 
poised to begin bringing its direct rays to the northern hemisphere 
its called the equinox because it is a time when the hours of 
daylight and darkness are nearly equal 
the amount of daylight has been growing longer since the winter 
solstice last december and will keep doing so until junes summer 
solstice when things start back the other way 
in roman times this season marked the new year and indeed many 
countries continued to celebrate new year in march until just a 
couple of hundred years ago 
the observance may well be logical at a time of rebirth with 
winters chill fading early flowers coming forth and planting 
getting under way for the new crops 
in fact it is still new years for some folks astronomers 
measure the length of the year from one vernal equinox to the next 
but todays popular calendars set forth this equinox as the 
start of spring a widely accepted if not official definition 
indeed the english weather historian richard inwards considered 
counting this date as the start of spring illogical 
better from his point of view were either the medieval 
reckoning that spring began on feb 22 or the farmers calendar 
still followed by meteorologists that counts spring as beginning 
march 1 
inwards though was calculating his seasons according to the 
weather in england which is generally milder than many other areas 
generally spring is a time of gradually gentling weather as the 
increasing amounts of sunshine warm and land and people but the 
promise can be a fickle one suddenly overturned by a stubborn 
winter storm 
spring in other words is where you find it but at least the 
arrival of the equinox is a pleasant reminder that better times are 
on the way

offensive in the border region which began march 8 
when he heard of the honduran attack ortega abruptly left a 
meeting with representatives of opposition parties in managua

gunships were flown in for the us exercise

negotiators trying to work out a settlement in the 
afghanistan war were reportedly under new pressure to reach an 
agreement friday after a statement released by the soviet foreign 
ministry 
the talks recessed for the weekend and un officials said they 
would resume monday 
an afghan rebel leader said the soviet union was secretly trying 
to contact the resistance to negotiate an agreement 
in moscow foreign ministry spokesman vadim p perfiliev said if 
a settlement proved impossible in geneva moscows withdrawal of 
its troops from afghanistan will be performed differently from 
terms agreed to this month 
those terms state that the 115000 red army troops would be out 
of afghanistan in a ninemonth span and that half would leave in 
the first three months the troops intervened in december 1979 
a source close to the geneva talks who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said the statement was expected to add momentum to the 
unmediated negotiations 
a pakistani source said the soviet statement seemed designed to 
pressure pakistan into modifying its demand that a settlement be 
linked to the formation of a new government in afghanistan to 
oversee a settlement 
pakistan represents the guerrillas in the talks 
in peshawar pakistan gulbaddin hekmatyar the new chairman of 
the afghan resistance said the soviets were trying secretly to 
contact the insurgents 
the russians are willing to talk but secretly they are 
trying for it but secretly not openly hekmatyar said 
hekmatyar also said that only an agreement with the resistance 
would guarantee the red armys safe passage out of afghanistan 
the guerrillas do not recognize kabuls sovietbacked government 
and have said the un talks are useless because they dont 
directly involve them and the soviets 
the russians have to realize the fact that without an 
agreement with the mujahedeen it is not possible for the afghan 
crisis to be solved said hekmatyar 
he said the guerrillas would stop fighting if the soviet troops 
withdraw unconditionally and abandon attempts to preserve the 
communists power 
we will give them safe passage to leave afghanistan if 
they take the government they brought by their forces along with 
them hekmatyar said we will open the gates of afghanistan for 
them to leave 
if not he said the guerrillas will increase attacks on soviet 
bases and concentrate on their expected withdrawal route through 
northern afghanistan

disagreement over a 1907 border treaty 
stalled talks friday between laos and thailand to resolve a 
frontier conflict that has claimed hundreds of lives 
thailands ambassador to laos niran panupong said both sides 
have different interpretations of the treaty between his country 
and what was then frenchruled laos 
in addition thongsi intapon a laotian official of the prime 
ministers office said laos first wanted to define the role and 
duties of a joint border committee proposed by the thais before 
such a body is formed 
if we commit ourselves to that committee now we will find 
ourselves arguing in the jungles thongsi told reporters 
accompanying the 15member thai delegation to the talks 
the thais want an agreement defining the location of the border 
in the disputed wedge of hills between thailands northern 
phitsanulok province and laos sayaboury province 
top thai army officials have said 147 thai soldiers and 402 
laotian troops died before the two sides began a truce and pledged 
to enter into peace talks feb 19 
the thais say they will take the dispute to the world court if a 
bilateral agreement is not reached but thongsi said such a move 
would be a last resort and not necessary 
he said the prime ministers of both countries want a speedy 
agreement but added the talks could take quite a while if the 
atmosphere at fridays meeting persisted 
the 1030mile border is poorly defined and a similar 
territorial dispute over three border villages led to battles in

gov evan mecham his honesty challenged 
on the witness stand shouted hes tired of this kind of 
baloney but acknowledged ordering arizonas top lawman not to 
cooperate in an investigation of an alleged death threat 
the firstterm republican governor got into more than one 
shouting match with prosecutor paul eckstein during his second day 
of testimony at his impeachment trial thursday as eckstein sought 
to damage mechams credibility 
mecham is accused of trying to thwart an investigation of the 
death threat allegedly made by one of his staffers against a top 
aide who was scheduled to testify before a grand jury investigating 
the governors campaign finances 
he returned to the stand today and was expected to complete his 
testimony on the accusation the first of three major charges 
against him he also is accused of concealing a 350000 campaign 
loan and of misusing 80000 from a state fund by loaning it to his 
auto dealership 
at least one other witness was expected to be recalled to the 
stand state official peggy griffith who reported the alleged 
death threat nov 13 the last scheduled witness was mechams own 
defense attorney fred craft who was present at a key meeting in 
connection with the obstruction claim 
mecham fighting for his political life insisted thursday he 
was kept in the dark about the details of the death threat made by 
a former state official lee watkins when he did hear about it he 
said he didnt consider it serious 
two somewhat excitable people had a verbal exchange and 
somewhere along the line there were those who determined they would 
make something out of it he said its a total manufactured 
thing 
mecham acknowledged however that he ordered ralph milstead 
the state department of public safety director not to cooperate 
with an attorney generals investigation of the alleged threat 
i said tell them weve looked into it and theres nothing to 
it he said 
mecham said today he wishes he had fired milstead and that if 
he had we wouldnt be sitting in this body in this action 
today i have highly repented of that 
during nearly three weeks of testimony witnesses quoted watkins 
as saying that mechams former top aide donna carlson might go 
on a long boat ride if she testified before the grand jury 
watkins has denied the charge 
it would require a twothirds vote of the 30member state senate 
to remove mecham from office they could then take another vote on 
barring him from any future state office 
in addition to the impeachment trial the first of a us 
governor in six decades mecham faces a criminal trial april 21 on 
felony charges that he concealed the 350000 loan he also faces a 
recall election may 17 
attorney general bob corbin confirmed thursday his office also 
is looking into a 150000 personal loan taken by mecham in 
december to pay off the unreported campaign loan 
in a series of testy exchanges under crossexamination by 
eckstein thursday mecham turned combative and at one point 
declared i am kind of tired of this kind of baloney 
during six hours on the stand the governor pleaded a faulty 
memory for details but said he knew one thing he had never been 
accused of anything worse than a traffic ticket before the current 
proceedings 
eckstein then produced copies of two lawsuits in which mecham 
was accused of fraud in business deals 
the governor bristled saying that was not the same thing and 
attempted a lengthy explanation that became a shouting match as the 
attorney tried to stop him 
this has to be told youre trying to impugn my honesty 
mecham said 
eckstein interrupted sayingill ask the questions 
ill respond as i see fit snapped mecham ive earned the 
right to respond 
at one point mecham said hopefully i will be back on the 
ninth floor the governors office in the near future and as he 
left the senate building he flashed a thumbsup sign to reporters 
and wellwishers

12yearold girl was raped didnt heed a supervisors order to kick 
in a door

buildings landlord to arrive with a key instead of breaking down 
the door to rescue the girl 
the tape indicates horka arrived outside the apartment at 439 
am on dec 20 and said over the radio two minutes later were 
going to the back door supposedly its a home invasion 
the order to kick down the door came two minutes after horka 
told his superiors the girls mother was worried for the welfare 
of her 12yearold daughter according to the tape 
horkas supervisor sgt ernest targonski said youve got 
to get in there somehow so long as she states that the man is in 
there weve got to push the door in push the door in 
but horka and two other police officers waited almost a 
halfhour before entering the home the tape indicates 
the girl was rescued when officer peter miller arrived at the 
scene and entered the apartment through an open back door

the incident was a rape he replied i dont know i dont know 
what this is right now

massachusetts gov michael dukakis holds a 
slight edge in kansas democratic presidential caucuses on saturday 
based on an organization that even his rivals concede is strong 
dukakis jesse jackson and albert gore jr all campaigned in 
kansas this week trying to kindle enthusiasm among registered 
democrats and spur them to turn out at 117 caucuses kansas with 
only 39 national convention delegates has been ignored until now 
weve been organized in kansas for eight months said state 
sen paul feleciano dukakis state chairman i feel very good 
heading into the caucuses i think well get 20 to 24 of the 39 
delegates still to be picked 
state sen joe norvell a gore supporter conceded dukakis 
organizational lead in kansas but said i do believe that with 
sen gores extensive campaign trip through the state his efforts 
could minimize what i would consider an early lead for gov 
dukakis 
gore lacking a big organization here campaigned wednesday and 
thursday throughout the state the tennessee senator won 
endorsements from state treasurer joan finney the highest elected 
democratic state official and a qualified endorsement from state 
chairman jim parrish 
were it not for my promise to the democratic state committee 
early on to stay neutral until the 19th of march id be making 
a public announcement for you parrish told gore im leaning 
very much in your favor 
jackson has had a better organizational effort in kansas than 
has gore but his supporters conceded recently they are not 
organized in enough counties to garner a majority of the kansas 
delegates 
rep jim slattery who supports missouri rep richard gephardt 
said friday his candidate would do well in kansas and he said 
michigan is a doordie state for gephardt michigans 
democratic caucuses will be held march 26 
i always hate to make predictions that can be proven wrong in 
48 hours so ill avoid doing that i think theyll all get 
delegates rep dick gephardt and undecided will do well 
slattery said 
gore supporter norvell also predicted a large uncommitted vote 
saturday saying he thinks kansas democrats still are making up 
their minds 
i really do not see a frontrunner in kansas he said 
democrats will caucus saturday afternoon and vote for delegates 
to the district conventions april 23 and the state convention may

illegal aliens are driving down wages and job 
conditions for lowincome native americans and legal immigrants but 
also are indirectly enhancing job opportunities for some 
higherskilled workers congressional investigators say in a new 
report 
hurt most by the tide of illegal workers sweeping border farm 
and some metropolitan areas are native and legally documented 
immigrant crop pickers janitors and food processing workers the 
general accounting office says 
wage and benefit increases won by largely legal mexican migrants 
and native black workers under union organizing campaigns in those 
industries in the 1970s have disappeared as they have been 
displaced by illegal immigrants working at often belowminimum 
wages the gao said in a 70page report 
for example janitors in downtown los angeles office buildings 
most of them black or legal hispanic immigrants had won wage and 
benefits reaching a peak of 12 an hour by 1983 under union 
contracts according to the report 
however a group of aggressive nonunion janitorial services 
hiring predominantly illegal immigrants have since wrested away the 
best building contracts driving the union scale back down to 4 an 
hour and below 
of 2500 black janitors working under highwage contracts in 
1977 only 100 still enjoyed comparative wages by 1985 the gao 
said the union still had 600 working members but 500 of them had 
suffered large pay cuts 
citrus and tomato pickers in southern california many of them 
mexicans admitted under guest worker programs have seen their 
wages and benefits drop by 18 percent since 1975 because of the 
growing use of illegal immigrants by farm labor contractors the 
gao said 
however the congressional investigators said it is impossible 
to measure what it called the net effects of the growing use of 
illegal aliens in other businesses such as fullservice 
restaurants and highfashion shoe and garment manufacturing 
the increased supply of illegal workers undoubtedly depressed 
wages for some natives or legal immigrants in those industries 
too the gao said 
but at the same time by stimulating business they also 
expanded employment opportunities and wages for other legal and 
native workers in complementary usually skilled occupations it 
said 
as an example it cited fullservice restaurants that use 
illegal aliens as dishwashers and busboys the associated labor 
savings allow low prices that lead to expanded sales creating jobs 
for more higherskilled and higherpaid chefs and waiters the gao 
said 
citing case studies in new york city and los angeles the gao 
said illegal immigrants working at low wages by us standards have 
meant the survival of small specialized companies in the 
highfashion womens footwear and garment industries 
the studies quoted owners of those companies as saying they are 
under intense cost pressure from foreign producers and could not 
find americans or legal immigrants willing to work all day behind 
sewing machines or with the skills needed to produce highfashion 
womens shoes 
without a supply of illegal workers the gao concluded many of 
those businesses would close down or move their operations out of 
the country 
the labor department strongly disagreed with the gaos 
conclusions saying none of the studies it surveyed offered any 
concrete evidence of a positive effect from using illegal workers 
except the comments from employers 
in a formal reply to the report the department also disputed 
gaos premise that legal workers wont take many of the lowwage 
jobs particuarly in the shoe and garment industries 
the fact is that large numbers of native and legal us 
workers are in the same labor market as illegal workers the 
labor department said if wages were not depressed by illegal 
workers even greater numbers of native and legal workers would be 
in that labor market 
the study was requested by congress in 1985 when it was 
considering immigration reform legislation enacted a year later 
providing for government fines against employers who use illegal 
aliens 
if successful the gao said those employer sanctions will force 
wages up for legal immigrants and natives causing considerable 
stress financially for growers and some manufacturers

police on friday threatened 
strict action against organizers of a national strike set for 
monday the anniversary of the 1960 sharpeville massacre 
antiapartheid organizations have called for a national day of 
protest to mark the anniversary and to protest the recent 
crackdown on major black opposition groups 
the strike also had been intended to protest the scheduled 
execution friday of six blacks from sharpeville convicted of 
complicity in the 1984 mob killing of a black town councilor during 
antiapartheid riots 
on thursday 15 hours before the hangings were to take place a 
judge granted a onemonth stay of execution to the sharpeville 
six instead of a mass execution one black man convicted in a 
separate murder case was hanged at pretoria central prison at dawn 
friday without fanfare or an overnight vigil 
tsepo letsoara 24 was convicted of killing a black woman in 
october 1985 there was no campaign to save him and neither the 
government nor its opponents has contended that his crime had 
political overtones 
police commanders announced that reinforcements would be 
deployed monday in the johannesburg area where the strike is 
expected to be most widespread 
calls for strikes are illegal under emergency regulations in 
effect since june 1986 but on other days of protests since 
then hundreds of thousands of black workers and students have 
stayed home 
we are planning all actions humanly possible to prevent 
persons from intimidating and preventing workers from being able to 
do a good days work said lt pierre louw a police spokesman 
he said labor unions and other elements organizing the 
strike were under investigation 
march 21 is observed annually by blacks as sharpeville day 
to mark the day in 1960 when 69 blacks were shot and killed by 
police in the township south of johannesburg while demonstrating 
against the pass laws the laws restricting blacks freedom of 
movement have since been repealed 
antiapartheid riots broke out in sharpeville and nearby 
townships in september 1984 starting a twoyear period of 
nationwide unrest in which more than 2000 blacks were killed the 
councilor whose murder led to the sharpeville six trial was 
killed on the first day of those riots 
the five black men and one woman gained their reprieve when 
pretoria supreme court justice willem human granted a onemonth 
stay of execution after receiving evidence of perjury by a 
prosecution witness 
the government said it ignored a massive international appeal 
for clemency leaving the case in the hands of the judge 
attorney prakash diar said friday the defense team had already 
begun preparing an application to reopen the trial and reexamine 
government witnesses 
the six were convicted under the principle of common cause 
which held them responsible for the september 1984 death of town 
councilor jacob dlamini because they were part of a crowd of 100 
who stoned and burned him to death in sharpeville 
president pw botha had rejected pleas from leaders of most 
western nations and from countries and organizations around the 
world to grant clemency the government said humans decision 
proves the wisdom of the state president and his ministers in 
deciding not to intervene in the due process of law 
two johannesburg newspapers reported friday that botha had 
granted clemency three weeks ago to a black policeman who had been 
sentenced to death for 1986 murder of a youth in mamelodi a black 
township outside pretoria 
a spokesman for justice department said botha had commuted 
constable george john sindanes death sentence to eight years in 
prison and he was one of five people whose death sentences were 
commuted this year

soviet scientists are working around the clock to 
prepare the first launch of their space shuttle on an unmanned test 
flight expected by june officials said friday 
alexander i dunayev the head of the space agency glavkosmos 
also said that the agency plans to use the actual shuttle not a 
dummy in the test flight and that more than one of the craft will 
be built 
dunayevs comments at a news conference were the most detailed 
to date about the soviet shuttle the session was called to discuss 
thursdays launch of an indian satellite by a soviet rocket 
the soviets are believed to have been developing their own 
winged reusable spacecraft since at least 1982 but soviet 
officials did not confirm the project until december 1984 and have 
released little information about it 
dunayev said the first flight of the shuttle was imminent 
we are now working quite energetically on testing on land on 
the surface of the components we are working literally round the 
clock he said 
he refused to specify when the launch will occur saying only 
that it would be in the nearest future 
it is very important that this flight be very thoroughly 
prepared so i would not get involved in some guesswork dunayev 
said 
however another soviet space official speaking privately said 
the first flight would occur in the first half of this year 
neither he nor dunayev would comment on when the first manned 
flight would occur 
dunayev said soviet scientists were encountering difficulties 
daily in preparing the shuttle but he did not provide details 
western specialists on the soviet space program have said the 
flight would be unmanned and computerized dunayev confirmed the 
flight would be totally automated because the soviet union believes 
pilotless tests are prudent 
with the development of manned spacecraft the soviet union 
prefers at the first stage automats he said and we believe 
that for the sake of security of human life what is required above 
all is to ensure that man survives 
he went on to imply that us space officials were not as 
concerned about astronauts safety as the soviets were seven 
astronauts were killed when the space shuttle challenger exploded 
in january 1986 
we pursue the fundamental objective whether man is alive or 
dead after the flight on the basis of that we regard the 
fundamental differences between the soviet direction of development 
and the us part of development dunayev said 
james oberg an american specialist on the soviet space program 
said in a telephone interview from his home in texas that the 
soviet shuttle may include a separable nose section from which the 
crew could escape in an emergency 
soviet officials have said little about the size or other 
characteristics of the shuttle but the soviet press has reported 
the shuttle will be lifted into orbit by the new energia rocket 
booster which can carry up to 100 tons of payload more than the 
us shuttle 
in its first test may 15 energia successfully carried aloft a 
payload but the payloads own engines failed 
alexei f bogomolov director of the soviet mission control 
center near moscow called medvezhyi ozero said in an interview the 
shuttle will have onboard engines to orient the craft in space and 
maneuver it through the atmosphere toward a runway landing the 
us shuttle glides powerless to landings 
the soviet space chief said the soviet union plans a fleet of 
shuttles 
how many its difficult to say it is clear that we will have 
more than one he said

developer donald trump has a handshake agreement 
to buy the landmark plaza hotel for 450 million the wall street 
journal reported friday 
the plazas owners have agreed on basic terms with trump and are 
expected to sign a binding contract next week according to sources 
quoted in newspaper 
a spokeswoman for trump and a spokesman at howard rubenstein 
associates which represents trump did not return telephone calls 
seeking confirmation friday 
another unidentified source quoted by the journal said trump was 
the preferred bidder because it was believed he was most likely to 
restore the hotels luster 
the 81yearold landmark hotel was acquired in january from the 
allegis corp when robert m bass of fort worth texas and the 
tokyobased aoki corp bought the westin hotels and resorts chain 
an allegis subsidiary for 153 billion bass owns 71 percent of 
the plaza aoki owns the rest the journal said a bass spokesman 
declined comment 
the hotel which overlooks central park at fifth avenue can be 
seen from trump tower on fifth avenue which combines restaurants 
shops and apartments 
the plaza is expected to earn 22 million this year which 
industry professionals quoted by the journal said is a meager 
return for the price trump is offering 
i think anything over 350 million is high stephen brenner 
a new york hotel consultant said 
in 1907 the plaza opened as a permanent residency hotel and 
later became a commercial hotel a few tenants from before world 
war ii are protected by rent control laws and pay 200 a month in

a government commission has declared 
polands first sex education book unacceptable and banned it from 
schools ending a sixmonth debate that made the text a bestseller 
on the black market 
preparation for life in the family was introduced in high 
schools last fall to a storm of protest 
one normally progovernment lay catholic newspaper called it a 
textbook for masturbation and defloration another called it a 
sex manual for beginners 
critics said it violated religious teachings and encouraged 
premarital sex 
after two months of complaints minister of national education 
henryk bednarski in november suspended the books use in high 
schools 
on friday official newspapers announced that a special 
commission appointed by bednarski to evaluate the book now had 
banned it permanently 
the controversy didnt hurt the texts popularity the first 
printing of 500000 copies sold out in state book stores and is 
available only at inflated prices on the black market according to 
newspaper reports 
the book was designed for use in a nationwide high school course 
on family life and sexual matters which had been taught since 1973 
without a text 
many parents and clergy lined up against the book but it was 
defended by such odd political bedfellows as writers for communist 
party papers and the underground publications of the banned 
solidarity trade union federation 
the commission reviewing the book including teachers 
psychologists doctors and other experts held its final meeting 
thursday 
according to the official pap news agency the commission 
chairwoman concluded we appreciate the necessity of giving youth 
sexual knowledge but we think that the book as a mandatory 
textbook is unacceptable 
the chairwoman anna przeclawska dean of warsaw universitys 
pedagogics department said experts found the book replete with 
mistakes about biological and psychological topics and filled with 
overly difficult language and inappropriate graphics 
it presented a onesided biological conception of sexual 
problems omitting the need for friendship and love she said 
a roman catholic church weekly niedziela said explicit 
illustrations of sexual positions could lead to the arousal of 
children and undermine parental authority 
the commission recommended that work proceed slowly on a new 
textbook stressing that what is most important is the teacher 
who cannot be replaced by anything 
a commentator on the popular youthoriented television news 
broadcast teleexpress condemned the book ban and said young 
people will be doomed to barnyard knowledge or often unqualified 
teachers 
the books defenders argued that it presented the roman catholic 
view of opposing artificial contraception and abortions 
they included the polish united workers party weekly polityka 
which published letters from readers who complained that poland is 
sexually backward 
one reader said there were cases in which sales clerks 
deliberately punched holes in condoms because this is the kind of 
morality we have in poland 
daniel passent a polityka columnist accused the roman catholic 
majority of attempting to force its views on the noncatholic 
minority 
several writers in clandestine weeklies published by solidarity 
also objected to the campaign against the book which in turn 
prompted outraged responses from prounion priests and activists 
a commentary in november in the most widely circulated 
solidarity underground weekly tygodnik mazowsze said sexual 
knowledge among young poles was close to medieval 
the books backers argued the textbook was needed because many 
youths lack information about sex and birth control 
estimates of the number of abortions per year range as high as 
800000 according to official statistics every sixth woman who 
gets married under the age of 20 is already pregnant

a baby with a fatal birth defect who 
was maintained on a respirator for a week to preserve his organs 
for transplant clung to life friday without life support officials 
said 
the boy born with most of his brain and skull missing was 
taken off the respirator thursday at loma linda university medical 
center after he failed to show signs of brain death the hospital 
requires before taking organs for transplant 
baby d continues to breathe on his own and is being kept 
comfortable said spokeswoman anita rockwell 
meanwhile another infant with the same condition being kept 
alive in the loma linda organ donor program began to show signs of 
impending brain death friday 
babies with the defect called anencephaly usually die within 
hours or days of being taken off lifesupport systems ms rockwell 
said 
loma linda developed the first medical guidelines in the united 
states for using lifesupport equipment to preserve anencephalics 
hearts and other organs for transplant if the babies are allowed 
to die naturally their organs deteriorate to the point of being 
unsuitable for transplant 
the girl is the fifth anencephalic infant delivered into loma 
lindas donor program the first was stillborn and the second met 
criteria for brain death but a suitable recipient for his organs 
couldnt be found before the body parts deteriorated 
the other two never met the hospitals criteria 
under the guidelines infants are placed on lifesupport systems 
for seven days if doctors determine an infant is brain dead within 
that time the hospital will alert organ procurement agencies 
nationwide and a search for a suitable recipient will begin 
the hospitals criteria for brain death require that an infant 
be in a coma and unable to breathe on his or her own and show an 
absence of eye reflexes ms rockwell said 
the lifesupport system helps prevent the infants heart liver 
and other vital organs from deteriorating until doctors have 
determined the baby is brain dead 
the hospitals procedure was devised to address ethical 
questions surrounding the use of doomed anencephalics as organ 
donors 
if an infant is not declared brain dead within seven days he or 
she is taken off the respirator and allowed to die naturally 
without further consideration as a donor

very low blood cholesterol increases the 
risk of one form of stroke even though it decreases the overall 
risk of all forms of stroke researchers said friday 
a sixyear study of 350000 men showed that those with 
cholesterol levels below 160 were three times as likely as others 
to have a socalled hemorrhagic stroke in which a blood vessel 
bursts and the subsequent bleeding damages parts of the brain 
the studys principal author dr hiroyasu iso of the university 
of minnesota and the university of tsukuba in tsukuba city japan 
said his findings do not suggest any change in public health 
efforts to get americans to lower their blood cholesterol levels 
public efforts to lower cholesterol should continue and our 
efforts to understand the etiology cause of stroke should 
increase iso said in presenting his results at a meeting of the 
american heart association 
hemorrhagic strokes are less common than strokes caused by 
clots which account for 70 percent to 80 percent of all strokes 
the increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke was observed only in 
men with high blood pressure but there might be a smaller increase 
in risk in people with normal blood pressure iso said his study 
couldnt determine that he said 
the increased risk occurred in men with blood cholesterol levels 
below 160 milligrams only 6 percent of the men he studies had 
cholesterol levels that low he said the mean blood cholesterol 
level in the subjects was 211 milligrams 
cholesterol levels below 200 milligrams are associated with a 
low level of coronary heart disease 
levels over 240 milligrams double the risk twenty percent to 25 
percent of americans have cholesterol levels in this range 
according to the heart association 
in japan low levels of cholesterol are more common and 
hemorrhagic strokes are more common too iso said 
dr william kannel of the framingham heart study in 
massachusetts said that study shows a similar risk associated with 
low cholesterol as does the honolulu heart study directed by dr 
dwayne reed of the national heart lung and blood institute 
those researchers and others said however that the risk 
associated with very low cholesterol is outweighed by the benefits 
nothing confers immortality said kannel youre always 
dealing with tradeoffs he emphasized that coronary heart 
disease with its strong link to elevated cholesterol is the chief 
form of heart disease given that id say get your cholesterol 
as low as you can he said 
if you look at total stroke said dr lewis kuller of the 
university of pittsburgh theres no question the lower the 
cholesterol the better

the soviet union announced friday 
it will borrow political and economic reforms from yugoslavia and 
reiterated that it wont impose its policies on other communist 
nations 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev pledged as he ended a trip to 
yugoslavia that eastern european countries are free to follow any 
paths to socialism without soviet interference 
this echoed speeches gorbachev made twice last year but it 
marked the first time he put such a pledge into a formal document 
the declaration also signed by yugoslav president lazar mojsov 
brings the soviet union one step closer to abandoning at least on 
paper the socalled brezhnev doctrine that tolerates no 
alternative to moscows brand of communism 
gorbachev returned to moscow on friday after a fiveday visit to 
yugoslavia that gave him a firsthand look at the countrys 
decentralized economy and at its ethnic divisions similar to those 
the kremlin confronts at home 
the trip one of his longest to a foreign country included 
detailed talks with communist leaders factory visits in belgrade 
and a stroll friday through the medieval buildings and sundrenched 
narrow streets of dubrovnik 
proceeding from the conviction that no one has a monopoly over 
the truth the two sides declare that they have no pretensions of 
imposing their concept of social development on anyone the 
declaration said 
for the first time too the soviet union embraced the concept 
of socialist selfmanagement that had been developed by yugoslav 
leader josip broz tito after he broke with moscow in 1948 
the two sides consider the development of socialist 
selfmanagement in keeping with the specificities of each country 
to be of the highest importance the declaration said 
it ensures the genuine authority of the people and the freedom 
of the individual and is a dependable guarantee against any 
administrativebureaucratic distortion of socialism the 
declaration said 
fridays document replaces agreements reached by both countries 
in 1955 and 1956 when then soviet leader nikita khrushchev 
signaled that the kremlin might tolerate alternative ways to 
communism 
but in 1956 workers unrests were crushed in poland and soviet 
tanks quashed revolt in budapest 
soviet historians have hinted in past months that moscow may be 
willing to review its assessment of czechoslovakias attempt in 
1968 to develop an alternative brand of communism 
however the present prague communist leadership took power 
after the reforms were crushed by a sovietled warsaw pact invasion 
therefore any reassessment of prague spring would have to be 
sensitive to those currently in power 
fridays declaration indicates moscow wants to borrow some 
economic and political practices from yugoslavia whose position 
between east and west has enhanced its international standing and 
standard of living over the past four decades 
meat dairy and fresh produce often in short supply for 
soviets are readily available to yugoslavs who also have access to 
western luxury items like the sony walkman which are still a 
coveted prize for most soviets 
but tripledigit inflation has cut yugoslavs standard of living 
by at least a third since 1980 placing many consumer items out of 
reach of workers earning an average wage of 180 a month 
a 20 billion debt has built up and many yugoslavs expect times 
to get even harder after the international monetary fund completes 
negotiations this spring on how to reschedule debt payments 
gorbachev indicated tuesday he also would not favor too much 
decentralization of his economy telling workers at the belgrade 
factory that we have to maintain a regulatory role in order not 
to make mistakes 
fridays document said the soviets and yugoslavs will work to 
develop political and personal contacts

the reagan administration is assured that 
nuclear warheads will not be placed on chinese intermediaterange 
missiles sold to saudi arabia but the sale is still a disturbing 
regional trend the state department said friday 
the department confirmed that saudi arabia had acquired chinese 
missiles with a range of 2200 miles capable of hitting all areas 
of the middle east including israel 
with iran and iraq engaged in a socalled war of the cities 
the lobbing of missiles against major population centers the 
introduction of more rockets into the region has raised concerns in 
washington spokesmen said 
it is another part of a disturbing regional trend in 
surfacetosurface missile proliferation said rudolph boone a 
state department press officer the sum total of the 
proliferation is a degradation of the security of all states in the 
region 
the missiles were described as chinese css2 rockets similar to 
those used in chinas limited space program in the early 1970s and 
capable of being outfitted with nuclear warheads 
such a system is not in the interests of peace and stability 
in the region boone said 
secretary of state george p shultz expressed us concern about 
the sales when he talked last week with chinese foreign minister wu 
xueqian spokesman charles e redman said 
wu and other chinese officials since then have told the united 
states categorically that it will not export nuclear weapons to 
any government we accept these assurances redman said 
saudi arabia as well has assured us at the very highest level 
that saudi arabia does not have nor does it intend to acquire any 
nuclear capability redman said 
he said the united states was in close touch with saudi arabia 
on the issue as well as with other governments in the region 
presumably israel 
the united states and six other major industrialized democracies 
have agreed not to export ballistic and cruise missiles capable of 
carrying payloads of 1100 pounds more than 187 miles 
weve been actively engaged in an effort to get other 
countries to join that regime redman said all nations were 
invited to join in the case of the chinese we have approached them 
specifically on several occasions about discussing it but we 
really havent had any response to that invitation 
according to other officials who spoke on condition of 
anonymity saudi arabia sought the chinese missiles after the us 
congress blocked the sale of 48 f15 jet fighters to the saudis 
congress agreed late last year to permit the sale of 24 f15s 
enough to keep saudi air strength at current levels 
the administration has said saudi arabia needs sophisticated 
weapons for defense against a possible widening of the 7yearold 
iraniraq war

once the home of viking chiefs and 
storyteller hans christian andersen the city of odense celebrated 
its 1000th birthday friday with hopes of recapturing the grandeur 
of its past 
this city in central denmark was once a cultural center and 
industrial power but it fell on hard economic times local 
officials have planned yearlong millenium festivities to help 
generate new business 
queen margrethe ii marked the citys anniversary by attending a 
day of music and pageantry under clear skies fireworks and a 
torchlight procession were scheduled for the evening 
cultural and sporting events such as the junior cycling world 
championships ballet theater and a huge laserbased 
soundandlight show were planned for later in the year 
odense is at the geographic center of denmark on the island of 
funen it takes its birth date from the first written reference to 
the city ever found a letter from german emperor otto iii 
granting the church in odense tax relief it was dated march 18 
988 
the citys symbol is a swan from andersens fairy tale of the 
ugly duckling because odense developed from a poor backward 
farming town to an industrial powerhouse 
but odenses shipbuilding iron and wood industries eventually 
became outdated and unemployment climbed 
in recent years much of odenses income has come from tourists 
visiting the yellow cottage where andersen the son of a shoemaker 
and a washerwoman was born in 1805 
about 200000 people every year visit the home of denmarks most 
famous author who wrote the princess and the pea the 
emperors new clothes and other tales 
parts of odense are the same as in andersens days with winding 
cobblestoned streets lined with 18thcentury houses but today the 
charm of the inner city is surrounded by highrise buildings and 
urban malls 
with 173000 residents odense is denmarks third largest city 
about 100 years ago it was the biggest in the country today it is 
dominated by small companies 97 percent of which employ fewer than 
50 people 
we have one of the countrys highest unemployment rates 
almost 11 percent and growing said bjarne christensen the city 
manager the average jobless rate in denmark is 8 percent 
christensen said he believed the millenium could mark a turning 
point 
the goal is to market odense nationally and internationally 
to support the culture and to create a festive atmosphere he 
said of course we also aim at attracting people and business 
an 11mile tunnelbridge link between funen and the main island 
of zealand is to be opened in 1993 giving odense greater chances 
to bid for conferences 
we hope to become denmarks center with the great belt 
bridge you can get here from copenhagen in an hour and 15 
minutes mayor verner dahlsgaard said in an interview 
denmarks second tv channel opening later this year will be 
based in odense 
the name odense is from odins vi meaning the shrine of odin 
who was chief of the nordic gods and patron of culture and 
language the city prides itself on its museums three of them 
under the roof of a converted 19thcentury cloth factory 
north of odense at ladby archaeologists discovered the remains 
of a 72foot ship which was put into the 1000yearold grave of a 
viking chief along with his 11 horses 
christianity came to odense in the 9th century the medevial 
cathedral built in 1300 contains the tomb of st knud a king who 
was murdered by his subjects for imposing high taxes

for significant progress toward settlement of the longstanding 
dispute over cyprus between greece and turkey

president noted that the new special representative of the united 
nations oscar camilion visited cyrpus shortly after the election 
of george vassilou as president in february and expressed his 
hope that there will be progress in the near future

greece and turkey as a result of the recent meetings between prime 
ministers andreas papandreou and turgut ozal the president

cyprus has been split between turkish and greek cypriots for 14 
years in 1983 the turkish cypriot minority which makes up 17

in the turkishoccupied northern third of the mediterranean island 
nation 
vassilou a leader of the 500000 greek cypriots was sworn in 
as president on feb 28 and promised to seek direct talks with 
turkey the turks have about 30000 troops and 65000 settlers in 
the northern part of cyprus 
altough talks between the two sides had been deadlocked for two 
years reagan said papandreou and ozal have resolved to increase 
their cooperation and to work toward lasting solutions of the 
issues dividing greece and turkey we welcome this development and 
resultant building of confidence and lessening of tensions in the 
area 
these recent developments he said reinforce my belief that 
there is an opportunity at this time to make real progress toward a 
settlement of the dispute 
reagan made his remarks in a letter to house speaker jim wright

a bipartisan group of senators today proposed 
a 48 million package of new aid to nicaraguas contra rebels 
including renewed authority for the cia to deliver previously 
stockpiled weapons 
supporters said the proposal was designed to trigger 
negotiations in congress and with the reagan administration aimed 
at quick passage of an emergency infusion of aid to replace 
supplies lost or expended during the past weeks heavy fighting 
along the nicaraguanhonduran border 
we think its very important right now to send a signal to the 
sandinista government which allegedly crossed the border into 
honduras in an effort to destroy rebel camps and supplies said 
sen david boren dokla one of 11 sponsors of the new aid 
proposal 
sen nancy kassebaum rkan said announcement of the package 
also would strengthen the contras as they enter direct ceasefire 
talks with the managua regime on monday 
the proposal would use 48 million in unspent pentagon money to 
buy food clothing shelter and medical supplies and to transport 
it to troops in the field over the next year about 3 million of 
that amount would go for communications gear 
but in what promised to be a controversial provision the 
package would allow the cia to airdrop ammunition and weapons 
previously stockpiled by the rebels to troops in the field boren 
said the rebels still have 2 million to 5 million worth of 
undelivered supplies about half of them lethal 
and it would give president reagan the right to hold a quick 
guaranteed vote in congress on any request for further military aid 
under certain conditions if the peace talks between the sandinistas 
and contras break down 
as a carrot the bill also would promise longterm economic 
aid for the region once political stability is restored 
sen daniel evans rwash who has opposed contra aid in the 
past said he was supporting the latest proposal because it is 
the best way to ensure that the peace talks have some chance of 
success 
action on further aid for the rebels has been stalled since 
march 3 when the house narrowly rejected a 30 million package of 
purely humanitarian aid aid proponents saw the sandinista 
incursion into honduras as a new opportunity to revive interest in 
aid

a hospital is not treating cancer 
patients older than 70 with radiation because of a shortage of 
nurses 
the head of the radiumhemmet cancer clinic jerzy einhorn 
called the move an extremely painful decision but said the 
hospital lacked resources to treat everyone 
associate professor ulrik ringborg an administrator at the 
stockholm clinic told the aftonbladet newspaper that no one had 
been turned away because of age since the decision was adopted 
march 7 some patients however were offered alternative 
treatments to radium 
the hospitals decision prompted an outcry from prime minister 
ingvar carlsson and government health officials no one in sweden 
should be too old to receive the treatment needed carlsson said 
health minister gertrud sigurdsen called the age limit 
unacceptable and a violation of the public health care law 
long waits are common for nonurgent treatments under the 
socialized medical system but the clinics move appeared to mark a 
new level in the hospital crisis the employee shorage has been 
caused by resignations of experienced nurses who complained of low 
salaries overtime stress and low status 
funds for public medicine are distributed by the governments of 
each county most health care is free and financed with tax money

building the space station which is expected to be ready for 
occupancy early in 1998 the estimate of us costs has risen from 
a projection of 8 billion made in 1984 to more than 30 billion in 
current dollars 
japan also is expected t contribute 2 billion and canada about 
800000 
cooperation between the united states and esa seemed doomed to 
failure late in 1986 when the pentagon announced it wanted to 
retain its options for military research on the station the 
national aeronautics and space administration had to assure its 
european as well as canadian and japanese partners that no major 
weapons systems would be placed aboard although the research 
option remains 
nasa said the agreement marks the end of more than two years 
of negotiations on the technical and programmatic framework between 
the two agencies in the largest cooperative civil space project 
undertaken 
in its decision thursday the esa council authorized director 
general reimer luest to sign a memorandum of understanding with 
nasa administrator james c fletcher in the near future 
the memorandum of understanding is being reviewed by the reagan 
administration then will be submitted to congress for review 
before it is signed by the two parties 
it also has to be approved by each of the esa member 
governments austria belgium denmark france west germany 
ireland italy netherlands norway spain sweden switzerland and 
the united kingdom 
in addition to providing the columbus module to the space 
station complex the esa also will furnish an unmanned freeflying 
polarorbiting platform for earth observation experiments the 
united states is developing a similar platform 
as a third element esa will provide a freeflying spacecraft 
designed to accommodate longduration microgravity applications in 
the fields of fluid physics life and material sciences nasa said 
that spacecraft will be visited periodically by astronauts 
the freeflyer will be launched into an orbit compatible with 
that of the space station by an ariane 5 rocket 
presidernt reagan invited european participation in the space 
station program in 1984 and nasa and esa agreed the following year 
on what elements would be provided by each agency

the senate approved by voice vote friday a 
bill that would boost from 700 million to more than 7 billion the 
pool of insurance available for swift disbursement to victims of a 
major nuclear accident 
moments earlier the chamber narrowly rejected an amendment by 
sen john glenn dohio designed to bolster oversight of the 127 
nuclear facilities run by the department of energy including 
plants involved in the production of nuclear weapons 
glenn proposed the establishment of an independent panel to 
investigate safety problems at the does aging reactors but after 
winning an early test vote 4744 he was defeated on each of four 
successive roll calls in parliamentary maneuvering that saw both 
sides scrambling for lastminute converts 
on his last chance glenn lost 4942 after coming within a 
vote or two in the intervening tallies 
the senates action on the overall bill a 20year extension of 
the priceanderson act sent the measure back to the house which 
approved a slightly different version last july 
since 1957 the law has provided for a nationwide pool of 
insurance funds that would be tapped to compensate victims of an 
accident at a nuclear reactor or related facility 
under current provisions the pool could pay up to 700 million 
if the accident involved a commercial nuclear power plant and up 
to 500 million if it involved a governmentowned facility both 
the house and senate versions of the renewal legislation would 
boost the amount in both cases to more than 7 billion 
glenn agreed that the monetary boost is necessary when measured 
against the lessons resulting from the explosion and fire at the 
chernobyl reactor in the soviet union in 1986 but priceanderson 
insurance is no substitute for steps to prevent a nuclear 
accident he said 
glenn cited a long history of safety and environmental problems 
at the does nuclear plants including the savannah river 
production reactors in south carolina 
it is a terrible irony he said that while the nation seeks 
to deter a nuclear attack by constanting upgrading its own nuclear 
arsenal large numbers of americans are in danger of being 
poisoned by radiation in peacetime 
glenn whose governmental affairs committee has revealed a 
number of environmental and safety hazards at doe plants proposed 
an independent oversight panel with the authority to appeal 
directly to the president for safety improvements if the energy 
department balked at its reports 
the amendment was opposed by armed services committee chairman 
sam nunn dga and energy committee chairman bennett johnston 
dla both said they could support glenns proposal if it is 
attached to a separate defense authorization bill later in the 
year but they argued it did not belong in the priceanderson 
package 
the bill would require nuclear utilities to continue to buy the 
maximum amount of private liability insurance available now 
amounting to about 160 million per plant 
if the private insurance proved insufficient to compensate 
victims of an accident each of the nations commercial plants now 
totaling 110 would be assessed an equal amount to cover the 
additional costs to a maximum of 706 billion under that 
provision each plant could have to pay up to 63 million 
the government meanwhile would selfinsure its own plants up 
to the same 7 billion total if a single accident proved even more 
costly than that it would be up to congress whether to appropriate 
additional taxpayer funds 
the nofault system for both private and government plants 
shortcuts the usual legal requirements for damage claims by 
eliminating the necessity for victims to bring individual lawsuits 
in court the nuclear industry has long agreed to that facet of the 
program in exchange for the cap on total liability

pat robertson said friday he is 
staying in the republican presidential race despite vice president 
george bushs overwhelming delegate lead because there has to be 
a rallying point for conservatives 
otherwise the former television evangelist told a news 
conference conservatives would lose their political leverage to 
influence bush on specific foreign or domestic policies or 
influence his selection of a vice presidential running mate 
if everybody drops out then whatever policies are being 
advocated by george bush will become the policies of the republican 
party robertson said 
but he conceded if the trend continues george bush has a 
pretty close lock on it absent some unforeseen event 
certainly im a realist and i can count robertson said 
referring to bushs accumulation so far of more than 700 of the 
1139 delegates needed to win the gop presidential nomination in 
august the associated press delegate count gives robertson just 17 
delegates 
robertson said he is continuing his campaign to further the 
conservative principles of president reagan 
im a supporter of ronald reagan id like to see the reagan 
policies of 1980 and the republican platform of 1984 carried on to 
1988 he said 
questioned about farm issues robertson said he wants a world 
that is free of subsidies by the year 2000 but that he supports 
some writedown of farm debt for family farmers robertson said 
he would redirect agricultural subsidy funds from agribusiness to 
family farmers

eighteen members of congress flew to michigan 
friday trying to help revive the flagging presidential campaign of 
fellow rep richard gephardt who said im the underdog today 
but that doesnt really matter 
rep john dingell of trenton mich said gephardts support in 
the house was significant because we in congress dont like 
weaklings or phonies 
a new poll published friday showed gephardt well behind 
democratic rivals michael dukakis and jesse jackson in michigan 
but the missouri congressman said i think you will see that the 
gephardt message about economic revival is going to get through to 
the michigan voters 
gephardt soundly beaten on super tuesday and then again this 
week in illinois has pinned much of the future of his campaign on 
the march 26 michigan caucuses which will allocate 138 of the 
states 150 delegates to the democratic national convention next 
july in atlanta 
eighty house members support his nomination gephardt has said 
among the 18 who joined him friday was michigans rep dingell who 
said gephardts support among members of congress reflected their 
greater experience with him than with jackson and massachusetts 
gov dukakis 
he is obviously a known quantity dingell said we also 
know how he responds in a crisis we in congress dont like 
weaklings or phonies 
gephardt dismissed a new survey conducted for the detroit free 
press and wxyztv and published in friday editions of the 
newspaper that showed dukakis and jackson each favored by 32 
percent of michigan democrats or others leaning toward the party 
gephardt was preferred by 10 percent of the 328 voters surveyed 
earlier this week sens albert gore jr of tennessee and paul 
simon of illinois each had 6 percent support and 14 percent was 
undecided the polls margin of error was plus or minus 5 
percentage points the free press said 
the candidate said he had overcome poor showings in surveys 
prior to the iowa democratic caucuses and in other states 
were going to make political history in michigan just as we 
did in iowa he said 
gephardt had also flown house colleagues in to help him in iowa 
that time 42 congressmen flew on a chartered plane that cost 
15500 an expense partially defrayed by lobbyists who flew along 
the plane ride turned into a flying fundraiser drawing pointed 
comments from critics who noted that gephardt was running as the 
antiestablishment candidate 
gephardt spokesman mark johnson said friday there were no 
lobbyists on the plane this trip you all make much more of this 
than we do this is just send them out to a couple events and come 
back 
the congressmen flew into detroit on two planes he said one 
belonging to chrysler and the other a regular charter the 
campaign paid for it first class airfare for everybody he said

illegal immigrants who find amnesty 
application fees too steep will be able to get interestfree loans 
from the catholic diocese of el paso the bishop said friday 
i think its good for our community for these individuals to 
become citizens bishop raymundo pena said they would have 
better opportunities to get goodpaying jobs and that would help 
our economy 
under the program people who apply for immigration amnesty 
through the dioceses migrant and refugee services program are 
eligible for oneyear loans if they live below the federal poverty 
level 
under the immigration reform and control act of 1986 people who 
have lived in the united states illegally since before jan 1 
1982 are eligible for amnesty immigrants who qualify for amnesty 
are granted temporary residency and are eligible later for 
permanent residency and then citizenship 
the deadline for applying is may 4 the government announced 
friday it will give people seeking amnesty 60 additional days to 
submit supporting documents 
the immigration and naturalization service charges a filing fee 
of 185 per person or a maximum of 420 per family plus a 75 
counseling fee and a 10 photo and fingerprint fee 
applicants also must go to a doctor for a medical exam often 
they hire lawyers to help them and the search for documentation 
can become expensive the ins justifies the fees by saying they are 
a way to ensure that applicants wont become public charges 
i think the government has a valid argument that they should 
be selfsufficient pena said at a news conference but illegal 
immigrants get caught in a catch22 situation where they cant get 
a work permit so they cant get a job that pays enough money 
ins spokesman art moreno said the agency approves of the program 
about 27000 people in new mexico and west texas have applied 
for amnesty so far moreno said an estimated 10 percent of those 
qualified for amnesty cant afford the filing fees the rev rick 
matty said 
the diocese needs about 60000 to fund the loan program and 
has raised about 12000 so far from businesses and individuals 
pena said

after two dismal seasons many maple syrup 
producers say the sap is running well this season and hope their 
good luck will last 
weve got it coming out of our ears weve got so much sap we 
dont know when were going to get it all boiled in said nancy 
clark of clarks sugar house in alstead 
clarks sugar house which usually produces about 1000 gallons 
a season only made 620 last year this year the trees have yielded 
about 500 gallons 
a year ago we were at 411 gallons said roger adams of 
stuart and johns sugar house in westmoreland this year were at 
1250 
last year stuart and johns produced only 1400 gallons in a 
good year they produce up to 3000 gallons 
about 60 percent of the states maple syrup is produced in the 
connecticut river valley where producers are pressed to keep up 
with the flow said agriculture commissioner steve taylor 
prices have leveled at about 35 a gallon taylor said adding 
that even with a good season he does not expect prices to drop 
dramatically because demand remains high after the last two years 
annual maple syrup production in the state averages about 77000 
gallons taylor said however the last two crops yielded about 
47000 gallons compared to the bumper crop of 102000 gallons in 
1984 
the poor crops were directly attributable to a cycle of warm 
days and warm nights without cool nights and warm days sap 
doesnt run 
the weather has everything to do with it adams said 
though some producers experienced small sap runs two weeks ago 
this weeks sunny weather following cool evenings had buckets and 
pipelines overflowing 
this last time it started running it doesnt seem itll ever 
stop clark said adams added that his two woodfired evaporators 
are going full tilt 
liz bascom coowner of the states largest syrup producer 
bascoms sugar house in acworth said she was unwilling to predict 
a banner year because a quick thaw could end the season as quickly 
as it began 
shirley sullivan of broken ridge farm said the sap was running 
so heavily that it almost guaranteed she would be working until 
midnight 
i like that she said

the federal government on friday tried to 
bolster its amnesty program by giving illegal aliens who file in 
the final month of the plan 60 more days to provide documents to 
support their applications 
under the change in the program which has attracted a 
lowerthananticipated number of applications amnesty seekers 
will be able to file a skeletal application from april 4 to the may 
4 deadline without producing backup documentation and medical data 
until sometime after july 5 
the reagan administration has said it opposes extending the 
filing deadline despite sentiment in congress to do so 
if any of you have ever filed your income tax on the night of 
the 14th of april theres usually one document or one fact you 
dont get attorney general edwin meese iii told reporters at an 
immigration office in arlington va we want to be sure that 
doesnt stop anybody from this program 
just over 1 million amnesty applications have been filed and 
although a lastminute surge is anticipated the volume of requests 
is likely to fall far below the 2 million estimated as recently as 
january by alan nelson commission of the us immigration and 
naturalization service 
our goal is not two million meese said our goal is for 
every eligible person to apply if an eligible alien doesnt 
apply by may 4 thats the persons fault not ours he added 
legislation with 60 cosponsors would extend the filing deadline 
for another year but meese opposed the idea of extending it 
theres no reason to he said the more confusion and 
hesitancy in the program the more the temptation is out there 
then to postpone and postpone and postpone 
rep charles schumer dny who introduced the extension 
legislation called the change virtually meaningless 
the administrations approach assumes many illegal aliens 
havent filed because they lack documentation but many illegal 
aliens have not stepped forward because they still fear the ins 
schumer said to them the ins is the agency that is supposed to 
throw them out of the country 
meese said that if an extension were granted at the end of that 
time people would say they extended it before theyll probably 
extend it again 
it is our hope that on may 4 every single person who is 
eligible for legalization will have applied the attorney general 
said 
the application can be completed in less than 30 minutes nelson 
said 
since the amnesty program began last may 4 ins personnel have 
gone the extra mile in all respects and it seems sad at the end 
not to deal with it in a little more flexible way said jerry 
tinker staff director of the senate subcommittee on immigration 
and refugee policy 
short of legislation there were a number of administrative 
steps ins could have taken including deferring the payment of fees 
420 for families to encourage people to apply for amnesty 
tinker said there were extensive discussions with ins officials 
over various administrative moves and for them to come forth with 
this mouse was disappointing 
under the 1986 immigration reform and control act illegal 
aliens who have lived in the united states since jan 1 1982 can 
be granted amnesty if they provide documentation supporting their 
claim of having lived here for the past six years 
meese and nelson also announced another change in the program 
that would give private groups more time to locate aliens eligible 
for amnesty 
in the past these private groups assisting the immigration 
service collected fees only after they had completed filling out 
forms for an applicant a process that can take three hours or 
longer 
under the change the groups will be given a referral fee for 
each applicant as soon as they have directed an alien to an ins 
legalization office

hundreds of american 
paratroopers filled the morning sky friday in a spectacular show of 
military muscle 
us ambassador everett briggs said the action filled a honduran 
request for support against what he insisted was an invasion by 
nicaragua 
this readiness exercise is a fine demonstration of our ability 
to respond very quickly when requested and to show support 
everett briggs told reporters at the scene of the parachute drop of 
about 800 men from the 82nd airborne division of fort bragg nc 
briggs said that stories that the united states had pressured 
honduran president jose azcona into requesting the exercise are 
absolutely false 
he said azcona first approached him on tuesday 
they asked for ways in which we could demonstrate our 
support briggs said we discussed ways we might respond and 
settled on this particular method 
even though the white house said the cable from azcona wasnt 
received until late wednesday more than eight hours after troops 
were put on alert for the mission briggs said he was sure the 
letter was written tuesday night 
referring to the 1500 to 2000 sandinista troops who he said 
have crossed into honduras briggs said by central american 
standards i dont think its wrong to call it an invasion he 
said most of those nicaraguan troops were still in honduras 
briggs said the honduran ministry had reported that its aircraft 
had made a couple of runs along the border in response to the 
sandinista invasion he quoted the honduran minister as saying they 
hit a nicaraguan helicopter 
the united states was not suggesting to the hondurans what type 
of military response to make this is their country and its 
their country that has had this fairly large sandinista 
incursion he said theyve been telling us what they plan to 
do and asking our support 
gen fred f woerner commander of the us southern command 
based in panama came here to review the exercise and said it was 
a reassuring factor to our allies not only in honduras but 
elsewhere 
woerner said also there were some very very preliminary 
indications that the sandinistas were starting to withdraw but he 
said the duration of the us exercise was not necessarily 
linked to that 
fridays parachute drop went absolutely super said brig 
gen daniel schroeder commander of the joint task force who said 
the force of 3000 men would be complete later in the day after a 
few more planeloads arrived with troops of the 7th infantry 
division of fort ord calif 
honduran defense minister wilfredo sanchez valladres greeted the 
men shortly after they landed in the brushcovered valley about 
five miles south of the air base 
we thank you for coming to work with us he said the 
morale of the honduran people has been reinforced by this 
the morale of the troops also was buoyed by the chance to 
conduct an exercise away from their home base and near a combat 
scene 
schroeder smiled but deferred when asked whether he thought the 
troops wanted to see action against the sandinistas obviously he 
said the men were aware of the nearby battles and he said the 
adrenaline is pumping 
sgt doug longpre 22 of the 82nd airborne said everybody is 
psyched up about being down here 
hours after the paratroopers arrived another battalion of the 
82nd airborne was flying out of palmerola in helicopters for joint 
exercises with honduran troops in an area nearer but still 100 
miles from the combat zone 
the us commanders continued to say their orders were to stay 
away from actual conflict troops were ready and had ample 
ammunition and weapons including light tanks and artillery to 
respond if called upon they said 
the arrival of the paratroopers was the most dramatic display of 
the american deployment but most of the troops and supplies were 
being delivered by a stream of jet transports that arrived every 
half hour around the clock the aerial convoy included a giant c5 
galaxy which brought attack reconnaissance and troopcarrying 
helicopters 
the paratroopers spilled out of eight air force c141 jets on a 
calm clear morning and the airbone commander said it was completed 
without injury 
schroeder said part of the training value of the exercise was 
the change in climates they had boarded their planes at fort bragg 
in freezing cold and then floated down in the tropical heat

police on friday announced they 
recovered nearly all of the 8 million in us cash that vanished 
from a february air shipment from the united states to argentina 
it was the largest brinks robbery in the history of the 
company which was protecting the cash 
the money was recovered by narcotics agents working for rio de 
janeiros specialized police department 
four suspects all brazilian employees of a private cargo firm 
that operated at rios international airport were arrested 
its obvious they planned it together we are going to 
interrogate them to find out how they pulled it off said nilo 
augusto batista head of the specialized police department 
the suspects and the recovered money were shown to reporters at 
the narcotics squads headquarters a dilapidated 
turnofthecentury building in downtown rio 
the suspects all appearing to be in their late 20s hid their 
faces from reporters and clicking cameras and refused to answer any 
questions 
the money was part of a 52 million shipment from the federal 
reserve board in new york to the central bank of argentina said 
marven moss a spokesman for brinks inc based in darien conn 
the money disappeared feb 5 when 13 canvas sacks containing 52 
million were transferred in rios international airport from a 
flight from new york to one to the argentine capital of buenos 
aires two of the sacks never made it to argentina 
batista said the cargo company which hired the four suspects 
took the money out of the first plane put it on a cart and took 
it in for inspection by government officials afterward the money 
was placed inside vans and taken to the second plane for the trip 
to argentina somewhere along the line 8 million vanished 
he said the first break in the case came when the narcotics 
squad of his department came across certain information about the 
theft apparently from tipsters with connections to rios drug 
trafficking world 
even though this case was technically not in the drug area 
our people followed the tip and the result was nearly total 
success batista said he added that the dollars were traced to 
the states of sao paulo espirito santo minas gerais and rio de 
janeiro where the thieves tried to exchange them apparently for 
other american dollars or for foreign currency 
narcotics division detective antonio carlos estevam who 
coordinated the threeman team that arrested the four suspects and 
found the money said it was a combination of solid police work 
and luck we have no crystal ball 
usually when there is a large theft of money most of it 
gravitates to the drug world this is the theory we operated on 
after the airport incident i would say we have achieved what no 
police force anywhere else has ever achieved we captured all the 
suspects recovered practically all the money and no one was 
hurt estevam said 
estevam said the operation started thursday when two of the 
suspects were arrested in a car in the ilha do governador district 
located near the airport later that day two more suspects were 
arrested and the money was recovered 
batista said the four suspects were brazilians and that there 
were no signs of involvement by foreigners he added that none of 
the money wound up in the hands of drug dealers 
the recovered money belongs to brinks since its insurance 
repaid the federal reserve board for the theft moss said

state treasurer ann richards has been 
loudly urging texans to claim longforgotten money left in state 
coffers but joseph phillips is finding it hard to heed her call 
how long does it take phillips 48 asked thursday more 
than seven months after first filing to reclaim 900 from the state 
the money belongs to phillips and his sister patricia crawford 
and was part of a trust left by their father who died in 1985 the 
money was left erroneously to languish in a bank account and found 
its way into the treasury under a law stipulating that accounts 
inactive for at least three years be turned over to the state 
the treasurers office says there is no question that phillips 
should get the money it is part of about 60 million owned by 
75000 residents and companies but held by the state 
you can be assured that if you have money coming to you you 
will get it ms richards said at a press conference earlier this 
month to publicize efforts to return the money 
but phillips was not assured i thought if they are that slow 
in responding to me how in the world are they going to handle more 
claims 
phillips first filed his claim with the treasury last aug 7 
after a trust official told him about the money in january he 
filled out another form later he discovered his sister also would 
have to complete a form which took him several weeks just to 
obtain 
three weeks later after reading about ms richards news 
conference phillips wrote the dallas morning news 
a spokesman for ms richards conceded to the news that the claim 
had taken too long he said the claim was complicated and that a 
series of miscues including a change of address by the unclaimed 
property division caused delays 
we are expediting a check he told the news phillips will 
get his check within four weeks after its cleared by the 
attorney generals office he assured

angry dockworkers moved massive 
blockades across the entrance to their port near the panama canal 
on friday to fight off an army takeover by troops loyal to gen 
manuel antonio noriega 
noriega fired his intelligence chief and four other officers in 
an apparent purge of his fractured defense forces which came two 
days after a failed coup attempt against the military strongman 
four american military police officers were arrested in the 
capital by panamanian authorities and held for several hours the 
pentagon said 
the panamanian newspaper critica said the americans were 
carrying handguns maps of the capital and military implements 
when they were detained in an area where daily activities 
disturbing the public order had occurred 
panamanians without cash for weeks lined up at public parks 
and pay stations to receive partial payment and bags of food being 
doled out by the government 
noriega gave no reason for fridays ousters 
col bernardo barrera had been in charge of intelligence for the 
15000member defense forces which includes panamas army navy 
police and air force 
a source close to the defense forces said barrera might have 
been faulted for not knowing in advance of wednesdays coup 
attempt which was said to have involved a few junior officers lead 
by the nations police chief col leonidas macias 
the other ousted officers were identified by the military press 
office as majs juan oberto pablo pinto and jose williams and 
capt orlando iguez their units and positions were not disclosed 
at the balboa port about a mile outside the panama canal about 
300 striking dockworkers moved carsized containers across the port 
entrance to fight off an army takeover ordered thursday by the 
government 
the port is shut down said one dockworker we wont 
accept anything less than what they owe us he said asking not 
to be identified for fear of reprisal well wait here for them 
the army 
four shipping containers were stacked across the port entrance 
they formed a barricade nearly 20 feet high and no vehicles or 
machinery were passing in or out 
ports at panama city and colon used primarily to receive and 
ship cargo closed monday when dockworkers angry about not being 
paid went on strike the panama canal commission said the shutdowns 
had no effect on its operations 
in addition to the ports the military was ordered to take over 
the nations electrical water and telephone companies airports 
and the ministries of education health and finance all of which 
had been struck by workers demanding salaries 
the four american military police arrested thursday night in 
panama city were identified by the critica newspaper as danny h 
feltro william jerry virts richard and tammy markley 
the newspaper did not provide their ranks or other information 
and the pentagon said friday it could not immediately confirm the 
identities printed by the paper 
a us southern command statement in panama city said the four 
were members of a military police detachment checking on the 
security of dependent families living in the area in which they 
were detained 
the us militry dependents like everyone else in panama have 
been without lights and water for extended periods because of the 
recent strikes 
long lines of public employees including teachers and 
electrical workers gathered at special pay stations around the 
capital to receive partial payment of their semimonthly salaries 
each employee was receiving only 75 sometimes with 35 paid in 
old commemorative panamanian coins kown as balboas 
the government also began handing out free bags of food 
containing beans rice processed cheese and other staples of the 
panamanian diet it had been selling the bags for between 14 and 
15 
more than 1200 people lined up for the bags at a park near the 
center of the city to receive food 
the government short of cash for months because of its 
inability to renegotiate a huge foreign debt began running out of 
money three weeks ago when depositors began a run on the countrys 
banks 
the bank run began on feb 26 the day after noriega deposed the 
nations president eric arturo delvalle in a thinly disguised 
coup devalle had tried to fire noriega the day before in a move 
that backfired 
the action by delvalle who still is recognized by the united 
states came after noriega was indicted by two grand juries in 
florida on charges of narcotics trafficking

a highranking east german transport 
official defected to west germany and led authorities friday to 
arrest a suspected communist spy officials and news reports said 
the masscirculation newspaper bild said the woman was arrested 
following the interrogation of the defector and was suspected of 
having spied for east germany 
west german officials identified her as a secretary in the 
federal ministry for economic cooperation 
earlier friday security sources said ulrich fuchs one of the 
four deputy directors of east germanys staterun deutrans 
transport company had defected to west germany 
the sources who requested anonymity said west german 
intelligence officials hoped to learn more about how east germany 
uses its longhaul trucks to spy on the west 
bild said the woman had access to secret documents provided to 
the ministry by west germanys intelligence service the documents 
dealt mainly with the situation in third world countries such as 
nicaragua and angola the newspaper said 
the national television network ard said the documents did not 
contain military information 
alwin brueck a former state secretary in the ministry in whose 
office the woman worked for some time identified the suspect as 
elke falk according to ard 
bild said the woman returned several days ago from a vacation in 
austria where she may have met with communist colleagues 
hansjuergen foerster spokesman for the federal prosecutors 
office confirmed the womans arrest but declined to link the two 
cases 
he said the woman whom he refused to identify was in 
investigative custody she is suspected of having supplied 
information to a communist secret service since 1975 when she met 
an agent known to authorities under the false name of gerhard 
thieme foerster said he declined to identify the communist agency 
bild said thieme was an east german agent who recruited the 
woman after seducing her she is in her 40s and worked in the 
ministrys european section since 1987 following other positions 
in the ministry the newspaper said 
west germanys counterespionage agency had placed the woman 
under surveillance one year ago bild said 
several government secretaries have been unmasked as communist 
spies in recent years 
margret hoeke a longtime secretary in the west german 
presidents office was convicted of spying for the soviet kgb and 
sentenced to eight years in prison last august during her trial 
ms hoeke described how she began spying after falling in love with 
an east bloc agent 
sonja luenburg chief secretary to economic minister martin 
bangemann vanished in august 1985 and is believed to have fled to 
east germany 
west german sources said fuchs was undergoing interrogation by 
counterespionage officials at an undisclosed location in west 
germany 
they said fuchs had also unofficially worked for the east german 
secret service but apparently was no big fish 
the sources added that further questioning of fuchs could give 
more insights into his activities for the communist secret service 
but bild quoted unidentified security experts as saying fuchs 
was one of the most important defectors in 10 years 
the newspaper said friday fuchs defected in early march during a 
business trip to the west 
bild said fuchs knew everything about the secret spying trucks 
of east germany and the soviet union he knows secret meeting 
points for agents and courier methods used by communist spies 
quoting an unidentified counterespionage expert bild said the 
west germans hoped to learn about the electronic equpiment built 
into soviet bloc trucks the routes they take while traveling 
through the west and about safe houses used by communist agents 
west german security officials long have suspected east german 
truckers of using their drives through west germany to report on 
military movements and gather other information for the east german 
secret service 
bild said about 3000 deutrans trucks pass through west germany 
every month the trucks are usually equipped with sensitive cameras 
and electronic listening devices bild said

a white house comission on friday said the 
government should turn over to private businesses the operation of 
prisons air traffic control facilities mail delivery and scores 
of other services 
agencies now providing those services have become musclebound 
to the point of paralysis the panels chairman david f 
linowes told reporters after presenting president reagan with what 
he called the first independent exhaustive analysis of the 
privatization issue 
linowes however acknowledged that the bulk of the 78 
recommendations in the 278page report by the presidents 
commission on privatization are unlikely to be enacted before 
reagans term ends next janaury 
we didnt take on this job with the expectation that it would 
stay with just one administration he said for the most part 
we opt for an incremental approach we know americans dont take 
kindly to sudden change they like them to evolve 
the recommendations include repealing laws that created the us 
postal services monopoly putting the federal aviation 
administrations flight service facilities and control towers out 
for private bids and selling the naval petroleum reserves in 
california and wyoming 
the panel also called for the use of vouchers or direct 
subsidies to individuals for housing education and elderly care 
rather than pouring any more money into public housing projects or 
federal aid for public schools 
and the commission would sell to private banks and other 
financial institutions the governments 250 billion portfolio of 
housing business agriculture and education loans 
government should not be in the business of business 
linowes said the welldeveloped banking industry can take over 
those loans freeing up billions of dollars for the federal 
treasury 
many of the recommendations such as selling the petroleum 
reserves and government loans have been proposed in the past by 
reagan and rejected soundly in congress each time 
and critics were quick friday to predict that initiatives based 
on the white house commissions report also would fail 
luckily it wont fool anybody except those who want to 
believe it said robert m tobias president of the 59000member 
national treasury employees union it should die with the rest of 
the administrations foolish ideas at the end of 1988 
however linowes a democrat said he believes lawmakers 
gradually will warm to the recommendations as the work of an 
independent bipartisan commission 
the facts will argue for themselves he said for example 
vouchers will provide the same amount of lowincome housing for 
onethird the cost of public housing 
linowes said all of the commissions recommendations include two 
caveats 
first government must never abdicate its responsibilities for 
setting policy and standards and second the rights of current 
employees cannot be abrograted as a result of these changes 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater reflecting the scant 
attention that the administration gave to privatization in its 
proposed 1989 budget except for pilot studies involving military 
commissaries and federal prisons called the report forwardlooking 
the work is close to the presidents philosphy of 
government fitzwater said reagan campaigned on a platform 
of limited government we are continuing those efforts 
reagan appointed the 13member commission last september and 
linowes estimated the cost of its study at 450000 
he said the panel found that most agencies often because 
workers lack incentives for coming up with new ideas are trying 
to deal with todays problems using yesterdays solutions 
for example he said visits to air traffic control towers 
revealed the use of outdated computers 
the checks and balances of government do not lend themselves 
to managing high technology linowes said government should 
reach out by opening its operations to the creative talents and 
drive of entrepreneurs

conservatives launched a campaign friday to 
persuade president reagan to pardon lt col oliver l north with 
one saying juries dont convict heroes who stand 10 feet tall 
indicting a true american hero at a tremendous cost is 
completely unacceptable and should be rejected immediately l 
francis bouchey president of the council for interamerican 
security said in a statement issued at a news conference 
in a related development pentagon sources said friday that 
north has asked to retire from the marine corps north submitted 
his request thursday asking that he be allowed to retire effective 
may 1 when he will have completed 20 years of active military 
service the sources said 
the conservatives said they have formed an ollie north task 
force to lobby for a pardon for north and john m poindexter 
former head of the national security council 
sen steven symms ridaho sent a letter to reagan asking him 
to pardon north symms office said 
the two former white house aides along with arms dealers 
richard v secord and albert hakim have been charged with 
conspiring to defraud the government in the irancontra episode 
the case involved diverting money from the sale of weapons to iran 
to the nicaraguan rebels 
bill kling of the foreign policy project said he thought the 
public supported north juries dont convict heroes who stand 10 
feet tall he said 
north and poindexter are a package deal on pardons 
according to andrew messing head of the national defense council 
foundation 
but he and others refused to commit themselves to seeking 
pardons for secord and hakim 
messing said secord and hakim were in a different category 
because they were businessmen who stood to gain personally from the 
irancontra affair he said 
marlin fitzwater reagans spokesman said there have been no 
discussions at the white house about possible pardons

burned buses taxis and other vehicles that defied their nationwide 
ban on transport and they threatened more sabotage to disrupt 
weekend elections 
the farabundo marti national liberation front an alliance of 
five guerrilla groups claimed its fighters attacked three soldiers 
guarding a gas station outside this capital 
the armed forces press office said it could not confirm or deny 
the report made on the guerrilla radio station the radio said 
three soldiers were killed or wounded but it didnt give details 
the guerrilla radio venceremos said our demolition squads will 
carry out new actions in repudiation of the elections it also 
said urban commando cells are carrying out actions to ensure the 
transport bans success 
salvadorans on sunday elect all 60 members of the legislative 
national assembly and mayors and municipal councils nationwide the 
guerrillas who have been fighting the usbacked government since 
1979 call the elections a farce they say free and fair balloting 
is impossible in wartime 
they decreed an indefinite nationwide transport ban beginning 
friday to protest and disrupt the elections 
a poll published friday by san salvadors central american 
university indicated more than 80 percent of prospective voters 
intend to cast ballots despite the guerrilla call for a boycott 
but the same poll indicated about half the electorate either 
rejects all the candidates or remains undecided 
the poll of 914 people in 11 of the countrys 14 provinces gave 
the rightist national republican alliance or arena an edge over 
the governing christian democrats in the assembly vote 
the centrist christian democrats have 33 deputies but are 
expected to lose that majority no leftist party is participating 
in the elections 
the privately owned radio station ysu with correspondents in 
almost all 14 provinces said guerrillas burned eight vehicles in 
the eastern province of usulutan the radio citing police and 
armed forces officials said the vehicles destroyed were two buses 
two tractortrailers two pickups one jeep and one taxi no 
injuries were reported in the destruction of the vehicles 
there were no other reports of violence from other provinces 
intercity bus transport was reduced by about 80 percent 
nationwide according to dispatchers the capitals two main bus 
terminals were virtually deserted friday morning 
one person died and 18 were injured when an overcrowded pickup 
overturned in the capital 
scores of pickups with people packed in the beds and standing on 
the bumpers circulated in san salvador partially taking the place 
of privately owned buses none of which was seen on the road 
the pickup owners were charging 60 cents six times the normal 
bus fare 
the government put several dozen blue and white stateowned 
buses on the street and they too were overcrowded with people 
riding on the roof luggage rack hanging from the doors and 
standing on the bumpers army trucks also were used for passenger 
transport 
many people simply walked to work 
of 10 people randomly consulted on the city sidewalks not one 
supported the transport ban 
it hurts everybody said computer programmer jose ortiz he 
said he thought election turnout would be high because lots of 
people feel they made a mistake last time they voted and now they 
want a change 
he cited what he said were the christian democrats unkept 
promises 
the transport ban is a problem for all of us it makes a 
tough situation even tougher said ricardo quintanilla a 
laboratory worker consulted during his threemile walk to work 
about the elections he said they dont offer much hope for 
solutions to the countrys problems but voting is a habit so lots 
of people will vote

the following dispatch was filed by frederick 
kempe of the wall street journal a member of a pentagon press pool 
covering the arrival of us troops in honduras 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the commanderinchief of 
the us southern command said he was skeptical that usbacked 
efforts to oust panamanian strongman gen manuel antonio noriega 
would bring any quick results 
putting a time line on gen noriega is probably one of the 
greatest hazards of our profession said gen fred woerner who 
was on an inspection mission to observe the arrival of about 800 
paratroops from the us armys 82nd airborne division 
he said this weeks failed coup attempt showed that the 
solidarity of the panamanian defense forces has been ruptured 
woerner ruled out the possibility of using us troops to help 
bring down noriega something he said was a matter for the 
panamanian people 
he wouldnt comment on whether the united states military would 
respond if panamanian president eric arturo delvalle requested its 
assistance in the future 
delvalle has been in hiding since his aborted attempt to fire 
noriega as military leader last month noriega responded by forcing 
the ouster of delvalle but the united states still regards him as 
panamas constitutional leader noriega has been indicted by two 
federal grand juries in florida on drugtrafficking charges 
woerner provided a gloomy description of panamas internal 
situation in his brief remarks during the second day of maneuvers 
here 
the city is locked up the economy has come to a standstill 
the people are afraid intimidated the normal political processes 
are nonfunctioning people are desperately struggling for their 
basic freedoms he said

democratic presidential candidate 
michael dukakis criticized the reagan administrations sending of 
troops to honduras as he split his campaign day friday between 
michigan and kansas 
he spoke with junior high school students in michigan then flew 
to kansas where democrats hold party caucuses on saturday he was 
returning friday night to michigan for appearances at union halls 
with sen edward kennedy michigans democratic primary is one week 
from saturday 
the whole policy in central america is illegal dukakis said 
at a news conference after addressing a student assembly at mason 
junior high school in drayton plains just outside pontiac 
call back the troops and end this he said 
the massachusetts governor said the assignment of troops to 
central america runs against agreements signed by members of the 
organization of american states he said if he were president he 
would end aid to the contra rebels and back a central american 
peace plan drafted by costa rican president oscar arias and signed 
by five central american nations 
as long as you have an administration thats obsessed with the 
overthrow of that government in nicaragua the peace process 
cannot begin dukakis said 
on tuesday dukakis had failed to win any delegates in the 
illinois primary but despite gains in illinois by favorite sons 
paul simon and jesse jackson dukakis dismissed what some have 
suggested is a growing possibility of a brokered convention one in 
which no candidate enters with a clear majority 
ive always felt from the beginning that somebody would emerge 
from the primary process with a good plurality particularly if 
the field begins to thin down a little bit he said 
on other matters dukakis 
urged a reduction in military spending through scaling back the 
presidents star wars spacebased missile defense program if 
youre going to spend 6 billion on star wars you cant spend 6 
billion on housing he said 
spoke broadly about a change in us policy in the middle east 
saying the united states must show leadership in the region my 
secretary of state would have been pushing ahead as a followup on 
the camp david accords he said

a judge declared a mistrial friday in the case 
of tran van khiem brother of vietnams dragon lady madame ngo 
dinh nhu who is accused of slaying their parents two years ago 
judge fred ugast of district of columbia superior court ruled 
khiem incompetent to testify about the strangulation deaths of his 
elderly parents who had lived in washington since resigning from 
their diplomatic posts with the old south vietnamese government in 
1963 
ugast issued his ruling with great reluctance after a 
courtappointed psychologist examined the defendant thursday and 
found him profoundly delusional 
ugast ordered khiem returned to st elizabeths hospital a city 
mental institution for 90 days he said the court would then 
reconsider whether khiem could testify 
khiem 62 is charged with two counts of firstdegree murder in 
the july 1986 deaths of his father tran van chuong 88 former 
south vietnamese ambassador to the united states and his mother 
nam tran chuong 82 former observer to the united nations 
the defendant has stated that his parents were killed because of 
his fathers alleged part in the assassination of president kedy 
and south vietnamese leader ngo dinh diem 
neither prosecutors nor defense attorneys have turned up any 
evidence to support khiems assertions and his attorneys argued 
that his grandiose claims and the finding of the court psychiatrist 
were reason enough to declare him unfit for trial 
ugast had ruled in november that the defendant should stand 
trial but be evaluated throughout the legal proceedings to make 
certain he could assist his attorneys in preparing his defense 
madame nhu was first lady of vietnam for her bachelor 
brotherinlaw diem and has lived in exile near rome since the 
usbacked coup that resulted in the killing of diem and her 
husband ngo dinh nhu in 1963

gov evan mecham facing senators hostile 
questions at his impeachment trial said friday he believes the 
states top lawman is guilty of leading a mutiny against him 
mecham said he wishes he had fired department of public safety 
director ralph milstead who has accused mecham of obstructing 
justice 
i wish i had done that because we wouldnt be sitting in this 
body today he said i have highly repented that 
do you feel director milstead is guilty of mutinous service 
yes or no asked sen tony west a republican like mecham 
yes i do sir said mecham who had previously hedged on 
answering the question 
west noted that in the military mutiny is punishable by death 
i wouldnt propose we take director milstead out and shoot 
him said the governor i would protect him against that 
but mecham angrily blamed milstead and others for his current 
predicament 
pressed on why he didnt fire milstead he said i had a war 
going on with the attorney general and i didnt need any others 
milstead had been been appointed by mechams democratic 
predecessor bruce babbitt and under state law could be removed by 
mecham only for good cause 
milstead who is out of the country previously testified during 
the trial that mecham told him not to cooperate with attorney 
general bob corbins investigation of an alleged death threat 
against former mecham aide donna carlson she was a grand jury 
witness in an investigation of mechams campaign finances 
mecham acknowledged some details of his muchquoted conversation 
with milstead but said he still thinks the death threat allegation 
was a bunch of hot air he also said we have really worked 
to make a mountain out of molehill 
the obstruction of justice claim is the first of three broad 
charges against mecham being considered by the arizona senate he 
also is charged with concealing a 350000 campaign loan and with 
misusing 80000 from a governors protocol fund by lending it to 
his auto dealership 
it would take a twothirds vote of the 30member senate to 
convict mecham and remove him from office the senate could then 
take another vote and forbid him from ever holding state office 
again 
mecham also faces a criminal trial april 21 on the charge that 
he concealed the 350000 loan and a recall election may 17 
the 63yearold firstterm governor who had a jaunty demeanor 
in his first two days on the stand appeared weary and defensive as 
his third day of questioning ground on 
you have missed the total point he snapped at one senator 
when another senator accused mecham of keeping an enemies list 
the governor shot back i dont need a list 
mecham lashed out at those who had testified against him he 
accused milstead of misusing state vehicles and office help and of 
living out of wedlock with a woman which is against the law in 
arizona 
he accused dps lt beau johnson of stealing an important report 
from his desk and indirectly leaking it to the news media and he 
accused ms carlson of taking things from his desk johnson 
formerly headed mechams dps security detail while ms carlson was 
his legislative liaison 
he said he was not paranoid but realistic in believing that 
corbin also a republican was trying to mortally wound him 
politically he also accused newspapers and others who hold high 
positions of working against him 
corbin contacted later said he had no comment 
when questioned about the alleged death threat on ms carlson 
the governor continued to plead ignorance of the details i knew 
nothing of a death threat i knew nothing of a serious nature he 
said 
democratic sen carolyn walker pressed mecham on his state of 
mind on nov 15 when he told milstead he should not cooperate with 
the attorney generals probe 
is it fair to say you put your political career ahead of the 
good of the people of arizona the senator asked 
certainly not said mecham

effective implementation of the us 
immigration and naturalization services amnesty program for 
illegal aliens depends on a vigorous public outreach and public 
education campaign according to an american bar association 
report released friday 
the report issued by the abas national executive forum on the 
immigration reform and control act of 1986 said it is imperative 
to find ways to reach eligible aliens inform them and encourage 
them to participate before the program ends 
the legalization program was developed to provide amnesty to an 
estimated 2 million undocumented workers it is open to those 
aliens who lived illegally in the united states before jan1 1982 
and to agricultural workers who can show they lived in this country 
for at least 90 days in the year ended may 1 1986 
the aba report the result of a twoday conference funded by the 
gannett foundation also recommended that the ins allow applicants 
to file a short form legalization application and adjust its 
interpretation of regulations to make the program available to the 
maximum number of aliens 
for those 13 million aliens who have already applied the 
report stressed the need for letting them know what to do to obtain 
permanent status 
the statute requires that after an 18month period the 
applicant must demonstrate a minimal understanding of ordinary 
english and a knowledge of us history and government or make 
satisfactory progress in courses of study to that end failure to 
do so would result in loss of permanent status

the irancontra affair shouldnt pose a 
problem for george bushs candidacy because voters are not 
interested in the issue former sen john tower said friday 
i fully expect the opposition to use it on him but i dont 
think its going to have a major impact i think the electorate 
will tend to focus on the problems of the moment said tower who 
served as chairman of president reagans special panel that 
investigated the irancontra affair 
the issue has already been used in the campaign by bushs 
opponents for the gop nomination tower said but it has fallen a 
little bit flat 
admittedly thats among republicans who are probably a little 
tired of it anyway because of the embarrassment to the republican 
administration tower added they dont like to hear it brought

the panamanian government declared a 
national state of urgency friday that gives it the power to 
suspend individual freedoms 
a decree said the action was taken because of a real situaion 
of undeclared war against the republic of panama by the united 
states and the domestic political opposition 
the decree did not specify what measures would be taken and said 
only that the executive branch will adopt the measures adequate 
for the preservation of public order to repell the domestic and 
foreign attacks on the national economy and to face the state of 
urgency throughout the country 
it said that for the past several weeks panama has been the 
object of an attack on its economy by the united states of america 
in coordination with national political sectors desperate to take 
over the government by force 
the situation it said affects the structure of national 
life 
the decree was based on article 51 of the panamanian 
constitution which gives the government the power to suspend 
temporarily partially or totally individual rights and 
liberties in cases of war or internal disturbances affecting 
peace and public order

the panamanian government declared a 
national state of urgency today that gives it the power to 
suspend individual freedoms 
a decree said the action was taken because of a real situaion 
of undeclared war against the republic of panama by the united 
states and the domestic political opposition the decree did not 
specify what measures would be taken 
the nations military strongman gen manuel antonio noriega 
also dismissed a colonel in charge of military intelligence and 
four other officers in an apparent purge following a coup attempt 
meanwhile unpaid dockworkers at the balboa port at the mouth of 
the panama canal in panama city defied an army takeover of the 
facility blocking its entrance with large shipping containers 
four american military police officers were arrested thursday 
while they were on duty and released after about eight hours the 
pentagon said today 
the governmentowned newspaper critica said the soldiers were 
arrested near the university of panama and were carrying handguns 
maps of the city and other military implements 
the paper identified them as danny h feltro william jerry 
virts richard and tammy markley but did not provide hometowns the 
pentagon said it could not immediately confirm the identities 
among those forcibly retired by the panama defense forces was 
col bernardo barrera who had been in charge of intelligence for 
the 15000member military organization which combines panamas 
army navy police and air force noriega derives his power from 
the defense forces which he heads 
the others were identified by the military press office as maj 
juan oberto maj pablo pinto and maj jose williams and capt 
orlando iguez their units and positions were not disclosed 
no reason was given for their dismissal but the action came 
only two days after troops loyal to noriega foiled an attempted 
coup by what was said to be between eight and nine junior officers 
led by the nations police chief col leonidas macias 
macias and four other officers were arrested during an attempted 
takeover of the defense forces headquarters in panama city early 
wednesday they are being held but no charges have been announced 
at the balboa port about 300 dockworkers said they were 
awaiting the arrival of soldiers who were ordered to take over the 
facility thursday by the nations civilian head of state manuel 
solis palma 
by decree he also ordered the military to take over the 
nations stateowned electric water and telephone companies 
airports and the ministries of education health and finance all 
of which had been struck by workers demanding their salaries 
the port is shut down said one dockworker at the union hall 
at the entrance of the facility about a mile from the miraflores 
locks of the panama canal the first set of three locks for ships 
entering the canal from the pacific 
meanwhile opposition leaders expressed dismay that widespread 
protests have been unable to remove noriega and many now openly 
say only a us military intervention can do so 
it is something we as panamanians do not want to see but 
the legal conditions for military intervention exist said a 
leader of an opposition party like others interviewed he spoke on 
condition he not be identified 
the civic crusade a broad antigovernment coalition had 
planned demonstrations thursday but the sight of hundreds of 
soldiers carrying automatic rifles and tear gas canisters through 
the streets of the capital apparently discouraged them 
the transpanama pipeline carrying alaska oil across the isthmus 
en route to gulf coast markets resumed operations today a 
spokesman for the pipeline said it had stopped because of 
electrical outages wednesday and thursday 
service was restored at 6 am est this morning he said 
we actually never stopped loading and unloading at both ends we 
stopped the actual pumping from one end to the other because for 
that we depend on public energy but we have our own plant at each 
end for loading and unloading 
workers were on strike because the cashstarved government 
under economic pressure by the united states was unable to pay 
them 
some shops opened in downtown panama city thursday but banks 
which shut their doors march 4 remained closed 
talk of possible us intervention stems from politicians 
frustration in a country used to strong military governments that 
give opposition parties little room to maneuver 
i guess right now a large majority of panamanians would 
welcome a us military intervention said the leader of another 
large opposition party but three months later everybody would be 
saying yankee go home 
we are just desperate for a change in the situation he 
added 
on feb 25 a day after noriega was indicted by federal grand 
juries in florida on drug trafficking and money laundering charges 
president eric arturo delvalle tried to fire the general 
the next day noriega had the national legislative assembly 
which he controls vote delvalle out of office the united states 
continues to recognize delvalle who is in hiding as panamas 
legitimate president

the air force adopted a policy friday that 
decisions by military wives to work outside the home are none of 
the services business 
if the spouse of a serviceman chooses to work instead of 
volunteering to help with local air force base activites and 
charities that decision is a private matter and cannot be used 
in judging the servicemans qualifications for promotion the new 
policy states 
the policy change was recommended by a special task force that 
was created last september shortly before an internal 
investigation concluded two wives of senior officers at grissom 
afb ind had been pressured to quit their outside jobs with 
warnings the careers of their husbands would suffer if they didnt 
that investigation also found that while pressure had been 
brought to bear on the wives the commanding officers were not 
guilty of any misconduct because the air force didnt have a 
written policy on the matter at the time 
in its new policy statement friday the air force said no 
commander supervisor or other air force official will directly or 
indirectly impede or otherwise interfere with this decision by the 
spouse 
neither the decision of the spouse in this matter nor the 
marital status of the military member will be a factor used to 
affect the evaluation promotion or assignment of the military 
member 
the policy statement was signed by air force secretary edward c 
aldridge and gen larry d welch the services chief of staff who 
had created the sevenmember task force of air force military and 
civilian officials 
that panel in a 21page report released friday described 
promulgation of the new policy as essential but also warned of 
widespread skepticism that it would have any effect 
the common belief within the air force was that the 
twoforone policy is currently operative and that spouse 
participation would continue to be a major factor in promotion and 
selection for command 
the twoforone policy is shorthand for the expectation that 
the wife of a serviceman will forgo career aspirations of her own 
in order to support her husbands career 
the task force said the days of unmarried servicemen were long 
gone 64 percent of the air forces members have family 
responsibilities and that societal changes were having a 
substantial impact 
subtle changes in the nations family structure have created a 
dichotomy for the air force spouse accommodate the needs and 
aspirations of the individual family while meeting the needs of 
the broader family the air force community 
senior commanders schooled in the old ways might not like it 
the panel continued but military spouses increasingly resent the 
institutionalized pressure on them to support military careers 
through volunteer work 
and the panel continued they particularly resent a dual 
standard that has now become starkly clear it is all right for 
the husband of a military woman to work in the civilian community 
but if the wife of a military man works she is often perceived as 
shirking her responsibilities to the air force family 
this conflict between the old and the new results in 
significant consequences it reduces participation erodes morale 
impacts retention and limits creative leadership 
besides recommending a new enforceable policy statement the 
panel urged welch and aldridge to establish a professional 
volunteer management program to recruit and recognize military 
spouses who wish to perform volunteer work while using air force 
family support centers to help those spouses who preferred to seek 
jobs

a bipartisan group of senators proposed a 48 
million package of new aid to nicaraguas contra rebels friday 
including renewed authority for the cia to deliver previously 
stockpiled weapons 
as us troops continued to arrive in honduras in a show of 
force assistant secretary of state elliott abrams said additional 
assistance was being discussed with honduran president jose azcona 
in response to a reported nicaraguan incursion 
white house chief of staff howard baker said president reagan 
would give most careful consideration to any request from 
honduras for troops to help repel nicaraguan forces although he 
reiterated that us troops were not expected to be involved in any 
military operation in the region 
one of the senates leading peace advocates sen mark o 
hatfield said the sending of us troops amounted merely to 
matching stupidity with stupidity and introduced legislation 
barring the troops from a combat role without permission from 
congress 
sponsors of the new contra aid proposal said they hoped it would 
revive negotiations in congress and with the reagan administration 
on an aid package that could be quickly enacted to replace supplies 
lost or expended during the past weeks heavy fighting along the 
nicaraguanhonduran border 
but the extent of the damage inflicted on the rebels by the 
sandinista incursion remained unclear sen david boren dokla 
chairman of the senate intelligence committee said the nicaraguan 
troops were withdrawing without accomplishing all their objectives 
we think its very important right now to send a signal to the 
sandinista government which allegedly crossed the border into 
honduras in an effort to destroy rebel camps and supplies boren 
said 
sen nancy kassebaum rkan said announcement of the package 
also would strengthen the contras as they enter direct ceasefire 
talks with the managua regime scheduled for monday this is a 
commonsense moderate and reasoned approach she said 
the proposal would use 48 million in unspent pentagon money to 
buy food clothing shelter and medical supplies and to transport 
it to troops in the field over the next year about 3 million of 
that amount would go for communications gear 
but in what promised to be a controversial provision the 
package would allow the cia to airdrop ammunition and weapons 
previously stockpiled by the rebels to troops in the field boren 
said the rebels still have 2 million to 5 million worth of 
undelivered supplies about half of them lethal 
and it would give president reagan the right to hold a quick 
guaranteed vote in congress on any request for further military aid 
under certain conditions if the peace talks between the sandinistas 
and contras break down 
as a carrot the bill also would promise longterm economic 
aid for the region once political stability is restored 
sen daniel evans rwash who has opposed contra aid in the 
past said he was supporting the latest proposal because it is 
the best way to ensure that the peace talks have some chance of 
success 
action on further aid for the rebels has been stalled since 
march 3 when the house narrowly rejected a 30 million package of 
purely humanitarian aid aid proponents saw the sandinista 
incursion into honduras as a new opportunity to revive interest in 
aid 
meanwhile abrams told reporters that american officials have 
been discussing with honduran president azcona the possibility of 
providing additional assistance to that country in addition to the 
3200 troops already airlifted to palmerola air base near 
tegucigalpa 
there are some other possibilities that weve discussed 
abrams said adding that the possibilities did not include 
additional troops we do not have a formal request from president 
azcona as of this morning for any other form of assistance 
obviously if we get one well take it very seriously 
baker said that if a request were received from honduras for 
troops to help repel nicaraguan forces it would be most 
carefully considered and most deliberately considered but i cannot 
tell you what decision the president would make under those 
circumstances 
baker interviewed on the syndicated television program john 
mclaughlins one on one was asked at what point us troops 
would enter action 
i dont anticipate that will occur at all i think that the 
honduran forces can handle that on their own and i fully 
anticipate that either the nicaraguans will retire on their own or 
honduras will as they say encourage them to do that but i do not 
expect american troops to be involved in any military operation 
there he said 
hatfields proposal would permit us military exercises in 
honduras like the training mission which began thursday only if 
congress has been notified a month in advance troops could not be 
sent into combat without a declaration of war or a clear and 
present danger of attack on the united states or its citizens it 
also would prohibit any increase in the permanent us military 
presence there 
he said the administrations action amounted to sinking to the 
level of those in nicaragua who have no interest in peace 
under the terms of this legislation we will not allow and will 
not tolerate sending american military personnel into combat in 
central america hatfield said it is not an option we will 
not permit our young people to be used as pawns in this political 
game and we will not push them down the slippery slope of 
intervention as we pushed their fathers and brothers down that 
slope into vietnam

general motors president robert stempel on friday 
introduced a new car steering wheel designed to move with the 
driver on impact and reduce injury in car crashes 
stempel told a conference of 1000 road safety activists that 
the steering wheel remains a primary source of injury in the 
event of a crash despite the collapsible steering column 
developed 20 years ago 
the new steering wheel has an energyabsorbing hub the point 
where the wheel meets the steering column at this juncture in the 
new wheel six metal joints are designed to fold on impact and 
enable the wheel to move parallel to the drivers chest this 
allows the wheel to rest against the body and move with it 
that helps spread the force of the impact and reduces chest 
injuries stempel said 
tests showed the new steering wheel also lessened injuries to 
the abdomen and the face when those were the points of impact he 
said 
the new wheel will make its debut next year in the chevrolet 
cavalier and will be phased in on other models not equipped with 
air bags 
stempel used the occasion to encourage the wearing of seatbelts 
especially in massachusetts where a seatbelt law was repealed 
thirtytwo states require motorists to wear seatbelts 
he also urged motorists to pay better attention to pedestrians 
and motorcyclists who comprise one quarter of the annual road 
death toll 
the threeday national conference called lifesavers is the 
sixth annual meeting of safety experts state and city officials 
car makers and dealers and representatives from the insurance 
industry and law enforcement

lt col oliver north the fired national 
security aide facing trial in the irancontra affair announced 
friday he has asked to retire from the marine corps and said he may 
subpoena the highestranking officials in our government as 
part of his defense 
north submitted his request on thursday asking that he be 
allowed to retire effective may 1 when he will have completed 20 
years of active military service pentagon sources said 
that is the minimum amount of service required to retire with a 
pension with 20 years of service north is entitled to a pension 
totaling 50 percent of his base monthly pay or slightly over 
22000 a year 
in a statement read in the office of his attorney brendan 
sullivan north said the lawyer has informed me that the defense 
against these charges may require him to issue subpoenas for the 
testimony and records of the highest ranking officials in our 
government 
that strikes me as a course of action incompatible with my 
continued service as a marine officer he continued 
accordingly with great sadness i have tendered my request to 
retire from the marine corps 
north who wopre a civilian busines suit in place of his usual 
ribbonbedecked marine uniform refused an answer questions after 
reading the statement 
according to one official who agreed to discuss the matter only 
if not identified north has available a substantial amount of 
accumulated leave and probably will stop working as a staff officer 
at marine corps headquarters pending his retirement 
north was reassigned to headquarters in november 1986 after 
president reagan fired him as an aide to the national security 
council 
the sources said there was nothing to block approval of norths 
retirement request 
they noted that rear adm john poindexter norths former boss 
and reagans former national security adviser exercised his right 
to retire from the navy late last year 
north poindexter and two others were indicted by a federal 
grand jury wednesday on charges they conspired to divert iranian 
arms sales profits to the nicaraguan contra rebels 
the 23count indictment which also named retired air force maj 
gen richard v secord and his business partner albert hakim said 
the defendants organized directed and concealed a program to 
continue funding of and logistical and other support for military 
and paramilitary operations in nicaragua by the contras at a time 
us law barred such action 
north vowed after the indictment was returned to fight the 
charges declaring i did not commit any crime 
north a muchdecorated combat veteran of vietnam and graduate 
of the us naval academy testified last year before congress that 
he always believed he had the approval of his superiors to take the 
actions he did 
poindexter during his testimony before congress said he never 
informed the president of his decision to divert arms sale profits 
the 44yearold north is currently drawing a base pay of 
369360 per month under military retirement rules he will be 
entitled to half that or slightly more than 22000 a year 
according to one source north was technically required to 
provide the marine corps with four months advance notice before 
retiring the service is unlikely to balk however at granting him 
a waiver of that advancenotice requirement the source added 
one pentagon official said gen alfred m gray the marine corps 
commandant had already approved norths request and that it was 
now awaiting only the approval of the navy secretarys office 
and that should come on monday said the source this is 
all very routine 
according to the defense department the pension rights of north 
and poindexter are unlikely to be affected by the outcome of the 
legal cases against them since both men served honorably for at 
least 20 years 
generally speaking a conviction does not affect eligibility 
for a military pension said col david shea a pentagon 
spokesman

morton thiokol officials said thursday that 
if five employees killed in fire while loading an mx missile motor 
with fuel had followed company policy they would be alive today 
they said the crew ignored strict company rules and entered the 
building during a phase of the operation that should have been 
handled by remote control from a bunker a quarter of a mile away 
we dont know why the people were in the building by 
procedure they should not have been there we have not been able 
to come up with a reason we just dont know said robert 
lindstrom a former nasa executive who directed thiokols internal 
investigation of the dec 29 fire 
however in response to a question lindstrom said it was 
possible that the crew had complied with procedures 
lindstrom said the companys probe resulted in the same 
conclusion reached by an air force investigation namely that the 
explosive fire which burned 100000 pounds of solid propellant and 
destroyed the building was ignited by either a spark of static 
electricity or heat from friction 
the air force conclusions were expected to be released shortly 
on wednesday the utah division of occupational safety and 
health cited the defense contractor for six safety violations and 
imposed a 31700 fine the victims presence in the building and 
failure to use remotecontrol equipment were among the most serious 
violations alleged by the agency which characterized three of them 
as willful and serious 
phillip r dykstra vice president of strategic operations for 
morton thiokol said the states contention that management knew 
that crews occasionally were present during restricted operations 
was not supported by facts 
its not true dykstra said our investigation shows no 
one was aware that occasionally procedures had been violated 
lindstrom said that during interviews with numerous employees 
one or two said crews had gone into buildings in violation of 
safety rules he said investigators did not pursue that issue 
because their charge was only to find the cause of the fire 
dykstra contested uoshs classification of the three violations 
as willful although the facts supporting the citations were true 
he said the company will avail itself of every legal avenue to 
challenge these citations a procedure which involves appeal to 
the independent utah uosh review commission 
the workers were withdrawing the core from a casting of the 
first stage of an mx missile when the solid fuel ignited the blaze 
caused 62 million in damage to the building at the companys 
wasatch operations plant 25 miles west of brigham city 
morton thiokol makes the missiles four stages and the space 
shuttles solidfuel rocket boosters one of which failed when the 
challenger blew up in january 1986 
the fire has held up production of the mx missile until the 
cause and corrective measures could be determined ed garrison 
president of the companys aerospace group said morton thiokol 
hopes to reach an agreement on corrective measures with the air 
force within two weeks 
he said those measures include removing the tefloncoated steel 
core at a slower rate to reduce friction verification that the 
motor is properly grounded to prevent buildup of static 
electricity and installation of instruments to monitor static 
electricity 
the cores or forms are removed after the propellant has been 
poured into the casing and allowed to harden 
the state agency alleged that the missile motor was not properly 
grounded during the operation though lindstrom said the previous 
shift had grounded the missile correctly because of extensive fire 
damage it was impossible to know whether the grounding had 
remained intact he said 
however he said static electricity can build up even when there 
is proper grounding 
it takes up to four hours to remove the 60inch core from the 
casing after the initial phase in which the core is lifted about 
30 inches crews are authorized to enter the building to remove a 
hydraulic lift and attach the core to a crane that completes the 
procedure 
responding to a question lindstrom said it was possible the 
workers had completed the first phase of their task and were in the 
building to change the equipment if so they were following 
company policy

government radio condemned border air 
raids by honduras which it said struck inside nicaragua and 
exhorted listeners friday against american imperialism and the 
threat of military intervention 
a headline in barricada the sandinista newspaper said the 
order of the day intensify combat 
honduras said the raids thursday were confined to its own 
territory aimed at nicaraguan soldiers it said crossed the 
frontier the day before in pursuit of contra rebels 
the sandinista government continued with plans for ceasefire 
talks with the contras next monday but the ussupported rebels 
were considering a boycott 
ceasefires in the regions civil wars and a ban on the use of 
one countrys territory for attacks on another are provisions of 
the peace plan signed aug 7 by five central american presidents 
nicaragua said it had called off its offensive to roust contras 
from camps along the honduran border wednesday but was maintaining 
combat positions 
although the defense ministry said none of the soldiers entered 
honduras a nicaraguan military source indicated privately that 
they had 
honduran officials and the reagan administration say sandinista 
soldiers crossed the rugged illdefined border about 175 miles 
from managua 
on thursday the united states started flying 3200 soldiers of 
the 82nd airborne division and 7th light infantry to honduras in a 
show of support defense secretary said they would be on a training 
exercise there for 10 days but would stay out of combat 
president daniel ortega said nicaraguan troops would take on the 
americans if necessary 
he hedged the question of whether nicaraguan soldiers crossed 
the coco river in the isolated northern region as he has when 
previous incursions were reported 
here the question is not if army troops penetrated honduran 
territory or not but that we have dozens of camps of mercenary 
forces in honduran territory tolerated by the honduran 
government he said thursday 
honduran warplanes bombed the bocay border region where 
nicaraguas northern military headquarters is located the honduran 
government said a sovietsupplied nicaraguan helicopter was 
destroyed but the defense ministry denied the claim 
journalists taken to the area earlier thursday saw and felt a 
bomb explode at the confluence of the bocay and coco rivers lt 
col javier carrion commander of the offensive against the 
contras said two bombs fell in nicaraguan territory and one on the 
honduran side 
carrion told reporters in a jungle clearing at san andres de 
bocay that 4500 soldiers were involved in the sweep through an 
area running from central nicaragua to the frontier he said they 
had air support from sovietsupplied helicopter gunships and an26 
propellerdriven planes carrying bombs 
he said sandinista troops had killed 92 contras and wounded 300 
at the cost of 34 soldiers dead and 68 wounded 
the colonel said the purpose was to destroy contra bases in the 
border area which is about 40 miles from an important mining 
region the rebels attacked in december 
honduras said about 2000 nicaraguan soldiers crossed the 
border and a highranking military officer said about half of them 
still were there friday

twenty years after the kerner commission accused 
the news media of looking at the world with white mens eyes 
newspapers and broadcast stations still are not hiring or promoting 
enough blacks a group of black journalists said friday 
despite some industry attempts to improve black employment 
prospects what has resulted in far too many instances can simply 
be characterized as a lot of motion and little movement the 
groups report said 
the national association of black journalists formed a panel to 
compare the status of blacks in journalism today with 20 years ago 
when race riots prompted president johnson to appoint illinois gov 
otto kerner to head the national advisory commission on civil 
disorders 
the kerner commission conclusion that the journalistic 
profession has been shockingly backward in seeking out hiring 
training and promoting blacks still rings true said dewayne 
wickham of the gannett news service president of the nabj 
the panel which wickham said carried out its study over several 
months acknowledged substantial good will among news media 
executives 
but wickham said we also found there had not been a lot of 
progress it would be wrong to stand here and say there has 
been no progress it would be equally wrong to say it is 
significant 
the panels recommendations 
newspaper publishers should promise to double the number of 
black journalists from 35 percent of newsroom employees to 7 
percent by 1991 
newspaper and broadcast industry foundations should deny grants 
to college journalism programs which do not employ a single 
fulltime black member or which does not undertake a serious 
effort to recruit and retain black students 
the national association of broadcasters and the 
radiotelevision news directors association should join the nabj to 
form a task force to halt the decline in blacks working in 
television news a declining number of black men employed in 
broadcast news caused the ratio of minority group members in the 
field to drop from 15 percent in 1979 to 13 percent in 1986 the 
panel said 
believing there is a possible relationship between the 
deregulation of the broadcast industry and this sharp drop the 
nabj will monitor the compliance of television stations with 
existing federal communications commission regulations the 
report said 
where we are unsuccessful in bringing compliance through 
negotiations the nabj will move aggressively to challenge the 
licenses of broadcast stations it said 
ernie schultz president of the rtnda said his group supported 
the reports recommendations 100 percent 
wickham said copies of the report also would be sent to the nab 
the american society of newspaper editors and the american 
newspaper publishers association for comment 
dwight ellis nab vice president for minority services said 
blacks are losing ground in broadcasting its been documented 
he said that although the reason for the decline was unclear 
the nab and the news editors were considering two remedies an 
advertising campaign to tell blacks about some of the less obvious 
jobs available in broadcasting and creation of an institute to 
train minority group members for management 
lee stinnett executive director of the asne said surveys show 
that the number of minority group members employed in newspaper 
newsrooms has more than doubled since 1978 rising from 1700 to 
3600 or from 4 percent of the total to 65 percent he said 
slightly more than half the minority newspaper journalists are 
black he said

federal regulators on friday pledged to 
protect all depositors and general creditors of the thrift unit of 
the troubled californiabased financial corp of america the 
nations second largest thrift holding company 
the announcement by the federal home loan bank board came after 
the companys disclosure in a report filed with the securities and 
exchange commission that its thrift unit american savings amp loan 
association of stockton calif was insolvent under generally 
accepted accounting principles 
the bank boards promise designed to provide the ailing sampl 
with stability and stem a drain of deposits goes beyond its usual 
mandate of protecting deposit accounts up to 100000

the management of fca and american

worth was plus 69 million at the end of 1987 compared with 3578 
million at the end of the third quarter 
fca had previously revealed that its net worth had fallen into 
the red but this is the first disclosure that net worth at 
american fcas main subsidiary has fallen below the zero mark 
that happened when american concluded that repayment of debts due 
from its parent company was not assured 
fcas annual report filed with the sec also disclosed that 
american had a drain on deposits of 493 million during the first 
two months of this year it attributed the drain to publicity about 
the banks problems and said the drain eased during the first 10 
days of march deposits had totaled 171 billion at the end of the 
year 
the drain was milder than the severe run at american in august 
and september of 1984 when the bank amid heavy operating losses 
lost about 68 billion of its 25 billion in deposits 
the bank boards sister agency for commercial banks the federal 
deposit insurance corp issued a similar promise on thursday 
protecting all depositors and general creditors of first 
republicbank corp of dallas a bank holding company of about the 
same size as fca 
however the fdic went a step further than the bank board by 
pumping 1 billion into first republicbank 
fca on feb 23 asked the bank board for a 15 billion in 
assistance as soon as possible karl hoyle a bank board spokesman 
said the request is under review 
fca with 337 billion in assets ranks second among thrift 
companies only to hf ahmanson amp co the los angelesbased parent 
of home savings of america

find another institution willing to take over all or part of fca on 
terms that wouldnt be too costly to the federal savings and loan 
insurance corp the bank board unit that insures deposits 
onagain offagain talks with the thrift unit of ford motor co

three months of last year bringing its 1987 loss to 468 million

billion in mortgagebacked securities to reduce its vulnerablity to 
interest rate fluctuations

a 19member us delegation selected by 
president reagan is heading to el salvador this weekend to monitor 
legislative and municipal elections that leftist guerrillas have 
threatened to disrupt with violence officials said friday 
the president strongly supports the people of el salvador and 
their democratic aspirations and is demonstrating this support by 
sending this delegation white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
said 
a delegation member rep john g rowland rconn said our 
presence there is mainly one to deter any fraud by the 
participating political parties and to objectively and fairly 
report what we see happening 
andy fisher an aide to sen richard g lugar rind said the 
delegation will visit polling places in san salvador and the 
countryside despite the pinpointing of the polls as military 
targets by the leftist forces 
the delegation headed by lugar and rep john p murtha dpa

here is a transcript of the announcement 
friday by lt col oliver north who is facing trial in the 
irancontra case on his request to retire from the marine corps 
there have been many inquiries this afternoon regarding a story 
apparently out of the pentagon about my status in the marine corps 
and i would like to clarify the situation at this time 
i love the united states marine corps and the courageous 
brothers in arms that i have served with over the past 20 years 
since graduating from the united states naval academy my goal 
has simply been to serve our country as a marine for as long as 
possible 
unfortunately the indictment delivered two days ago places me 
in a situation where my continued service would be inconsistent 
with preparing and presenting a vigorous defense against these 
unfounded charges 
my attorney brendan sullivan has informed me that the defense 
against these charges may require him to issue subpoenas for the 
testimony and records of the highestranking officials of our 
government 
that strikes me as a course of action incompatible with my 
continued service as a marine officer 
accordingly with great sadness i have tendered my request to 
retire from the marine corps 
for over 16 months i have silently endured a torrent of media 
speculation as the largest investigation in the history of our 
country has probed every aspect of my personal and professional 
life and that of my family 
i have not responded except when required by law during the 
course of the congressional hearings last summer 
further silence is a disservice to me my family and the brave 
people i have served and worked with on matters of great importance 
to our country 
moreover while on active duty i am not fully free to speak out 
or to take other actions which may be necessary 
the months ahead will be difficult and i recognize that 
fighting a prosecutor with an unlimited budget an enormous staff 
is a formidable and costly task for me and my counsel 
my family and i continue to take heart from the overwhelming 
expressions of love and concern and encouragement by countless 
freedomloving people 
we are extremely grateful 
your prayers and support have helped us to endure this ordeal in 
washington 
i thank you 
god bless you 
semper fidelis 
thank you

a bipartisan group of senators proposed a 48 
million package of new aid to nicaraguas contra rebels friday 
including renewed authority for the cia to deliver previously 
stockpiled weapons 
as us troops continued to arrive in honduras in a show of 
force assistant secretary of state elliott abrams said additional 
assistance was being discussed with honduran president jose azcona 
in response to a reported nicaraguan incursion 
white house chief of staff howard baker said president reagan 
would give most careful consideration to any request from 
honduras for troops to help repel nicaraguan forces although he 
reiterated that us troops were not expected to be involved in any 
military operation in the region 
one of the senates leading peace advocates sen mark o 
hatfield said the sending of us troops amounted merely to 
matching stupidity with stupidity and introduced legislation 
barring the troops from a combat role without permission from 
congress 
sponsors of the new contra aid proposal said they hoped it would 
revive negotiations in congress and with the reagan administration 
on an aid package that could be quickly enacted to replace supplies 
lost or expended during the past weeks heavy fighting along the 
nicaraguanhonduran border 
but the extent of the damage inflicted on the rebels by the 
sandinista incursion remained unclear sen david boren dokla 
chairman of the senate intelligence committee said the nicaraguan 
troops were withdrawing without accomplishing all their objectives 
we think its very important right now to send a signal to the 
sandinista government which allegedly crossed the border into 
honduras in an effort to destroy rebel camps and supplies boren 
said 
sen nancy kassebaum rkan said announcement of the package 
also would strengthen the contras as they enter direct ceasefire 
talks with the managua regime scheduled for monday this is a 
commonsense moderate and reasoned approach she said 
the proposal would use 48 million in unspent pentagon money to 
buy food clothing shelter and medical supplies and to transport 
it to troops in the field over the next year about 3 million of 
that amount would go for communications gear 
but in what promised to be a controversial provision the 
package would allow the cia to airdrop ammunition and weapons 
previously stockpiled by the rebels to troops in the field boren 
said the rebels still have 2 million to 5 million worth of 
undelivered supplies about half of them lethal 
and it would give president reagan the right to hold a quick 
guaranteed vote in congress on any request for further military aid 
under certain conditions if the peace talks between the sandinistas 
and contras break down 
as a carrot the bill also would promise longterm economic 
aid for the region once political stability is restored 
an administration official speaking on condition he not be 
identified said of the new aid package we are encouraged from 
reports we have heard about it but we will have to wait until we 
have the actual details 
sen daniel evans rwash who has opposed contra aid in the 
past said he was supporting the latest proposal because it is 
the best way to ensure that the peace talks have some chance of 
success 
action on further aid for the rebels has been stalled since 
march 3 when the house narrowly rejected a 30 million package of 
purely humanitarian aid aid proponents saw the sandinista 
incursion into honduras as a new opportunity to revive interest in 
aid 
meanwhile abrams told reporters that american officials have 
been discussing with honduran president azcona the possibility of 
providing additional assistance to that country in addition to the 
3200 troops already airlifted to palmerola air base near 
tegucigalpa 
there are some other possibilities that weve discussed 
abrams said adding that the possibilities did not include 
additional troops we do not have a formal request from president 
azcona as of this morning for any other form of assistance 
obviously if we get one well take it very seriously 
baker said that if a request were received from honduras for 
troops to help repel nicaraguan forces it would be most 
carefully considered and most deliberately considered but i cannot 
tell you what decision the president would make under those 
circumstances 
baker interviewed on the syndicated television program john 
mclaughlins one on one was asked at what point us troops 
would enter action 
i dont anticipate that will occur at all i think that the 
honduran forces can handle that on their own and i fully 
anticipate that either the nicaraguans will retire on their own or 
honduras will as they say encourage them to do that but i do not 
expect american troops to be involved in any military operation 
there he said 
hatfields proposal would permit us military exercises in 
honduras like the training mission which began thursday only if 
congress has been notified a month in advance troops could not be 
sent into combat without a declaration of war or a clear and 
present danger of attack on the united states or its citizens it 
also would prohibit any increase in the permanent us military 
presence there 
he said the administrations action amounted to sinking to the 
level of those in nicaragua who have no interest in peace 
under the terms of this legislation we will not allow and will 
not tolerate sending american military personnel into combat in 
central america hatfield said it is not an option we will 
not permit our young people to be used as pawns in this political 
game and we will not push them down the slippery slope of 
intervention as we pushed their fathers and brothers down that 
slope into vietnam

partners in a new york banking firm that does 
business with the state of massachusetts have given money and 
helped raise more for the presidential bid of gov michael dukakis 
according to a published report friday 
a dukakis campaign spokesman denied there was anything improper 
michael del giudice general partner in lazard freres and co 
organized eight fundraisers last june that raised 250000 for the 
dukakis campaign said the boston herald 
and jonathan oherron a partner in the same firm was cohost 
of a fundraising dinner also in june that raised 25000 the 
herald said 
federal election commission records show del giudice gave the 
maximum contribution of 1000 to dukakis and oherron and his 
wife each gave 500 the newspaper said 
lazard freres was awarded a threeyear contract jan 7 to advise 
the state on fiscal management of construction of a third boston 
harbor tunnel and the depression of the central artery 
i think its ridiculous to suggest that there is any 
appearance of a conflict of interest said campaign spokesman 
steve akey there is absolutely no connection between 
contributions and contracts 
akey said other members of the banking firm support different 
candidates and he said it would be impractical for the campaign to 
refuse contributions from the thousands of individuals and 
companies that do business with the state or operate under state 
regulation 
the subject of campaign finance has become a debating point 
between dukakis and a democratic rival rep richard gephardt of 
missouri 
dukakis has faulted gephardt for taking money from political 
action committees while noting that his own campaign rejects pac 
money and contributions from registered massachusetts lobbyists 
gephardt has defended his nearly 300000 in pac donations and 
persistently raised questions about dukakis acceptance of 
contributions from anyone doing business with the state of 
massachusetts

israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir 
insisted friday that his country remains committed to seeking peace 
in the middle east despite his rebuff of a us proposal for an 
international peace conference 
israel cannot accept the proposal offered by secretary of state 
george shultz because such a gathering would give arab countries 
and the soviet union a chance to impose their will on israel 
shamir said 
however israel remains open to direct talks with the arabs the 
prime minister said 
this approach is enshrined in the camp david accords to which 
we remain committed shamir said referring to the settlement his 
country made with egypt in 1978 under us auspices they still 
provide a workable blueprint for resolving issues between us and 
our arab neighbors including the palestinian arabs 
the camp david agreement called for a period of limited 
selfrule for palestinians in the occupied territories 
about 250 palestinians and their supporters demonstrated outside 
the century plaza hotel as shamir addressed 750 at a luncheon of 
the world affairs council 
the chanting demonstrators carried signs protesting israeli 
troops violent suppression of palestinian unrest in the west bank 
and gaza strip 
about 20 members of the militant jewish defense league staged a 
counterdemonstration outside the hotel but there were no 
confrontations said police sgt larry mckinley 
in the occupied territories friday israeli troops shot a 
protester to death and at least 25 others were injured in violence 
that erupted after moslem noon prayers the death was the 101st 
since the unrest began 3 months ago 
shamirs likud bloc which shares power with the more liberal 
labor party rejects shultz proposal for a conference including 
the permanent members of the un security council such a meeting 
would lead to demands that israel give up territory it has held 
since 1967 and considers vital to its defense shamir said 
the soviets have been pushing the idea because they know that 
within this framework they can push a settlement favorable to 
themselves and their syrian clients he said 
shamir who arrived in los angeles on thursday after talks in 
washington with shultz president reagan and congressional leaders 
has sought to blunt criticism by some american jews of his 
countrys action in the occupied territories 
he reiterated that the picture of the palestinian riots in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip has been distorted by the news 
media and said americans shouldnt confuse the violence with 
usstyle civil rights activism 
it is war it is an extension of urban terrorism he said 
defending his troops use of rubber bullets beatings and live 
ammunition 
in answer to a question from the audience shamir said he 
believed american jews continue to support israel despite the 
controversy 
i dont see any changes shamir said i think the great 
majority of the jewish community in america supports the state of 
israel

president reagan on friday named treasury 
secretary james a baker iii to head a working group to coordinate 
recommendations for altering the governments regulation of 
financial markets 
the group was appointed under a presidential order after 
nicholas f brady head of reagans task force on the oct 19 stock 
market crash told congress on thursday that a repeat of that event 
could occur unless the governments regulatory authorities are put 
under one roof 
bradys commission earlier had called for making the federal 
reserve board a super regulator with authority over both the 
securities and exchange commission and the commodities futures 
trading commission in regulating financial markets 
but that idea has been rejected by the heads of all three 
agencies 
federal reserve chairman alan greenspan has said he doesnt want 
the added authority and a turf fight has erupted between sec 
chairman david ruder and the cftcs new chairwoman wendy gramm 
over which agency should regulate stock index futures 
the sec has blamed trading in stock index futures for worsening 
the october crash which saw the dow jones average of 30 industrial 
stocks fall more than 500 points in one day 
ruder has suggested that regulation of trading in index futures 
be transferred from the cftc to his agency an idea opposed by both 
gramm and brady 
commodity exchanges where the futures are traded and the cftc 
have maintained that activity on the index futures markets oct 19 
had no affect on the severity of the collapse in stock prices 
named with baker to the working group were greenspan ruder and 
gramm plus the five other governors now on the federal reserves 
board and four other members each from the sec and cftc 
reagan gave the group 60 days to report back to him on any 
progress in ironing out their differences and coming up with 
recommended legislation 
the goals are twofold said white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater first to ensure the continued integrity 
competitiveness and efficiency of our nations financial markets 
and second to maintain the publics confidence in those markets 
specifically the panel was told to look at the desirability of 
a tiebreaking referee with emergency powers and more formal 
intermaket coordination and cooperation mechanisms among the three 
agencies 
it also was told to examine the adequacy of private sector 
capital for futures floor traders market makers and brokerdealers 
and whether margin requirements need to be strengthened and 
harmonized 
other issues the panel was told to explore include the 
desirability of simultaneous trading halts in all markets to clear 
transactions imposition of price limits on stocks index futures 
and options emergency measures to restrict large rapid 
liquidations and revising equity shortsale rules 
none of them is simple fitzwater said of the issues and 
while deserving high priority may not be resolved quickly or 
without considerable reflection

lt col oliver north the fired national 
security aide facing trial in the irancontra affair announced 
friday he has asked to retire from the marine corps and said he may 
subpoena the highestranking officials in our government as 
part of his defense 
north submitted his request on thursday asking that he be 
allowed to retire effective may 1 when he will have completed 20 
years of active military service pentagon sources said 
that is the minimum amount of service required to retire with a 
pension with 20 years of service north is entitled to a pension 
totaling 50 percent of his base monthly pay or slightly over 
22000 a year 
in a statement read in the office of his attorney brendan 
sullivan north said the lawyer has informed me that the defense 
against these charges may require him to issue subpoenas for the 
testimony and records of the highest ranking officials in our 
government 
that strikes me as a course of action incompatible with my 
continued service as a marine officer he continued 
accordingly with great sadness i have tendered my request to 
retire from the marine corps 
north who wore a civilian business suit in place of his usual 
ribbonbedecked marine uniform refused to answer questions after 
reading the statement 
north said he has silently endured a torrent of media 
speculation during 16 months of irancontra investigations he 
said he had not responded except when required by law and that 
further silence is a disservice 
while on active duty i am not fully free to speak out or to 
take other actions which may be necessary north said 
a man apparently a private security guard controlled the 
access of reporters and photographers to the room where north read 
his statement before north entered the guard told the press to 
keep your hands out of your pockets and to make no quick 
moves 
according to one official who agreed to discuss the matter only 
if not identified north has available a substantial amount of 
accumulated leave and probably will stop working as a staff officer 
at marine corps headquarters pending his retirement 
north was reassigned to headquarters in november 1986 after 
president reagan fired him as an aide to the national security 
council 
the sources said there was nothing to block approval of norths 
retirement request 
they noted that rear adm john poindexter norths former boss 
and reagans former national security adviser exercised his right 
to retire from the navy late last year 
north poindexter and two others were indicted by a federal 
grand jury wednesday on charges they conspired to divert iranian 
arms sales profits to the nicaraguan contra rebels 
the 23count indictment which also named retired air force maj 
gen richard v secord and his business partner albert hakim said 
the defendants organized directed and concealed a program to 
continue funding of and logistical and other support for military 
and paramilitary operations in nicaragua by the contras at a time 
us law barred such action 
north vowed after the indictment was returned to fight the 
charges declaring i did not commit any crime 
north a muchdecorated combat veteran of vietnam and graduate 
of the us naval academy testified last year before congress that 
he always believed he had the approval of his superiors to take the 
actions he did 
poindexter during his testimony before congress said he never 
informed the president of his decision to divert arms sale profits 
the 44yearold north is currently drawing a base pay of 
369360 per month under military retirement rules he will be 
entitled to half that or slightly more than 22000 a year 
according to one source north was technically required to 
provide the marine corps with four months advance notice before 
retiring the service is unlikely to balk however at granting him 
a waiver of that advancenotice requirement the source added 
one pentagon official said gen alfred m gray the marine corps 
commandant had already approved norths request and that it was 
now awaiting only the approval of the navy secretarys office 
and that should come on monday said the source this is 
all very routine 
according to the defense department the pension rights of north 
and poindexter are unlikely to be affected by the outcome of the 
legal cases against them since both men served honorably for at 
least 20 years 
generally speaking a conviction does not affect eligibility 
for a military pension said col david shea a pentagon 
spokesman

some republican activists said friday they 
will fight to keep this years gop presidential campaign platform 
true to conservative principles 
they insisted their fight is not an effort to stop vice 
president george bush the frontrunner in the gop presidential 
race 
the group seeking to save the reagan platform is spearheaded 
by the american conservative union and donald devine who recently 
was ousted from a top post in sen bob doles lagging presidential 
campaign 
this is not a stopbush campaign devine told a news 
conference 
but he repeatedly criticized a speech the vice president gave in 
chicago last week in which bush promised a bush administration 
would press for a tough new code of ethics for government officials 
our purpose is to promote an agenda the republican party can 
win on said devine who was president reagans director of the 
office of personnel management from 1981 to 1985 
to win in november bush must galvanize the support of 
republican activists who are overwhelmingly conservative not shift 
his policies toward the center devine and other conservative 
leaders said 
daniel graham a retired air force lieutenant general who heads 
high frontier a group pressing for development of the strategic 
defense initiative said the republican party must take a strong 
stand against cuts in the pentagon budget 
l brent bozell iii chairman of the conservative victory 
committee said the republican platform must reaffirm that the 
party is committed to the elimination of the ruthless marxist 
regime in nicaragua 
devine said efforts will be made to raise money for a 
delegatetracking system to identify the conservatives and 
represent their views at the convention in new orleans in august 
bush in a speech to the governors club in chicago had said he 
was personally disturbed at the breaches of ethics i have seen in 
the past few years in government he said he would appoint an 
ethics panel in the white house to draft a new code of ethics 
devine said bush shouldnt have started talking about 
something unnecessarily critical of ronald reagan 
i would think that a stronger ethics in government act is one 
that provided less discretion to independent prosecutors or 
permanent prosecutors to make up charges said devine we have 
an ethics in government act that says the appearance of a conflict 
of interest is a felony now thats preposterous 
bozell also criticized the reagan administrations 
intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty with the soviet union and 
claimed it has weakened support for anticommunist rebels in 
afghanistan and angola 
were affirming the 1980 republican platform which is 
unfortunately a far cry sometimes from the 1988 adminstration 
said bozell 
asked where conservatives could turn if they dont prevail on 
the gop platform devine said stay home 
some conservatives believe they would be better off if they 
relinquished the white house this year to a liberal democrat such 
as massachusetts gov michael dukakis and reclaimed it in 1992 he 
said

rescue workers on friday removed remains 
of the 138 people who died when an avianca jetliner slammed into an 
andean peak burst into flames and started a landslide 
a bogota newspaper quoting an avianca executive reported 
friday that the boeing 727100 hit the mountain after it swerved to 
avoid a collision with with another avianca plane 
but another company official said the cause of the crash had not 
been determined 
no americans were reported on the domestic flight 
witnesses said the plane clipped trees before slamming into the 
mountainside thursday near zulia 50 miles north of cucuta where 
it had taken off 
a police inspector in nearby campo alicia augusto bautista 
said the impact opened a hole that looked like a crater in a 
volcano 
col miguel benedetti civil defense director for the state of 
north santander said thursday night that there were no survivors 
the government and avianca said there were 131 passengers and seven 
crew members aboard both had given different figures earlier 
the government said it had begun an investigation but recovery 
personnel had not yet located the planes black box which 
could provide clues to the cause of the crash 
this tragedy has saddened many colombian homes president 
virgilio barco said in a thursday night speech on television 
the plane took off from cucuta 250 miles northeast of bogota 
and was to stop at the caribbean ports of barranquilla and 
cartegena 
rain snow and rough terrain hampered rescue efforts thursday 
civil aeronautics agency officials said that work crews some using 
helicopters returned to the crash site friday 
bautista said the remains of the victims were scattered and many 
passengers had been buried by a landslide touched off by the jet 
its not possible to recognize anyone he said 
police civil defense workers red cross members and local 
residents placed bodies in plastic bags and loaded them on 
helicopters headed for cucuta 
the bogota daily el siglo on friday quoted raul garcia an 
avianca vice president as saying that the pilot had swerved to 
avoid a collision with another avianca jet flying from bogota to 
cucuta 
garcia was quoted as saying the two pilots communicated by radio 
before the accident and that the second plane landed safely shortly 
after the crash 
he did not return phone calls to his office friday 
airport officials at cucuta would not comment 
but jairo mejia aviancas director of operations told the 
newspaper we cant give too much credibility to speculation and 
said the cause of the crash had not been determined 
local residents said the plane appeared to be flying low before 
it slammed into 8000foot la cuchilla peak 
however the operator of the control tower at cucutas airport 
ivan robayo said the plane was flying normally and had not 
reported any trouble

richard gephardt promised friday to defend american jobs 
rather than foreign protectionism and michael dukakis attacked 
president reagans policy in central america as the two democratic 
presidential hopefuls pointed toward next weeks michign showdown 
vice president george bush enjoying the status of nearnominee 
on the republican side said reagan did the right thing when he 
dispatched combat troops to honduras rival bob doles campaign was 
reduced to skeletal remains with only about a dozen paid aides 
remaining 
meanwhile the man who directed president reagans investigation 
into the irancontra affair said he doubted the episode would 
damage vice president george bushs bid for the white house i 
fully expect the opposition to use it on him said former sen 
john tower of texas but he added the voters will tend to focus 
on the problems of the moment and not the past 
the republican campaign was quiet appropriately so for a race 
that has been all but wrapped up by bush 
democrats were running full tilt with caucuses primaries and 
conventions in kansas texas puerto rico and south dakota this 
weekend offering 169 delegates and the big 138delegate michigan 
caucus showdown a week away 
im the underdog today but that doesnt really matter 
gephardt said as he and 18 house democratic colleagues moved 
through michigan i think you will see that the gephardt message 
about economic revival is going to get through to the michigan 
voters 
dukakis ahead in a new public poll as well as his own 
countered with massachusetts sen edward m kennedy who agreed to 
appear at labor rallies in two michigan cities looking ahead to 
other staes dukakis also picked up an endorsement from rep sam 
gejdenson of connecticut sources said he would receive one from 
rep jim florio of new jersey on saturday 
the governor divided his time between michigan and kansas during 
the day and he hit hard against reagans decision to airlift 3200 
combat troops to honduras the whole policy in central america is 
illegal he said call back the troops and end this 
he also criticized the idea of possible presidential pardons for 
oliver north and others indicted in the irancontra affair on 
wednesday but he said i dont want to consider the political 
effects of the indictments 
bush disagreed strongly with him on central america 
we did the proper thing he said in an interview with a 
puerto rico television station conducted by telephone we are for 
freedom and democracy there is no question that nicaragua invaded 
honduras 
gephardt was focusing almost exclusively on michigan which 
poses a makeorbreak test for his faltering candidacy he and 
dukakis already have begun airing television commercials in the 
state even though the caucuses are a week away 
campaigning in regions of the state where factories have closed 
in recent years he said its time we had a president who 
defended american jobs rather than foreign protectionism i reject 
the notion that in order to move some of us ahead we must leave 
millions behind 
jesse jackson won the endorsement of george sallade who headed 
former candidate gary harts michigan campaign in 1984 and again 
this year sallade said he thought most of harts supporters would 
follow suit i expect the racists if they exist to be 
outnumbered next saturday he said 
sen albert gore jr of tennessee campaigned in puerto rico 
looking for support in sundays primary he said he would consider 
a request from the popular democratic party to exempt the 
commonwealth from federal minimum wage laws and said he favors 
letting puerto ricans decide whether to become a state 
doles campaign has been severely curtailed since tuesdays 
illinois primary defeat at the hands of bush spokeswoman dale tate 
said only about 10 to 12 aides were left on the payroll although 
several other officials were volunteering their services the 
campaign once employed about 300 persons she said 
dole has vowed to stay in the race until the wisconsin primary 
on april 5 but ms tate said the kansas senator was unlikely to 
air television commercials in connecticut which votes on march 29 
the other active challenger to bush former television 
evangelist pat robertson campaigned in california where he 
proclaimed there has to be a rallying point for conservatives 
with bush holding an overwhelming lead in nominating delegates 
over his two rivals most interest focused on the still murky 
democratic race 
dukakis and jackson both spent time in kansas which holds 
caucuses on saturday with 39 delegates at stake 
at washburn university in topeka jackson accused reagan of 
fighting psychological warfare with the congress manipulating 
the public mind for more contra aid 
gephardt also looked to translate his victory in last months 
south dakota primary into delegates at a statewide convention on 
saturday and dukakis and jackson the two top finishers in the 
texas primary on march 8 looked to carve up most of the 64 
delegates at the states caucuses on saturday 
the other campaign contest of the weekend is puerto ricos 
primary with 51 delegates at stake 
gephardts campaign chartered two jets to ferry house members to 
michigan to campaign on his behalf the missouri congressman is 
obviously a known quantity said rep john dingell dmich we 
also know how he responds in a crisis we in congress dont like 
weaklings or phonies 
the other democrat in the race sen paul simon of illinois is 
essentially conceding michigan to his rivals he campaigned in 
pennsylvania during the day where he criticized reagans decision 
to send combat troops to honduras i think candidly it was 
designed not to meet a military threat to honduras but to try to 
line up some votes in the house and the senate for military aid to 
the contras and i dont think its going to work he said

the army began moving about 2000 
soldiers into the border jungles friday with orders to drive out a 
nicaraguan force of half that size 
roughly 2000 nicaraguan soldiers had been reported in the 
mountainous area thursday the day after honduras said they crossed 
the frontier pursuing contra rebels a ranking honduran officer 
said 1000 of them remained on the honduran side friday 
about 800 american paratroopers among the last to arrive of 
the 3200 soldiers sent to honduras were dropped onto palmerola 
air base friday morning the defense department says the us 
forces will be in central america for a 10day training exercise 
gen fred f woerner commander of the us southern command 
based in panama arrived to review the exercise and said it was a 
reassuring factor to our allies not only in honduras but 
elsewhere 
he said there were some very very preliminary indications 
that sandinista troops were beginning to withdraw but the duration 
of the us exercise was not necessarily linked to that 
the honduran officer who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
two honduran infantry battalions totaling 1600 to 2000 soldiers 
were moving in from a base at juticalpa about 90 miles west he 
said warplanes were on call from the tamara air base 15 miles north 
of tegucigalpa 
orders were given for the soldiers to expel the invading 
troops with whatever means necessary he said adding that about 
half the original force had fled to nicaragua honduran soldiers 
began sweeping the border region for mines thursday but none had 
been found he reported 
honduras gave the sandinistas 24 hours to get their soldiers out 
of the country but the time of the deadline was not stated 
the sandinistas have denied entering honduras but a nicaraguan 
military source indicated privately that they had 
nicaraguas northern military headquarters is near the frontier 
in bocay and honduran warplanes flew raids in the area thursday 
hours after us troops began arriving in honduras 
us defense secretary frank carlucci said the american troops 
from the 82nd airborne and 7th light infantry were sent on a 10day 
training exercise to provide moral support and would be kept 
away from combat 
pentagon officials said privately the four us battalions would 
spend eight or nine days training with hondurans in different parts 
of the country 
one battalion of the 82nd airborne will be at juticalpa an 
official said but anyone who knows the country would realize 
the 90 miles might as well be 4000 theres nothing but 
mountains and jungle in between 
the basic order that these troops arent to get near the 
fighting still stands he said 
president daniel ortega of nicaragua said thursday his soldiers 
were ready to combat and liquidate the 82nd airborne if 
necessary 
alejandro bendana secretarygeneral of the nicaraguan foreign 
ministry said one step could lead to another in the border 
conflict indicating war might result 
the ussupported contras have secret bases in honduras from 
which to attack across the border in their 6yearold battle with 
the sandinistas 
manuel suarez spokesman for the honduran armed forces told 
local reporters president jose azcona hoyo would continue telephone 
conversations with ortega and other central american leaders 
trying to avoid a break in the peace process that has been 
developing in the region 
among provisions of the peace plan signed by the five central 
american countries aug 7 are ceasefires in civil wars and a ban 
on the use of one countrys territory for attacks on another 
azcona 60 has been reported ill with flu for several days and 
canceled several meetings the daily newspaper la prensa said he 
was dealing with the situation from his home 
la prensa printed an editorial cartoon in which uncle sam said 
theres an invasion in honduras while azcona a member of the 
armed forces and a diplomat look around saying where where 
where 
members of the legislature demanded a meeting with foreign 
minister carlos lopez to be told why they were not asked to approve 
azconas request that american soldiers be sent in 
reports on thursdays air raids conflicted 
nicaraguas foreign ministry blamed the united states and made a 
formal protest 
reagan administration officials said one of nicaraguas 
sovietsupplied helicopters was destroyed but the sandinistas 
denied it nicaragua is believed to have more than 40 military 
helicopters 
honduras said its air force attacked only inside its own 
territory 
suarez the military spokesman said the honduran air force 
raided along the border near san andres de bocay site of the 
sandinista military headquarters in northern nicaragua 
reporters flown to san andres de bocay saw two jet aircraft 
unidentified fly in from honduras just after noon thursday and 
drop at least five bombs near the border

a wonder both spiritual and 
touristic will be played out saturday at mission san juan 
capistrano when thousands of visitors scan the skies for returning 
cliff swallows 
in other urban areas the small noisy birds are considered a 
messy menace their pilgrimage from argentina to regions as far 
north as alaska goes unappreciated their mud nests are destroyed 
before eggs are laid 
but here the annual migration is considered a marvel thanks to 
a 1939 song that popularized a legend about a franciscan padre 
befriending the weary birds when an inn keeper smashed their nests 
some 9000 swallowseekers are expected to flock to the 
cobblestone streets around the 212yearold mission during the 
annual celebration of the clefttailed birds official return on 
march 19 st josephs day 
when you think about it who really cares if they come back 
every year people are cyclical it assures us that things are not 
screwed up said alan lieberman curator of birds for the san 
diego zoo some 60 miles south 
he added i think it romanticizes love among the animals 
as legend has it the swallows have failed the camera and 
binoculartoters only once in 1935 when they were reportedly 
delayed by a storm 
accounts of the swallows were recorded nearly from 1776 the 
year father junipero serra founded the mission leon renes 1939 
song when the swallows come back to capistrano put the town on 
the map 
in recent years the number of birds sighted on march 19 has 
dropped from thousands to a handful mission and tourism officials 
maintain that the shy birds are scared off by the welcoming hoopla 
the insecteating birds also are a victim of urbanization that 
has turned the small farming town 60 miles south of los angeles 
into a community of 22500 lush orange groves and mudflats have 
become parking lots and condominiums 
instead of nesting in the shade of the renovated mission many 
of the whitebellied brown birds set up house under the eaves of 
buildings and freeway overpasses in outlying areas 
the swallows they dont come like they used to there are too 
many people here now and they scare them away laments paul 
arbiso 92 the missions gardener and bell ringer since 1910 
arbiso will ring four antique bells when he first sees a swallow 
saturday kicking off an allday party 
the festivities should begin fairly early since the first birds 
to complete the 6000mile journey from goya argentina arrived 
several weeks ago said brian mcinerney director of tourism for 
the mission 
weve got about 1500 swallows at the mission already 
mcinerney said earlier this week 
the mission also has 50 workers answering inquiries from around 
the world said mcinerney last years event put about 50000 in 
the missions coffers he said 
the local chamber of commerce said it does not keep a tally on 
the birds economic impact but spokeswoman jan hessell said hotels 
in the area are booked and merchants ready for the onslaught 
people will buy anything with a swallow on it and the mobs 
have to have somewhere to eat she said 
the event has its detractors some bird experts argue that 
migrating animals dont make or keep appointments 
march 19 is a day people chose and im not sure the swallows 
are aware of it said gerald collier a san diego state 
university orinthologist they do come around the beginning of 
spring 
he also points out that there are between 50 million and 100 
million cliff swallows in the wild so 1500 come to san juan 
capistrano he said where are all the rest 
some swallows will go to a shopping mall in nearby mission 
viejo where nests from last year await them under the eaves of a 
department store 
hershey gehris the malls general manager recalls a different 
attitude towards cliff swallows in campbell calif 
they used to fight them more than here gehris said they 
do things to your clothes that make you a little upset and they do 
marvelous things to the paint job on your car 
i think theyre neat around here he adds but i dont 
think id want them around all the time

some homes these days go begging for a buyer 
but the reason has nothing to do with high prices or rising 
interest rates 
a new sales gimmick allows prospective home buyers to drive up 
to a house tune their car radio to an am frequency and hear the 
lowdown on closets bedrooms and that unseen swimming pool out 
back without getting out of the car 
the device has a range of about 150 feet and a tape that plays 
for a couple minutes 
robin stella a vice president at robert stone inc real estate 
agency said friday her company began using the talking house 
device three months ago and sales this year are up 43 percent 
ms stella said the device deserves at least some credit for the 
boost 
the devices are used primarily to sell houses but its 
manufacturer realty electronics in fond du lac wis said other 
applications are being discovered 
we certainly envision a time when they are very common that 
you pull up to a bank and hear about their interest rates that you 
go to a drivein restaurant and hear about the specials said 
scott matthew vice president 
already some of the 10000 devices sold have gone to car washes 
with long lines that use it to peddle their waxes 
car dealers closed on sunday employ it to entice buyers who go 
window shopping a shopping mall in ohio is using it to advertise 
markdowns 
the inspiration came from disney amusement parks where visitors 
tune their radios to a certain frequency to find out more about the 
attractions matthew said

student at nearby plymouthsalem high school who also takes classes 
at plymouthcanton 
singler who doesnt align himself with either group added 
with the police here its just making things worse things would 
have died down naturally but now something might happen sometime 
in the future

its over discrimination of one group over another he said 
the burnouts feel the jocks receive preferential treatment from 
some administrators and faculty members he said

saying we feel we should be treated with the same courtesy as 
other peer and social groups we believe youre taking the jocks 
side over the pit issue

abu shaban has represented several gazans in appeals to the 
israeli supreme court tel aviv university professors and the 
leftwing citizens rights movement sent a telegram to defense 
minister yitzhak rabin demanding abu shabans release

subversive activities but israeli liberals contended he was picked 
up because of his participation in the tel aviv gathering 
its devastating to believe that people cannot talk freely on 
our campus university professor moshe shaked said on israel 
radio 
four arab journalists also were detained according to arab 
reports 
chief of staff shomron said israeli leaders should open peace 
talks even before calm returns he said demonstrations could be 
ended immediately if the army ordered soldiers to open fire on

if someone wants to achieve calm at the cost of ordering the 
army to go against the basic norms of the israeli army he 
said then it will have to be without me

the customs service has donated about 20 
million in clothing to three african nations through an agreement 
with the agency for international development officials said 
thursday 
the agreement signed by customs commissioner william von raab 
and aid administrator alan woods establishes a permanent program 
allowing the transfer of seized textile merchandise for 
humanitarian distribution 
this is a true case of government triumphing over its own 
bureaucracy said von raab noting that it benefits more than 
the egos of government officials someone will actually benefit 
from this 
previously customs had no recourse but to spend hundreds of 
thousands of taxpayers dollars to destroy this clothing von 
raab said 
a major shipment of clothing was seized after the peoples 
republic of china alerted customs that counterfeit documents were 
being used to bring the items into the country 
the clothing includes cotton jeans shirts dresses denim 
jackets and infants cotton shirts manufactured in china 
aid will turn the clothing over to world vision relief 
organization and the adventist development and relief agency for 
distribution in mozambique malawi and zimbabwe where it is 
expected to clothe 20000 children

three powerful senate chairmen and the senate 
democratic leader agreed friday to seek to amend the arms treaty 
signed by president reagan and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev in a 
way that would limit future presidents ability to reinterpret the 
accord 
the administration immediately denounced the move 
under the amendment interpretations of the intermediate nuclear 
forces treaty by president reagan and his sucessors in the white 
house would be based not just on the treaty text but on the full 
record of senate ratification hearings 
the condition would be attached to prevent the a recurrence of 
what many senators have charged is reagans overly broad 
interpretation of the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty 
that interpretation has been used to justify testing and 
development of reagans strategic defense initiative often called 
star wars 
congressional sources speaking on condition of anonymity said 
the decision to attach the condition to prevent future broad 
interpretations of the inf pact was made at a luncheon by the 
four leading senators 
they are majority leader robert byrd of west virginia foreign 
relations chairman claiborne pell of rhode island armed services 
chairman sam nunn of georgia and intelligence committee cochairman 
david boren 
the original author of the proposal was sen joseph biden ddel 
their condition will be presented to the foreign relations panel 
during consideration of the treaty next week the sources said 
the inf signed by reagan and gorbachev in december would 
eliminate all landbased missiles with ranges between 300 and 3125 
miles and has been hailed by most senators of both parties as an 
important step forward in arms control 
ratification by the required twothirds of the senate is 
expected but the attachments of conditions opposed by the 
administration would be a complicating factor 
in a commentary attached to the proposed amendment the senators 
have said their purpose was not to resolve the dispute over the abm 
treaty 
rather the provision is intended to reaffirm certain 
constitutional principles which have been brought into question 
during the reinterpretation debate the commentary said 
in that debate many democrats have argued that the abm treaty 
as outlined during the ratification hearings in 1972 prevents much 
star wars testing and development the administration has asserted 
that its interpretation based on the text and the record of 
negotiations with the soviets permits star wars development 
the white house meanwhile in a letter to sen richard lugar 
rind a member of the foreign relations panel reiterated its 
opposition to attaching conditions to the inf treaty 
the letter signed by arthur b culvahouse counsel to the 
president and sent to lugar on thursday said the resolution is 
seriously flawed 
he acknowledged that for domestic purposes a president would 
adhere to an interpretation generally agreed to by the senate but 
he said the proposed amendment would go too far by binding an 
administration to all statements made by official of the 
executive branch during ratification proceedings 
these would include answers to over 1000 questions submitted 
by members of the senate no matter how trivial or how unimportant 
the issue addressed may be to the senates advice and consent 
deliberations 
the result might be two inf treaties one binding domestically 
against the president and a second one binding internationally 
between the united states and the soviet union culvahouse said 
he said the differences will favor the soviet union because 
the soviet union is not and cannot be bound by our domestic 
processes 
the proposal only serves the interests of confusion 
ambiguity confrontation and uncertainty he said

backers of former state school 
superintendent carolyn warner filed petitions friday to put her on 
the recall election ballot against impeached gov evan mecham 
setting up a possible sevenway race in the may 17 vote 
more than 100 people took out petitions to run against the 
firstterm republican governor but only six came back with 
signatures as fridays filing deadline passed 
backers of mrs warner a democrat who lost to mecham in 1986 
filed what they said were about 6500 signatures well over the 
total of 3336 valid signatures required 
backers of acting gov rose mofford another democrat and two 
republican hopefuls party national committeeman jack londen and 
former congressman john rhodes submitted signatures thursday 
mecham is automatically on the ballot unless the senates 
impeachment trial ends before then with a vote to bar him from 
public office 
two lesserknown candidates one a realestate broker with 
little political experience and the other a member of the socialist 
workers party also filed under the deadline 
under state law the highest vote total wins the recall 
election even if it is less than a majority political 
affiliations are not indicated on the ballot 
mecham was elected on his fifth try in a race against mrs 
warner and a democrat running as an independent bill schulz 
several candidates have said that a large number of candidates 
in the may 17 election would boost mechams chances of retaining 
office 
state law requires that mrs mofford who was elected secretary 
of state in 1986 and became acting governor when mecham was 
impeached last month resign both posts if she is to campaign 
openly for the governors job 
she has declined to say whether she would resign and run 
actively 
warner campaign spokesman dave bolger said mrs warner would not 
run if mrs mofford declared she would campaign actively 
on the republican side londen vowed to drop out if mechams 
senate impeachment trial results in acquittal rhodes said he would 
stay in the race regardless of the outcome of the trial which 
wound up its third week friday 
mecham is charged with obstructing justice concealing a 
350000 campaign loan and loaning 80000 in state money to his 
auto dealership 
the other two candidates filing petitions were tempe realestate 
broker john c oertle sr and and socialist workers party candidate

the soldiers who left fort ord for 
honduras are members of the 7th light infantry division designed 
for quick airlifts to any part of the world on short notice 
some members of the socalled bayonet division have been trained 
in warfare in saudi arabia the sinai desert korea panama and 
honduras 
in october 1985 the 7th was incorporated into the militarys 
rapid deployment force and became the armys first modern light 
division it is one of four light infantry divisions in the army 
the others are based in hawaii alaska and new york 
a light infantry division is designed for low to 
midintensity combat said capt guy shields fort ord spokesman 
shields said the entire fort ord division of 11400 soldiers can 
be moved in less than six days a description of the 7th light 
issued by fort ord says initial combat elements can be in a 
potential crisis area in less than 18 hours 
the description also calls the 7th light an offensively 
oriented highly responsive combat division deployable three times 
faster than existing infantry divisions 
the units at fort ord consist of nine infantry battalions they 
have fewer vehicles less equipment and fewer soldiers than 
standard infantry divisions and thus are able to move faster in 
500 airlifts instead of about 1200 
in march 1986 200 fort ord soldiers were sent to honduras for 
us and honduran military exercises known as big pine they were 
stationed near the nicaraguan border about 100 miles from the site 
of skirmishes between the nicaraguan army and the contras and 
practiced troop deployment 
the fort ord troops brought some vehicles and personal weapons 
such as m16a1 rifles and sidearms but were cautioned to avoid any 
real combat 
in march 1987 750 soldiers from the division were sent to 
honduras for several weeks of field exercises with honduran troops

honduras asked for us help friday in 
ferrying honduran troops to the scene of their battle with 
sandinista forces administration sources said adding that the 
request was likely to be approved 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
government of honduras asked the united states for helicopter 
support in moving some additional honduran troops to an area within 
about 20 miles of the border of nicaragua where the fighting has 
been going on 
the cable came in to the state department today but no 
decision has been made as yet said an official who asked not to 
be identified 
but another official said i cant imagine that we would turn 
it down weve done it before 
in december 1986 40 us helicopters were used to ferry 
honduran troops and equipment to the nicaraguan border to repel a 
nicaraguan attack on contra rebel camps on honduran soil the 
transported 700 honduran soldiers to the front after honduran 
president jose azcona asked for the aid no americans became 
involved in comba 
the sources said a response to honduras would probably come over 
the weekend they said the honduras were not planning to move a 
large number of troops but they declined to give a number they 
said the united states has sufficient transport helicopters in 
honduras to do the job 
the sources said that they would be following the same type of 
rules as in l986 when they did this in that us personnel and 
equipment would stay well away from the scene of fighting to ensure 
they were not exposed to hostile fire 
the request came as us troops continued to arrive in honduras 
in a show of force and a bipartisan group of 11 senators proposed 
a 48 million package of new aid to nicaraguas contra rebels 
including renewed authority for the cia to deliver previously 
stockpiled weapons 
assistant secretary of state elliott abrams said earlier that 
additional assistance was being discussed with honduran president 
jose azcona in response to a reported nicaraguan incursion 
white house chief of staff howard baker said president reagan 
would give most careful consideration to any request from 
honduras for troops to help repel nicaraguan forces although he 
reiterated that us troops were not expected to be involved in any 
military operation in the region 
one of the senates leading peace advocates sen mark o 
hatfield said the sending of us troops amounted merely to 
matching stupidity with stupidity and introduced legislation 
barring the troops from a combat role without permission from 
congress 
sponsors of the new contra aid proposal said they hoped it would 
revive negotiations in congress and with the reagan administration 
on an aid package that could be quickly enacted to replace supplies 
lost or expended during the past weeks heavy fighting along the 
nicaraguanhonduran border 
but the extent of the damage inflicted on the rebels by the 
sandinista incursion remained unclear sen david boren dokla 
chairman of the senate intelligence committee said the nicaraguan 
troops were withdrawing without accomplishing all their objectives 
we think its very important right now to send a signal to the 
sandinista government which allegedly crossed the border into 
honduras in an effort to destroy rebel camps and supplies boren 
said 
sen nancy kassebaum rkan said announcement of the package 
also would strengthen the contras as they enter direct ceasefire 
talks with the managua regime scheduled for monday this is a 
commonsense moderate and reasoned approach she said 
the proposal would use 48 million in unspent pentagon money to 
buy food clothing shelter and medical supplies and to transport 
it to troops in the field over the next year about 3 million of 
that amount would go for communications gear 
but in what promised to be a controversial provision the 
package would allow the cia to airdrop ammunition and weapons 
previously stockpiled by the rebels to troops in the field boren 
said the rebels still have 2 million to 5 million worth of 
undelivered supplies about half of them lethal 
and it would give president reagan the right to hold a quick 
guaranteed vote in congress on any request for further military aid 
under certain conditions if the peace talks between the sandinistas 
and contras break down 
as a carrot the bill also would promise longterm economic 
aid for the region once political stability is restored 
an administration official speaking on condition he not be 
identified said of the new aid package we are encouraged from 
reports we have heard about it but we will have to wait until we 
have the actual details 
action on further aid for the rebels has been stalled since 
march 3 when the house narrowly rejected a 30 million package of 
purely humanitarian aid aid proponents saw the sandinista 
incursion into honduras as a new opportunity to revive interest in 
aid 
meanwhile abrams told reporters that american officials have 
been discussing with honduran president azcona the possibility of 
providing additional assistance to that country in addition to the 
3200 troops already airlifted to palmerola air base near 
tegucigalpa 
there are some other possibilities that weve discussed 
abrams said adding that the possibilities did not include 
additional troops 
baker said that if a request were received from honduras for 
troops to help repel nicaraguan forces it would be most 
carefully considered and most deliberately considered but i cannot 
tell you what decision the president would make under those 
circumstances 
baker interviewed on the syndicated television program john 
mclaughlins one on one was asked at what point us troops 
would enter action 
i dont anticipate that will occur at all i think that the 
honduran forces can handle that on their own and i fully 
anticipate that either the nicaraguans will retire on their own or 
honduras will as they say encourage them to do that but i do not 
expect american troops to be involved in any military operation 
there he said 
hatfields proposal would permit us military exercises in 
honduras like the training mission which began thursday only if 
congress has been notified a month in advance troops could not be 
sent into combat without a declaration of war or a clear and 
present danger of attack on the united states or its citizens it 
also would prohibit any increase in the permanent us military 
presence there 
he said the administrations action amounted to sinking to the 
level of those in nicaragua who have no interest in peace 
under the terms of this legislation we will not allow and will 
not tolerate sending american military personnel into combat in 
central america hatfield said it is not an option we will 
not permit our young people to be used as pawns in this political 
game and we will not push them down the slippery slope of 
intervention as we pushed their fathers and brothers down that 
slope into vietnam

the plo envoy told an emergency general

his mission open if the united states tries to close it 
some diplomats said the world body should consider fighting the 
us government in american courts and provide alternative 
accommodations for the palestine liberation organization on un 
international territory the plo has observer status at the united 
nations 
plo observer zehdi labib terzi and other speakers denounced the 
us justice department decision to close the mission under a new 
antiterrorism act saying the move conflicts with us treaty 
obligations to the united nations the us state department has 
opposed the closure 
the justice department says it will take legal action if the 
mission is not closed by march 21 the effective date of the law 
it is not expected to be closed by monday and litigation is 
expected 
terzi said israel also should be denied its place at the united 
nations if the mission is closed the united nations regards the 
plo as the sole legitimate representative of the palestinian 
people but israel and the united states consider it a terrorist 
organization 
we deem it proper the general assembly should ask the 
secretarygeneral to take all steps including legal steps if 
necessary to ensure the plo observer mission be able to discharge 
its official functions without hindrance terzi said 
it was the second emergency session on the plo issue this month 
and the 159member assembly is to consider draft resolutions 
condemning the us action general assembly resolutions carry the 
moral weight of world opinion but are not binding on the

people who are moderately physically fit 
have a lower risk of dying of a heart attack even if they dont 
exercise a new study shows 
you dont have to be a super athlete you dont have to have 
extraordinary levels of fitness or physical activity to get the 
benefit said one of the studys directors steven blair of the 
institute for aerobics research in dallas 
blair described the study friday during a meeting of the 
american heart association 
the study is one of the first to show that physical fitness as 
measured by the length of time a subject can walk or run on a 
treadmill protects against fatal heart attacks even in people who 
dont exercise blair said 
physical fitness is a function of past exercise and genetics 
blair said some people are simply born more fit than others blair 
said 
it is widely accepted that exercise or other forms of physical 
activity protect against heart disease and many studies have shown 
that the protection extends even to those who engage in only 
moderate physical activity 
this study of 3120 women and 10226 men who came to the cooper 
clinic in dallas for preventative health exams extends that 
observation to physical fitness itself 
blairs institute and the cooper clinic are both part of the 
aerobics center founded by dr kenneth cooper to encourage 
exercise and physical fitness the institute is the research arm of 
the aerobics center 
blair and his collaborator harold kohl iii found that men in 
the bottom 20 percent when ranked by physical fitness were twice as 
likely as the others to die of a heart attack 
women in the bottom 20 percent had 28 times the risk of other 
women 
the conclusions that can be reached by the study are limited by 
the fact that the subjects were not a representative sample of the 
american population blair said 
eighty percent were college graduates they were virtually all 
white and they were largely welltodo he said 
in a standard treadmill test a physically fit 40yearold man 
might be able to exercise for 20 or 25 minutes blair said a 
champion athlete could last more than half an hour and people who 
are not fit can become exhausted much sooner

the army on friday began moving 
2000 soldiers to border jungles it says nicaraguan troops have 
penetrated and president jose azcona hoyo said he was depending on 
us support to fend off agression from nicaragua 
reagan administration sources said friday that honduras had 
asked for us help in transporting the troops to the border area 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the request 
for helicopter support would probably be approved 
honduras said the nicaraguans crossed the border in pursuit of 
usbacked contra rebels and a ranking officer said friday that 
about 1000 of the soldiers remained on honduran territory 
at a news conference friday azcona said the us deployment of 
more than 3000 troops in honduras was a warning and he would ask 
for more us help if the leftist nicaraguan government didnt 
withdraw its troops 
the us embassy said about 800 american paratroopers the last 
of the 3200 troops sent to honduras were dropped onto palmerola 
air base friday the defense department says the troops will be in 
central america about 10 days 
azcona said his own troops will keep bombing sandinista 
positions if the nicaraguans do not withdraw 
we are preparing an operation to bomb inside honduran 
territory he said the day after an air raid in the bocay region 
azcona said he decided to ask for us troops because their 
arrival would be spectacular he said he expected the simple 
presence and immediate response of us troops would scare the 
sandinista troops into withdrawing 
the united states helped honduras move troops to the border in 
december 1986 after nicaraguan forces attacked contra rebel camps 
in honduras forty us helicopters transported 700 honduran 
soldiers to the front no americans were involved in combat 
the reagan administration sources said that if the request for 
helicopter support was granted us personnel would stay away from 
any fighting 
nicaragua has denied its troops entered honduras but a 
nicaraguan military source indicated friday that they had 
the 60yearold azcona said honduran infantry was moving into 
the mountainous bocay region and should be in position by saturday 
were acting with complete calm the sandinistas only have to 
leave our territory azcona told a news conference 
the honduran officer who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
two infantry battalions totaling from 1600 to 2000 soldiers were 
moving in from a base at juticalpa about 90 miles west of bocay 
he said warplanes were on call from tamara air base 15 miles north 
of tegucigalpa 
the officer said soldiers had orders to expel invading 
troops by whatever means necessary adding that about half the 
original force had fled back to nicaragua and about 1000 remained 
he said the remaining sandinista troops were spread over an area 
about 40 miles square 
pentagon officials said privately the four us battalions from 
the 82nd airborne and 7th light infantry would spend eight or nine 
days training with hondurans in different parts of the country 
one battalion of the 82nd airborne will be at juticalpa one 
official said but anyone who knows the country would realize 
the 90 miles might as well be 4000 theres nothing but 
mountains and jungle in between 
the basic order that these troops arent to get near the 
fighting still stands he said 
president daniel ortega of nicaragua said thursday his soldiers 
were ready to combat and liquidate the 82nd airborne and would 
continue the offensive against contra rebels in an area reaching 
from central nicaragua to the border 
alejandro bendana secretarygeneral of nicaraguas foreign 
ministry said one step could lead to another in the border 
conflict indicating war might result 
the contras have had secret bases in honduras from which to 
attack across the border in their 6yearold battle with the 
sandinistas 
nicaraguas northern military headquarters is in san andres de 
bocay near the frontier and honduran warplanes flew raids in the 
area thursday hours after us troops began arriving 
azcona said the planes fired rockets on a dirt airstrip in 
honduras used by nicaraguan helicopters he would not confirm 
us reports that a sovietmade helicopter was destroyed the 
sandinistas denied it 
reporters flown from nicaragua to san andres de bocay saw two 
unidentified jets fly in from honduras thursday and drop at least 
five bombs near the border

president reagan would give most careful 
consideration to any request from honduras for us troops to 
assist in repelling nicaraguan forces white house chief of staff 
howard h baker jr said friday 
interviewed on the television program john mclaughlins one 
on one baker said however that he does not expect us troops 
to be used in any military engagements in the region 
the presidential aide defended reagans decision to send us 
troops into the area and denied that the united states had put 
pressure on the honduran government to request them 
he said the president made the decision in the second floor of 
the residence portion of the white house a minute after 800 on 
wednesday evening after receiving a request from honduran 
president jose azcona 
i do not believe there was any effort any armtwisting to 
try to contrive a situation where he would make this request 
baker said i think it was made for the reason stated in this 
letter his country was invaded and that he wanted help 
interviewer john mclaughlin asked baker what the president would 
do if azcona asked him to have us troops join honduran troops 
in combat to repel the invaders 
no such request has been received i do not believe such a 
request will be received baker said but were it received to 
answer your hypothetical question were it to be received it would 
be most carefully considered and most deliberately considered but 
i cannot tell you what decision the president would make under 
those circumstances 
when asked at what point us troops would enter action baker 
said i dont anticipate that will occur at all i think that the 
honduran forces can handle that on their own and i fully 
anticipate that either the nicaraguans will retire on their own or 
honduras will as they say encourage them to do that but i do not 
expect american troops to be involved in any military operation 
there 
baker rejected suggestions that the administration had raised 
the alarm about the nicaraguan border crossing in order to 
strengthen its hand in seeking renewed assistance from congress for 
rebels fighting nicaraguas marxistled government 
it was not our design he said it did not work that way 
and we did not want it that way 
in fact baker said he thinks prospects for an agreement on aid 
to the rebels were better on tuesday before the crisis arose than 
they are now 
i think we were on the brink of that until this incursion 
occurred and until we received this request from azcona he 
said after that theres dust in the air and fur flying and 
clearly we are not better off now than we were before 
he also said however that he believes the prospects will 
improve again after the dust settles and people think about it 
and understand whats happened and stop imputing bad motives to 
this administration and this president 
but if that was our design it was the dumbest legislative 
strategy ever devised because it hasnt worked that way he said 
the program was taped for weekend broadcast and a transcript 
was distributed for release on friday 
on other subjects baker said 
that when he went to panama as senate republican leader during 
the debate on the panama canal treaties gen manuel antonio 
noriega who was then the panamanian intelligence chief threatened 
in a conversation to blow up the canal if the treaties were not 
ratified he said omar torrijos then the panamanian strongman 
told him look noriegas sort of a hothead dont pay any 
attention to him 
but baker said the administration which is putting pressure on 
noriega to step down has not had direct contact with the 
panamanian leader he was asked about reports that noriega wants 
direct contacts with the united states but that the united states 
will not agree to those talks until he agrees to leave panama 
there have been some contacts that would appear to be from 
gen noriega or on his behalf but thats all i can tell you 
they purport to be queries by on gen noriegas part but we 
have not had direct contact with gen noriega baker said 
baker made his remarks before other administration officials 
revealed late friday that a us envoy has gone to panama at 
noriegas request to discuss terms of his possible departure 
on possible pardons for individuals indicted in the irancontra 
affair the presidents simply not going to address that 
question the president has the constitutional pardoning authority 
but hes said over and over this is not the time and its not the 
circumstance in which to consider that 
he does not expect vice president george bush assuming bush is 
the republican presidential nominee to ask him to be his running 
mate i think he needs to go to a governor perhaps someone who 
can bring about a balance to the ticket he said possibilities 
would include govs george deukmejian of california tom kean of 
new jersey and former govs lamar alexander of tennessee and 
richard thornburgh of pennsylvania

soviets who earn 3200 or more a month working in 
a cooperative operating outside state control will have to pay more 
than half the money back in taxes and even as much as 90 percent 
izvestia said friday 
the government newspaper outlined progressive income taxes for 
members of cooperatives that it said will go into effect april 1 
taxes will remain low for the cooperatives themselves but 
income taxes for those who earn more than 500 rubles 800 a month 
from working in the cooperatives will climb steeply according to 
an interview izvestia conducted with finance ministry official y 
zemskov 
zemskov said taxes will be increased on high salaries because 
cooperatives in those cases are paying out in salaries what the 
government would like them to spend improving and expanding their 
services 
under mikhail s gorbachevs reforms soviets can get permission 
to form cooperatives to produce goods and provide services outside 
the staterun economy the cooperatives must be approved by local 
governments but otherwise operate outside state control 
the tax rate now is between 2 percent and 3 percent for 
cooperatives in their first year and up to 10 percent after their 
third year 
taxes of cooperative members will start going up sharply after 
an income of 500 rubles a month zemskov said the tax on an income 
of 1000 rubles 1600 will be 27020 rubles and on an income of 
2000 rubles 3200 will be 535 percent 
he said the tax eventually reaches 90 percent but did not say 
what the income threshold was for that tax 
zemskov said local governments will be allowed to keep the money 
levied in income taxes on cooperatives to provide them with an 
incentive to help cooperatives develop

crew members of a hightech 28foot rowboat that 
crossed the treacherous strait between south america and antarctica 
said friday they encountered squalls that tossed three of them into 
the turbulent sea 
why did we do it said jay morrison 34 because nobody 
had ever done it before thats a pretty good reason 
rowing most of the way morrison and three colleagues crossed 
the stormy drake passage between tierra del fuego the southern tip 
of south america and antactica in a 600mile voyage that ended 
march 7 
you should see what its like to try to walk on land after 
being thrown around at sea for 12 days said ned gillette who 
organized the voyage and led an similar expedition last year that 
was scuttled by ice 
until we made it we werent really sure it could be done 
said gillette of stowe vt i didnt think wed expire on the 
trip but i didnt know where wed end up 
the expedition in the 17000 red boat jokingly dubbed the sea 
tomato mixed raw adventure with hightechnology precision the 
expedition was financed by corporate sponsors 
while crew members bailed flooded cabins and rowed the boat 
through 100foot swells a massachusetts weather station each day 
fed the expedition forecasts and the boats location was tracked 
by satellite 
after waiting nearly a month for proper weather the expedition 
almost ended in disaster off the chilean coast feb 22 just hours 
after leaving under sail 
a heavy squall erupted and swamped the craft sending gillette 
overboard gillette an experienced moutaineer was saved by a line 
fastened to the boat as were two other crew members who were 
washed overboard later in the trip 
three days out the crew took down the sails and began rowing in 
shifts sometimes all night they went about 26 mph on average or 
about as fast as a person walks 
sometimes an albatross would land alongside said gillette 
it would paddle along and watch us we would outdistance it 
sometimes 
the team brought provisions for 25 days we didnt know how 
long wed be out said gillette there was a lot of 
uncertainty 
the sea tomato stripped of some expensive equipment now rests 
on king george island in antarctica as a gift to the chilean 
government 
i kind of hope they leave it there said gillette it did 
its job to get us there it would be fitting it keep it there

the mayor and the communist party chief of a city 
in azerbaijan where at least 32 people died in ethnic rioting were 
fired thursday reports from soviet armenia said 
those dismissed were said to be the mayor and communist party 
chief of sumgait azerbaijan where riots broke out feb 28 between 
azerbaijanis and ethnic armenians 
in another development the editor of glasnost magazine reported 
a police raid thursday he said was linked to the publications 
coverage of ethnic violence in armenia and neighboring azerbaijan 
sergei grigoryants a former political prisoner and editor of 
glasnost said six carloads of police descended on the office in 
kratovo a town about 15 miles southeast of moscow 
he said by telephone that uniformed and plainclothes officers 
spent more than two hours checking editors papers and taking 
photographs 
grigoryants said they wanted to search the office but did not 
have a warrant the five editors present would not let police into 
the back half of the office where editorial work is done he said 
the house was completely surrounded by police cars 
grigoryants said adding that many police were involved he said 
they did not detain anyone or take anything from the office 
grigoryants founded glasnost named for soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachevs policy of more openness last june and has 
unsuccessfully sought official approval for it 
gamlet kocharyan a member of the governing council of the 
kafar armenia said by telephone the dismissals at sumgait were 
announced in a television broadcast from yerevan capital of the 
armenian republic 
armenian activists say the victims in sumgait were armenians 
killed by azeris the dominant group in neighboring azerbaijan 
most azeris are shiite moslems and armenians are predominantly 
christian 
unrest in the southern republics began with armenian 
demonstrations pressing for nagornokarabakh an area of azerbaijan 
that has an armenian majority to be annexed by armenia 
kocharyan identified the men fired as muslim zade communist 
party chief in sumgait and mayor tavakkula yagub ogly mamedov 
the report said they would be replaced by the premier of the 
nakhichevansky autonomous republic in azerbaijan and a factory 
manager from sumgait according to kocharyan 
baku radio reported earlier that mamedov was fired for serious 
shortcomings in the work of maintaining appropriate law and order 
and discipline in the city and for the lack of political foresight 
he has shown which has resulted in tragic consequences 
the television report also said a commission had been formed to 
search for witnesses to the rioting in sumgait kocharyan said 
grigoryants is armenian and has reported regularly to western 
correspondents in moscow about the ethnic unrest in armenia and 
azerbaijan 
he traveled to yerevan to witness a memorial procession march 8 
for those killed in sumgait he and fellow editor andrei shelkov 
who went to sumgait held a news conference last friday for foreign 
journalists who have not been permitted to visit the area 
according to grigoryants the police visit to the glasnost 
offices was undoubtedly part of a campaign of reprisals against 
him 
on saturday shelkov was attacked on a moscow trolley bus by a 
person who could not be identified grigoryants said 
official soviet media have criticized grigoryants police made 
two raids in august on the editorial office but did not take 
anything or arrest anyone 
in october police confiscated about 70 copies they said were 
printed illegally on stateowned equipment

a former wedtech corp executive testified 
friday that he was told attorney general edwin meese iii interceded 
with the pentagon on the defense contractors behalf over a 24 
million navy contract 
the allegation came at the racketeering trial of rep mario 
biaggi and six others charged in a series of bribery and influence 
peddling schemes involving wedtech 
the governments first witness exwedtech official mario 
moreno said he met with a close friend of meese san francisco 
lawyer e robert wallach in december 1983 meese at the time was 
presidential counselor 
moreno said wedtech had been notified it would be awarded the 
less lucrative part of a navy contract to build bridge pontoons 
and he asked wallach to get meese to change the navys mind 
moreno said wallach told him mr meese said he would talk to 
mr weinberger referring to thendefense secretary caspar 
weinberger moreno testified that he understood weinberger would 
call thennavy secretary john lehman 
moreno said that in january 1984 wedtech received approval 
making it eligible for the entire pontoon contract which it signed 
in april 1984 
moreno first described meeses alleged intervention in an 
affidavit disclosed in october at a senate hearing at the time 
meese and weinberger said through spokesmen they had no 
recollection of the action described by moreno 
moreno previously testified at the wedtech trial that wallach 
told him that meese had also interceded on wedtechs behalf with 
the commerce department over a federal financing package 
wedtech a 100 millionayear defense contractor before 
declaring bankruptcy in 1986 grew from a small new york machine 
shop through a series of nobid defense contracts prosecutors 
claim wedtech falsely portrtayed itself as a minority company to 
get contracts 
wallach meeses former personal lawyer is under indictment on 
charges of taking bribes from wedtech officials for trying to 
influence meese and others 
in december a special prosecutor in washington said there was 
insufficient evidence to charge meese in the wedtech case 
moreno is one of four exwedtech officials who have pleaded 
guilty to bribing public officials and to other crimes

the united states and honduras told the 
security council friday that nicaraguan troops had invaded 
honduras nicaragua claimed the sending of us troops to honduras 
signaled a plot for direct us military action against nicaragua 
nicaraguan envoy rita delia casco denied sandinista troops 
entered honduran territory what they have said is mere lies 
said ms casco the foreign ministrys director of international 
organizations 
we nicaraguans cant withdraw from nicaragua she told a 
news conference after the emergency session ended the military 
actions we have taken are limited to the defense of our territory 
and sovereignty 
the council adjourned without a resolution or a vote and was to 
decide whether to resume discussions at some future date 
nicaraguas sandinista government had asked for the meeting to 
protest the sending of 3200 us military personnel to honduras 
thursday and friday 
ms casco said a us congressional delegation was welcome to 
visit nicaragua and would be escorted to key border areas to see 
the situation 
after denouncing the united states in an address to the council 
ms casco shook hands and chatted with us ambassador herbert s 
okun who had accused nicaragua of invading honduras and rejecting 
democracy 
okun deputy chief of the us mission said sending us troops 
for military exercises in honduras was a measured response 
requested by the honduran government 
the us force does not constitute either a threat or the use 
of force against nicaragua he said 
okun also claimed the santinistas were trying to destroy 
usbacked rebels known as contras and stifle democratic debate 
many of the rebels operate from bases in honduras which borders 
nicaragua 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar is considering a 
nicaraguan request to send a factfinding mission coordinated with 
the organization of american states to the nicaraguanhonduran 
border 
honduran ambassador jorge ramon hernandez told the council if 
nicaragua withdraws the troops which even today are in honduras 
that would be proof of its commitment to peace 
we denounce this invasion as the expansionistic aggressive 
attitude of nicaragua not only to my country but to others it is 
trying to disrupt the whole regional peace process 
he accused nicaragua of launching a broadranging offensive in 
flagrant violation of honduran territorial integrity and said 
honduras had requested us assistance 
ms casco claimed the reagan administration created an 
artificial crisis and was out to justify direct military action 
against nicaragua 
okun said sending the troops was a measured response designed 
to show our staunch support for the democratic government of 
honduras at a time when its territorial integrity is being violated 
by the sandinista army 
he said the us troops would be involved in exercises away from 
the area of border hostilities 
ms casco told the council washington wants to sabotage central 
american ceasefire talks and the peace plan signed in august by 
the presidents of five central american countries the plan calls 
for an end to outside aid to insurgents 
this is a crisis artificially created by the us 
administration in its design to find justification for the

a father told police he stuffed his 
newborn baby into a toilet and later threw him into a lake but 
authorities concluded the child had died in the womb and said no 
murder charges will be filed 
however the case has prompted several tips about pregnant women 
whose newborns have vanished and detectives are opening 
investigations into three cases as a result said tarrant county 
sheriffs detective wayne boggus

acquaintance of the mother authorities said the acquaintance

nightmare said boggus the father said he found the baby dead 
and he put the body in a bag with heavy rocks and tossed it into 
lake boggus said 
the mans wife still weak did not knew what was in the bag 
the man said it was two weeks before he told her what he did with 
the baby authorities said 
the only explanation we got from him was that he freaked 
out boggus said he said he almost fainted himself i assume

government radio condemned border air 
raids by honduras which it said struck inside nicaragua and 
exhorted listeners friday against american imperialism and the 
threat of military intervention 
a headline in barricada the sandinista newspaper said the 
order of the day intensify combat 
honduras said the raids thursday were confined to its own 
territory aimed at nicaraguan soldiers it said crossed the 
frontier the day before in pursuit of rebels known as contras 
reagan administration officials said a nicaraguan helicopter was 
destroyed in the raid but nicaragua denied it 
however a defense ministry spokesman said friday that rebel 
antiaircraft fire hit a sandinista helicopter thursday near san 
andres de bocay the region bombed by honduras he did not not 
elaborate 
later friday maj rosa pasos the chief defense ministry 
spokeswoman called the associated press to deny any helicopter had 
been hit in the region 
the sandinista government continued with plans for ceasefire 
talks with the contras next monday but the ussupported rebels 
were considering a boycott 
ceasefires in the regions civil wars and a ban on the use of 
one countrys territory for attacks on another are provisions of 
the peace plan signed aug 7 by the five central american 
presidents 
nicaragua said it had called off its offensive to drive contras 
from camps along the honduran border wednesday but was maintaining 
combat positions 
although the defense ministry said none of the soldiers entered 
honduras a nicaraguan military source indicated privately that 
they had 
honduran officials and the reagan administration say sandinista 
soldiers crossed the rugged illdefined border about 175 miles 
from managua 
on thursday the united states started flying 3200 soldiers of 
the 82nd airborne division and 7th light infantry to honduras in a 
show of support defense secretary said they would be on a training 
exercise there for 10 days but would stay out of combat 
president daniel ortega said nicaraguan troops would take on the 
americans if necessary 
he hedged the question of whether nicaraguan soldiers crossed 
the coco river in the isolated northern region as he has when 
previous incursions were reported 
here the question is not if army troops penetrated honduran 
territory or not but that we have dozens of camps of mercenary 
forces in honduran territory tolerated by the honduran 
government he said thursday 
journalists taken to the area earlier thursday saw and felt a 
bomb explode at the confluence of the bocay and coco rivers lt 
col javier carrion commander of the offensive against the 
contras said two bombs fell in nicaraguan territory and one on the 
honduran side 
carrion told reporters in a jungle clearing at san andres de 
bocay that 4500 soldiers were involved in the sweep through an 
area running from central nicaragua to the frontier he said they 
had air support from sovietsupplied helicopter gunships and an26 
propellerdriven planes carrying bombs 
he said sandinista troops had killed 92 contras and wounded 300 
at the cost of 34 soldiers dead and 68 wounded 
the colonel said the purpose was to destroy contra bases in the 
border area which is about 40 miles from an important mining 
region the rebels attacked in december 
the defense ministry said 17 soldiers and 15 rebels were killed 
between tuesday and friday in fighting in the central province of 
matagalpa in zelaya on the caribbean coast and jinotega where san 
andres de bocay is located 
civilian sources who spoke on condition of anonymity for 
security reasons said 17 soldiers were killed and eight wounded in 
two clashes friday in the central province of chontales six rebels 
were killed they said 
honduras said about 2000 nicaraguan soldiers crossed the 
border and a highranking military officer said about half of them 
still were there friday

the government controlled by gen 
manuel antonio noriega declared a state of emergency throughout 
panama friday but the opposition responded with a call for an 
indefinite general strike 
the emergency decree appeared aimed at forcing reopening of 
banks and other businesses closed for three weeks during an 
economic and political crisis that has brought panama to the brink 
of bankruptcy 
in washington sources in the reagan administration said william 
walker a deputy assistant secretary of state for latin american 
affairs had gone to panama to discuss possible terms for the 
military strongmans departure 
one official who spoke on condition he remain anonymous said 
walker would tell noriega the united states will not seek his 
extradition on drug trafficking charges if he seeks asylum in a 
third country noriega says he is innocent of all charges 
spain has been mentioned as a possible place of refuge for 
noriega 
fridays emergency decree technically called a state of 
urgency by panamas constitution permits the government to 
suspend a wide range of civil liberties including freedom of 
speech and assembly and the right to private property it was seen 
however more as a maneuver to get the banks to reopen 
the national civic crusade a coalition of opposition groups 
seeking noriegas ouster said it was calling a general strike as 
of monday to put a halt to the catastrophic national situation 
aurelio barria foremost leader of the crusade also 
acknowledged receiving a message from noriega through a third party 
seeking a panamanian solution to the crisis 
he and other crusade leaders declined to give details they said 
they would not negotiate with noriega because he is a liar and 
cannot be trusted 
panamas nominal civilian chief of state manuel solis palma 
said friday the government declared the emergency because there 
is a real situation of undeclared war against panama by the 
united states and by political foes at home 
the emergency does not automatically suspend civil rights but 
gives the government the right to do so by decree a government 
spokesman said measures to implement fridays decree will follow 
in due time 
luis h moreno a former member of the national banking 
commission said he was sure the emergency was aimed at forcing 
reopening of the 118 foreign and locally owned banks that make 
panama a major financial center 
he told the associated press i think thats the only reason 
for the decree 
the communique said panama is the object of an attack on its 
economy by the united states in coordination with national 
political groups desperate to grab the government by force 
in other developments friday 
angry dockworkers moved huge blockades across the entrance to 
balboa port near the panama canal to fight off an army takeover by 
troops loyal to noriega 
noriega fired his intelligence chief and four other officers in 
an apparent purge of his fractured defense forces two days after a 
coup attempt against him failed 
the pentagon said panamanian authorities arrested four us 
military police officers in the capital and held them several 
hours the newspaper critica said the americans were carrying 
handguns and military implements when detained in an area 
where daily activities disturbing the public order had occurred 
the government blamed the closing of the banks on the 
arbitrary freezing of funds of the national bank of panama on 
deposit in the united states 
about 50 million in official panamanian funds have been tied up 
in legal actions brought by attorneys for eric arturo delvalle who 
was deposed as president by noriega feb 26 delvalle ousted after 
he tried to fire noriega still is recognized as president by the 
united states 
the united states has cut off all economic and military aid to 
panama and applied other economic sanctions including withholding 
of 65 million in monthly panama canal fees due this week 
panama was last under a state of emergency less than a year ago 
it decreed that emergency on june 10 after the governments foes 
staged demonstrations aimed at noriegas ouster it was lifted on 
june 29 
the next day a pronoriega mob attacked the us embassy in 
panama city stoning it and splashing it with red paint as police 
stood by 
under the state of emergency the government can jail citizens 
indefinitely without formal charge search their homes without 
warrants open their mail and restrict their travel 
moreno said bankers and the banking commission have been trying 
for more than two weeks to reach agreement on a plan to reopen the 
banks which were closed by a government order march 3 many closed 
their doors days earlier fearing a run on deposits 
the problem is one of lack of confidence moreno said 
if the government forces the banks to reopen the banks will not 
have enough cash to cover the demand for withdrawals 
fridays communique also blamed panamanian business groups for 
the economic crisis accusing them of hoarding currency closing 
shops and raising prices 
in washington an administration official speaking on condition 
of anonymity said two panamanian pilots defected to the united 
states thursday he also said noriega received military equipment 
from cuba and money from libya recently he presented no evidence 
and the report could not be confirmed 
the failure of the cashstarved panamanian government to pay its 
workers has led to violent demonstrations 
panamanians lined up at public parks and pay stations friday to 
receive partial payment and bags of food from the government 
at balboa port about a mile outside the panama canal about 300 
striking dockworkers moved carsized containers across the port 
entrance to battle an army takeover ordered thursday by the 
government the men are demanding to get paid 
no vehicles or machinery were passing in or out 
ports at panama city and colon closed monday when dockworkers 
struck the panama canal commission said the shutdowns had no 
effect on its operations 
the military was also ordered to take over electrical water and 
telephone companies airports and several government ministries 
all struck by workers demanding salaries 
in firing the five officers friday noriega gave no reason 
col bernardo barrera had been in charge of intelligence for the 
15000member defense forces which includes panamas military and 
police 
a source close to the defense forces said barrera might have 
been faulted for not knowing in advance of wednesdays coup attempt 
the four american military police arrested thursday night in 
panama city were identified by critica as danny h feltro william 
jerry virts richard and tammy markley 
francisco artola vice president of the opposition national 
authentic party said his radio station in changuinola bocas del 
toro province was raided and closed friday by defense force guards

japanese officials were sitting in their 
embassy studying a major senate trade document while house members 
were forced to wait hours to get their copies an influential 
lawmaker complained thursday 
an irate rep william frenzel rminn told a closeddoor 
caucus of house trade lawmakers he finally obtained a copy of the 
paper by messenger from the japanese as a courtesy three hours 
before it arrived from the senate 
frenzels remarks to house members of a housesenate conference 
committee drafting a sweeping trade bill were confirmed by his 
administrative assistant pat eveland who also handles trade 
legislation for him 
we think it would be nice if the senate would decide to give 
us the trade offer first before the private sector and the press 
she said when asked what frenzel told the caucus his aides said 
the congressman himself was not available to discuss the matter 
the document was a compromise offer from senate members of the 
conference committee it was designed to resolve conflicts between 
house and senate versions of the 1000page trade bill primarily 
sections dealing with unfair practices by the japanese and other 
trading partners 
among other things it contained the senates proposal to erase 
the from the bill the controversial trade plan sponsored by 
democratic presidential hopeful richard a gephardt dmo his 
proposal calling for 10 percent yearly rollbacks in japanese trade 
surpluses is contained only in the house bill 
in place of gephardts plan the senate is proposing its own 
socalled super 301 proposal which would require the us trade 
representative to draw up a list of japanese barriers to american 
products and then either negotiate an end to them or retaliate 
eveland said that she was on the telephone with a japanese 
embassy official early wednesday morning discussing the senates 
offer when to her surprise it became evident that they had a 
copy of it 
she said that she asked the japanese for a copy and that they 
immediately duplicated theirs and sent it by messenger to frenzels 
office on capitol hill she said a version was not available from 
the senate finance committee until 1230 pm wednesday 
just how the japanese managed to obtain the offer remained 
unclear eveland said several copies were distributed to reporters 
who worked late in the senate press gallery on tuesday night 
meanwhile rep tom downey dny said he also was among those 
who were forced to wait and finally had to go out of channels to 
get his copy

canada has begun efforts to deport a dutch 
immigrant convicted in his native land of collaborating with the 
nazis during the german occupation of world war ii 
the office of secretary of state david crombie said thursday it 
has moved to strip jacob luitjens a retired botany teacher at the 
university of british columbia of his canadian citizenship 
luitjens in his late 60s is fighting the attempt in the 
federal court he declined comment to reporters from his home in 
vancouver but five years ago luitjens denied allegations he helped 
round up people resisting nazi rule 
crombies spokesman jocelyn francoeur said full details cannot 
be disclosed because the case is pending in court 
but nazihunter sol littman canadian representative of the 
simon wiesenthal center hailed the governments action as a 
breakthrough in catching up with warcrime suspects who entered 
canada decades ago 
weve been after this guy for years and years he said we 
know the dutch government wanted him very badly 
based on information from witnesses and other sources littman 
alleged that luitjens and his family belonged to the dutch national 
socialist party before the war and that luitjens and his father 
volunteered for the auxiliary police during the nazi occupation 
littman said luitjens was directly involved in the deaths of a 
19yearold member of the dutch underground and a german deserter 
he said that after the war luitjens fled to paraguay and lived 
in a mennonite colony but was tried in his absence by a dutch war 
crimes court in 1948 and convicted of treason 
treason is not an extraditable offense in canada the government 
rejected previous dutch requests for luitjens who emigrated here 
in 1961 and retired from teaching four years ago 
the toronto star quoted justice minister ray hnatyshyn as saying 
that because of the law deportation rather than a trial in 
canada may be the only option available to us 
the government set up a war crimes unit in the justice 
department last year based on the report of a special commission 
headed by judge jules deschenes 
unlike the us office of special investigations canada chose 
to concentrate on trying suspects here rather than deporting or 
extraditing them as deschenes also recommended 
the deschenes report cited 20 cases requiring urgent action and 
an additional 218 in need of further investigation 
under canadian law citizenship can be revoked if it was 
obtained fraudulently or by withholding facts that would have 
disqualified the applicant such as criminal convictions 
even if luitjens loses the citizenship battle he can appeal 
deportation through the courts the law normally requires 
deportation to the country from which a person arrived in this 
case paraguay rather than the netherlands

amoco corp will install steel suspenders on 
its landmark lakeside skyscraper to ensure that the white marble 
facade stays put on blustery days in the windy city an executive 
said thursday 
marble slabs sheathing the worlds fourthtallest building are 
starting to curl or bow after 15 years said shelby pierce amocos 
engineering manager the 275pound slabs are 1inch thick and 
measure 4feet2 by 3feet9 
if the straps dont work amoco may have to strip the stark 
1136foot building near lake michigan of its gleaming facade he 
said 
next week workers will begin installing boltedin stainless 
steel straps 2 inches wide at one corner of the building at a 
minimum cost of 1 million 
were looking at an area where the most severe bows occur the 
southeast corner gets most exposure to sun and thermal cycles and 
heavy wind pierce said its almost like a belt and 
suspenders 
hopefully it wouldnt look like a checkerboard he said 
pierce said the company noticed the problem in 1979 by 
november the condition of the marble began to get worse 
there are two philosophies pierce said one philosophy is 
that as marble bows its an indication of loss of strength 
another philosophy is thats not true 
our particular difficulty is that we have four different 
grades of marble on the building he said 
while workers spend six weeks reinforcing the southeast corner 
engineers will check the rest of the building to see if more 
drastic measures are needed he said

a leftist urban guerrilla group 
says polling places in sundays elections are military 
objectives and is warning people to stay away from them 
the armed forces said guerrillas killed the mayor of a northern 
town on thursday and the governing christian democratic party 
reported a mayoral candidate was kidnapped 
the warning was issued wednesday night by the pedro pablo 
castillo urban command a unit of the peoples revolutionary army 
one of five groups battling the usbacked government 
the five groups united in the farabundo marti national 
liberation front have rejected the legislative and municipal 
elections the rebels insist that peace must be achieved before any 
election is held 
they declared a nationwide ban on transportation as of today in 
an effort to disrupt the voting 
the statement was given to a local television crew that was 
taken blindfolded to a guerrilla safehouse channel 6 broadcast 
part of an interview and provided the associated press with a 
transcript of the rest thursday 
the broadcast did not show the guerrillas 
the defense ministry said this week that about 53000 of its 
56000 troops will be deployed to provide election security 
defense minister gen eugenio vides casanova said his men could 
guarantee secure voting in 244 of the nations 262 municipalities 
the guerrilla document advises people to avoid gathering at 
polling places because due to the presence of troops they 
will be considered military objectives by our units 
it also called on filling stations to stop selling gasoline and 
warned that the ones remaining open will be declared military 
objectives 
the leader of the urban cell known as commander ester told the 
tv crew the urban commando cells are going to take a series of 
actions to repudiate the elections and to repudiate us 
intervention in our country 
the guerrillas recently began urban units and it was not clear 
if the statement covered the one group or the entire guerrilla 
front 
the united states provided almost 600 million in aid to el 
salvador last year more than the amount given any other country in 
the western hemisphere 
at least 65000 people have died since the guerrillas took up 
arms in 1979 
the armed forces press office said guerrillas killed mayor 
sergio romero of azacualpa on thursday it said in a communique 
that the rebels then went to san miguel de mercedes also in 
northern chalatenango province and burned the mayors office and 
the post office 
the christian democrats said mayoral candidate faustino flores 
of coatepeque in santa ana province was kidnapped wednesday night 
the party said guerrilla leaflets were found at flores house 
the guerrilla front says the elections are not legitimate 
because they cannot be free and fair in wartime 
the rebels demand a share of power in return for laying down 
their arms the government rejects this

israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir warned 
american jews on thursday not to compare palestinian protests in 
the occupied territories to a civil rights struggle 
these are another expression of the arab refusal to accept 
israel to coexist with us and to recognize that israel is a 
permanent feature in the region shamir said 
the protesters cry palestine is arab and openly declare 
that all of palestine is theirs shamir told about 1500 members 
of the jewish community at a dedication of a cornerstone for a 
museum commemorating the holocaust 
these are not passive civil rights marches he said 
shamir fresh from his meeting with president reagan secretary 
of state george p shultz and congressional leaders reiterated his 
opposition to an american plan for peace in the middle east that 
calls for an international conference 
shamir his address punctuated by enthusiastic applause said 
the proposal would play into the hands of the soviets and arabs 
who he said are trying to bypass direct talks with israel 
we are for direct negotiations without preconditions for 
open talks at which each side will present its views and claims on 
an equal footing without outside intervention shamir said 
he called on his audience to close ranks behind israel as it 
tries to quell rioting by palestinians on the west bank and the

defense secrtary frank c carlucci said 
thursday he protested to his soviet counterpart nicaraguas alleged 
intrusion into honduras 
carlucci said he and dmitri yazov briefly discussed the 
nicaraguahonduras dispute and that yazov made some attempt to 
defend the sandinista action 
i would not characterize it as a vigorous defense he added 
at a news conference in bern carlucci arrived back in washington 
later thursday 
us troops arrived in honduras on thursday after the united 
states and honduras accused nicaraguan troops of entering the 
country in pursuit of usbacked contra rebels carlucci said he 
had endorsed the decision 
carlucci described the three days of closeddoor talks with 
yazov as cordial and businesslike and said yazov invited him 
to moscow to continue their discussions at a later date 
at a separate news conference yazov termed the discussions the 
first ever business session between us and soviet defense chiefs 
as quite candid and very useful 
carlucci said that of course there were a number of areas of 
disagreement yazov said the kremlin does not harbor any 
illusions about a breakthrough in superpower relations 
the two sides announced agreement that the chairman of the us 
joint chiefs of staff adm william crowe and the soviet chief of 
staff marshal sergei akhromeyev will meet soon to work out 
guidelines to prevent friction between us and soviet forces

fatal shooting by a soviet soldier of us army maj arthur 
nicholson in east germany three years ago 
yazov said the incident occurred before he became defense 
minister last may and was being handled by the foreign ministry 
according to carlucci 
the two sides also discussed the us proposed spacebased 
defense plan and regional conflicts including angola cambodia and 
korea carlucci said 
yazov said in a statement that both sides agreed to hold further 
talks on each others military doctrine and to consider an exchange 
of data

peter simsa is the very model of a 
modern east bloc businessman 
he has his own company a carpeted office where he serves guests 
brandy in snifters and a telephone in his car 
now he has his own lobbying group the first of its kind in the 
east bloc the national association of hungarian entrepreneurs 
the organization of which simsa is president is dedicated to 
promoting small businesses in hungary and representing their 
interests to the government 
under the leadership of communist party chief janos kadar 
hungary in the early 1960s adopted economic policies that 
encouraged some private ownership and enterprise 
the socalled goulash communism gave hungary one of the 
highest standards of living in the sovietled east bloc although 
mounting foreign debt and big moneylosing state enterprises 
recently have bleakened economic prospects 
hungarians were allowed to take second or third jobs such as 
providing services or operating small private shops 
in the late 1970s the government began to allow private 
partnerships and small cooperatives operating as small private 
companies 
what distinguishes them from state cooperatives is that they 
spring from private initiative and are established with private 
capital 
simsas vertikum enterprise was the first such small cooperative 
to come into being in 1979 today he said hungary has 40000 
private businesses which account for more than 15 percent of the 
gross national product 
some 60000 of the 106 million hungarians are engaged in 
private business as their main job and 540000 others work part 
time in the private sector 
originally a department specializing in private entrepreneurs 
was set up in the hungarian chamber of commerce a governmental 
agency 
but increasing private enterprise and a desire for greater 
independence led simsa to seek permission for a separate 
association 
our two basic criteria were that it should be a nationwide 
union and that it should fulfil the aim of representing our 
interests he said 
the government agreed last year to recognize the association 
with the proviso that it be supervised by the chamber of commerce 
simsa stressed that the relationship with the chamber does not 
mean a subordination 
on feb 20 the association held its first general congress and 
in less than a week signed up 1500 members half its precongress 
goal of 3000 members this year 
it was really difficult to foresee how many people had any 
sense of community or entrepreneurial identity simsa said 
the association has attracted interest from other east bloc 
countries izvestia the soviet government newspaper and radio 
prague in czechoslavkia asked for interviews simsa also had talks 
with the us chambers of commerce 
the chief problem is the economic regulation said simsa 
regulators do not take into consideration the specific 
characteristics of our group while officially they say that they 
would like to inspire people to give incentives but in reality 
they are very rigid 
an example he said is the rule that one person can make and 
sell bread but a group of people cannot do the same thing 
there are plans to change this he added in addition to 
fighting regulations the association will strive to make private 
business accepted as partners with the government he said 
now he complained private enterprises often are at the bottom 
of the list when it comes to allocating scarce resources 
private companies are permitted only 30 employees and the 
average size is eight people simsa said 
for a small cooperative the law mandates 15 to 100 cooperative 
members who in turn can hire as many workers as they want a 
typical work force is 100 to 200 
simsa said when it allowed more business the original aim of 
the government was to improve the availability of small service 
such as small shoemakers and shopkeepers 
however in reality these private entrepreneurs dont go into 
this direction where the government wants them to but where there 
is money he said the best market for them is the state 
companies and cooperatives 
so entrepreneurs perform specialized services for the big state 
factories or provide raw or intermediate materials 
simsas vertikum for instance maintains cooling systems and 
strengthens concrete cooling towers and grain elevators he started 
the business with nine workers and 21 today there are 115 coop 
members and employees and the business has 543000 in property 
other entrepreneurs have opened marriage mediation bureaus or 
factories to make medical protheses 
last year hungarys biggest small cooperative had revenues of 
32 million in 1988 it might exceed 43 million

back in 1985 when stocks were still hot stuff 
and destined to become hotter such things as brokerage fees 
foreign cars audiovisual equipment and recreation were among the 
fastgrowing consumer expenditures 
it was a year of big hopes and the stock market was viewed as 
the way to fulfill those hopes brokerage fees in that year rose 54 
percent for example making that category the biggest yeartoyear 
gainer 
the economy was full of big notions many of them generated by 
the bigspending group of baby boomers those born by the 
bundles in the 1950s and now in their 30s and sometimes called 
yuppies they were a driving force 
the spending continued in 1986 when the biggest yeartoyear 
percentage gainer among consumer expenditures was the 97 percent 
for boats followed at 507 percent by recreational vehicles 
those were also years of very low savings rate and strong credit 
use in fact one might safely say that people were too busy 
spending to bother very much about savings 
but something happened early in 1987 and in retrospect it might 
have given a hint of the crash to come in october judging from 
expenditures hopes werent as high mundane practical items moved 
to the fore 
at 115 percent the big gainer was books and maps followed by 
funeral and burial expenses floor coverings hand tools and 
automotive repairs 
to edward yardeni economics director at prudentialbache 
securities the figures reveal more the aging of the baby 
boomers as they move as a demographic wave through the economy 
based on their advancing years he makes a startling forecast 
we predict that over the next five years the personal savings 
rate will rise to 10 percent 
a doubledigit savings rate it has never happened in the united 
states for any prolonged period of time barring the world war ii 
years when there wasnt very much to buy and lots of money to put 
away for the bright days to follow 
yardeni has a point though those low savings and high spending 
rates of the mid1980s reflected the economic activities of an age 
category that traditionally is inclined to big expenditures 
now he observes the yuppies are turning into couch potatoes 
they at least some of them have made their trips and spent 
their money and obtained their material possessions and now they 
want to rest 
instead of running around and looking for things to buy they 
are relaxing they dont go out to eat as often as before but are 
home enjoying the products of their own ovens in a material sense 
theyve got theirs 
as a direct consequence yardeni believes the days of low 
savings rates is over at least for a while last year the savings 
rate of 38 percent was the lowest since 1947 compared with an 8 
percent rate in the 1970s 
the economic implications are fascinating including among other 
things the probability that a lot of folks will start paying off 
their big bills and that plenty of money will be available for 
business investment 
but if people become such economic dullards as a 10 percent 
savings rate would suggest wont the economy almost cease growing 
not so says economist yardeni 
he points out that a rising savings rate doesnt imply a 
reduction in consumption just a slower growth rate as he sees 
it the economy will continue to expand and the implication is 
that the growth will be healthier

polly bergen says her two most recent roles 
as rhoda in war and remembrance and as vivian in the abc movie 
addicted to his love represent the extremes of her personality 
she reprises her role as rhoda in abcs 30hour miniseries war 
and remembrance the sequel to the winds of war it will be 
broadcast next season on abc 
addicted to his love a movie in which a group of women 
swindled by a romantic con artist seek revenge will appear on abc 
next monday 
i loved playing rhoda bergen said i loved her in all her 
weaknesses and shallowness i understood her and cared about her 
thats why i like vivian so much shes so strong she sets up 
the scam to take care of the jerk who ripped them off the funny 
thing is that vivian and rhoda are the two extremes of me people 
see me as having all the strength of vivian but im really as 
frightened as rhoda but i guess im closer to vivian 
when bergen signed for the movie it was called sisterhood 
at one time it was called sweet vengeance she had a few 
choice but unprintable words about the new title 
it was a good part but only a moderate script when i signed 
she said the day i arrived to begin work the script had been 
drastically improved as we went along there was more rewriting and 
it got better and better thats why i think we got such good 
people 
the movie also stars barry bostwick as the con artist erin 
gray linda purl and dee wallace stone as his other victims and 
colleen camp as a woman who helps them in their plot arthur allan 
seidelman directed from a screenplay by ronni simon and richard 
alfieri 
its not a comedy but theres a lot of comedy in it said 
bergen my biggest scene is very moving heartbreaking but the 
rest of my appearances are fun it becomes a game to get him 
im the oldest and wealthiest of the women i play a widow 
whos lonely and vulnerable and she fell for this very slick man 
when its over it very nearly destroys my belief in myself as a 
woman so i have an enormous anger and have to make a decision i 
have to expose myself and my pride to get this done 
in war and remembrance she returned to her role as the wife 
of pug henry robert mitchum the naval officer who observes much 
of the war effort in the books by herman wouk rhoda has an affair 
with the scientist played by peter graves 
i had total sympathy for her bergen said she had built 
her life around her husband all she ever wanted was a little 
appreciation and affection when she no longer got it from him she 
turned elsewhere she was shallow but she had always been there 
for her husband and family 
after four years with the role playing it rehearsing it 
learning lines and preparing for it she was very sad to finally 
take her leave of rhoda 
the last day was very traumatic she said it was like 
walking away from a part of myself i had grown very close to her 
bergen said she is currently considering two theatrical movie 
scripts and two scripts for tv comedies 
the trouble is 90 percent of the scripts for the new season 
have characters whose oldest age is 22 said im not 22 ive 
run companies for more than 20 years im a bright woman i look at 
tvs highestrated shows theyre not about kids i know the 
demographics of the country i dont understand why all the scripts 
are for kids its beyond my comprehension 
bergen who is married to business entrepreneur jeffrey 
endervelt has three grown children and lives in new york besides 
her film and tv work she also runs companies that manufacture 
shoes handbags and belts

hildegard smith doesnt remember the 30odd 
years she spent raising her family in this rural county seat 
friends say the 50yearold mother of five knows that the people 
gathered at her bedside are her children but only because theyve 
told her so 
she believes richard smith when he tells her he is her husband 
but cannot conjure memories of their years together or the plans 
they made to retire soon to florida 
yet when she shuts her eyes those close to her say mrs smith 
sees as vividly as if it were just happening the faces of two white 
men who accosted her in her apartment building stairwell chopped 
off her hair smeared her with excrement painted markings on her 
face and told her we dont want niggers in this town 
suffering from amnesia since the morning attack feb 8 mrs 
smith is in seclusion being guarded by her family and supported by 
a growing coalition of clergy members citizens and community 
leaders 
meanwhile the towns tiny detective squad is working overtime 
trying to find the assailants 
the rev william j sadler interim pastor of the first 
presbyterian church and a leader of the coalition likened the 
communitys response to the attack to the way a person reacts to 
the death of a loved one 
they go through all the same phases he said first they 
say did this really happen then they get angry 
and underlying the anger here are feelings of impotence and 
anxiety 
we dont know who they are sadler said of the assailants 
so the question remains was it an evil passing through this 
town or has something dark within been revealed 
people have been calling asking are we racist newton 
administrator camille furgiuele said 
newton nestled among hills 60 miles northwest of new york city 
is home to 8000 people of whom an estimated 150 are black 
were really a lily white community sadler said 
but not a racist community said sadler mrs furgiuele and 
others 
there is prejudice no matter where you go mrs furgiuele 
said i cant say that there is no prejudice here but i dont 
think it exists in newton anymore than anywhere else 
sylvester fletcher a 54yearold black scientist who urged the 
formation of the coalition put it this way 
there are undercurrents of racism in every community in that 
regard newton is not an exceptionally good place its a decent 
place 
people here either like you or they let you alone he added 
john gibson 37yearold coowner of the county seat restaurant 
doubted the attackers were locals 
i dont think they could be from around here ive noticed 
that people here only usually do harm to themselves drinking 
too much that sort of thing he said 
newton is facing transition a nearby interstate highway 
completed just over a decade ago has brought traffic to town and 
made urban new jersey seem closer 
the attack on mrs smith has made the cities seem closer still 
people tell me theyre locking their doors mrs furgiuele 
said 
however more apparent than any sense of fear is the feeling of 
a community protecting its own 
although dozens knew of the attack shortly after a neighbor 
found mrs smith the story was kept under wraps mrs smith 
hospitalized for 12 days immediately after the attack initially 
was unable to talk about the incident 
by the time police had the full story days had turned into 
weeks and community leaders were getting anxious fletcher said 
i am a positive person he said i wanted something 
positive to happen 
we had to make a statement that this community would not 
accept this kind of violence sadler added 
richard smith finally agreed to let the new coalition publicize 
his wifes case a feb 26 news conference was called at which mrs 
smiths identity was revealed and composite sketches of the 
assailants were handed out 
the sketches appear on 10000 wanted posters that were 
distributed last week a reward of 13000 was offered for 
information leading to arrests 
the ensuing publicity has been rough on police chief larry 
romyns he has one fulltime detective and one part time and 
shortly after the attack on mrs smith there was a murder a man 
is accused of slaying his wife because she intended to divorce him 
romyns said his detectives have received dozens of leads 
others are leery of what the publicity might bring to the 
community 
we do not want anyone to escalate this into a wappingers falls 
situation sadler said referring to the new york state hometown 
of a 16yearold black girl who says she was sexually assaulted by 
six white men 
when the teenager tawana brawley was found last november 
excrement was smeared on her and kkk and nigger were 
written on her body some of her hair had been chopped off 
officials here say they do not know if the attack on mrs smith 
was a copycat reaction to the brawley case but they are quick 
to point out the differences between them 
mrs smith was not sexually assaulted miss brawley was she 
told police also people here say this is local affair that will 
be handled without the help of outsiders 
if the rev al sharpton showed up we wouldnt want him 
here sadler said referring to the civil rights activist who has 
taken up miss brawleys case sharpton and others have encouraged 
miss brawley not to cooperate with authorities claiming that for 
various reasons they cannot be trusted to handle the case properly 
the community is not without outside support the state chapter 
of the national assocation for the advancement of colored people 
has intitiated an investigation of the incident the state assembly 
has passed a resolution expressing a vehement cry of outrage 
and the newarknorth jersey committee of black churchmen says it 
will ask gov thomas h kean to intercede in whatever way he 
would deem necessary to bring this case to justice according to 
the groups leader dr edward verner 
one way the state can help sadler said is by allocating money 
from a fund for victims of violent crimes the smiths have no 
health insurance and in addition to paying for mrs smiths 
hospital stay the family faces huge bills for psychiatric 
treatment shell need 
our hope is that through treatment and time her memory will 
come back sadler said

although there are few signs of a looming 
recession the probability of one remains a subject of intense 
discussion in certain areas of the country such as new york 
why is this so asks albert sindlinger who was testing public 
opinion as long ago as the great depression and as recently as 
this very day and who declares again that recession isnt an 
immediate threat 
sindlinger whose company conducts scores of telephone 
interviews each day says he finds a contradiction between what he 
reads and hears in the media and what ordinary folks around the 
country are telling him and his staff 
the people he and his staff talk to he states are confident 
about their own economic future he says their household money 
supply a measure of existing conditions is healthy and so are 
their expectations he says 
he points out that these opinions cant be taken lightly because 
the consumer factor the ability and willingness to buy is the 
vital ingredient of our total economy bigger even that business 
and government 
but he continues many of the economic reports he reads include 
phrases such as when the recession begins rather than if 
there is a recession 
he was especially indignant about the profiferation of these 
references following the oct 19 stock market crash which he 
contends bore no resemblance to 1929 which he vividly recalls 
so he sought the reason why 
sindlinger now says the fault lies with the financial press 
which he says is headquartered in new york city close to the 
financial community 
new york he says is a special situation that doesnt reflect 
the countrys mood 
ever since black monday he says we have been watching a 
strong steady decline in consumer confidence in one and only one 
area eastern new york state 
he declares that the economy in much of the country has improved 
in the past year and is continuing to do so he couldnt have said 
that in late 1986 when his readings showed 31 states in recession 
now he says there are but four in recession oklahoma louisiana 
west virginia and mississippi 
in short by his estimates the nations economy has been growing 
stronger but the economy of eastern new york has not he measures 
that area at barely above recession level 
the weakness there is rooted around the new york city 
financial community he states large numbers have been laid 
off and many others say they are extremely concerned about their 
lack of job security 
these layoffs have spilled into the bmw automobile 
dealerships fur salons and fern restaurants mcdonalds also is 
feeling the pinch on manhattan island since lowerpaid clerks are 
being laid off too 
he concludes 
so the financial press stuck on the same island with the 
financial houses and their current and former employees cant help 
but get the idea that somethings wrong with the economy 
they see these people on the streets and interview them for 
their stories being observant people they immediately sense that 
people in the big apple are in trouble 
he asks do these causal observations affect their 
interviewing and reporting seldom without an answer or an 
explanation the crusty sindlinger responds 
are they human of course theyre affected 
while conditions could improve around the country he says they 
are a lot better than some new yorkers believe they are

in the chaos and intolerance that is 
lebanon rmeileh is an oasis of liberty a haven for people fleeing 
political and social persecution and assassination 
this coastal town 19 miles south of beirut is what lebanon 
used to be before 13 years of civil war sectarian hatreds and 
religious fanatacism turned it into a wilderness 
leftists and other refugees from beirut and the south have fled 
to rmeileh following a campaign of assassinations by shiite moslem 
fundamentalists against communists proiraqi baath socialists and 
other leftists 
one of the things that makes rmeileh different from just about 
everywhere else in south lebanon is that alcohol is sold openly at 
the side of the road 
alcohol is banned in most areas of the region dominated by 
shiite moslem factions and in beiruts southern slums the shiite 
stronghold in the capital 
islamic religious laws also ban mixed parties mixed bathing and 
the consumption of pork 
but in the summer rmeilehs eight restaurants and three miles 
of mediterranean beaches and hillside picnic areas are packed with 
males and females having a good time pork also is sold 
hamza 35 comes from the staunchly shiite town of nabatiyeh in 
the south 
we cant buy drinks in nabatiyeh any more so we come to 
rmeileh he said in summer women have to come here to swim 
because its the one of the very few places they can do that 
because he lives in a shiite area where such activities are 
forbidden hamza declined to disclose his full name 
rmeileh was a mainly christian town with about 5000 maronite 
catholics until 1985 when moslem forces overran the coastal 
plain now only about 60 maronite families are left 
but rmeileh now is protected by communist party militiamen most 
of them christians who are allied to neighboring druse and sunni 
moslem forces who help keep the shiites out 
the syrian army also has a checkpoint just south of rmeileh on 
the awali river which also acts as a deterrent for shiite gunmen 
abu rim a leftist official in the town said 500 refugee 
families moslems christians and palestinians live in rmeileh 
with the local christians 
our aim is to get rid of the sectarian atmosphere and 
implement coexistence he said 
elias tabet director of the towns government school said 
ethnic mix gives rmeileh a nonsectarian nature where people from 
different areas and religions feel safe and free 
samih germanos 57 a christian who fled beiruts 
shiitecontrolled southern slums said were very happy and hope 
things will stay this way 
acting mayor halim kleib said the tourist influx last summer 
was even better than prewar times 
people in the south prefer rmeileh to other places because 
its the closest resort to them that provides restaurants and 
private beaches as well as drinks kleib added 
ali hujeiri 40 a father of nine who works at a pepsi cola 
plant in a nearby town said he sells alcohol on the street to earn 
extra money and that most of his customers are from the shiite 
south 
im the only one to sell pork in this area said abu elie a 
32yearold shopowneri started bringing it from mount lebanon 
last week and in four days i sold around 40 kilograms 88 
pounds 
justice minister nabih berris amal movement and the 
iranianbacked hezbollah party of god have been blamed for many 
of the assasinations of leftists in south lebanon 
but since many of those who have fled to rmeileh 
selfdeportees amal calls them are skilled or professional 
people the amal recently asked them to return to their villages 
wafiq rihan a 33yearold shiite school teacher didnt sound 
as though he is ready to return he said that after he fled 
nabatiyeh last year the communists and the leftist druse helped 
us find places to stay and in the beginning we relied on red cross 
supplies 
im teaching at the school now he added i was originally 
a teacher but most of the other deportees here are also working in 
their particular fields medicine the law and so on 
one doctor who fled nabatiyeh even has some of his old 
patients come here to see him for treatment 
rihan said he wants to go back to his own village but only when 
its safe

blunt criticisms of art censors have come to 
be expected from chinas most famous movie director wu tianming 
even more than the evocative and provocative films produced by his 
studio 
it takes no prompting to set him off 
those people censors were used to making hypocritical 
propaganda wu grumbled in a recent interview people who have 
feudal and ultraleft ideas and bureaucrats get in the way of 
our work 
even the censors however have been unable to stop the cascade 
of domestic and international honors awarded in the past four years 
to wus movies and those of young directors who work under him at 
the xian film studio in chinas ancient capital 
since wu became its director in 1983 the debtridden studio in 
arid northwestern china has become a prolific producer of 
hauntingly beautiful technically innovative movies that have 
raised chinas standing in the international film community many 
in one way or another also have been seen as affronts to socialism 
for example wus own old well about a poor villages 
efforts to dig a well won top honors last year at the tokyo 
international film festival and a special prize at the hawaii 
international film festival and received critical acclaim in new 
york 
but its release to prudish chinese audiences was delayed for 
months because of the movies depiction of a love triangle 
including several kissing scenes of unusual passion 
the black cannon directed by huang jianxing one of wus 
stable of young directors aroused heated debate because it 
attacked mindless bureaucracy it eventually was named best movie 
of 1985 by chinas ministry of broadcast film and television 
another xian studio release the horse thief directed by 
tian zhuangzhuang never was shown to general chinese audiences 
because of its depiction of poverty among tibetan horsemen 
from his brick office compound with peeling paint and leaking 
pipes the 48yearold wu said he wants to expand the limits of 
what is acceptable in chinese filmmaking largely restricted since 
1949 to socialist morality tales 
wu said the studio does not seek to create controversy but it 
often results because he and his fellow directors are trying to 
depict the often harsh realities of life in china 
this frightens conservative bureaucrats accustomed to propaganda 
movies he said they lived illusions they cannot accept any 
movie that reflects the dark side of life 
its a side of life wu knows well he was born in the mountains 
of shaanxi province north of xian where perpetual drought keeps 
many peasants in poverty during the 196676 farleftist cultural 
revolution he was denounced as a rightist and paraded through 
xians streets wearing a signboard proclaiming his political sins 
afterward he said he went home and shut my door and 
studied for the rest of the tumultuous decade during which china 
made almost no movies 
wu is willing to take risks not only for his own movies but 
those of other directors at the xian studio one reason it has 
attracted talented young directors and cinematographers 
on his movie the black cannon huang said the moment we 
saw the film for the first time we knew it would be controversial 
but we had a common idea he said pointing to wu that 
this film should reflect life we felt some pressure when the film 
was not immediately approved but mr wu said at one meeting if 
problems occurred he would be held responsible 
another attraction is wus readiness to give young directors 
free rein 
asked if he gives advice to the less experienced 34yearold 
huang wu laughed and said he does fine on his own if i were to 
help him i might stifle him 
there would be great prosperity in chinas literature and arts 
if all artistic leaders followed my example to let artists do what 
they like 
wu is harsh in his criticism of standard chinese movie fare 
sixty percent of chinese movies are seriously lacking he said 
but he is no kinder to foreign movies 
he disliked steven spielbergs empire of the sun partly 
filmed in shanghai about the japanese invasion of china in world 
war ii wu also said he does not seek to copy western movies 
he says his studios movies are the best being made in china 
now and was confident his own old well will sweep the chinese 
critics and government awards for best movie of 1987 
several upcoming xian movies appear ripe to arouse debate one 
is about army chief peng dehuai purged in 1958 for daring to 
criticize mao tsetung another concerns three youths whose lives 
are failures despite their efforts to get ahead 
maybe some people will think its too gray huang said of 
the latter movie which he is directing to be called floating 
out of the sea 
his own output is relatively slim in addition to codirecting 
two movies he has directed just three old well life 
1984 and river without a buoy 1983 all three have received 
prizes at home or abroad 
the demands of running a studio that employs 1450 and is 
perpetually in debt will keep him from starting his next movie 
before next year he said 
will it be controversial 
yes wu said emphatically using one of his few english 
words definitely

the peoples consultative assembly has 
closed shop for another five years after an 11day session marked 
by unprecedented discord 
a public outburst by an army general a dispute over the vice 
presidency and previously unheard of votes on policy matters upset 
the script at what is usually a prearranged ceremonial occasion 
the assembly is supposed to elect the president and vice 
president and approve state policy guidelines it consists of the 
500 members of parliament chosen through a general election last 
april and another 500 people appointed by president suharto 
the constitution describes the assembly as the nations supreme 
lawmaking body in fact suharto rules the worlds fifth most 
populous country with the support of the armed forces and 
participatory democracy is limited 
five factions in the assembly acclaimed suharto as president for 
a fifth fiveyear term the factions include three political 
parties the military and appointees from different regions 
state secretary sudharmono was sworn in unopposed as vice 
president only after jailani naro of the moslembased united 
development party withdrew at the last minute 
i didnt withdraw i was pulled out by my party naro told a 
news conference 
earlier in the session naros party caused the assembly to 
depart from tradition by voting for the first time ever to break a 
deadlock 
political custom calls for musjawarah or negotiating for as 
long as it takes to reach consensus some authorities dislike 
voting as a practice they associate with westernstyle democracy 
the moslem faction was outvoted 28028 in committee on its 
request to add a clause to election rules stating that general 
elections should be held in a fair and honest manner opponents 
maintained this was already embodied in the regulations 
the moslem group lost by equally lopsided margins on proposals 
to reject javanese mysticism as part of religion and subsidize 
islamic boarding schools 
the vice presidency is a largely ceremonial position but with 
the 66yearold suharto starting what is assumed will be his last 
term his running mate would be wellplaced to stake a claim as 
heir to the presidency 
stepping out as vice president is umar wirahadikusumah 64 a 
retired general and suhartos former comradeinarms umar kept a 
low profile during his one term and was never regarded as having 
presidential ambitions 
constitutional procedures for succession exist but do not take 
into account the widespread mystical belief that the national 
leader must be blessed with a divine mandate before one has a 
right to rule 
about 90 percent of indonesias 170 million people are 
considered at least nominally moslem but dukuns or 
soothsayers have a wide following and suharto rules with the help 
of javanese spiritual advisers informed sources say 
suharto and the late president sukarno are the only presidents 
indonesia has had since independence from the dutch after world war 
ii economic chaos an attempted coup and bloodshed in the last 
months of sukarnos rule were supposed to be signs that he had lost 
the divine mandate sukarno died in 1970 
sudharmono who is 61 the is leader of golkar the government 
political party as minister in charge of the state secretariat 
since 1966 he has been boss of the countrys 26 million civil 
servants 
once known as suhartos doorman because he wielded power for 
years by controlling access to the president sudharmono is a 
retired army general his background is in military law not field 
command however and not all in the officer corps welcomed his 
nomination by golkar 
military sources who insisted on anonymity said some generals 
supported instead the newly appointed armed forces commander gen 
try sutrisno 52 a popular figure and a former suharto aide 
one military figure gen ibrahim saleh startled the assembly 
session when he took the microphone and said we indonesian 
soldiers who believe in god and defend honesty and justice have 
heard rumors that the nomination of the vice president is not being 
fairly and correctly carried out 
there are certain things that we feel are against our 
conscience he added but then was escorted out by other generals 
of the military faction before he could finish his statement 
former armed forces commander gen lb murdani told reporters 
later that saleh did not reflect the views of the armed forces

the national park service has proposed 
landmark status for the farm of whittaker chambers whose 
allegations about infiltration of the american government fueled 
the fires of the red scare and whose writings deeply influenced 
president reagan and other conservatives 
forty years ago in a strange and symbolic incident chambers 
then a time magazine editor opened a hollowedout pumpkin on pipe 
creek farm and retrieved microfilmed documents that connected alger 
hiss a longtime state department official to communist activities 
a decade earlier 
chambers who had renounced his communist past accused hiss of 
having belonged to a secret cell of underground communists that 
passed documents to the soviets in the 1930s chambers claimed they 
had been close associates at one time 
hiss sued chambers for libel but the tables turned as the 
pumpkin papers sealed hiss fate before the house unamerican 
activities committee criminal indictments followed and after two 
trials hiss was sent to prison on march 22 1951 his libel suit 
was dismissed in 1951 
although he served 44 months in prison after being convicted of 
perjuring himself before the committee by denying under oath that 
he ferried the documents to chambers in 1938 he has maintained his 
innocence 
reached at his new york home last week the 83yearold hiss 
said he had no comment on the effort to honor chambers with a 
landmark 
he added i will have something to say about him in the latter 
part of may when he publishes what he termed a 
semiautobiographical book 
after turning in his former associates chambers who had slept 
for years with a gun fearing retribution retreated with his family 
to the farms 390 rolling acres where he tended to the land and 
wrote about his experiences until his death in 1961 
one of the conservatives most influenced by chambers 1952 
autobiographical volume witness was a young californian ronald 
reagans own book wheres the rest of me includes references 
to chambers 
he talks about the deep impact that whittaker chambers had on 
him he said reading witness was one of the most profoundly 
moving experiences of his life according to white house chief 
speechwriter tony dolan 
dolan said reagan was so stirred by the story of a communist who 
came to see the evils of totalitarian regimes that he bestowed a 
posthumous medal of freedom on chambers in 1984 
reagan and dolan discussed the presidents interest in chambers 
a subsequent exchange between dolan and secretary of the interior 
donald hodel led to the site nomination 
hodel is a very devoted conservative very devoted to the 
president dolan said 
the landmark designation for the chambers farm depends on 
approval from the national park system advisory board which is 
scheduled to meet on april 26 and then from hodel it would 
provide the property with a plaque and place it in a league with 
more than 1800 other sites from ships to presidential homes with 
national historical value 
historians point out that the hisschambers case polarized the 
political world fueled the paranoia of the cold war and rocketed 
thencongressman richard m nixon to prominence as one of hiss top 
interrogators 
according to park service historian barry mackintosh nixon made 
at least two unpublicized visits to the chambers farm and became 
convinced that chambers was telling the truth about his association 
with hiss years later nixon would return to westminster to 
speak with chambers about his desire to be president but chambers 
wrote supporter and national review founder william f buckley jr 
that he found nixon inadequate for the job 
asked why the reagan administration chose to honor his father 
with a landmark nomination john chambers a former journalist now 
serving as deputy staff director of the joint committee on printing 
in washington said whittaker chambers left behind a literary 
legacy and a legacy of action a legacy of conscience and this is 
the place where some of this was formulated and one of the places 
where it came be focused 
its an honor that we welcome said chambers who has lived 
at pipe creek farm off and on since the age of 2 
maintaining it as a working farm is he said his way of paying 
tribute to his fathers conversion to a simple life of manual 
labor expressed in the volume cold friday 
here i determined to root the lives of my children i 
meant to root them in this way in their nation for i hold that a 
nation is first of all the soil on which it lives for which it is 
willing to die whittaker chambers wrote 
this was all there was to give the ground beneath their 
feet i meant to give it to them not only against the forces of 
open revolution but also against that suffocating materialism 
which more than want or hunger recruits the forces of revolution 
in the west 
according to dolan chambers felt there was a death struggle 
going on in the world between freedom and totalitarianism and as a 
matter of fact he felt the west would probably lose that 
struggle 
what he didnt count on was ronald reagan he could not 
the future 
in light of the delaware ruling henley said it has moved to 
dismiss a suit challenging santa fes restructuring and other 
actions by santa fes board 
earlier this week henley announced its own restructuring which 
would include raising 25 billion in new bank financing to fund 
acquisitions at the time henley chairman michael dingman 
indicated the company was on the prowl for new takeover 
prospects 
separately olympia amp york announced it has again extended by 
six days until next wednesday the expiration date of its tender 
offer of 1750 a share for up to 14 million santa fe shares which 
would boost its stake to 196 percent to date 477 million shares 
have been tender the company said

the southwest african nation of angola has known 
only war since independence from portugal in 1975 a marxist 
government is in place in luanda the capital backed by the soviet 
union and cuba in the countryside is a usbacked guerrilla force 
called unita in between are people often suffering the bullets 
mines and bombs of war an associated press correspondent had a 
rare look at the war recently during a tour of an angolan war zone

land mines people with legs blown off 
orphans abandoned farm fields hunger the thunder of artillery in 
the distance the clatter of helicopter gunships overhead all this 
is part of daily life for the people of bie a highland province in 
central angola shattered by a dozen years of guerrilla war 
for a group of foreign reporters visiting this former farming 
town and the provincial capital of kuito saw clear evidence of the 
heavy fighting between government forces and rebel guerrillas 
the war has left its mark on everyone everything 
cuemba set on a rise in undulating grassy countryside is 
ringed by trenches and machinegun emplacements visible from the 
air the least hazardous way to reach the town 
approaching cuemba from kuito in a casa cn235 troop transport 
a shorttakeoff and landing aircraft the visitors accompanied by 
government guides saw roads and railways empty of all traffic 
the fading outlines of abandoned farmlands farther out from 
cuemba were also visible from the air contrasting with orderly 
rows of lush growth mainly corn seen outside kuito 87 miles to 
the west where the fighting of recent months has not been so 
intense 
it is much the same in other parts of angola where the national 
union for the total independence of angola unita supported by 
the united states and south africa is fighting a 
sovietcubanbacked marxist government in luanda the capital 
an estimated 40000 cuban troops are in angola along with more 
than 1000 soviet military advisers the united states sends arms 
to the rebels and south africa lends air and groundtroop support 
unita claims to have full control of about a third of angola 
in the southeast and east where about 2 million of angolas 81 
million people live in the area it calls liberated angola 
unita has established a government and runs schools and hospitals 
the guerrillas say they operate in another third of the country 
while the government maintains full control of the rest 
flying is perhaps the only safe way to travel in many parts of 
the country thousands of villagers have lost one or both legs to 
unita land mines the government says hundreds of others have been 
killed leaving children orphaned and making physical disability a 
common condition 
the international committee of the red cross which operates 
several physical rehabilitation centers in the region last year 
estimated 15000 angolan army soldiers and 15000 civilians have 
lost limbs in land mine explosions 
on the airport road in kuito the visitors saw three women who 
had lost legs moving along on crutches or with canes in the city 
there were more 
there were children too in tattered filthy clothes some too 
small some too large clearly the only clothing they owned 
in cuemba where unita has been fighting for control of the 
region since jan 25 children and older villagers show signs of 
malnutrition 
bullet holes snake across the walls of many houses the tracks 
of the strategic benguela railroad which links landlocked southern 
african countries to the atlantic ocean are rusty and caked with 
thick dried mud it was obvious no trains have been through for a 
long time 
hairdressers cafes clothing and photography stores printing 
presses and transport companies lie abandoned their windows are 
broken and paint from before angola gained independence from 
portugal in 1975 is peeling from the frames the municipal swimming 
pools in cuemba and kuito are long out of use 
government forces killed 180 unita guerrillas in a recent 
threeday battle around cuemba the defense ministry says the 
rebels had not shelled the airports packedearth runway or taken 
control of the town as they had claimed 
government forces clearly were in control on this day

the first foreign reporters to visit the region since unita 
launched a major offensive to seize cuemba and munhango 40 miles 
to the east were met by the fit and wellequipped angolan army 
unit stationed in the town 
the commander maj jose walter freitas gomes displayed 
weapons including antitank missiles mines and mortars that he 
said were made in the united states and captured from the rebels 
no markings however could be seen on the weapons to indicate 
where they were made 
at the end of their 50minute visit to the town the reporters 
were seen off by a small crowd most of them children and there 
was a momentary disturbance 
a drum sounded somewhere in the distance and the children 
suddenly streaked off in fear mistakenly believing the noise was 
artillery fire their lives are full of those sounds 
leaving cuemba the casa cn235 lifted into the air long before 
reaching the end of the runway climbing almost vertically in a 
spiral to gain altitude fast and to get away from any unita 
snipers or artillery 
for the same reason landing had been a reverse of this 
maneuver dropping 21000 feet to cuembas airport in four minutes 
the angolans call this corkscrew drop the spiral of death 
in october the international red cross suspended operations in 
bie after its sole cargo plane in angola a hercules c130 crashed 
after takeoff from kuito airport following what appeared to be an 
engine fire 
four people aboard the plane were killed along with a woman and 
child on the ground the red cross began operating in the area 
again in late february flying in food and medicine 
the red cross resumed the services after rebel leaders at 
unitas jamba bush headquarters in southern angola said they would 
permit relief operations 
angolas minister of state for inspection and control kundi 
payama said in kuito that unita has supporters and guerrillas 
among the population of bie he noted that jonas savimbi unitas 
leader was born in the province 
there are people working their family plots in this area who 
put down their hoes at night dig up their hidden guns and become 
unita raiders planting mines and laying ambushes payama said 
these things happen if you cant feed the people and they 
cant get decent housing or find a job or work most of the fields 
weve got lots of food at the atlantic port of lobito but 
getting it here is the problem he said lobito is the starting 
point of the benguela railroad but rebel attacks have made it 
impossible for trains to travel as far as cuemba 
every time we try to bring a food convoy here by road it gets 
attacked and burned payama added he said the people understood 
however that the government was trying to get food through 
cuban soldiers were seen getting off a plane at kuito airport 
and others were in evidence in huambo capital of the neighboring

instead they expect it will be at most part of a growing 
armamentarium against aids the fda said there are now more than 
100 drugs being tested against aids or against the opportunistic 
diseases that attack bodies weakened by aids 
broder at nci is conducting tests that team azt with other 
drugs principally one called ddc for dideoxycytidine he is 
conducting tests in which the drugs are alternated 
i believe we eventually be using a combination of several 
drugs said dr glen mathisen chief of infectious diseases at 
olive view medical center in los angeles 
mathisen and others note that drug combinations have been used 
successfully against major killers such as leukemia and 
tuberculosis most cancer chemotherapy includes a combination 
skillfully administered in cycles 
azts full range of uses are still being explored because the 
drug now is limited only to patients at a late stage of aids or of 
aidsrelated complex or arc 
barry said studies are under way using azt to protect medical 
workers who have been exposed to the blood or other body fluids of 
aids patients during treatment there have been more than 1000 
such reported incidents and its hoped that azt given within hours 
of the exposure will prevent development of aids 
other studies are exploring the use of azt for infants born with 
the disease or for people who test positive for the hiv virus but 
who do not have the aids sympthoms 
but no matter what else is learned about azt the important 
thing is that the drug has bought time said broder 
its not the magic bullet he said but its keeping 
people alive we can now worry about things like longterm toxicity 
of the drug before azt they didnt live long enough for that to 
be a concern

before i king jordan jr lost his hearing he 
knew nothing about gallaudet university like many district of 
columbia residents he drove by it frequently without so much as a 
curious thought 
now jordan has taken over the 124yearold liberal arts 
university for the hearing impaired as its first deaf president 
he has become an important symbol to the nonhearing even those 
who have nothing to do with gallaudet 
its overwhelming jordan said i came here after i 
accepted the appointment the students were crying hugging me the 
emotion is still very high its a wonderful feeling 
when i go off campus i ride in the gallaudet university 
station wagon and people blow their horns and wave at me i can see 
people recognize me 
during the last week the campus has been empty while its 2200 
students who pushed jordan into power took spring break 
on monday theyll return and jordan will hold a celebration 
assembly to reinforce what has become his motto deaf people can 
do anything except hear 
jordan rose to the presidency march 13 on a wave of student 
protest that followed the decision by gallaudets trustees to 
appoint a hearing woman elisabeth zinser as president 
the outcry led to zinsers resignation and the hiring of jordan 
who had been among two deaf people also considered for the job 
what you saw was something really unique jordan said of the 
seven days of protest 
it was not dissatisfaction with the university administration 
at all what you saw was the deaf community the entire national 
and international deaf community finally reach a point where they 
knew it was time to speak out about their frustrations at not being 
in the top leadership positions in the field 
the conditions were just perfect the leadership in the 
student body was tremendous 
i cant tell you how proud i am of the students how well 
organized they were how they guaranteed that there would be no 
violence no damage and they carried that out there was never 
anyone hurt or any damage done 
virtually all the students were in on the demonstrations they 
marched they rallied they blocked entrances to the campus and 
they convinced older deaf people that the time was now to take 
charge 
jordan originally threw his support behind zinser saying he had 
hoped to persuade the students to compromise for the good of the 
university 
overnight literally overnight it became clear to me that it 
was getting bigger and bigger by the minute and that i had misread 
it that i had made a mistake he said 
i dont think anyone realized the support there was on the 
outside ive never seen a movement that was universal support 
before 
when the group marched from here to the capitol people came 
out of their houses and applauded people who were tied up in 
traffic instead of blowing their horns impatiently and wanting the 
march to be over blew their horns in support got out of their 
cars and waved 
people lining the way between here and the capitol were 
signing i love you it was probably a onceinalifetime 
movement 
jordans deafness has not impaired his speech but he uses a 
sign language interpreter to understand hearing people though he 
can read lips he says a lengthy conversation is exhausting without 
the help of signing 
he lost his hearing in 1965 when he was 21 and stationed in 
washington with the navy a motorcycle accident caused multiple 
skull fractures severed his auditory nerve and put him in the 
hospital for a year 
when he recovered someone suggested he enroll at gallaudet 
until then he knew nothing about the school 
before i became deaf i drove by here regularly a few times a 
week and i had no idea what it was he said 
though his family was very supportive deafness had never been a 
part of their lives growing up in glen riddle pa jordan never 
even knew a deaf person 
his father was a shipping clerk his mother an office clerk and 
his life with two older sisters and one younger brother had been 
typical small town america 
when i first came to gallaudet i was going through a period of 
adjustment to deafness one of the things that was easy for me to 
do was to lose myself in my studies i found that i was very good 
at it while i couldnt hear i could read and id write and 
became a very strong student i made a conscious decision to become 
as good a student as i could 
after getting his bachelors degree in psychology jordan went 
on to receive a masters degree and phd from the university of 
tennessee there were no interpreters to translate lectures so 
jordan read the professors lips and got help from his hearing 
classmates 
along the way he married a hearing but very supportive 
woman and now has a 17yearold son and 15yearold daughter 
he returned to gallaudet in 1973 as a professor of psychology 
and became dean of the college of arts and sciences in 1986 
as its president he said he will encourage deaf people to seek 
teaching positions at gallaudet but he will not put any quotas on 
the number of deaf people who should hold either staff or 
administrative positions 
about 30 percent of the professors are deaf fewer 
administrators are 
academica is becoming a better career program for deaf people 
jordan said in the past the only opportunity for deaf people would 
have been gallaudet 
he said he knows of deaf people in other schools using 
interpreters to teach hearing students 
i really believe that the events of last week show that even 
when someone needs an interpeter still there can be clear 
meaningful communication he said

a betterthanexpected january trade deficit helped drive the

report showing sustained factory usage underscored signs of 
economic strength 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials jumped 2172 points in a 
late buying spree thursday to close at 208604 the market 
barometers best showing since octobers stock market crash 
analysts credited the betterthanexpected trade deficit and 
takeoverrelated buying for the strong performance 
separately the federal reserve reported the nations factories 
mines and utilities operated at 824 percent of capacity in 
february sustaining that rate for the third consecutive month 
the commerce department reported a slight widening of the us 
merchandise trade deficit to 1244 billion but economists said 
the 19 percent increase was too small to cause alarm 
exports fell in a seasonallyexpected trend this time by 10 
percent to 2233 billion 
but economists were more enthusiastic over a 6 percent dip in 
imports to 3477 billion which they say is a firmer indication 
the trade balance slowly is improving 
januarys deficit was up from 1220 billion in december but 
down from the gaps of 1321 billion in november and 1763 billion 
in october 
if the january level continued for 12 consecutive months it 
would yield an annual trade deficit of about 149 billion in 1987 
the merchandise trade deficit was 17122 billion 
the january report represented a slight setback after two 
consecutive monthly improvements but there were some bright spots 
the deficit with japan still the largest singlecountry 
imbalance fell by 176 percent in january to 395 billion its 
lowest level since december 1986 
the united states showed its first surplus in nearly three years 
with britain with exports topping imports by 75 million for all 
western europe the deficit declined 51 percent to 133 billion 
the trade news helped support the dollar and pushed interest 
rates lower in the credit markets where the yield on the 
treasurys bellwether 30year issue fell to 853 percent from 
wednesdays 860 percent 
the federal reserves report showing sustained high factory use 
helped underscore economists contentions that the industrial 
sector remained strong 
before the year began some experts had expressed fears that the 
economy could weaken significantly due to widespread cutbacks in 
production as businesses tried to work off a huge supply of unsold 
goods built up in late 1987 
while high inventories have led to cuts in auto production many 
other industries such as textiles chemicals and paper have 
continued to have high operating rates

us and european trade officials 
are holding a new round of talks in the lengthy dispute over 
government subsidies to the airbus aircraft manufacturing 
consortium 
but both sides remain far apart on the longsimmering issue of 
subsidies to airbus which the united states contends are unfair 
and us trade envoys are not optimistic about the outcome of the 
meeting 
the expectations are very low an official close to the 
negotiations said thursday 
the us delegation led by trade representative clayton 
yeutter is expected to use todays meeting to increase pressure on 
the economic ministers representing the four airbus countries to 
abolish or at least scale down the payments sources said 
us officials have grown impatient over the slow progress of 
the talks and are looking for indications that the airbus nations 
at least are willing to agree to reduce some of their support 
sources said 
the americans at a minimum want the europeans to give a signal 
that they are willing to accept some effective discipline in regard 
to subsidies an informed diplomatic source who asked not to be 
identified said earlier this week 
the united states estimates the four countries involved in the 
airbus industrie consortium france britain west germany and 
spain have given 10 billion to the consortium since it was 
created 17 years ago 
willy de clercq the european economic communitys external 
relations commissioner said last week there was a realistic 
chance of settling the dispute but he also said the eec 
governments cannot entirely renounce state aid payments to 
airbus 
de clercq predicted an agreement would require further rounds 
of very difficult negotiations 
the united states maintains that subsidies to airbus are unfair 
to us aircraft makers in the widebody longhaul passenger jet 
market 
the airbus nations contend the subsidies do not distort trade 
and are allowed under civil aircraft provisions of the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade 
the eec also argues that us aircraft manufacturers long have 
enjoyed huge indirect subsidies through military contracts from 
the pentagon and millions in government research grants 
according to eec figures the united states exports 5 billion 
worth of aircraft and aircraft parts to western europe per year 
compared to 3 billion of european aircraft exports annually to the 
united states 
the eec says outstanding european orders and options for us 
aircraft total 23 billion while us orders and options for 
airbus stand at 13 billion 
the united states contends airbus has 35 percent of the world 
market a figure the eec rejects as far too high 
the eec claims us manufacturers still dominate the worldwide 
civilian aircraft market with boeing controlling 49 percent of the 
market and mcdonnell douglas corp 17 percent while airbus has a 
25 percent share 
the united states has threatened to retaliate against airbus if 
the negotiations fail despite a recent decision by the four airbus 
ministers to have airbus managers enter into direct negotiations 
with mcdonnell douglas on a possible joint project 
the aim of the talks is to see whether the two sides could 
collaborate on one or more new airplanes 
under the proposal the new aircraft would not compete with 
existing models 
but diplomatic sources told the associated press that the move 
was unlikely to reduce tensions over the subsidy issue 
it may well be helpful for airbus and mcdonnell douglas to 
agree on a joint project but that will not solve the core problem 
of the current subsidies said another diplomatic source who 
also declined to be identified further

campeau corp has gotten a boost in one aspect 
of its court fight to gain the upper hand in its attempted take 
over of federated department stores inc but still faces major 
obstacles 
the securities and exchange commission on thursday agreed with 
campeaus contention that its sweetened buyout offer for federated 
constituted an amendment to a previous proposal rather than an 
entirely new bid 
the sec opinion was sought by a federal judge hearing a lawsuit 
brought over the issue by rival bidder rh macy amp co inc 
if us district judge leonard sand agrees with the sec campeau 
could let its tender offer expire as scheduled before the april 4 
expiration of macys competing offer which is supported by 
federateds management 
that could pressure federated shareholders into tendering their 
shares to campeau because of the earlier deadline macy is suing 
to force campeau to keep its offer open longer 
but although campeau got a boost in the dispute over its tender 
offer it still must win a victory in its challenge to federateds 
poison pill takeover defense 
both campeau and macy have bid more than 6 billion for 
federated one of the nations biggest department store operators 
in a friend of the court brief the sec told sand the 
revised bid campeau announced on march 2 was not a new offer and 
as such did not have to remain open for 20 business days past its 
publication 
earlier this week sand ordered both companies offers to remain 
open for three business days after he rules on campeaus lawsuit 
seeking to invalidate federateds poison pill 
campeau has told sand its offer could not proceed while the 
poison pill remained in effect the pill would allow current 
federated shareholders to buy more of the companys stock at a 
steep discount unless the board of directors withdrew the 
provision making a hostile takeover prohibitively expensive 
it was not known when sand would make his ruling 
macy had no comment on the secs opinion said maureen milano a 
spokeswoman for the retailer 
macy is offering 7735 a share in cash for 7043 million 
federated shares for a total of 54 billion macy would exchange 
shares in the merged company macysfederated inc and issue 
convertible debt securities for the remainder of federateds 895 
million outstanding shares which analysts have estimated would 
produce a total value of 63 billion 
campeaus bid is a twostep allcash package that would be 
worth 68 a share or 618 billion it is offering 75 each for 
705 million federated shares and would acquire the remaining 
stock for 44 cash per share in a subsequent merger 
federated stock fell 62 cents to 6250 a share thursday on the 
new york stock exchange 
in a related matter the head of the federal trade commission 
refused thursday to appear before a house panel reviewing the 
proposed federated takeover 
rep thomas luken dohio said ftc chairman daniel oliver and 
ftc commissioner terry calvani told the house energy and commerce 
transportation subcommittee they would neither testify nor turn 
over documents on the agencys review of any possible 
anticompetitive effects of a merger between federated and campeau 
luken said he was considering subpoenaing the officials if they 
did not testify voluntarily 
robert paul general counsel for the ftc said the commissioners 
decided not to give the documents to the subcommittee because 
several weeks ago the panel released to the press an ftc staff memo 
on the campeau bid the agency considered confidential 
federated owns 650 stores including the bloomingdales 
burdines filenes foleys lazarus and richs department store 
chains ralphs supermarkets gold circle discount stores and main 
street and childrens place specialty stores

the head of the federal trade commission has 
been asked to justify his refusal to give congress documents on the 
agencys review of campeau corps proposed takeover of federated 
department stores inc 
the request was made thursday by rep thomas luken dohio 
after ftc chairman daniel oliver and ftc commissioner terry calvani 
refused to appear before the house energy and commerce 
transportation subcommittee 
im a little outraged at this conduct luken said following 
the hearing theyre setting up roadblocks 
luken chairman of the subcommittee said if the officials 
continue to refuse to comply i will obviously be thinking about 
proceeding with subpoenas and possibly contempt citations 
campeau and rh macy amp co inc are locked in a takeover battle 
for cincinnatibased federated the congressman has accused the ftc 
of failing to thoroughly investigate the hostile takeover bid by 
campeau which preceded the friendly takeover agreement between 
federated by macys 
robert paul the ftc general counsel said the commissioners 
decided not to give the documents to the subcommittee because 
several weeks ago the panel released to the press an ftc staff memo 
on the campeau bid the agency considered confidential 
theres tremendous concern on their part that this was very 
very bad precedent said paul chairman oliver and commissioner 
calvani are not going to be party to producing documents 
furtheruntil there is assurance by the subcommittee that this 
type of thing will not happen again 
paul said that if there was an ftc investigation of the macys 
bid and the commissioners rendered a decision they might be 
subject to allegations by private parties that the agency acted 
because of congressional pressure 
the more the congress acts on this puts pressure on us the 
greater the possibility of arguing that we have been influenced by 
congress that weve been tainted said paul 
luken said 80 percent to 90 percent of the information marked 
confidential in the ftc memo released by the subcommittee was 
contained in public filings and that the rest is just 
chitchat he said federated and campeau were told the memo was 
being given to the subcommittee and neither objected 
luken asked that oliver and calvani submit a legal memo giving 
their reason for not providing the documents and for not appearing 
before the panel 
ftc commissioners mary azcuenaga and andrew strenio who 
appeared before the subcommittee thursday said they had voted to 
turn over the requested documents but had failed to obtain the 
necessary majority vote to do so 
federated operates about 650 stores in 36 states and had sales 
exceeding 11 billion in 1987 
campeau is a retailing and real estate development company based 
in toronto

a 1 billion federal cash infusion to first 
republicbank corp has helped stanch a run on deposits but federal 
officials say the advance is only an interim step to steady the 
troubled bank holding company 
the federal deposit insurance corps cash advance on thursday 
helped calm jittery depositors and slow runoff of deposits that has 
drained an undisclosed amount of reserves from the ailing company 
bank spokesman joseph c bowles said 
as soon as the fdic action was made available to the public 
the deposit outflow stopped bowles said 
in washington fdic chairman william seidman said his agency was 
talking to private investors about participating in a restructuring 
of the company as a longterm solution to first republicbanks 
problems 
in a move intended to stem any ripple effect on the banking 
system as a whole seidman also pledged his agency to fully protect 
all depositors of the banks as well as general creditors 
that goes beyond the minimum the agency normally would be 
expected to insure which is deposits of 100000 and less 
the promise covers money borrowed overnight from other banks by 
first republicbank to meet the cash rules of the federal reserve 
board however it does not apply to the holding company and its 
bond and note holders 
the action today confirms that all depositors and other 
general creditors of first republicbanks banks will be fully 
protected said gerald fronterhouse first republicbanks 
chairman and chief executive 
bowles and other bank officials refused thursday to say how much 
of the companys deposits had been withdrwan since tuesday when it 
announced its decision to seek federal help 
last month the bank lost 600 million in deposits over a 
fiveday period amid rumors that it was in danger because of 
billions of dollars in bad loans particularly in real estate 
but several customers at the companys lead bank in downtown 
dallas indicated they were not worried about losing their deposits 
i have confidence in the people running the bank itll 
survive said alex cochrane 
gail scott said its pretty scary i hope they can work it 
out 
a woman who declined to identify herself said she wasnt worried 
because the fdic insures accounts up to 100000 and before they 
go under i will have spent my money 
an associated press reporter was escorted out of the bank under 
guard thursday as he tried to interview customers and bank 
officials 
george reagan investment manager of the texas teachers 
retirement system a major institutional investor that holds 
498000 shares of first republicbank stock said the fdic money 
would provide a cushion for the bank until the economy recovers 
this will allow first republic to get through the hard times 
no one especially first republic realized that we would go 
through such a hard time with the texas real estate market for so 
long he said

savings association is the companys largest individual investor 
with more than 1 million shares 
nine months ago those shares were worth 24 million now

that all depositors including the state treasury are safe

life has gotten sweeter for chocolate 
lovers thanks to a drop in cocoa prices that has translated into 
bigger candy bars and could mean future pricecutting promotions 
the price of raw cocoa which typically constitutes up to 20 
percent of a typical chocolate bar has fallen to fiveyear lows 
while that hasnt meant direct reductions in the cost of a 
snickers or hershey bar at the corner newsstand or vending machine 
it has helped candy makers offer a bigger bar at the same price 
the nearmonth cocoa future traded on the coffee sugar and 
cocoa exchange in new york traded at 1552 per ton on thursday 
down from the midjuly price of 2175 analysts say abundant 
supplies and rising production have depressed prices 
but cheaper cocoa doesnt directly translate into cheaper bars 
because cocoa and chocolate dont have the direct price 
relationship of for example oil and gasoline or beans and coffee 
industry analysts say 
while cocoa and its byproducts constitute up to 20 percent of a 
chocolate bar about 50 percent of the candy is sugar and the rest 
milk nuts vanilla or other ingredients said susan smith a 
spokeswoman for the chocolate manufacturers association 
hackettstownbased mampmmars a privatelyheld company considered 
to be the nations argest candy bar maker has increased the size 
of two popular products by about 8 percent in recent years 
last fall mampmmars enlarged its milky way bar as it had done 
with its snickers bar the nations biggest seller according to 
industry estimates the previous year 
hans fiuczynski a spokesman for mampmmars said the lower cocoa 
price augmented and abetted the decision to increase the bar 
size although he said similar moves by other candy makers also 
played a major role 
we did what other people did not necessarily because of the 
price of raw materials fiuczynski said 
a spokesman for hershey chocolate usa in hershey pa said 
a drop in cocoa prices and stabilization in the cost of other 
ingredients contributed to its decision to boost the size of its 
various chocolate bars by 10 percent to 14 percent in july 1986 
but the price of cocoa doesnt have that direct an effect on 
us in terms of the cost of its products said spokesman carl 
anderson 
kim badenhop an analyst with merrill lynch capital markets 
inc said recent cocoa prices could be considered the lowest in 
decades if inflation was taken into account 
badenhop predicted the increased cash flow resulting from 
cheaper commodity costs could show up in stillbigger bars and more 
promotions such as coupons or discounted brands 
retailers probably wont pass on their savings to consumers by 
cutting the price of an individual chocolate bar but are likely to 
do it by offering a bigger product for the same price discount 
coupons or through other promotions badenhop said 
weve been told through the grapevine that has happened with 
some of the companies said ms smith 
consumers may see direct savings in products such as packages of 
candy bars sold in supermarkets or bags of small chocolates said

television producer burt sugarman has 
launched a twopronged attack against media general inc filing a 
countersuit against the company and launching a proxy fight to win 
three seats on the board of directors 
sugarman filed suit thursday in us district court against 
media general and each of its directors asking a judge to order 
that his 6150 per share buyout offer worth about 16 billion be 
considered solely by the three directors elected by holders of the 
companys publiclyheld stock 
the suit also sought a ruling that shareholders voting as a 
single class could approve sugarmans offer by simple majority 
vote 
separately sugarman disclosed in a filing with the securities 
and exchange commission that he was undertaking a proxy battle to 
place himself and two others in the three seats on media generals 
board for holders of the class a publicly traded shares 
the disclosures mark the latest skirmish in the weekslong 
struggle between sugarman and the family of media generals 
chairman d tennant bryan which controls a majority of the 
companys voting power 
the family which has rejected sugarmans overtures repeatedly 
owns 71 percent of the companys class b common stock which is 
not publicly traded the 559168 class b shares have the voting 
power to elect seven of the companys 10 directors 
media general has 28 million publiclytraded class a shares 
which have one vote each and elect three directors 
sugarman who controls 10 percent of the companys class a stock 
and none of the class b has argued that the disproportionate 
voting rule doesnt apply if a holder of more than 10 percent of 
the companys stock proposes a merger media general says its 
counsel disagrees 
sugarmans suit said the bryans are thwarting a vote by 
stockholders even though their class b shares constitute only 14 
percent of the companys total equity 
david l jordan a media general vice president said the 
companys lawyers had reviewed the suit and think it is without 
merit 
media general sued sugarman and his companies in federal court 
monday asking the court to block the takeover attempt and force 
sugarman to sell his 10 percent holding 
the suit alleges sugarman submitted incomplete and inaccurate 
information to federal regulators about his proposed takeover 
sugarmans group includes barris industries inc of beverly 
hills calif which produces game shows and giant group ltd of 
harleyville sc which makes cement products 
media general owns several communications interests including 
richmond newspapers inc which publishes the richmond news leader 
and the richmond timesdispatch

wealthy entertainer merv griffin who late 
last year entered the hotel business by paying 100 million for the 
beverly hilton in beverly hills has offered 35 per share or 225 
million for resorts international inc 
but an attorney for new york real estate investor donald trump 
who controls about 90 percent of resorts voting power and is 
offering 22 per share to take the company private spurned the 
thursday offer as illusory and a blatant attempt at market 
manipulation 
trump is chairman of resorts international which operates 
hotelcasinos in new jersey and the bahamas 
griffins offer made by his privately owned griffin co 
investment concern is contingent on several conditions including 
a provision that trump agree to vote his shres in favor of the 
merger and agree to terminate his fiveyear management agreement 
for resorts atlantic city properties 
trump has no intention of agreeing to those conditions said 
his attorney jack nusbaum 
in light of the stance by trump resorts board decided at a 
thursday meeting that griffins offer was moot therefore the 
board decided not to withdraw its recommendation in favor of 
trumps 22pershare offer 
in response griffin spokesman mark gill said griffin is 
considering legal action against resorts outside directors for 
breach of fiduciary duty to shareholders other than trump three of 
resorts six directors are trump nominees 
despite insistence by trump that he would not raise his offer 
resorts stock closed thursday at 2525 per share up 337 
griffin said it decided to make the offer after talks with fv 
scutti a major holder of resorts class a common stock who is 
dissatisfied with trumps offer scutti owns about 5 percent of the 
htelcasino company 
resorts has 57 million class a shares outstanding each of 
which is entitled to one vote it also has 752000 class b shares 
nearly all of which are owned by trump and each of which has 100 
votes 
in atlantic city nj resorts which maintains corporate 
offices in both atlantic city and north miami fla owns the 
700room resorts casino hotel and undeveloped real estate facing 
the boardwalk and is building the 42floor 1250room taj mahal 
it also operates a casino and owns and operates hotel facilities 
with 1370 rooms on paradise island in the bahamas 
work on the luxurious and expensive taj mahal which will be the 
largest hotelcasino in new jersey when it is completed has been 
at the root of financial problems for resorts 
trump bought control of resorts when its stock was depressed by 
those difficulties and he was granted the fiveyear operating 
agreement of resorts atlantic city properties in exchange for 
agreeing to help raise financing to complete the taj mahal 
that financing hasnt yet been arranged and trump has offered 
22 per share to buy out other shareholders and take the company 
private initially trump had offered 15 per share but a number 
of class a shareholders sued and trump raised his offer to settle 
those suits a court hearing to approve those settlements is 
scheduled for friday in delaware where resorts is based 
nusbaum contended the offer by griffin was arranged by scutti in 
an effort to force trump to raise his bid again 
besides the beverly hilton the griffin co owns several radio 
stations and the nations largest supplier of closedcircuit tv 
systems which are widely used at facilities such as racetracks it 
also has extensive real estate holdings in beverly hills and 
northern california 
merv griffin is a 10time emmy award winner who served for 23 
years as host of the merv griffin show one of tvs 
longestrunning programs

pillsbury cos stock headed lower today 
after a twoday runup apparently dampened by a report of a 
largerthanexpected quarterly loss and word that the company was 
negotiating to sell its godfathers pizza chain 
rumors that the food and restaurant giant is a takeover target 
pushed pillsburys stock up more than 7 a share over the course of 
two days on thursday pillsbury closed at 4537 in heavy new 
york stock exchange trading 
but that trend reversed today when the stock fell 25 cents a 
share to 4512 
pillsbury said thursday it lost 1078 million during the third 
fiscal quarter 50 million more than anticipated and a sharp 
downturn from the 485 million or 56centsashare profit posted 
in the yearago period 
sales during the quarter fell to 15 billion from 153 billion 
a year earlier 
william spoor pillsbury chairman and chief executive 
acknowledged in a letter to shareholders given our many recent 
disappointments it is not surprising that we have raised investor 
skepticism and questions about our future 
but he said he remained committed to keeping the company 
independent now we must demonstrate through action and not 
words that we can perform at levels commensurate with our 
potential he said 
spoor said the quarterly loss which stemmed from 1409 million 
in restructuring charges to close businesses restaurant properties 
and plants would contribute to an earnings decline in fiscal 1988 
which ends may 31 
twothirds of the charges occurred in the companys restaurant 
division 
the 580unit godfathers chain which pillsbury acquired in 
1985 was put on the block because it did not have nearterm 
potential to be a major strategic component of pillsburys 
portfolio spoor stated 
company spokesman johnny thompson said negotiations were under 
way with the management team of omaha nebbased godfathers but 
he declined to comment on whether pillsbury had received any offers 
pillsbury earlier announced plans to sell its bay street key 
west grill and quik wok restaurant chains spoor said the company 
had received a letter of intent from an unidentified party to buy 
bay street 
however spoor reiterated that burger king the companys 
biggest restaurant operation is not for sale 
analysts had been expecting pillsbury to announce a 
restructuring including the sale of its steak amp ale bennigans 
and godfathers restaurant operations ever since chairman john 
stafford resigned last month and spoor took over as interim 
chairman 
pillsburys announcement in february of lowerthanexpected 
earnings for the fiscal year ended in may preceded staffords feb 
29 departure 
analysts have speculated that potential buyers for pillsbury 
could include swissbased nestle sa beatrice co of chicago and 
new york investor saul steinberg

the great us airline giveaway seems to be 
grinding to a halt 
worried about the potential financial impact of burgeoning 
frequentflier programs and triplemileage travel awards many 
major air carriers have imposed restrictions on the plans or are 
thinking of doing so 
the frequentflier plans which reward passengers with free 
tickets or upgrades to first class after they have flown a set 
number of miles were launched in 1981 to stimulate brand 
loyalty to airlines in a fiercely competitive climate 
the giveaway escalated to fever pitch at the beginning of this 
year when delta air lines introduced a new program to 
automatically triple the mileage accumulated by frequent fliers 
most big airlines quickly followed suit 
but the us airline industry is facing a staggering revenue 
loss if the estimated 8 million people enrolled in those programs 
start redeeming their bonuses and bumping paying passengers the 
accumulated value of those bonuses is around 124 billion reckons 
julius maldutis senior airline analyst for the investment firm 
salomon brothers inc 
that compares with total industry revenue of around 467 
billion in 1985 505 billion in 1986 and just over 60 billion 
last year 
the frequentflier programs have really gotten out of 
control said dan sheehy a spokesman for united airlines 
were concerned with the direction that the programs are taking 
john zeeman uniteds executive vice president for marketing and 
planning said in a speech early this month that the airline is 
considering imposing restrictions on its frequentflier programs 
he said the options under review include requiring that travel 
awards be redeemed by a certain deadline and even eliminating free 
trips and providing only firstclass upgrades instead 
if united decides to limit its program the changes would be 
announced in early may zeeman said 
many other airlines have recently slapped restrictions on their 
programs most notably by limiting the number of free tickets for 
any one flight but the limits being mulled by united a subsidiary 
of allegis corp and the nations largest airline are more 
farreaching and could be matched by the other carriers 
the last thing these airlines need is more damage on their 
balance sheets said peter tanous an editor of frequent a 
monthly newsletter on frequentflier programs published in colorado 
springs colo the airlines are scared stiff that they may be 
forced to take a hit against their earnings 
observers warn that the internal revenue service could decide to 
tax the programs sparking a mad rush by passengers to redeem 
their travel bonuses the irs indicated recently that it considers 
travel awards a form of reportable income when transportation costs 
for a frequent business flier are paid by an employer 
and the financial accounting standards board is expected to 
require airlines to provide for the liability of unredeemed awards 
in their 1988 financial statements 
the looming crisis has taken hold during an already turbulent 
period for the nations airline industry the business is coming 
off one of its worst safety performances in 1987 struggling with 
unions and threatened strikes against some big carriers and 
worrying about the possibility of a recession later in the year 
for now though many airlines are enjoying robust passenger 
traffic and earnings prompting them to raise fares recently and 
to eliminate some discount fares 
analysts say nearly all the major airlines except delta have 
started to limit their frequentflier largesse by instituting 
capacity control or reducing the number of freebies on a 
flight 
everyone else is doing it you have to control and manage your 
inventory said bob gibbons a spokesman for northwest airlines 
which will start capacity control on april 1 for bonuses issued 
after feb 15 
even holdout delta has blackout dates or certain peak 
travel periods when free tickets cannot be used delta the third 
largest airline also has the unique requirement that frequent 
fliers must charge their tickets on an american express card 
we want to remain competitive with the industry delta 
spokesman jim lundy said when asked what might happen if united 
instituted major restrictions 
some airlines also are looking at other approaches such as 
replacing free travel with merchandise awards or hotel and car 
rental premiums 
while they could significantly restrict their frequentflier 
programs the airlines are not about to eliminate them or 
triplemileage awards altogether observers say when the 
triplemileage plans were launched at the start of the year the 
carriers assured passengers that the popular gimmicks would be 
retained through 1988 
we recognize that there certainly is an economic impact 
associated with the triplemileage program said frank dinuzzo 
managing director of sales promotion for american airlines but he 
added american has no intention of canceling its program 
indeed some observers suggest the airlines may be caught in a 
sort of catch22 by their frequentflier programs forced to 
keep them because there is no way to end them 
i suspect that if the airlines had their druthers they would 
throw frequentflier programs into a bonfire because theyve just 
become so expensive said michael j friedman a vice president 
of shampe inc an aviation consulting firm 
however he noted it would be extremely difficult for a carrier 
to end its frequentflier program without all its competitors doing 
the same

while the major us airlines may be losing 
millions of dollars with their frequentflier programs and 
triplemileage travel awards a new study contends that companies 
are wasting as much as 12 billion a year on business travel 
the survey of 57 large and mediumsized companies by 
travelmation corp a travel agency based in stamford conn found 
that us businesses are squandering 10 percent to 15 percent of 
their annual travel budgets 
travel agents use of antiquated airline reservation systems 
that cant keep pace with fastchanging fares is the main cause of 
the waste according to the study 
airline analysts estimate that us carriers currently make 
around 40000 fare changes a day 
millions of dollars could be saved by companies each year 
without reducing quality by combining the use of advanced computer 
technology with a carefully worked out corporate travel plan 
said travelmation president louis van leeuwen who directed the 
survey 
conventional travel agencies whose methods worked well before 
deregulation of the us airline industry in 1978 are now unable 
to offer companies the best travel values van leeuwen said 
among the studys other findings 
conventional travel agencies even those equipped with 
computers cant keep track of constant fare changes 
many travel agents cant guarantee they will find flights at 
the lowest fares available 
many agents dont automatically process the dailychanging 
rules governing which fares can be used on which flights 
corporate travel policies are largely ignored by travel agents

the transpanama pipeline that 
carries alaska oil across the isthmus en route to markets on the 
us gulf coast resumed operations friday the pipeline said 
pumping had stopped because a strike by electrical workers cut 
off power wednesday and thursday prompting the panamanian 
government to announce it was taking over all public utilities 
service was restored at 6 am est this morning a 
spokesman for the pipeline operator said we actually never 
stopped loading and unloading at both ends we stopped the actual 
pumping from one end to the other because for that we depend on 
public energy but we have our own plant at each end for loading 
and unloading 
the pipeline carries 650000 barrels a day of alaska oil 
roughly 10 percent of us domestic production a barrel is 
equivalent to 42 gallons 
bp america inc owns twothirds to threequarters of the oil 
flowing through the pipeline the rest is owned by exxon co usa 
the flow was first halted at 2 pm est wednesday when 
electrical workers joined a widespread strike against gen manuel 
antonio noriega said tim reynolds a bp america spokesman in 
washington dc the strike cut off power to a pump station at the 
foot of a mountain he said 
the company was taking steps to set up a shiptoship transfer 
operation in order to put at least some of its oil through the 
canal but service was restored making thaat action unnecessary 
alaska officials were worried about a panama pipeline shutdown 
because it could slow sales of alaska crude which account for the 
bulk of state revenues 
west coast oil markets are glutted with alaska oil and the 
federal export ban prevents its sale overseas 
chuck logsdon chief oil revenue analyst for the state said the 
gulf coast markets have been handling more than 600000 barrels of 
the total daily alaska production of 18 million to 19 million 
barrels

a bipartisan presidential commission today 
told president reagan the government should begin a gradual but 
wholesale transfer of mail delivery air traffic control prison 
operations and scores of other services to the private sector 
controversial even before its submission the report by the 
presidential commission on privatization goes far beyond earlier 
proposals by reagan to sell off federal assets and reduce the scope 
of government 
the government with its checks and balances does not lend 
itself to managing high technology said the commissions 
chairman david linowes a democrat government entities have 
injected themselves well beyond the realm of government into 
business to the detriment of both business and government 
linowes a political economics professor at the university of 
illinois said at press conference after meeting privately with 
reagan that the president hasnt had an opportunity to read the 
report yet and did not indicate what if any of the suggestions 
the white house would push 
but he acknowledged that none of the recommendations is likely 
to be enacted before reagan leaves office next january 
this is the first time there has been an independent 
exhaustive analysis of the issues linowes said we didnt take 
on this job with the expectation that it would stay with just one 
administration 
the commission named last september by the president to expand 
upon his own privatization themes came up with 78 suggestions that 
it said would make government more efficient 
among the recommendations 
the postal services monopoly on delivering letters should be 
ended over time with private companies allowed to compete for the 
business 
a system of educational vouchers should be established to 
give parents greater freedom of choice in selecting elementary or 
secondary schools for their children linowes suggested vouchers of 
about 3000 a year and said they might be redeemable at private 
schools as well although at a discount 
the government should expand its voucher system for lowcost 
public housing instead of building new projects while selling 
existing public housing to residents where possible 
the management of military commissaries and federal state and 
local prisons should be contracted out 
airport control towers should be privately run although the 
government should continue to regulate the national airspace 
the report also called for privatization of elements of medicare 
and sale of the governments 250 billion loan portfolio and it 
echoed reagans own calls to sell off naval petroleum reserves 
urban mass transit systems and amtrak rail passenger service 
he seems to be gungho on it linowes said in an interview 
there were bound to be some overlaps 
many of these items proposed in annual reagan budget 
recommendations already have been rejected by a congress that to 
date has demonstrated little enthusiasm for privatization 
but linowes said he believes the concept will be more warmly 
received on capitol hill as the work product of a bipartisan 
commission 
the facts will argue for themselves linowes said he called 
the panels work an exhaustive analysis 
among the panels 12 members are james mcintyre jr who was 
budget director for president carter and melvin r laird 
secretary of defense under president nixon 
linowes a professor of political economy said that the panel 
is proposing a gradual turnover of government functions to private 
business in no place do we suggest it happen overnight that 
today youre a government agency and tomorrow youre not 
however the recommendations generated sharp advance opposition 
from public employees and postal workers unions 
the national association of letter carriers said ending the 
present postal service monopoly on first and thirdclass mail 
delivery would destroy the nations system of universal service 
rural and innercity residents would not be served or would 
receive reduced service at exorbitant postal rates the union 
said 
linowes however claimed the government could still demand 
postal delivery to all areas at the same price even if performed 
by private companies 
permeating all these recommendations is that the government 
must never abdicate its responsibility for establishing policy and 
standards he said 
on the proposal to contract out prison administration linowes 
said the government might pay a fee for each prisoner processed 
i can also see incentives given he added suggesting it 
might be a good way to whittle away at the nations 80 percent 
repeatoffender rate 
you could give a bonus if the released prisoner wasnt 
returned to jail for two years a bigger bonus if he stayed out for 
five less than two years no bonus there would be an incentive 
that doesnt exist now i can visualize teams of behavioral 
scientists and sociologists being hired as well as guards 
linowes said the report throws down a challenge for innovative 
thinking 
for instance there may be a question of whether amtrak can 
ever be made profitable under present circumstances but why cant 
the air space over railroad stations be leased out for 20 or 
30story office towers 
why should ticket agents stand around all day waiting to sell 
railroad tickets why cant they sell something else as well 
postcards or stamps we could bring in creative people from the 
private sector they could have circus cars running between new 
york and washington and charge 5 a head or we could have 
historical trips

running a retailing company has become a 
defensive business these days 
time was all management had to worry about was getting people 
in the front door now they have to fend off corporate raiders at 
the back door 
with takeover activity threatening their independence some 
companies have taken steps to protect themselves but others still 
cling to the myth that it cant happen here 
two weeks ago dart group corp dropped its bid for stop amp shop 
cos after stop amp shop agreed to a leveraged buyout by kohlberg 
kravis roberts inc analysts expect dart with a string of 
unsuccessful takeover attempts behind it to try for another 
retailer 
and if campeau corp loses to rh macy amp co inc in their 
battle over federated department stores inc the torontobased 
developer will probably pursue another major department store 
operator such as may department stores co or dayton hudson corp 
which retailers are the most likely targets 
the most vulnerable are companies whose stock is widely held 
rather than concentrated in the hands of a few insiders said

a squabble among british unions over singleunion 
representation at factories led ford motor co to cancel plans 
friday for an electronics plant in scotland 
ford said the proposed 73 million plant could not compete if 
its workers were represented by more than one union 
conservative party politicians reacted quickly accusing the 
unions of causing job losses in an economically depressed area 
the dundee fiasco is a tragic return to the socialist anarchy 
of the 1970s said michael heseltine a conservative lawmaker in 
parliament 
malcolm rifkind the governments scottish secretary criticized 
the unions for holding neanderthal attitudes 
ford said that it had reached agreement with the amalgamated 
engineering union to represent the initial work force of 450 
employees but that the 11 other unions also representing workers 
at fords current british plants balked plans called for the 
scottish factory to employ about 1000 workers at peak production 
britains unions are deeply divided about whether to accept 
singleunion deals and nostrike agreements which have become more 
common in this country particularly at japaneseowned plants 
union leaders have also been struggling to find a way to regain 
the power they lost under the legislation enacted by prime minister 
margaret thatchers conservative government 
years of relative labor calm have been disrupted by recent 
strikes at ford and other auto plants as well as walkouts by 
miners and nurses 
ford said there was no prospect of reaching an agreement for 
a single union to represent the plants hourly workers 
after very careful consideration we have decided not to 
proceed with development of a new electronics plant in scotland 
frank macher general manager of fords electrical and electronics 
division in detroit said in a statement 
a single trade union agreement was necessary to make the plant 
competitive in its industry in cost and quality macher said 
we had not expected that this requirement would prove so 
difficult to achieve 
norman willis general secretary of the trades union congress 
said he was calling two urgent meetings on monday to discuss the 
ford decision and to try to reverse it 
the 12 ford unions would meet the same day he said 
gavin laird leader of the amalgamated engineering union which 
represents about twothirds of fords more than 32000 hourly 
workers said he was pressing fords senior management for a 
toplevel meeting at its detroit headquarters early next week to 
try to save the plant 
however a ford spokesman in detroit john emmert said later in 
a telephone interview with independent television news there is 
no chance that the decision will be changed 
the deals opponents feared workers at the dundee plant would 
earn lower wages than workers at fords 21 other british plants

state officials moved friday to recover 
40 million they say american telephone amp telegraph co has added 
unfairly to the telephone bills of connecticut customers during the 
last two years 
in a complaint filed with the federal communications commission 
the officials challenged the telephone companys right to add a 73 
percent surcharge on longdistance charges to recoup the 
grossreceipts tax it pays in connecticut 
they argued that the surcharge imposed in connecticut and nine 
other states violates the longstanding practice of having uniform 
telephone rates across the country 
the other states where the surcharge is imposed are florida 
maine maryland new york rhode island vermont virginia west 
virginia and wisconsin according to the complaint filed with the 
fcc 
since the early days of the telephone company this country 
was built upon having an average rate throughout the country 
consumer counsel james f meehan said in announcing the action 
the thought was that people in montana should be able to call 
people in hartford at the same rate that people in hartford 
call people in montana he said 
meehan and attorney general joseph i lieberman have formed an 
alliance with the state department of public utility control in 
challenging federal regulators for allowing atampt to impose the 
surcharge 
the complaint seeks to recover the 40 million collected by atampt 
so far and to eliminate the surcharge 
the fcc allowed atampt to add the surcharge in states with a 
grossreceipts tax on longdistance companies starting in april 
1986 the surcharge in connectict was initially 36 percent but 
rose to 73 percent in january 
atampt is the only longdistance carrier regulated by the fcc 
although other longdistance companies such as sprint and mci also 
add the surcharge to their bills meehan said 
atampt officials responded that figuring the gross receipts tax 
into its national rates would be unfair to customers elsewhere in 
the country 
only connecticut residents benefit from the state gross 
receipts tax on telecommunications companies and therefore 
connecticut customers should pay those extra costs of doing 
business said paul karoff an atampt spokesman in connecticut 
meehan said atampt came up with the idea of imposing the surcharge 
in the 10 states with a gross receipts tax in order to generate 
millions of dollars that would allow it to reduce rates 
connecticut officials contend it is unfair given that the actual 
cost providing telephone service is lower in here than in many 
other parts of the country because of the high volume of business 
connecticut is the 10thlargest telecommunications market in the 
united states and generates about 550 million in annual revenues 
for atampt meehan said 
also atampt doesnt add surcharges to recover other types of 
taxes it pays they said 
the officials acknowledged it may be difficult to convince the 
fcc to hold a hearing on the complaint particularly since the fcc 
previously approved the surcharge they vowed to take the case to 
court if the fcc refuses to hear it 
there are fundamental issues of how rates are set in the 
country meehan said if we are successful i think create some 
new case law that will have major impact on rate setting practices 
throughout the federal system

dominos pizza inc advertises 
dominos delivers and the company delivered its annual report 
this year in an unmistakably shaped 12inchby12inch flipopen 
box 
that would be a small medium said ron hingst one of those 
involved in what has become a tradition of nontraditional annual 
reports 
the 1986 version was in the form of a spiral schoolstyle 
notebook with tabbed dividers for different subjects an earlier 
report came with a set of dominos 
its a chance for the financial guys to play marketing 
hingst said 
this years pizzastyle box contained a cardboard jigsaw puzzle 
of the dominos pizza name and trademark and the report with a 
quotation from thomas s monaghan chairman and founder on the 
cover 1987 was the year we worked hard to pull all the pieces 
together 
along with sections on areas such as development and service 
the report gave financial results reported earlier net income of 
77 million on total revenue of 8837 million for 1987 up from 
71 million on revenue of 7216 million for 1986 
because dominos is privatelyheld its annual report goes to 
suppliers media contacts and other people and companies it deals 
with hingst said

nestle sa the giant swiss multinational 
food group friday said it agreed to acquire the commercial and 
industrial holdings of italys buitoni food group for 16 trillion 
lire or 12 billion 
nestle said it was buying buitonis operations from cie 
industriali riunite spa cir a key holding of italian financier 
carlo de benedetti 
under the specifics of the transaction cir will sell all the 
operating units of buitoni spa its chocolate and confectionary 
company perugina spa and buitoni sa the french holding which 
controls buitonis foreign operations 
the acquisition represents the end of de benedettis dream of 
creating a major european food conglomerate which was frustrated 
by his failure to gain control of societe meridionale finanzaria 
spa sme italys major staterun food group 
the sale also raises a considerable sum of cash to help de 
benedetti in his fight to gain control of societe generale de 
belgique belgiums biggest company 
cir acquired control of buitoni in 1985 with an initial 
investment of 25 billion lire 20 million at todays exchange 
rates which was subsequently increased to 160 billion lire 
given the size of the initial investment analysts said de 
benedetti had achieved a remarkable return on his original 
investment 
it looks as if the engineer de benedetti has pulled out of 
the food industry in style the problem was that buitoni didnt 
reach sufficient critical mass said giovanni raimondi an 
analyst with milan brokerage studio aletti 
in 1987 the buitoni group earned consolidated net income before 
payments to minority interests of 408 million up from a loss of 
376 million in 1984 
buitoni produces pasta crackers and sauces in italy france and 
britain the perugiabased buitoni group also includes perugina 
one of italys leading chocolate producers as well as davigel sa 
of france which produces frozen food and food services olio sasso 
spa an edible oils group and vismara spa a meat producer 
the buitoni group which employs some 8000 people earned 39 
percent of its revenue in italy in 1987 36 percent in france 16 
percent in britain 4 percent in the rest of europe and 5 percent 
in the rest of the world 
nestle said it was particularly interested in the acquisiton of 
buitoni because it would give it a niche in the market for 
typically italian foods such as pasta it also will mesh perugina 
with its own chocolate sector

japans bridgestone corp agreed to buy firestone 
tire amp rubber co for nearly 26 billion in cash an offer that 
leaped far beyond a rival bid for firestone from the italian 
tiremaker pirelli spa 
pirelli which offered 193 billion for firestone said today 
from its headquarters in milan italy that it would not increase 
its offer later in a statement issued in new york the company 
said it would wait before making a final decision on dropping its 
current offer 
firestone directors announced the agreement to bridgestones 
80ashare offer late thursday and recommended that shareholders 
reject the pirelli bid 
firestone stock which had closed at 6250 a share on thursday 
shot up to 78 by midafternoon on the new york stock exchange 
bridgestone and firestone had announced an agreement in 
midfebruary that called for the japanese company to buy 75 percent 
of firestones worldwide tire manufacturing business for 15 
billion 
but after pirelli launched its bid last week bridgestone faced 
with losing the worlds fourth largest tire manufacturer decided 
to bid for the entire company 
we never considered backing away from our agreement with 
firestone to become its partner in operating its worldwide tire 
businesses bridgestone president akira yeiri said the merger 
agreement merely represents an expansion and extension of our 
original agreement 
in its statement in milan pirelli said it would not raise its 
bid 
pirelli has always said that its offer would be limited by its 
evaluation of industrial logic the statement said the figure 
offered by bridgestone does not fit into such logic 
but pirelli added in the later statement that it would wait 
until bridgestone formally began its tender offer for firestone 
before deciding whether to terminate its own offer 
yeiri said his company planned to keep firestones worldwide 
tire operations headquarters in akron ohio under existing 
management all of firestones north american plants will stay in 
operation 
firestone chairman john j nevin said a bridgestone subsidiary 
would begin a cash tender offer within the next few days for all of 
firestones 32 million outstanding shares the offer is subject to 
at least twothirds of the shares being tendered and approval of 
the deal by firestone shareholders 
bridgestone also has an option to acquire up to 58 million 
shares held by firestones treasury a lockup option typically 
granted to discourage hostile suitors 
firestone ranks fourth in tire sales worldwide behind industry 
leader goodyear michelin and bridgestone according to industry 
estimates 
in the fiscal year ending october 1987 firestone had net income 
of 145 million or 396 a share on sales of 387 billion 
firestones agreement with bridgestone was a major blow to 
pirelli which wants a foothold in the us tire market the 
worlds largest pirelli has a nominal 15 percent share of the 
us market 
sources close to pirelli said pirelli will continue to seek new 
markets 
there are always new opportunities in the us said one 
source speaking on condition of anonymity 
with the failure of its bid pirelli is canceling an agreement 
with frances michelin group pirelli had agreed to sell 
firestones retails stores division its brazilian operations and 
some other assets to michelin for as much as 800 million if its 
bid succeeded 
that agreement with michelin was contingent on us acquiring 
firestone so that goes up in the air a pirelli spokesman said

theres nothing roger kropf likes less than 
a bruised apple 
for years the lowell fruit grower has looked for a way to 
package the perfect fruit and to keep it that way during the long 
haul to the supermarket and eventually the consumers kitchen 
but no matter how we handle the product here it can be 
damaged any time starting at the point the trucks are unloaded at 
the store up until the consumer puts it in the refrigerator said 
kropf president of kropf fruit co 
kropfs company grows and markets its own apples peaches and 
plums and markets fruit for about 100 other growers across michigan 
kropf wrestled with a variety of ideas on how to protect produce 
from damage in shipment but it took a trip to an eggcarton 
company to get the answer 
i was standing in the production area of a company which makes 
polyfoam products and watching them make egg cartons kropf said 
i thought good lord if they can protect eggs they ought to be 
able to protect apples 
kropf began exploring the idea last year with dolco of decatur 
ill after a lengthy testing period the two companies produced a 
deepblue polyfoam container with wings to distribute the weight 
of stacked packages without damaging the fruit 
kropfs company began marketing fruit in the new containers in 
january 
much like the egg carton kropfs new container is a 12pack 
the container and contents are covered with a clear plastic film 
providing a view of the fruit 
the fruit is shipped in the specially designed packages and kept 
in them while on retailers shelves a 3pound package of apples 
averages about 25 cents more than the 3pound plastic bag of 
apples now found in supermarket produce departments 
this is really geared for only about 10 percent of the market 
for the clientele willing to pay a bit more for quality fruit 
said steve krampe sales manager for the company 
kropf ships his fruit throughout the united states east of the 
rockies and exports to foreign countries 
but the company isnt stopping at shipping the perfect apple it 
also plans to develop the special packaging for shipping peaches 
were very excited about the possibilities with peaches 
said krampe they bruise even more easily than apples

the founder and expresident of an 
irradiation company and a leading spokesman for the food 
preservation process was indicted friday on charges he ordered 
workers to bypass safety precautions and lied about it to federal 
regulators 
the company radiation technology inc of morris plains 
wednesday pleaded guilty to related charges involving violations at 
its rockaway plant rti irradiates medical products and spices 
company founder martin welt had planned to plead guilty to 
unspecified charges in the case the same day but withdrew from a 
plea agreement at the last moment said prosecutors in the us 
attorneys newark office 
welt 55 of denville withdrew as rtis president in mid1986 
after the federal nuclear regulatory commission temporarily 
suspended the companys license for the safety violations 
he has been one of the processs most vocal supporters touting 
it in the media and making a promotional trip to china last year 
welt also was a physicist with the nrcs predecessor the atomic 
energy commission 
also named in the 11count indictment was william jouris 48 of 
littleton mass in 1985 jouris was a resident nuclear engineer 
and operations manager at the rockaway plant the indictment said 
welt and jouris were charged with conspiracy to defraud the nrc 
making false statements and violating the atomic energy act welt 
also was charged with obstruction of justice 
welts attorney theodore h wells said he had not seen the 
indictment and could not comment he also refused to comment on the 
apparent breakdown in plea negotiations welt did not return a 
message left on his answering machine 
jouris could not be reached for comment he did not return a 
message left on his home answering machine attorney robert 
fettweis who prosecutors said has represented jouris did not 
return a message left at his office 
the indictment said the defendants bypassed or told others to 
bypass conveyor door safety interlocks at the rockaway plant 
the devices automatically lower the radiation source in this case 
cobalt 60 into a protective pool when a human or an object other 
than the product to be irradiated enters the area 
welt ordered the locks routinely bypassed starting in april 
1984 the indictment said and sought to impede an nrc 
investigation into the matter 
the criminal investigation grew out of the nrc probe which led 
to a pair of temporary license suspensions in 1986 
welt called a meeting and threatened rti workers with dismissal 
if they didnt lie to investigators the indictment said 
jouris was accused of removing a radiation safety monitor that 
prevented workers from being inadvertently exposed to radiation 
the company has said no worker or member of the public was 
harmed because of the violations 
assistant us attorney jacqueline c wolff said authorities 
know of at least one worker who entered the cell area while 
products were being irradiated but said the worker suffered no 
immediate injury 
she said it was difficult to measure the health affects of the 
safety violations because the results of lowlevel dosages dont 
appear until years later 
she said the safety interlocks frequently malfunctioned 
preventing the irradiation process from going on so company 
officials bypassed them to keep operating 
the indictment said jouris and welt lied to the nrc about the 
installation of a new conveyor door safety system at the rockaway 
plant telling regulators during a routine inspection that it had 
tested a new system in tandem with the old system for two weeks 
before dismantling the old one 
instead the indictment charged the old system was taken apart 
and the new one installed without testing 
welt faces up to 37 years in prison if convicted and jouris 
faces 22 years 
rti also has operations in salem nj west memphis ark and 
haw river nc

wheat futures prices advanced while soybeans and 
corn skidded lower friday on the chicago board of trade 
wheat was about the only market that showed any strength 
said victor lespinasse a trader with dean witter reynolds inc 
soybeans dropped about a nickel a bushel despite heavy buying 
again friday by a large speculator who triggered a strong rally on 
thursday 
fridays buying by the c amp d commodities was accompanied by 
heavy selling of soybean options negating any strong response by 
other traders said lespinasse 
he said beans were under pressure from selling by south american 
interests and by traders unloading contracts before the weekend 
increased farmer selling overnight weakened the corn market 
a rumor that the agriculture department was about to make an 
announcement of a large offer of subsidized wheat helped that 
grain said lespinasse 
on the close wheat was 1 cent to 3 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in march at 299 a bushel corn was cent

bridgestone corp of japan plans to create 
the mosttechnologically advanced tire company in the world when it 
purchases firestone tire amp rubber co bridgestone president akira 
yeiri said friday 
firestones board of directors recommended thursday that 
shareholders accept bridgestones offer to purchase firestones 32 
million outstanding shares for 80 a share bridgestone was spurred 
to make the 26 billion offer thursday because of an unsolicited 
offer from italian tiremaker pirelli spa 
pirelli did not make a counter offer friday the italian firm 
said in a news release that it will await the merger of bridgestone 
and firestone before making a final decision on terminating its 
58ashare offer 
firestone shareholders meet in akron on tuesday

wants to become a global tiremaker with the most efficient 
production facilities and the most effective marketing organization 
in the world 
the bridgestonefirestone alliance brings together many 
complimentary strengths yeiri told a news conference at 
firestones north american tire headquarters in akron together 
we have the design and manufacturing capability necessary to build 
highquality tires and to improve our global competitive position 
bridgestone plans to keep firestones corporate offices in 
chicago and its north american tire headquarters in akron he said 
all of firestones north american plants will remain in operation

in the meantime bridgestone still plans to move its north 
american sales operation from los angeles to nashville tenn 
bridgestone purchased a plant outside nashville from firestone in 
1983

ford and general motors and has made considerable progress in the 
international market with porche volvo audi and volkswagon

from bridgestone assets and bridgestone will borrow the rest the 
japanese tire maker decided 80 a share would be a fair offer after 
consulting with investment bankers he said 
in midfebruary firestone announced an agreement to sell 75 
percent of its worldwide tire manufacturing business to bridgestone 
for 15 billion but that agreement was in jeopardy after pirelli 
launched its tender offer for the entire company last week

pillsbury cos report of a 
largerthanexpected quarterly loss ended a twoday runup in its 
stock price that was spurred by takeover speculation but analysts 
said friday that the company remained vulnerable 
i dont think anything has really changed said craig carver 
of dain bosworth inc in minneapolis i think this company is 
still a very strong takeover possibility even though the stock has 
traded down somewhat today 
in active trading on the new york stock exchange pillsbury 
closed down 250 to 4287 
speculation that the minneapolis food and restaurant giant was a 
takeover target had pushed the companys stock up more than 7 a 
share from wednesday to thursday 
but that trend reversed friday pillsbury announced thursday it 
lost 1078 million during its third fiscal quarter 50 million 
more than anticipated and a sharp downturn from the 485 million 
or 56centsashare profit posted in the yearago period 
sales during the quarter fell to 15 billion from 153 billion 
a year earlier 
william spoor pillsbury chairman and chief executive said the 
quarterly loss stemmed from 1409 million in restructuring charges 
to close businesses restaurant properties and plants he said he 
expected earnings to decline in fiscal 1988 which ends may 31 
pillsbury said it would continue streamlining its troubled 
restaurant and food groups and was negotiating to sell its 
godfathers pizza chain the company said it would rally around its 
core businesses such as burger king and haagendazs ice cream 
the moves however failed to impress analysts 
godfathers is a drop in the bucket in this whole company 
carver said i would think regardless of what they do short of 
going out and making a major acquisition in an attempt to make 
themselves unattractive is not going to deter a possible raider or 
for that matter a friendly buyout attempt 
the sale of godfathers is unlikely to generate cash proceeds 
exceeding 50 million to me investors want more added john m 
mcmillin of prudentialbache securities in new york i think 
people want more restructuring 
the 580unit godfathers chain acquired by pillsbury in 1985 
is being sold because it does not have nearterm potential to 
be a major strategic component of pillsburys portfolio spoor 
said 
pillsbury which employs about 104000 worldwide with 97200 
workers in the united states had no comment friday on whether it 
had received any takeover offers 
analysts have speculated that potential buyers for pillsbury 
included swissbased nestle sa beatrice co of chicago and new 
york investor saul steinberg 
in a letter to shareholders thursday spoor said he was 
committed to keeping pillsbury independent

less than a week before insider trader ivan f 
boesky was to start serving a federal prison term officials 
declined to discuss his whereabouts friday and there were 
indications he might already be in custody 
the mystery of the exfinanciers location came against a 
background of death threats made against him raising the 
possibility that he might have sought federal protection prior to 
his scheduled surrender date of march 24 
boesky the central figure in wall streets biggest insider 
trading scandal was sentenced to a threeyear prison term for 
securities fraud last dec 18 by us district judge morris e 
lasker 
the judge recommended that the exfinancier spend the time at a 
minimum security facility in lompoc calif he permitted boesky to 
remain free pending the surrender date 
but according to the bureau of prisons computerized prison 
locator service in washington boesky was listed as in transit 
meaning he was no longer free on bail and was in custody 
locator service dispatchers who declined to be identified by 
name said boesky had been assigned a prisoner identification 
number 13987054 the last three digits indicated he was in the 
jurisdiction of the federal marshals office in manhattan they 
said 
flip lorenzoni an official of the marshals office said he 
could not comment on boeskys whereabouts and referred inquiries to 
a regional office in philadelphia 
that office referred questions to bureau of prisons spokeswoman 
kathryn morse who said a prison was chosen for boesky a few weeks 
ago but she declined to identify it until after his arrival in 
accordance with government policy she would not comment on whether 
boesky already had been placed in custody 
john carroll an assistant us attorney handling the boesky 
case declined to discuss boeskys whereabouts saying thats 
not a question im inclined to answer 
boeskys attorney theodore levine did not return repeated 
telephone calls to his washington office 
officials familiar with the federal prisoner assignment system 
said it was likely that boesky would go to lompoc a former army 
barracks near the pacific coast about 150 miles northwest of los 
angeles 
in a telephone interview lompoc warden richard rison declined 
to confirm or deny boeskys impending arrival but said highly 
publicized prisoners tended to check in unannounced before their 
surrender deadline in order to avoid press photographers at the 
gate 
if i was speculating i would say he wont be here on the 
24th rison said i just wouldnt believe hed plan to come 
with a lot of fanfare 
rison emphasized his remarks did not necessarily mean boesky had 
been assigned to lompoc 
formerly one of wall streets bestknown speculators boesky was 
fined a record 100 million in november 1986 to settle charges of 
insider trading which is the illicit use of confidential corporate 
information to profit in securities trading 
under a pleabargain arrangement boesky promised to cooperate 
in implicating others in exchange for pleading guilty to a single 
felony count conspiracy to lie to the sec which carried a 
maximum punishment of five years imprisonment and 250000 fine 
boeskys cooperation has raised expectatations of major 
indictments for securities fraud on wall street 
last month john mulheren a former boesky friend and fellow 
stock speculator was arrested on charges he plotted to kill boesky 
and a boesky aide because he thought they had implicated him

livestock futures prices advanced friday on the chicago 
mercantile exchange as traders jockeyed their positions before the 
government released its cattleonfeed report 
on other markets oil futures moved higher for the fourth 
consecutive day wheat was higher while corn and soybeans declined 
and treasury bonds retreated sharply 
the cattleonfeed report released by the agriculture 
department after the close of trading was not far off from what 
was expected 
the data probably will be only slightly bearish for the nearby 
april and june contracts said chuck levitt an analyst in chicago 
with shearson lehman hutton inc 
the survey of seven leading cattle states indicated that there 
were 6 percent more cattle on feed as of march 1 than a year 
earlier the number of animals placed on feed during february was 5 
percent fewer than 12 months ago while the marketings was put at 3 
percent above the yearago figure 
because the distant contract months are at a substantial 
discount to the nearby deliveries traders will be inclined to sell 
april and june deliveries and buy the back months levitt said 
live cattle settled 05 cent lower to 22 cent higher with the 
contract for delivery in april at 7377 cents a pound feeder 
cattle were 10 cent to 32 cent higher with march at 8212 cents a 
pound live hogs were 30 cent lower to 40 cent higher with april 
at 4620 cents a pound and frozen pork bellies were 25 cent lower 
to 165 cents higher with march at 5580 cents a pound 
oil futures prices advanced for the fourth consecutive day on 
the new york mercantile exchange 
fridays advances were a continuation of a rally begun near the 
close of the previous session after opec president rilwanu lukman 
announced hed have something to say next tuesday about stabilizing 
prices said nauman barakat a analyst in new york with smith 
barney harris upham amp co 
my feeling though is that they wont do anything but 
continue to talk up the market for a couple weeks he said 
after that the seasonal demand for gasoline will pick up and so 
opec wont have to do anything to shore up prices 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 13 cents to 30 cents 
higher with the april contract at 1658 a barrel heating oil was 
52 cent to 83 cent higher with april at 4505 cents a gallon and 
unleaded gasoline was 16 cent to 39 cent higher with april at 
4599 cents a gallon 
treasury bond futures plunged sharply on the chicago board of 
trade responding to what analysts said were renewed fears of 
inflation 
thursdays balance of trade figures helped the dollar and the 
bond market initially but further examination of the data gave the 
markets a different view said jack barbanel an analyst in new 
york with gruntal amp co 
inflation fears came not only from the trade data he said but 
also from the rising crb index which was partially influenced by 
the 1abarrel gain by oil over the last four sessions 
treasury bonds lost 1 932 points with the june contract 
settling at 91 132 points 
wheat futures prices advanced while soybeans and corn skidded 
lower on the chicago board of trade 
wheat was about the only market that showed any strength 
said victor lespinasse a trader with dean witter reynolds inc 
soybeans dropped about a nickel a bushel despite heavy buying 
again friday by a large speculator who triggered a strong rally on 
thursday 
fridays buying by the c amp d commodities was accompanied by 
heavy selling of soybean options negating any strong response by 
other traders said lespinasse 
he said beans were under pressure from selling by south american 
interests and by traders unloading contracts before the weekend 
increased farmer selling overnight weakened the corn market 
a rumor that the agriculture department was about to make an 
announcement of a large offer of subsidized wheat helped that 
grain said lespinasse 
after the close the usda said it offered the soviet union 1 
million tons of wheat 
wheat settled 1 cents to 3 cents higher with the march 
contract at 299 a bushel corn was cent to 1 cent lower with 
march at 198 a bushel oats were unchanged to 3 cents higher 
with march at 196 a bushel and soybeans were 3 cents to 6 cents 
lower with march at 620 a bushel 
precious metals futures posted gains on the commodity exchange 
in new york 
gold was 30 cents higher with the april contract at 44520 a 
troy ounce and silver was 6 cents to 61 cents higher with march 
at 6365 a troy ounce

young families trying to purchase their first 
home and lowincome families struggling to meet escalating rental 
payments are two groups which have suffered the most from flawed 
housing policies in the 1980s according to a new study released 
thursday 
america is increasingly becoming a nation of housing haves and 
havenots said h james brown one of the authors of the report 
and the director of the joint center for housing studies at harvard 
university while a majority of americans are wellhoused too 
many americans have not been able to share in this prosperity 
the report titled the state of the nations housing 
contended that the number of americans unable to secure decent and 
affordable housing was growing at an alarming rate among its 
findings 
since 1981 rental costs including utilities have risen 14 
percent faster than prices generally after adjusting for 
inflation rental costs are now at their highest level in two 
decades 
the steep increase in rental costs means that singleparent 
households must devote 584 percent of their incomes to rent 
compared to 349 percent in 1974 
homeownership rates have fallen steadily during this decade 
particularly among young people in 1980 433 percent of 
households in the 2429 age group owned their own home a figure 
that has now declined to 359 percent 
the aftertax cost of buying a typical first home in 1987 was 
7449 or 324 percent of the average annual income of potential 
firsttime buyers about 50 percent higher than the share of income 
required in the early 1970s 
the study which was financed by a grant from the ford 
foundation and several housing trade groups did not make any 
recommendations for needed changes in government policy 
the reagan administration has been criticized in the past for 
its efforts to scale back federal housing assistance programs but 
brown said it was important to realize that the countrys housing 
problems were a result of a number of forces which have been at 
work well before the current administration took office 
in reacting to the report carl d covitz undersecretary of the 
department of housing and urban development said that the 
administration was proud of its efforts in the past seven years to 
boost housing subsidies to lowincome families but realized much 
more needs to be done 
its never been easy for the typical family to buy their first 
home or for very lowincome people to afford decent housing and the 
harvard study performs a valuable service by pointing up some of 
the very real problems still faced by many american families 
covitz said in a statement 
william apgar another author of the report said that one 
particular problem was that even minimal federal housing assistance 
was reaching only one in four families in need 
only one in four rentor households with incomes at or below 
the poverty level live in public housing or receive some other form 
of federal housing assistance apgar said

the nations farm sector is continuing a 
strong recovery that began in 1987 with recordhigh net cash 
income the agriculture department said thursday 
cash income is still expected to recede from last years 57 
billion to between 50 billion and 55 billion in 1988 the 
departments economic research service said in a new outlook report 
the projected decline will result from lower livestock receipts 
rising expenses and lower government payments the report said 
those will more than offset a rise in 1988 crop receipts 
net cash income is the difference between gross cash income and 
cash expenses in the calendar year 
the income and debtservice problems that plagued agriculture 
during the 1980s have largely been weathered although financial 
problems persist for some producers who acquired longterm debt at 
high interest rates the report said 
a major contributor to increased cash flow is a marked 
reduction in interest expenses since the difficult 198083 years 
economists said receipts from crop sales are improving as a 
result of increased domestic and export demand for major 
commodities including wheat and corn 
receipts from livestock sales should be off slightly as red 
meat and poultry production expands almost 2 percent and prices 
falter the report said fruit prices this spring will be below 
a year ago as larger supplies come to market

speculation that pillsbury co had been 
targeted for a takeover bid sent the food and restaurant companys 
stock soaring for a second straight day thursday 
pillsbury jumped 350 a share to close at 4550 a share in 
heavy new york stock exchange composite trading about 348 million 
shares changed hands compared with average trading volume in the 
stock of 11 million shares a day 
analysts speculated that potential buyers included swissbased 
nestle sa beatrice co of chicago and new york investor saul 
steinberg 
pillsbury spokesman johnny thompson declined to comment thursday 
on whether the company has received any offers the companys 
rumored suitors earlier had also declined to comment 
anything could be true here said robert cummins food 
industry analyst at wertheim schroder amp co in new york the main 
story is that nestle wants to acquire them for 55 per share 
piper jaffray amp hopwood analyst stephen carnes said he suspects 
the rumors have pillburys executives scrambling for an 
acquisition to increase their companys debt and make it a less 
desirable takeover target 
the management at beatrice which went private in 1986 has 
nearly finished retiring the debt incurred in its leveraged buyout 
of the company under chairman donald kelly beatrice has profited 
from divesting itself of some units and is said to be looking to 
acquire a whole food company 
carnes said wednesday he doubts that kelly is interested in 
pillsbury for its breakup value instead carnes a former 
pillsbury executive said rumblings of a 55ashare offer by 
nestle make more sense 
analysts have been expecting pillsbury to announce a 
restructuring including the sale of its steak amp ale bennigans 
and godfathers restaurant operations since chairman john 
stafford resigned last month interim chairman william spoor has 
insisted pillsburys largest restaurant operation the burger king 
fastfood chain is not for sale 
pillsburys announcement in february of lowerthanexpected 
earnings for the fiscal year ended in may preceded staffords feb

roper corp said friday it accepted 
a sweetened 470 million buyout offer from whirlpool corp which 
filed suit charging that general electric corp tried to 
sabotage the deal with a competing bid 
roper said its board reviewed both offers before recommending 
whirlpools 50ashare cash tender offer to shareholders 
on the new york stock exchange friday ropers stock jumped 
575 a share to close at 53 
the bid tops the 3750ashare whirlpool offer made last month 
which prompted a bidding war for the augusta gabased maker of 
garden equipment and cooking ranges on march 6 ge said it would 
pay 45 a share or about 423 million for ropers outstanding 
shares 
whirlpool chairman david r whitwam said the higher bid 
underscores whirlpools determination to complete our agreedupon 
merger with roper despite the deliberate and heavyhanded 
interference of general electric 
in a suit filed friday in us district court in grand rapids 
whirlpool charged that ge knew whirlpool and roper had signed an 
acquisition agreement and intentionally sought to block that merger 
the suit seeks a court order barring ge from acquiring any 
interest in roper or interfering in a whirlpoolroper merger 
whirlpool alleged that the head of ges appliance business 
personally tried to persuade roper to break its contract with 
whirlpool the suit said ge intentionally maliciously and 
unjustifiedly engaged in a continuing course of conduct to 
sabotage the deal 
bruce bunch a spokesman at ge headquarters in fairfield conn 
said the lawsuit grossly misstates the facts and is utterly 
without merit 
we clearly have not interfered he said our offer is 
directly to the roper shareowners 
analysts say the merger will move whirlpool ahead of ge as the 
nations leading appliance maker whirlpool has said it would 
expand roper from a maker of ranges into a producer and marketer of 
a full line of appliances 
roper has a strong desire to see this combination successfully 
completed said roper chief executive officer robert cook 
whirlpools whitwam also noted that the merger is of strategic 
importance 
on thursday whirlpool and ge disclosed that the federal trade 
commission was investigating the outstanding tender offers for 
roper both companies indicated they would respond promptly 
whirlpool said in a statement that a thorough ftc review would 
conclude that a ge takeover would have serious anticompetitive 
effects 
whirlpool extended its offer through midnight est march 31

international paper co said friday it planned 
to begin discussions with union representatives aimed at resolving 
bitter labor disputes at several plants around the country 
officials for the company and the united paperworkers 
international union said they had agreed to meet with 
intermediaries within the next several weeks 
the meetings are intended to defuse the hostility between 
management and labor and set up a framework for pursuing the 
companys labor problems on a local level the company said 
the company and the union have been at odds for more than a year 
over contracts that have come up for renewal at the heart of the 
disagreements is the issue of whether local contracts should 
restore premium pay for sundays and holidays 
premium pay had been eliminated with labors approval from past 
contracts but since the industrys fortunes have improved in the 
last year the union has campaigned to revive the benefit 
the parties recognize that continuation of the adversarial 
relationship is not in the best interests of either party and have 
committed themselves not only to resolution of the current disputes 
but to building a proper relationship for the future said a 
statement released from the companys headquarters in purchase ny 
bob frase assistant to the president of the union which is 
based in nashville tenn said the union was encouraged by the 
prospect of the talks 
anytime we can sit down and talk thats positive said 
frase 
but he cautioned as did the company that the talks would not 
involve formal contract negotiations a final resolution of the 
disputes affecting at least seven plants might be hammered out 
later at the local level the company suggested 
about 3500 workers in four locations are embroiled in contract 
fights in mobile ala 1200 workers have been locked out of 
their jobs by the company while an additional 2300 have struck 
plants in jay maine lock haven pa and depere wis frase said 
contracts also are open pine bluff and camden ark and 
natchez miss said holly kinser a spokeswoman for the company 
analysts who follow international paper said the talks were a 
step in the right direction 
it can be significant if out of it comes a settlement said 
lawrence ross of the investment firm painewebber group inc 
although the companys plants have continued to operate through 
the disturbances the analysts said the bitter struggle with the 
union has hindered the companys performance at a time when the 
industry has turned profitable 
the mills are all running with replacement workers but 
efficiency has been affected said mark rogers of 
prudentialbache securities inc 
the company said it earned 305 million in 1986 and expects to 
post earnings of 407 million for 1987 when final figures are 
released next week however the company said its profitability was 
below the industry average in both 1986 and 1987 when measured in 
terms of its net worth 
the announcement said the company and the union had asked 
malcolm r lovell jr a professor of government and business at 
george washington university and gayle wineriter special 
assistant to the director of the federal mediation and conciliation 
service to assist in the talks 
the stock market greeted the news indifferently sending 
international paper shares down 25 cents to 4437 per share in 
new york stock exchange trading

a federal judge friday set a january court date in 
polaroid corps 57 billion patent infringement claim against 
eastman kodak co 
judge rya zobel set a jan 9 1989 trial date in the 
12yearold case and ordered pretrial evidence be presented to the 
court on july 27 
in 1985 zobel ruled that kodak had infringed on seven of about 
150 polaroid patents on instant cameras and film 
in january 1986 zobel barred the rochester nybased kodak 
from the instant photography business pioneered by polaroid 
the damage award amount filed last month in federal court in 
boston has increased polaroid stock value and also triggered 
speculation that a corporate raider may seek control of the 
cambridgebased company in anticipation of a big settlement 
kodak however has labeled the claim as ludicrous and 
excessively high several analysts predict a settlement between 1 
billion to 2 billion 
a 1 billion award would translate to about 10 per share for 
polaroid 
polaroid which was trading in the low 20 a share before the 
damage claim was announced closed friday down at 34 on the new 
york stock exchange kodak closed down at 42 
polaroid claims 32 billion in lost camera and film sales and 
seeks an additional 25 billion for lost opportunities to develop 
and market new products 
polaroid which introduced instant photography in 1948 held a 
monopoly in the field until kodak entered the market in the late 
1970s 
polaroid camera sales peaked at 75 million in 1978 before 
sinking to 34 million in 1984 sales rebounded to 44 million in 
1986 after the introduction of the spectra camera which offered 
better quality prints but fell 16 percent last year 
polaroid next month plans to introduce two new cameras the 
spectra 600 and image

black amp decker corp friday sweetened its bid 
again for american standard inc to 77 per share or about 24 
billion cash one day after the plumbing conglomerates board 
approved a 78pershare leveraged buyout 
we believe that our offer of 77 in the light of timing and 
probability of payment from the leveraged buyout represents a 
better choice for american standard stockholders black amp decker 
chairman nolan b archibald said in a statement 
american standard which has fought black amp deckers bid for 
nearly two months said after a marathon board meeting thursday 
that it would recommend its stockholders accept a 245 billion 
cash offer led by kelso amp co a new york investment banking firm 
specializing in employeeled leveraged buyouts 
the kelso buyout plan under which an employee stock ownership 
plan or esop would acquire 20 percent of the company topped 
black amp deckers previous bid of 73 a share or 23 billion 
stephen f page black amp deckers treasurer and vice president 
for finance said officials of the towson mdbased tool and 
appliance maker were confident they could acquire american 
standard but he indicated they were reaching their limit 
its always tough to say never page said but i dont see 
what would be there to make us go higher i just have a hard time 
seeing anything there 
american standard spokeswoman lois stewart said the company 
would have no comment 
black amp decker initially proposed a buyout at 65 a share later 
sweetening its bid to 68 and finally to 73 before making its 
latest bid 
american standard fell 50 cents to close at 7587 a share on 
the new york stock exchange friday black amp decker closed at 
2062 up 112 a share 
american standard has about 315 million common shares 
outstanding 
black amp deckers bid came despite analysts speculation thursday 
that the bidding war for american standard was over citing the 
size of the premium kelso was offering over the market price 
but black amp decker said it hiked the bid again after reviewing 
the information supplied by american standard and after a due 
diligence session with american standard management 
black amp decker also cited a delaware court ruling on tuesday 
invalidating the golden parachute and pension fund lockup put 
into place by american standard after black amp decker commenced its 
offer 
archibald said the action of the court would have justified an 
additional increase but we have to take into account the breakup 
fees and other costs that american standard has incurred since the 
date of that decision 
black amp decker set midnight march 31 as an expiration date for 
its tender offer 
american standard a maker of plumbing and air conditioning 
equipment said its definitive agreement with kelso is subject to 
kelso obtaining necessary financing 
american standard said kelso planned to finance the deal through 
a 18 billion loan to be syndicated by bankers trust co a 900 
million shortterm bridge loan from first boston securities 
corp an affiliate of the investment bank and 250 million of 
common equity from kelso and certain institutional investors 
kelso specializes in leveraged buyouts involving employee stock 
ownership plans or esops a concept it pioneered about 30 years 
ago 
the company added it expected a newly formed esop would acquire 
about 20 percent of american standards common shares 
in a leveraged buyout a company is acquired largely through 
borrowed money repaid from the target companys profits or sale of 
assets esops also are financed mostly with borrowed funds but 
equity is divided among all of the companys workers rather than 
just a few investors 
ms stewart said american standard which repeatedly rejected 
black amp deckers earlier overtures had received several offers but 
she refused to identify the bidders 
page said black amp decker plans to sell american standards 
transportation division 
under the kelso offer american standards management likely 
would remain largely intact but the company might be forced to sell 
its transportation division and new york headquarters to help 
reduce debt incurred in the buyout

texaco inc suggested late friday that back 
taxes owed to the federal government likely would total less than 
1 billion not the 65 billion originally suggested two months 
ago 
the oil giant made the suggestion in an announcement that it had 
reached a framework agreement to review all tax claims with the 
internal revenue service the agreement removed one of the last 
remaining impediments to texacos efforts to extricate itself from 
federal bankruptcy protection 
the nations thirdlargest oil company sought bankruptcy court 
refuge nearly a year ago because of a protracted court struggle 
with the much smaller pennzoil co which held a 103 billion 
damage claim against texaco 
pennzoil won the mammoth judgment from a texas jury that decided 
texaco had wrecked pennzoils agreement to buy part of getty oil 
co in 1984 by acquiring getty itself 
last december pennzoil agreed to drop the claim in exchange for 
3 billion cash setting in motion a complex process under which 
texaco would emerge from bankruptcy as a smaller restructured 
company 
but under the bankruptcy laws texacos other creditors had to 
state their estimated claims against the company before it emerged 
from bankruptcy in january the irs as a priority creditor 
indicated texaco might owe 65 billion in back taxes based on an 
audit of the company for 1965 through 1986 
if the irs were correct industry analysts said the back taxes 
would likely have crippled the company 
the irs claim stemmed from a theory the agency had developed 
that would have raised the market value of saudi oil handled by 
texaco during some of the years in question theoretically the irs 
might have demanded texaco pay taxes on what the company would have 
earned had it sold the oil for a higher price 
although analysts were certain the final tax bill would total 
much less the agreement announced friday marked the first time a 
figure in the 1 billion range was suggested 
under the agreement texaco will make cash deposits against tax 
claims totaling 1 billion over a fouryear period with the first 
installment of 200 million on the date its bankruptcy 
reorganization is approved and 200 million thereafter on each of 
the next four anniversary dates 
texacos announcement implied the final bill might even be less 
than 1 billion because of a provision that any leftover money will 
be returned to the company the company also downplayed the 
significance of the irs claim compared with the taxes texaco pays 
during the course of one year 
the amount of the deposits provided for in the agreement 
which cover outstanding tax claims spanning a period of 13 years 
should be viewed in the context of the 38 billion in direct taxes 
the company incurred in 1987 alone on its 358 billion in business 
revenue worldwide texaco said 
texaco officials declined to comment further because of what 
they called an arrangement with the irs not to elaborate on the 
agreement 
ellen murphy public affairs director for the irs in washington 
said the 1 billion figure represented only money to be deposited 
for claims and obviously its too soon to say what size liability 
were talking about 
nevertheless accountants familiar with irs policies on large 
backtax claimssuggested that if the agency felt texaco might owe 
more than 1 billion it would have demanded a bigger deposit
