a federal court jury convicted a woman monday of 
killing her husband and another woman by lacing their 
extrastrength excedrin with cyanide in the nations first trial in 
a death by product tampering 
the 12member jury deliberated almost five days before returning 
the verdict against stella nickell one juror held out for 
acquittal until the final vote said the jury foreman murray m 
andrews 55 
mrs nickell 44 of suburban auburn was convicted on each 
count she faced two of causing death by tampering with a product 
involved in interstate commerce and three of tampering the first 
two counts could result in life sentences 
king county prosecutor norm maleng said he would wait until 
after sentencing scheduled for june 17 to decide whether to file 
state murder charges 
when the verdict was read by the clerk mrs nickell bowed her 
head 
the charges stemmed from the june 1986 deaths of her husband 
bruce nickell 52 and of sue katherine snow 40 also of auburn 
both died after ingesting the poisoned painkillers 
the deaths touched off a nationwide tampering scare and prompted 
excedrin manufacturer bristolmyers co to recall its capsuled 
nonprescription medications 
seven people died in chicago in 1982 from cyanidelaced 
extrastrength tylenol but those deaths remain unsolved 
john weisberg spokesman for the new yorkbased bristolmyers 
said the company was gratified by the jurys verdict and 
particularly appreciative of the efforts of the fbi and other law 
enforcment authorities 
product tampering is intolerable to society when it occurs 
every effort must be made to identify those responsible and to 
bring them to justice he said 
were very pleased its finally over it was a tough case for 
the jury to decide said assistant us attorney joanne maida 
who said she would ask for an appropriately severe sentence 
she did not elaborate 
ms maida said she hoped it will be a deterrent to future 
drugtamperers 
during the trial ms maida portrayed mrs nickell as an icy 
hard human being unhappy in her marriage and beset by financial 
problems and accused mrs nickell of poisoning her husband to 
collect on his life insurance policies 
ms snow was an innocent stranger caught in mrs nickells 
scheme to make her husbands death appear random the prosecutor 
said 
but federal public defender thomas hillier said mrs nickell was 
the victim of a daughter who lied when she said her mother had 
discussed killing nickell with a drug overdose or by hiring a hit 
man 
the prosecution said mrs nickell put tainted painkillers on 
shelves of local stores to make her husbands death appear random 
and to lead doctors who had concluded nickell died of emphysema 
to the true cause of his death 
only mrs nickell had the motive opportunity and ability to 
commit the crimes ms maida told the jury in closing arguments may 
2 
hillier called mrs nickells daughter cindy hamilton 28 
unreliable and noted that pharmaceutical companies had offered a 
300000 reward to anyone who provided information leading to an 
arrest 
further the prosecution could not link mrs nickell to cyanide 
purchases hillier said 
earlier monday a juror said she had received an anonymous phone 
call friday in which the caller asked dont you all know that 
she failed the lie detector test 
information about the polygraph test had been kept from the 
jury but us district judge william dwyer said neither the 
panels trouble reaching a decision nor the phone call would force 
a mistrial 
he gave hillier a choice of substituting an alternate juror for 
the one who received the phone call but hillier declined 
ms maida said in her closing arguments that mrs nickells plan 
failed because she was careless in mixing the poisonous capsules 
greedy for insurance benefits and owned two of the five tainted 
bottles of painkillers found 
the odds of one person buying two bottles of cyanidelaced pain 
capsules at different stores on different days were 
astronomical ms maida said noting that more than 15000 
bottles had been examined in the seattle area 
ms maida also told jurors that mrs nickell might have gotten 
away with the scheme if she had been more careful about the bowl 
she chose for mixing the potassium cyanide with anacin and excedrin 
painkillers 
mrs nickell a tropical fish enthusiast used a bowl 
contaminated with algae destroyer a compound used to clean fish 
tanks the prosecution alleged traces of the compound were found 
in the five tainted bottles of excedrin and anacin ms maida said 
mrs nickell also tripped up in leaving fingerprints on library 
books about poisons and cyanide ms maida said 
but mrs nickell testified she did the library research to find 
out more about her husbands death and to protect children from 
dangerous foliage around her rural home

socialist president francois mitterrand has been a 
prominent face on the french left since the end of world war ii 
but in recent years he has moved markedly to the political center 
his first two years in office 198183 involved implementation 
of longheld socialist ideas and were largely a failure the 
radical philosophy of rupture with capitalism foundered on the 
rocks of economic reality 
after trying to spend their way to prosperity the socialists 
succeeded only in running up the national debt without being able 
to stop runaway unemployment in the face of a growing crisis the 
government was forced to reverse course and institute austerity 
when the right ousted the socialists from control of the 
national assembly in march 1986 mitterrand needed to appeal to a 
wider electorate if he was to have any hope of reelection 
ironically after mitterrands popularity had fallen to historic 
lows at midterm it soared after the right regained control of 
parliament leaving him with little real power in domestic affairs 
the french seemed to like the balance of power mitterrand 71 
quickly assumed the role of the wise grandfather referred to 
affectionately by many as tonton a childs term for uncle 
mitterrand was first elected may 10 1981 in a socialist tidal 
wave that ousted centerright president valery giscard destaing 
and then a month later the conservatives and centrists who had 
held power in the national assembly for 23 years 
the founder of the modern french socialist party mitterrand has 
now made four presidential races he was defeated by charles de 
gaulle in 1965 and by giscard in 1974 
mitterrand was born oct 26 1916 in jarnac in western france 
he earned degrees in law and letters in paris he was drafted in 
1938 and during the german invasion of may 1940 was shot and 
captured 
he escaped from a pow camp in germany and returned to france 
after the occupation of the vichy zone by the germans he created a 
resistance network his careerlong feud with gen charles de 
gaulle began during the war when mitterrand refused to join his 
resistance group with de gaulles 
it was during his resistance days that he met danielle gouze 
whom he married in 1944 shortly after the liberation 
during the chaotic postwar fourth republic mitterrand held 11 
cabinet posts including interior and justice minister 
in the early 1970s mitterrand took the moribund socialist party 
and built it into a major force but the union of the left he 
forged with the communists fell apart in 1977 
it was not until the final days of the 1981 presidential 
election that the two major leftist parties again joined to defeat 
giscard and oust the conservatives 
mitterrand shocked much of the west when he brought the 
communists into his government but that union only lasted three 
years until 1984 when the communists pulled out in a dispute over 
economic policy

the senate is facing fights over arms control 
and nato this week as it considers both a pentagon budget bill and 
the historic ussoviet treaty eliminating mediumrange nuclear 
weapons 
first the senate will begin work on the military budget an 
annual fight which generally involves wideranging decisions on 
americas farflung commitments 
the bill approved by the senate armed services committee 
authorizes 2995 billion for the pentagon and targets increased 
spending for nonnuclear weapons in the north atlantic treaty 
organization 
this issue of conventional weapons in nato is something that 
we paid an awful lot of attention to this year given the treaty 
said sen sam nunn dga chairman of the panel 
he was referring to the intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty 
signed dec 8 by president reagan and soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev 
it eliminates both nations mediumrange missiles and nunn and 
other supporters say natos nonnuclear defenses will have to be 
bolstered after the missiles are gone 
the senate is tentatively scheduled to begin work on the treaty 
wednesday 
during the pentagon bill debate amendments are likely both to 
increase spending for nato and call on us allies in the 16nation 
alliance to pay more of natos costs 
also expected are proposals providing advice to reagan from both 
conservative republicans and liberal democrats about the arms 
control policies he should follow in the last six months of his 
administration 
similar attempts were made the past two weeks in the house 
during that chambers work on its version of the pentagon budget 
bill the house approved nuclear arms control restrictions opposed 
by the administration along with cuts in star wars missile defense 
spending which were so deep that defense secretary frank carlucci 
threatened to advise reagan to veto the bill 
the house is expected to give final approval wednesday to its 
pentagon bill similar action by the senate will send the separate 
measures to a housesenate conference committee to reconcile the 
differences 
both measures propose 2995 billion for the pentagon in the 
fiscal year starting oct 1 one difference is that the house voted 
35 billion for the strategic defense initiative as star wars is 
formally known while the senate bill proposes 46 billion reagan 
wanted 48 billion 
the house also voted to order reagan to send the military into 
the fight against illegal drug traffickers antidrug amendments 
are likely in the senate although not as sweeping as the house 
proposal nunn said 
in midweek the senate is scheduled to turn to the inf pact 
which reagan wants ratified before he goes to the soviet union on 
may 29 for his fourth summit meeting with gorbachev 
with 67 votes needed for ratification senate leaders have 
predicted that 90 or more senators will vote to approve the pact 
but the debate over the treaty has been clouded by a dispute 
over whether both the united states and the soviets agree on 
several points such as the definition of weapons and whether 
the pact bans futuristic weapons such as lasers 
there also are questions about the latitude which will be 
allowed us inspectors who will be stationed inside the soviet 
union to verify compliance 
while the focus on the senate floor is on national security 
issues congressional leaders also are preparing to send reagan the 
omnibus trade bill 
the measure has been passed by both the house and the senate but 
instead of being sent to the white house it remains stalled on 
capitol hill while leaders seek to revise it and perhaps avert a 
threatened presidential veto 
last week the house voted 253159 to drop the bills curbs on 
export of alaska oil one of two provisions reagan has said would 
justify a veto the other is a requirement that companies with 100 
employees or more give 60 days notice of plant closings and large 
layoffs 
the measure approved by the house is a technical resolution 
senate leaders still are trying to get the technical resolution 
onto the floor without undue delay if they cannot they probably 
will abandon plans to drop the alaska provisions and just send the 
bill to reagan unchanged from the form in which it won final 
passage two weeks ago

a political mess has raised 
doubts about the future of democracy in this important us ally 
and put the dreaded word coup on the lips of just about 
everyone from the president on down 
however the military has vowed to let democracy unravel its own 
tangles and most people said they were betting against military 
intervention 
coup rumors have circulated since a week ago when a dispute 
over control of the legislature prevented effective installation of 
the 60member congress elected march 20 
president jose napoleon duarte told journalists thursday yes 
we are in the midst of a crisis but he added i believe the 
armed forces are absolutely convinced that this a coup would be a 
fatal course for the country because every coup implies a division 
in the armed forces and in the middle of a war that would mean 
a gigantic danger for national security 
leftist rebels are fighting usbacked government forces in an 
8yearold war that has claimed an estimated 65000 lives 
thirty deputies of the rightist republican nationalist alliance 
or arena took their seats may 1 and claim to constitute the 
national assembly 
the governing christian democrats including duarte contend 
that arena lacks the majority necessary to install the congress and 
make laws the christian democrats were resoundingly defeated in 
the legislative election losing their parliamentary majority 
right now the country has no legislature christian 
democratic leader julio adolfo rey prendes said at a news 
conference may 2 he is the partys candidate in presidential 
elections set for march 
the two main parties along with the smaller national 
conciliation party spent the end of last week trying to negotiate 
an end to the impasse but they failed positions appeared to have 
hardened 
the christian democrats and the conciliation party who claim 30 
deputies between them have formed an informal alliance to block 
arenas control of the legislature 
one of the christian democrats 23 deputies is claimed by arena 
which charges the seat was stolen through electoral fraud that 
dispute is before the supreme court but the christian democrats do 
not recognize its jurisdiction in the matter 
government opposition and military representatives have said 
the governmental crisis could deepen if the court rules for arena 
granting it a 31st seat and an outright majority 
arena says the assembly has 59 members meanwhile and that it 
already has a majority with 30 votes 
the christian democrats in a parallel session have seated the 
disputed deputy in defiance of the court 
meanwhile the military has watched warily from the sidelines 
col mauricio vargas chief of operations of the joint chiefs of 
staff said military intervention would do much more harm than good 
nationally it would be the rupture of the democratic 
process he said internationally it would mean isolation that 
would bring major repercussions and to break the democratic system 
would be to provide justification for the guerrillas position that 
we dont want democracy in this country 
el salvador receives more us aid than any country in the 
western hemisphere last years economic and military assistance 
was about 620 million 
president reagan has repeatedly held up el salvador as an 
example of central american democracy military intervention 
presumably would bring strong us bipartisan reaction and possibly 
a drastic cut in aid 
though a coup appears unlikely a top government source close to 
the president said the military is exerting strong pressure on 
politicians to resolve the impasse the source who spoke on 
condition of anonymity said the armed forces had imposed a 
deadline but declined to give details 
gen adolfo blandon head of the joint chiefs of staff said 
last week this dispute confuses things and is not beneficial 
to the democratic process it is irresponsible behavior on the part 
of the deputies in whom the people deposited their trust 
ricardo alvarenga named by arena as the new president of the 
assembly agreed that damage had already been done this mess 
leads the people to the conclusion which is logical but not 
necessarily correct that the guerrillas are right when they say 
our democracy does not work and is not the way to resolve our 
problems

the justice department is reviewing a texas 
literacy test for wouldbe law enforcement officers that is failed 
by three out of four blacks and two out of three hispanics 
the federal inquiry is intended to determine whether the test 
discriminates against minorities seeking jobs in nearly 300 texas 
law enforcement agencies 
minority groups tend to be underrepresented in texas law 
enforcement and critics say hiring practices may contribute to the 
prevalence of white faces in blue uniforms 
if the department concludes that the test is discriminatory 
wed have to take appropriate steps to address that problem 
said justice spokeswoman deborah burstionwade 
the test indicates whether a job candidate reads and writes at 
highschool level skills presumed necessary if the candidate is to 
understand the laws being enforced 
one section requires the person to complete a sentence by 
picking the correctly spelled word from three choices other 
sections test grammar 
another section asks the test taker to choose the clearest of 
three sentences discussing the same topic the wrong answers 
contain extremely basic obvious ambiguities said david 
boatright an attorney for the texas commission on law enforcement 
officer standards and education 
the justice department has looked at numerous other state city 
or county writing or reading tests for their effect on minorities 
and employment criteria for physical strength and agility and their 
effect on women 
exams reviewed by the agency have ranged from the suffolk 
county ny county police test to the maryland toll facilities 
police forces height and weight restrictions 
in texas during the past 7 months passing rates were 69 
percent for whites 67 percent for american indians 59 percent for 
asianamericans 36 percent for hispanics and 27 percent for 
blacks 
overall 55 percent of the people who took the test between 
sept 1 1987 and april 21 passed it according to the law 
enforcement standards commission people who fail may repeat the 
exam 
as of feb 17 the state had 41916 licensed law enforcement 
officers 73 percent of whom were black according to the most 
recent figures from the commission 
figures from the 1980 census show 12 percent of texans are black 
the commission had the test developed in the mid1970s and used 
justice department criteria in drafting it 
we offered to run it by the department of justice and they 
refused said attorney boatright were perfectly happy that 
theyre looking at it now 
one of the 283 law enforcement agencies using the test is 
lufkin police chief sherman collins says he doesnt fault the exam 
for the absence of black officers on his force although blacks 
make up about onefourth of the east texas towns population of 
30000 
collins says basic literacy is essential for an officer and to 
help prepare candidates he has enlisted the help of an adult 
learning center which offers preparation for the high school 
general equivalency diploma exam the local agency is offering a 
sixweek course to raise reading comprehension and writing skills 
up to five grade levels collins said 
we want black officers collins said we would have a 
better rapport with the black community if we had black officers 
out there serving them 
only one black out of 13 passed the test in lufkin in june when 
it was offered last the person who passed was a reporter who took 
the exam as part of a news assignment for the lufkin daily news

democratic frontrunner michael dukakis says he wouldnt know 
a horoscope from a telescope but he decided to see what the 
stars had in store for him after reading reports president reagans 
schedule has been affected by advice his wife gets from an 
astrologist 
dukakis told a crowd at a new york fundraiser last week that 
his horoscope for that day indicated he would be taking on new 
challenges and having to make tough decisions 
it is pointless for you to remain in your current position 
the massachusetts governor read drawing giggles 
dukakis said he also decided to check the horoscope of attorney 
general edwin meese iii whose legal troubles draw frequent gibes 
from dukakis during campaign appearances 
meeses horoscope the candidate said indicated that he should 
find happiness elsewhere 
ill drink to that dukakis said as the crowd roared in 
approval

dukakis is not generally known for his humor but he drew laughs 
from a group of west virginia coal miners when he said his ride 
into the mine on a cramped rail car was just a little bumpier 
than the boston subway he often takes to work 
minutes later asked if the mine was the first place he had 
campaigned where there was not a greek restaurant the 
massachusetts governor smiled and said there are greek 
restaurants everywhere 
fellow greek and dukakis confidant nick mitropoulis chimed in 
and if there isnt one there will be soon 
going out of the mine dukakis mistakenly turned toward a vein 
heading deeper into the mountain 
after a miner set him straight dukakis threw his hands in the

only a handful of television viewers witnessed 
one of the best ads of the 1988 presidential campaign 10 seconds 
of al haig stuffing pizza into his mouth at a new hampshire eatery 
it got on the air one day before he withdrew said jay 
bryant haigs media consultant the ad showed a 
mischievouslooking haig using his fingers to subdue some errant 
pizza cheese and instantly turned the offputting general into a 
likable human being 
political media observers from academics to admakers say few 
if any tv spots this year have broken new technical ground or 
connected emotionally with voters 
among the notable exceptions was democrat dick gephardts 
48000 hyundai spot a trade tirade aimed at korean tariffs 
that price us autos out of the korean market 
the populist impulses in the hyundai ad the defiant 
expression identified with the electorates feeling of 
powerlessness said kathleen hall jamieson a professor and 
author of two books on political ads and speeches it was a 
moment of empowerment it let the voters feel good 
jamieson also nominated the pizza ad saying it forced the 
viewer to reconsider haigs somewhat negative and militaristic 
image the clear message was that if you knew him youd like 
him she said 
the short spot shows haig with a piece of cheese hanging between 
his mouth and his pizza slice he pulls it up to his mouth with his 
finger realizes hes oncamera and winks 
meanwhile a narrator is saying with mock seriousness former 
secretary of state alexander m haig the man with the best 
credentials of anyone to be president whos also a lot more like 
you than you think vote for him 
also on the air for only one day was another favorite a bob 
dole ad questioning whether george bush had left any legacy in the 
numerous jobs he has held the ad depicts a mans shadow walking 
across a virgin expanse of snow crunching as he goes yet leaving 
no mark 
after 20 years of walking in the footsteps of giants isnt it 
odd that george bush has left no footprints at all a narrator 
asks its almost like he was never there 
that was the most effective line he had going it was a good 
ad it had the ring of truth and it was appealing said larry 
sabato a professor analyst and author 
but dole coasting on his iowa victory didnt use the ad in new 
hampshire nor did the campaign carry out plans to reshoot it in 
the sand for use in southern super tuesday states it aired once in 
florida snow and all then was pulled 
they were believing the press clippings that they were on the 
way to the nomination said sabato i almost think dole thought 
it was time for healing after iowa and he was trying to lower 
that negative of being too harsh 
other effective ads included gephardts attack on massachusetts 
gov michael dukakis for promoting belgian endive as a remedy for 
farm woes and dukakis ads mocking gephardts populist message and 
flipflops on issues 
jamieson makes a case for dukakiss standard biographical ad a 
fastpaced montage of photographs that begins and ends with the 
printed words a president for the 90s it is being used 
virtually everywhere and has been the only dukakis ad on the air in 
several states 
it suggests solidity and stability and puts in place basic 
premises about what hes done jamieson said its not the 
funniest its not the glitziest but it is the most effective 
except for the hyundai ad 
haig bruce babbitt and pete du pont won nominations for the 
worst tv spots of the campaign season as did the 
informationpacked al gore ads produced by david garth for the new 
york primary 
the gore spots in new york were awful disgraceful they were 
just tepid i felt they were very poorly communicating gores 
message said sabato 
du pont was skewered for visual gimmickry and amateurish 
production jamieson cited one spot in which he rotates like a 
statue and you see his squaredoff jaw and he looks straight into 
the camera i expected it to be an ad for aftershave 
babbitt looks very strange in many of his ads jamieson 
said haigs initial ads made him appear rather evil they 
emphasized his harsh nature said sabato 
the early haig ads tried to put the best face on haigs military 
background by noting for example that no wars were started by 
presidents who had been generals but they used ponderous music and 
ominous images and some gave the impression of julius caesar 
returns to the rubicon said jamieson it was almost 
terrifying

during last years legislative session 
massachusetts senate president william bulger relegated a 
capitalpunishment bill to committee effectively killing it 
bulger supports the death penalty but he also supports michael 
dukakis and his move spared the governor from having to veto a 
deathpenalty bill 
the incident illustrated how carefully the democratic 
presidential frontrunner is treading when it comes to crime and 
punishment but republican george bush has already attacked dukakis 
on some crime issues and made it clear that theres more criticism 
to come 
at a news conference in sacramento last week bush faulted both 
dukakis and democrat jesse jackson for not supporting the death 
penalty for drug kingpins dukakis opposes the death penalty 
under all circumstances 
another potential point of vulnerability is the massachusetts 
prison system one of the most overcrowded in the country with 
6600 inmates it is 72 percent over capacity the legislature 
pushed by dukakis allocated nearly 1 billion to expand capacity 
but it will take years to ease the overcrowding 
and dukakis ran into a storm of protest last year when william 
horton a convicted murderer walked away from a weekend furlough 
he was arrested later in maryland and convicted of raping a woman 
and beating her husband 
the horton case prompted angry calls for elimination of 
furloughs for firstdegree murderers serving life sentences 
dukakis defended the furlough program for months on grounds 
that it helped prison administrators by giving lifers an incentive 
to behave and gave him a record for judging commutation requests 
but after key members of the legislature deserted him and 
opponents gathered enough signatures to place a furlough ban on the 
fall ballot dukakis reversed himself and dropped his opposition to 
the ban 
dukakis a harvard law school graduate and member of the 
american civil liberties union is generally considered a liberal 
on domestic issues including some criminal matters in addition to 
his opposition to the death penalty he favors controls on handguns 
however dukakis dismayed some liberals when he instituted a 
statewide program of police roadblocks to stop motorists to check 
for drunken drivers he has also backed a bill that would tighten 
criminal sentencing and for the first time in state history 
allow prosecutors to appeal sentences they consider too low 
as governor dukakis created a statewide anticrime council to 
coordinate the efforts of prosecutors judges legislators police 
and citizens dukakis who has never missed one of the councils 
monthly meetings says he would create a similar federal program 
in his campaign literature dukakis touts a 14 percent drop in 
crime in massachusetts since 1983 and the lowest homicide rate of 
any industrial state however most experts attribute the decline 
to the aging of the states population combined with a low 
unemployment rate 
and dukakis doesnt mention the embarrassing fact that 
massachusetts remains the nations auto theft capital 
overall state sen paul harold a democrat who chairs the 
legislatures criminal justice committee gives dukakis high marks 
as an attorney and as someone whos sat in the governors 
chair he has a tremendous overview hes a traditional liberal in 
his theories but if somethings not working he wants to change it 
and get on to the next case harold said 
james fox a professor of criminology at northeastern 
university said governors can actually do little about criminal 
behavior and presidents even less but he said dukakis should be 
credited for his attention to criminal issues he can influence 
when you look at dukakis he appears to have liberal leanings 
but ones that do indeed seem to be supported by facts he said

advice to first lady nancy reagan says she is a serious 
scientific astrologer and i really dont like this circus 
atmosphere 
joan quigley confirmed in a telephone interview from her nob 
hill home sunday that mrs reagan had consulted her since 1981 as 
reported by former white house chief of staff donald t regan 
regan in his book for the record scheduled to go on sale 
today said that virtually every major move and decision the 
reagans made was cleared in advance with a woman in san 
francisco who drew up horoscopes 
regan said he did not know her identity 
ms quigley however said i cant deny that she has 
consulted me i am very uncomfortable however with the situation 
because normally i never discuss the identity of my clients and i 
never discuss their affairs 
i am a serious scientific astrologer and i am really not one 
of these clowns and i really dont like this circus atmosphere 
said ms quigley who has been practicing astrology since 1960 and 
has written three books on the subject 
jayj jacobs a member of the board of directors of the 
association for astrological networking said ms quigley is a 
specialist in political consulting who lectures on 
geopolitical astrology 
shes viewed as a competent professional and a specialist 
jacobs said 
ms quigley a san francisco heiress and republican political 
activist said she did astrological work for reagans 1980 
presidential campaign she declined to give the details 
after the assassination attempt mrs reagan asked me if she 
could consult me because she was worried about the presidents 
safety as well she might be ms quigley said 
she said mrs reagan telephoned her at various times 
sometimes on saturday afternoons from camp david the presidential 
retreat in maryland as regan reported 
i certainly never controlled the presidents actions she 
said mrs reagan would want to know if something was a safe time 
and i certainly advised her on that 
ms quigley said her advice is based on the exact time and place 
of a persons birth 
in a separate interview with television station kron in san 
francisco the astrologer said she advised the first lady when it 
was unsafe to fly she added i never had any contact with the 
president

from the day that donald t regan moved from 
head man at merrill lynch to secretary of the treasury in the 
reagan cabinet the world war ii combat veteran found the white 
house to be alien territory 
regans gruff marine corps manner had served him well on wall 
street but failed to help him survive the political battleground of 
washington or his conflicts with a determined first lady 
when i was chief executive and i said jump people said 
how high he recalled shortly after coming to washington in 
1981 when he said the same thing as treasury secretary he added 
people asked well do you have an environmental impact 
statement what do you mean by high 
nevertheless regan quickly made his mark winning the 
presidents praise as a very fine salesman for the taxcutting 
policies that were a hallmark of the reagan administration 
in 1985 regan and james a baker iii then the white house 
chief of staff got reagans approval to switch jobs 
as a former marine corps colonel and wall street star he 
fancied the view from the bosss elbow michael k deaver who 
had been bakers deputy later wrote 
once don regan took over as chief of staff there was only one 
man in charge larry speakes then the chief white house 
spokesman recalls in his recent book 
the early reports were glowing said deaver no hint of an 
accident waiting to happen 
troubles soon came however 
when the president underwent cancer surgery in july 1985 regan 
aroused first lady nancy reagans ire by ordering a white house 
helicopter to fly him to bethesda naval hospital according to 
speakes account he decided after a telephone call from mrs 
reagan that he would go by automobile as she did 
after reagans prostate operation the following year the first 
lady and the chief of staff again found themselves at odds she 
thought he was scheduling her husband for too much activity too 
early in his recovery 
then came the revelations that the administration had sold arms 
to iran while seeking freedom for american hostages and that some 
of the money had been funneled to help the contra rebels in 
nicaragua 
when the presidential board headed by former sen john tower 
made its report on the controversy in february 1987 it found 
regan responsible for the chaos that descended upon the white 
house 
he as much as anyone should have insisted that an orderly 
process be preserved the board said 
regan protested does a bank president know whether a bank 
teller is fiddling around with the books no 
this however was not the world of finance but the world of 
washington politics 
the capital quickly sensed that regan was on the way out and 
there were widely believed reports that mrs reagan was helping him 
on his way 
the end came on feb 27 1987 when reagan chose former senate 
republican leader howard h baker jr of tennessee as his new chief 
of staff 
regan hearing the news from thennational security adviser 
frank carlucci who had seen it on a cable news network broadcast 
responded with a onesentence letter of resignation 
now 15 months and many sentences later regan is giving his 
side of the story in his book for the record from wall street to 
washington 
the book being published monday reveals that mrs reagan used 
astrology to determine the timing of the presidents speeches and 
travel 
once again judging from the presidents reaction regan may 
have chosen the wrong adversary 
i would have preferred it if hed decided to attack me 
reagan said friday and apparently from what we hear hes chosen 
to attack my wife and i dont look kindly upon that at all

virtually ever major move and decision the reagans made during 
my time as white house chief of staff was cleared in advance with a 
woman in san francisco who drew up horoscopes to make certain that 
the planets were in a favorable alignment for the enterprise 
nancy reagan seemed to have absolute faith in the clairvoyant 
powers of this woman who had predicted that something bad was 
going to happen to the president shortly before he was wounded in 
an assassination attempt in 1981 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
at one point i kept a colorcoded calendar on my desk numerals 
highlighted in green ink for good days red for bad days 
yellow for iffy days as an aid to remembering when it was 
propitious to move the president of the united states from one 
place to another or schedule him to speak in public or commence 
negotiations with a foreign power 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
a full month after the presidents release from the hospital 
his schedule was still a dead letter because mrs reagans friend 
had not provided a list of auspicious days the whole month 
appeared inauspicious for the president 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
there was no choice but to humor the first lady in this matter 
but the presidents schedule is the single most potent tool in the 
white house because it determines what the most powerful man in 
the world is going to do and when he is going to do it but 
humoring mrs reagan we gave her this tool or more accurately 
gave it to an unknown woman in san francisco who believed that the 
zodiac controls events and human behavior and that she could read 
the secrets of the future in the movements of the planets

the president was deeply concerned about the hostages but an 
inventory of the time he spent on this problem in a given month 
would undoubtedly show a very low total minutes rather than hours 
like that first meeting with nsc adviser bud mcfarlane at 
bethesda the events that snowballed into the catastrophe that came 
to be known as the irancontra affair made little impression at the 
time that they happened 
much of what happened was hidden from the president and 
incidentally from me by mcfarlane and his successor as national 
security adviser adm john poindexter and by the remarkable 
young marine who was a virtual stranger to both of us lt col 
oliver l north

on nov 12 only nine days after the story broke the pressure 
from the hill was so great that the president has no choice but to 
talk to a congressional delegation the president told them 
that we had in fact supplied arms to iran but it was only a 
small amount and we had not swapped arms for hostages 
some of those men were skeptical ronald reagan never lied to 
them or in my experience to anyone and there is no question in 
my mind that he believed that he was telling the truth 
he knew of course that the united states had shipped antitank 
and antiaircraft missiles to tehran and that certain iranians had 
exerted influence over terrorists in lebanon to facilitate the 
release of the american hostages but in ronald reagans own mind 
that did not constitute a swap of arms for hostages

the president is a ruddy man with bright red cheeks he 
blanched when he heard meeses words the color drained from his 
face leaving his skin pasty white nobody who saw the

it he was the picture of a man to whom the inconceivable had

it was raisa gorbachev for whom western observers and 
especially nancy reagan were unprepared she is a stylish 
handsome woman with an intense and intelligent manner it was she 
far more than her husband who kept the conversational ball 
rolling at this dinner party she did not hesitate to make 
use of the opportunities offered to her to educate the president of 
the united states on the intellectual and philosophical basis of 
the soviet policy after the door had closed behind the

the parts on abortion have got to come out mrs reagan

in the four years that i served as secretary of the treasury i 
never saw president reagan alone and never discussed economic 
philosophy alone and never discussed economic philosophy or fiscal 
and monetary policy with him man to man 
from first day to last at treasury i was flying by the seat of 
my pants the president never told me what he believed or what he 
wanted to accomplish in the field of economics i had to figure 
these things out like any other american by studying his speeches 
and reading the newspapers

im sorry mr president but i wont be in any more this is my

and your chief of staff for two you dont trust me enough even to 
tell me who my successor is and make a smooth transfer i deserved 
better treatment than this im through im very disappointed

<TEXT>
i wish to state that my admiration for reagan as president 
remains very great my judgment of him as a man in light of my 
final experience as his chief of staff underwent a certain change

world as i had seen when i came to washington knew better than to 
put his trust in princes

readers of donald t regans book for the 
record might be confused by lack of quotation remarks around 
most of the quotations from president reagan 
in reporting his conversations with the president the former 
white house chief of staff consistently put his own words inside 
quote marks but leaves them out in reporting the presidents 
remarks 
thus a typical passage reads 
hi don the president said is this a good time to talk 
i said couldnt be better mr president 
regan explains it this way 
out of deference to the office and the man i have not 
enclosed language attributed to the president in quotation marks 
except in cases where his words have already appeared in print 
elsewhere

the government mired in a civil war 
that is sinking the country ever deeper into poverty and famine is 
making overtures toward its two main enemies 
the 12yearold war is stalemated and mozambiques marxist 
leaders now appear interested in making a deal with south africa to 
complement generous amnesty terms offered to rebels of the 
mozambique national resistance 
since the amnesty law took effect in december an estimated 500 
to 700 guerrillas have surrendered with a government promise that 
they will be not be punished for their war activities 
also mozambiques president joachim chissano sent cooperation 
minister jacinto veloso to south africa on april 26 with a 
conciliatory message for president pw botha the possibility of a 
summit meeting was discussed 
a day earlier chissano met with gavin relly chairman of south 
africas giant anglo american corp to discuss possible business 
ventures 
chissano continues to accuse south africa of supporting the 
rebels in violation of a 1984 nonaggression pact a charge 
pretoria denies 
however mozambiques decision to renew highlevel contacts with 
south africa suggests it forsees no quick military solutions to the 
war which the us state department says has claimed an estimated 
100000 lives in the past three years 
the fighting in northeastern nampula province visited recently 
by a group of western journalists is representative of the 
deadlocked war in many parts of mozambique 
the rebels roam the countryside at will attacking villages to 
obtain supplies and often kidnapping residents as forced laborers 
government troops fight an almost entirely defensive war 
attempting to protect economic installations and to keep 
transporation routes open but seldom seeking out the rebels in the 
bush 
eighteen of the 21 district capitals in nampula province have 
been attacked since last october refugee camps are swelling and 
food is in short supply in most areas hospitals dispense aspirin 
and antimalaria tablets but not much else 
repeated rebel sabotage on the railway that runs across the 
province prompted a european consortium to halt repair work until 
the government can guarantee their security 
the frequent attacks disrupt the villages and discourage 
people from staying and planting crops said jacob jeremiah 
nyambir the provincial governor we are trying to reorganize the 
military and stabilize the civilian situation 
nyambir and other local officials cited several incidents that 
highlight the militarys shortcomings 
nyambir pointed on a map to the three main rebel camps in 
nampula province but said the military has never been able to 
carry out attacks against the locations 
when rebels raided the northern coastal city of angoche last 
year they they were repelled by the military local officials 
said however the rebels kidnapped 300 civilians and the army made 
no attempt to pursue them 
because of poor communications word of rebel attacks on remote 
villages can take a week to reach the city of nampula the 
provincial capital nyambir said 
he said the provincial government has been unable to promote the 
amnesty campaign because nampulas radio station isnt powerful 
enough to broadcast much beyond the city limits and leaflets 
havent been published because the printing press is broken 
nonetheless 16 rebels seeking amnesty turned up in the town of 
moma on april 9 but local authorities had no idea what to do with 
them nyambir said it took a week before someone could reach 
nampula and receive instructions on how to handle the surrendered 
men 
the war has made mozambique one of the poorest countries in the 
world and is the primary cause of a famine in which an almost 6 
million of the countrys 145 million people need food assistance 
there are more than a million refugees inside the country and 
700000 mozambicans have fled to neighboring states including 
south africa 
the rebel movement created in 1977 by what was then whiteruled 
rhodesia opposes the marxist policies of the frelimo party 
government but beyond that its aims are vague 
no government acknowledges supporting the rebels and they appear 
to have generated little support among the civilian population with 
their repeated raids on villages in which they often kidnap 
residents and force them to carry supplies and grow food at rebel 
bases 
nowhere have i found support for the guerrillas said us 
ambassador melissa wells ive only found fear and terror 
those who have been kidnapped say the guerrillas make little 
effort to explain their positions 
they showed me a picture of their leader and told me that when 
they come to power everyone will have a car said luciano alouta 
31 who was kidnapped by the rebels in july and escaped a month 
later i did not believe what they told me or understand what 
they were fighting for 
the rebels threatened to kill anyone who left their camp and 
made no attempt to become friendly with the captured civilians 
alouta said 
refugees at several different camps in nampula told similar 
stories in the town of ribaue some residents said they sleep in 
the surrounding woods to avoid being kidnapped in one of the rebels 
frequent nighttime attacks the hospital and the local 
administration building were destroyed but a cotton gin manages to 
keep going despite four guerrilla raids in the past year 
the nearby village of lalaua sits empty following a rebel attack 
in early april in which 50 huts about a quarter of the village 
were burned the rebels did not occupy the village but residents 
are afraid to return saying they fear a repeat attack

a movie called rappin is playing on home 
box office this month five times this month to be exact in 
which the credits are accompanied by a song whose repetitive 
refrain is simply cant stop wont stop cant stop wont 
stop 
it might be the anthem for the current george bush campaign he 
cant stop wont stop running against jimmy carter 
the vice president is trying to take advantage of the fact that 
michael dukakis the probable democratic nominee often comes 
across as a cool detached technocratic official in the carter mold 
but bushs tactic may backfire if voters decide the similarity 
ends there 
malaise isnt prominent in the dukakis dictionary he likes 
to talk about hard work and miracles he says incessantly that he 
wants to be a builder not a great communicator he could give 
lessons in upbeat 
nonetheless bush is hoping that when voters look at dukakis 
they will see carter interest rates carter oil prices carter 
wringing his hands at camp david carter confronting a rabbit with 
his canoe paddle carter agonizing while the american flag was 
being burned and the embassy looted in tehran 
actually bush is more than hoping that will happen the 
republican standardbearer is trying to make it happen 
reaganbush ousted cartermondale in 1980 and crushed 
mondaleferraro the temptation to relive these races must be more 
than bush and his staff can bear once dukakis emerged as bushs 
likely opponent bushs campaign manager quickly labeled the 
massachusetts governor a northernfried carter and the concept 
became a staple on the campaign trail 
bush loves to ridicule gloom and doom democrats in canton 
ohio last week he spoke gleefully about the gloom and misery 
emanating from the democrats camp on tuesday he said let mike 
dukakis go around here talking about pink slips despair pessimism 
in the united states ill be the guy out there talking about hope 
and opportunity 
whatever he is however dukakis is no gloom and doom democrat 
speechwriter bill woodward recently told david broder about the 
guidance he got when he signed on with dukakis in 1987 
the first thing he said was dont be negative about the hopes 
for the country and dont be overly negative about the reagan 
administration woodward told the washington post writer that 
dukakis described a problem he saw in the 1980 and 1984 
campaigns the overpreoccupation with what the united states cant 
do at home or in the world he said that wasnt his experience in 
life or in the massachusetts governorship 
there has been some unmistakable gloom and doom in the 
democratic party psyche but it was the upbeat candidates dukakis 
and jesse jackson who survived the 1988 primaries and dukakis 
isnt likely to make it easy for bush to pin the carter malaise on 
him 
the best america is yet to come he says after running down 
what he sees as the shortcomings of the reagan years were 
going to build a future of hope and pride and opportunity 
still bush wont stop 
it all sounds like jimmy carter reborn again for the third 
time bush said about the 1988 democrats in cleveland bush said 
carter hangs over the democrats like a shadow an unwanted 
reminder of the last time they were in the white house in 
indianapolis he said no matter whether the democrats nominate 
dukakis or jackson its going to be a very clear choice on the 
issues as clear as 1980 or as clear as 1984 
i do not want to see this country go back to the failed 
policies of the past heres where things were when we started 
interest rates were 21 percent inflation was doubledigit 
every family getting wiped out employment going the wrong way 
this pride in our country down the military weak and somebody 
said to me after i cited those horrible statistics what are you 
doing running against jimmy carter 
i said no i dont want to run against jimmy carter but we 
dont want to go back to the policies that the liberal democrats 
had under jimmy carter that led us to those days of malaise 
if only carter were on the ballot

drought has threatened water supplies in the west and southeast 
forced some texas and california ranchers to sell starving cattle 
and allowed topsoil and crop seeds to blow away in the northern 
plains 
in san francisco residents were ordered to reduce water 
consumption by 25 percent atlanta residents were asked to cut 
usage by 10 percent los angeles also has imposed water 
conservation rules in northern montanas liberty county 70 people 
attended a 24hour vigil last week to pray for rain 
its almost like you saw in the typical 1930s scenes where 
clouds of dust are moving across the fields says fred kollman 
district conservationist in norman county minn 
you see drifts of dirt almost like snowdrifts in the road 
ditches there is lots of dirt in the air and lots of dirt in the 
houses 
in the west two straight winters of poor rainfall and scanty 
snowfall in californias sierra nevada led to drought in the 
southeast parts of the tennessee valley have been receiving 
belownormal rain since 1984 in texas the drought began last 
fall parts of the northern plains enjoyed abovenormal rain last 
summer but less than expected snow last winter 
im not sure how much longer the area can take it its 
scary said extension agent judee wargo in montanas liberty 
county where rainfall since october has measured 073 inch 
compared with an average 317 inches for the period 
last week texas gov william p clements said starr and 
mcmullen counties needed federal disaster assistance because of 
drought 
starr county has had just over 5 inches of rain since sept 1 a 
period in which it normally would receive most of its average 
annual rainfall of 20 inches ranchers have had to sell cattle for 
lack of hay and forage 
in jim wells county west of corpus christi extension agent 
billy paul said ranchers have started burning thorns off prickly 
pear cactuses so cattle can eat them but even the cactus is drying 
up in some areas said starr county emergency official alfonso 
perez 
despite abovenormal rain in nevada in april the drought is 
still on with a passion said state climatologist john james 
northern california is having its worst water shortage in 11 
years officials said 
winter precipitation was normal or above normal until the end of 
january 
but february and march of this year were dismal 
droughtproducing months said gary barbato a hydrologist with 
the national weather service at san francisco 
statewide snowmelt runoff in rivers through midsummer is 
expected to be an third of normal said don heath chief of the 
states newly activated drought center in sacramento 
as in texas some ranchers in californias central valley are 
selling cattle and appealing for federal grain subsidies 
portions of southern oregon have been classified as in a severe 
drought and sections of eastern oregon are in an extreme drought 
said stan fox snow survey superintendent for the us soil 
conservation service 
rainfall in april was near or above normal for the whole state 
but oregon depends on winter precipitation for most of its water 
snowpacks around the state range from 81 percent of normal on mount 
hood to 3 percent of normal in klamath county 
the columbia river is at its lowest level since the 19361937 
dust bowl years 
montanas mountain snowpack this winter was only 75 percent of 
normal meaning less to feed streams during the spring and early 
summer irrigation reservoirs in the states eastern and central 
part range from 98 percent full to 10 percent 
if we get into a normal july and august normally very dry 
months were going to have some real trouble said phil farnes 
head of the soil conservation service snow survey team 
the weather service says a mild drought is in effect across 
northern minnesota north dakota and eastern montana 
farmers in parts of northwest minnesotas red river valley have 
stopped planting for lack of rain and sugar beet seeds that were 
planted are blowing off some fields thousands of acres of grass 
grown for lawn seed have dried up while high wind last week blew 
away tons of topsoil 
south dakota gov george mickelson on friday declared 12 
counties state disaster areas 
in the southeast drought has hit the tennessee valley authority 
especially hard with the rainfall between june 1984 and april 56 
inches 
thats better than a years normal rainfall for the tennessee 
valley youre seeing impacts on recreation hydro generation 
water quality said larry richardson the tvas chief of

the state department has quietly sent 
cambodian officials a message in an effort to win the release of 
the remains of 80 american soldiers the phnom penh government 
claims to have from the vietnam war a congressman disclosed 
rep john g rowland rconn said us officials in a verbal 
communique delivered through the international red cross two weeks 
ago offered us aircraft and military honor guard to pick up the 
remains 
rowland along with reps bob smith rnh and frank 
mccloskey dind has been lobbying state department officials to 
pursue an offer made to the congressmen by a highranking cambodian 
diplomat during the lawmakers visit to southeast asia in january 
cambodian officials said they were willing to release the 
remains but have insisted that us officials receive them not an 
intermediary rowland said american diplomats had been reluctant to 
pursue the remains question with cambodia because the united states 
has no formal diplomatic ties with the communist regime 
but the congressman said last week that the state department 
sent the message offering the honor guard and transportation after 
two highranking members of the house armed services committee 
reps bill nichols dala and gv sonny montgomery dmiss 
also applied pressure on the administration 
david lambertson deputy assistant secretary of state for east 
asian and pacific affairs who has been handling the cambodian 
remains issue for the administration did not return telephone 
calls friday 
a state department official who spoke on the condition of 
anonymity said the red cross has succeeded in engaging the phnom 
penh regime on this issue on behalf of the united states and we 
hope its going to work itself out 
we are encouraged said the official who refused to discuss 
details of the talks or confirm that us military escorts and 
aircraft have been offered 
rowland smith and mccloskey in late march sent a telegram to 
tep henn cambodias ambassador to vietnam saying they would pick 
up the remains and personal effects tep henn in a telegram dated 
april 21 responded that he found the congressmens message 
encouraging but set no specifics for turning over the bodies 
the congressmen sent another telegram to the ambassador last 
week confirming the state departments offer and suggesting early 
june as a possible time for a transfer 
some have questioned whether cambodia can have 80 soldiers 
remains since the defense department estimates that only 82 
soldiers were lost in cambodian terrority during the war no us 
remains have ever been returned by cambodia 
the identified remains of 179 us soldiers have been returned 
from southeast asia since 1973 152 from vietnam 25 from laos and 
two from china according to lt col keith schneider a pentagon 
spokesman 
the congressional group also hopes to win the release of a 
colorado man who was arrested in cambodian territory one year ago 
no reason was given for the arrest of sterling brian bono of las 
animas and it was not known why the vietnam veteran was in the 
region

smoggy air in the nations cities may become 
significantly cleaner than official projections indicate new 
discoveries about auto pollution suggest 
planned new federal regulations to make gasoline less volatile 
harder to vaporize may cure a problem only now being recognized 
some analysts say 
this is the evaporation of gasoline from cars in use called 
running loss 
all cars have systems designed to control evaporation while 
parked the environmental protection agency has assumed the system 
also prevents significant vapors from escaping when the car is 
driven 
on a hot day it now appears the system can be overwhelmed and 
release five to 25 times more unburned gasoline than is permitted 
in exhaust 
the findings are so new that no one has had a chance to 
calculate their effect but they suggest that plans for less 
volatile gasoline may significantly reduce this previously 
underestimated contributor to smog 
official predictions have been underpredicting future 
improvement with the less volatile gasoline in use said tom 
austin a partner in sierra research of sacramento calif air 
pollution consultants 
gasoline vapor is the major raw material for urban smog 
chemical reactions with other pollutants in sunlight produce ozone 
which can make your chest feel tight 
in proposing a regulation to cut maximum summer gasoline 
volatility by 22 percent from the current voluntary standard the 
epa hinted at the new findings last august but it said results 
were too preliminary to use and did not disclose numbers 
however hugh shannon of exxon research corp disclosed numbers 
at an american petroleum institute briefing last week he said epa 
has results showing that running loss can reach 10 grams about 
half a liquid ounce per mile his own tests show a maximum of 2 
grams per mile 
the current limit in exhaust is 041 gram per mile 
while declining to reveal specific test results tad wysor an 
engineer in the emissions control technology division of epas ann 
arbor mich lab said of the 10gram figure we havent seen 
anything that its wrong but theres not a lot to back it up 
epa wants to know whether this has been happening all along or 
whether as shannon believes only recently because of the rise of 
fuelinjected engines more than 80 percent today compared with 
practically none in the mid1970s 
fuel injection systems continuously recycle uninjected fuel back 
to the tank carrying heat from the engine compartment and making 
the fuel hotter 
this causes a pressure buildup which with todays fuel 
overwhelms the underhood charcoal canister that captures and 
recycles the vapor 
sam leonard director of automotive emissions control for 
general motors corps environmental activities staff said you 
cant put a big enough canister under there to capture all 
running losses but epas volatility regulation definitely will 
eliminate them 
for several reasons volatility has surged in the 1980s that 
causes more evaporations and more ozone 
epa has known that cars passing its stationary emissions test 
while using fuel of 90 pounds vapor pressure typical of 1975 
flunk badly on todays fuel which may be 115 pounds or higher 
leonard says that on one part of the test gm researchers found 
16 times as much emissions using 115pound fuel compared with 
90pound fuel 
epa last week published the annual list of areas failing to meet 
national ozone standards the list rose from 62 to 68 names and 
environmental groups said the data showed that smog is getting 
worse 
most analysts have blamed the failure to reduce ozone levels 
more quickly on the failure of states and epa to require stricter 
controls such as vapor recovery systems on gasoline stations 
william s becker executive director of the state and 
territorial air pollution program administrators said running 
losses could be a reason some areas violate the standard but i 
dont think this is clearly the major reason 
still epas wysor said if all these things fall into place 
its logical to expect this is a big source and another explanation 
that could be offered as to why attainment of the standards has 
been so hard 
epa estimated that volatility controls will reduce emissions of 
ozone precursors by 8 percent in polluted areas that do not have 
strict controls of their own as california does this did not 
include elimination of running losses 
austin said his impression from conversations at a recent 
meeting of the society of automotive engineers was if we could 
get both running and stationary evaporative emissions under 
control we could reduce emissions by 10 to 15 percent with 
exponential benefits to public health

a top aide to attorney general edwin meese iii 
says a recent congressional report accusing his boss of violating 
white house ethics rules should top a list of sleaze 
assistant attorney general william bradford reynolds who last 
year was given additional responsibilities as counselor to meese 
said the bipartisan senate report is harmful to ongoing inquiries 
into the attorney generals actions 
weve got a process thats in place people who are 
investigating and it seems to me that we do not contribute to an 
integrity of that process when we have that kind of report that 
comes out that so disserves and so misstates what the facts are 
reynolds said on cbstvs face the nation program 
if that is the best case that one comes up with against this 
attorney general for ethical conduct i would have to say that this 
man is as clean as he can possibly be in every respect 
reynolds the top enforcer of the reagan administrations civil 
rights policies added if i were making a list of sleaze id 
put that the report at the top 
the report issued wednesday by the senate governmental affairs 
subcommittee on oversight of government management concluded that 
meeses violation of the rules resulted in improper favoritism 
for the scandalplagued wedtech corp 
the report said e robert wallach sent meese then counselor to 
president reagan 16 memos in 1981 and 1982 detailing wedtechs 
efforts to get a contract to build small engines for the army and 
government officials opposition to those efforts 
meese has acknowledged interceding on behalf of wedtech but 
says he only wanted to assure that its contract proposal got a fair 
hearing 
wallach a longtime friend of meese is now under indictment in 
the wedtech scandal he was paid 13 million by the bronx 
nycompany which subsequently won the nobid 32 million 
contract 
former counselor to the president edwin meese iii and former 
deputy counselor jim jenkins failed to observe the white house 
policy on contracts with procurement officials which failure 
resulted in improper favoritism toward a specific contractor the 
report said 
the white house procurement policy in effect since october 1981 
says that obviously no member of the white house staff should 
contact any procurement officer about a contract in which he has a 
personal financial interest or in which a relative friend or 
business associate has a financial interest 
reynolds said the report made reference to a policy or rule in 
the white house that wasnt in existence at the time the wedtech 
thing was referred over to the attorney general 
independent counsel james mckay has been investigating meeses 
ties to wedtech a 1 billion iraqi pipeline project promoted by 
wallach and other matters in addition the office of government 
ethics is conducting an inquiry into why meese solicited 30000 
lawyers and businessman to pay more than 3000 apiece to a 
profitmaking organization to attend a conference 
reynolds maintained that despite the investigations morale at 
the justice department remains good 
actually its very good he said we have a lot of 
professionals everybody in the department is very professional 
most of the people in the department take the attitude that is 
much the same as george bushs attitude these are investigations 
that are ongoing theyll play themselves out the process ought to 
be allowed to work reynolds said 
so far he added nobody has suggested that the attorney 
general has done anything that comes close to unlawful activity or 
activity that is going to result in an indictment of any kind

voters on tuesday will shape the future 
of mingo county a poor backwater once so corrupt a fire chief ran 
a drug carryout and a sheriff allegedly helped protect the 
business 
its up to the people this time said michael thornsbury a 
williamson lawyer and firsttime candidate who is running for the 
state house of delegates they can choose the old way or they 
can take the best opportunity theyve had to vote good honest 
candidates into office 
tales of corruption prompted voters to sweep incumbents out of 
the county courthouse in 1986 this year most of the old guard 
many under indictment didnt bother to run 
even so voters will have a wide choice 
fifty political novices are among the 69 candidates who filed 
for 12 offices which include the legislature county commission 
and sheriff 
in 1986 voters ousted longtime democratic party boss johnie 
owens and his slate of candidates in favor of those backed by 
owens enemy larry hamrick 
then in january 1987 an outofcounty judge and prosecutor 
specially appointed by the state supreme court launched a grand 
jury investigation into county politics months later 16 
politicians including hamrick were indicted on charges of 
conspiracy to subvert mingos free elections 
as ordinary citizens of mingo county we have been repeatedly 
shocked and dismayed at the manner in which the county government 
has been organized and run the grand jury said 
what we have heard individually by way of rumor hearsay and 
speculation over the past several years has been verified to us by 
sworn testimony 
taking on the power structure is not easy for some ordinary 
citizens many of whom have long believed their livelihood 
depended upon remaining in the politicians good graces poverty 
allowed corruption to flourish said assistant us attorney joe 
savage who heads a corruption investigation 
according to savage only 8700 of the countys 36000 residents 
have jobs more than 2600 of the jobs are controlled by 
politicians such as those who run the school board the county 
commission and the antipoverty agency as a result savage said 
many residents believe they must vote the way theyre told by the 
politicians 
the political bosses had a longstanding habit of threatening 
peoples jobs their food stamps their social security and many 
people just dont know that they the bosses cant really affect 
those things he said 
this years deadline for filing for office passed long before 
the grand jury returned its indictments but the investigation was 
no secret and when the filing period ended most of the incumbents 
many previously aligned with owens or hamrick had decided 
against seeking reelection 
there are an awful lot of just average good old people running 
for office this year said curtis fletcher a high school 
assistant principal who is one of five candidates vying for the 
democratic nomination for a county commission seat 
people had no idea what was going on with some of our 
leaders fletcher said they knew about who got gravel for 
their road and who got a job at the courthouse 
fletcher a political newcomer estimates he will spend about 
2000 for his campaign 
in the past you couldnt get elected to the commission 
unless you were willing to spend 15000 or 20000 he said 
according to the indictments much of that money went to buy 
votes for politicians who in turn used their positions to protect 
friends and family engaged in other illegal activities 
former sheriff eddie hilbert pleaded guilty to buying his job 
for 100000 from owens his predecessor hilbert allegedly used 
his position to protect kermit fire chief wig preece who was 
convicted on federal charges of running a drug carryout next 
door to the town police department headed by his soninlaw david 
ramey 
preece and ramey along with other relatives were sentenced to 
lengthy prison terms for their role in kermits drug ring 
they were doing more business than the kmart said tennis 
hatfield a former radio announcer who is a firsttime candidate 
running for sheriff when you can put up a sign on the building 
that says out of drugs back in 30 minutes theres something 
more wrong than usual

a legislator decided to go against the flow 
when he noticed how much more time women spent in restrooms than 
men so he penned a potty parity resolution to help relieve the 
situation 
the measure by delegate john a rollison iii calls for hearings 
to determine whether the state plumbing codes 5050 ratio of space 
for womens and mens restrooms in public buildings is fair to 
females who seem to spend a lot of time waiting in line at public 
facilities the hearings begin in the fall 
ive been surprised by the amount of attention this has 
received rollison said there should be a lot of people at the 
hearings 
he insists hes quite serious about the issue despite jibes 
from lawmakers and the press his resolution was passed by both 
houses in february amid hoots chuckles and whispered jokes 
but rollison steadfastly refuses to joke about restroom 
equity the term he favors over potty parity 
i havent found anyone yet who will tell me this is not a 
problem rollison said 
he said his legislative aide bonnie campbell and his wife 
brought the situation to his attention 
bonnie did some research and found it was a widespread 
problem rollison said womens restrooms are underdesigned for 
their flow 
ms campbell said the states plumbing code calls for equal 
restroom space for men and women in public buildings because 
urinals occupy less space than toilet stalls mens restrooms often 
have more facilities 
ms campbell cited several other reasons for lines forming in 
many womens restrooms while men go through without a wait 
elderly people take longer she said there are more 
elderly women than men and demographically thats getting worse 
also there are more handicapped women than men and younger women 
often have their children in tow 
rollison said the lack of toilets for women affects their 
enjoyment at public events 
some women wont even buy a beer at a sporting event he 
said 
savannah day a virginia tech professor of housing who has 
researched the problem said she had a friend in florida with a 
different approach 
she refused to stand in those long lines at florida state 
football games mrs day said so she would go to the mens 
room and her husband would guard the door 
the professor said that in addition to the factors cited by ms 
campbell women have more clothing to manipulate and do more 
activities in the restroom like talk and apply makeup 
a cornell university undergraduate conducted a similar study for 
the department of transportation in washington state ann tran 20 
found that men spend an average of 45 seconds in a restroom stall 
compared with 79 seconds for women 
the sophomore concluded that a 6040 ratio between womens and 
mens toilets would be more equitable 
rollison a republican said he expected to take a lot of 
ribbing over the resolution but he added frankly it didnt 
bother me 
after the resolution was approved rollisons aides decorated 
his office with toilet paper hanging on the door was a toilet lid 
with the message congratulations jack 
newspapers had some fun with rollisons resolution one headline 
proclaimed committee lifts lid on potty parity

congress knows that agriculture department 
estimates of farm program costs cannot be trusted and the 
record of the past 15 years bears out that assessment a 
congressman says 
rep glenn english dokla made the comment sunday in response 
to a report he requested from the general accounting office a 
congressional investigative arm it said farm program costs have 
exceeded agriculture department estimates by more than 46 billion 
over a 15year span 
lawmakers know that usdas budget forecasts cannot be 
trusted because of the errors english said 
the errors make it difficult to foresee program costs and can 
have an impact on the amounts that lawmakers authorize english 
said in a statement 
congress asks two questions when it considers farm program 
legislation he said what are the benefits to farmers and the 
nation and how much will it cost 
the report found the forecasts by the commodity credit corp 
were billions of dollars off target under both republican and 
democratic presidents and more often underestimated how much money 
would be required than overestimated 
the commodity credit corp estimates are separate from the 
figures contained in the presidents budget requests those 
requests seek funds to pay off net commodity credit corp losses 
already on the books 
commodity credit corp estimates are supposed to be a look ahead 
to conditions in the economy that could put the nations farm 
subsidy programs on a roller coaster and place new strains on the 
budget 
underestimates of the costs of farm programs result in too 
little money being allocated when congress makes up its spending 
plan and force congress to come back later in the year to make up 
shortfalls 
the report said agriculture department spending for farm income 
and price support programs totaled 1107 billion from 1972 through 
1986 it said commodity credit corp estimates for the period were 
638 billion or 469 billion too low 
usdas budget estimates were substantially incorrect in most 
years the report said it put the average at 31 billion a year 
beyond the forecasts produced by the agriculture department 
the report reviewed estimates for three individual commodities 
corn wheat and dairy they represented 63 percent of net outlays 
and 77 percent of the errors of recent years 
it said the corn budget estimates contained errors on both the 
plus and minus sides totaling 251 billion on balance the 
forecasts were off by a net 145 billion that represented the 
largest amount of error among the three commodities 
the report said the errors stemmed from a wide array of 
difficulties ranging from mistakes in forecasting supply and 
demand to problems in managing data and documentation 
although usdas forecasting methods have generally been 
developed by highly skilled staff little attention has been paid 
to reviewing and evaluating whether these methods work as 
intended the report said 
it also said that the usda has not had a structured quality 
control program but has taken some action to correct weaknesses

jesse jackson will probably challenge the 
seating of delegates at the democratic convention in july because 
it appears party officials will not act on his objections to the 
selection process his campaign chairman says 
willie brown speaker of the california assembly said he and 
other jackson advisers have spoken to democratic national committee 
chairman paul kirk and other party leaders about jacksons 
insistence that the delegate totals roughly correspond to the 
popular vote 
but those talks brown said are not so far productive and 
the campaign will likely make challenges to the delegate slates of 
states where it believes the selection has been unfair 
i think we are going to end up having to make them because i 
dont think its the discussion going to be productive brown 
told the associated press on saturday 
in recent days jackson has said he is appealing to party 
leaders for some measure of fairness but he has shied away 
from any indication that he would make an official challenge or 
employ the kind of attack he made in disputing party rules in 1984 
jackson uses puerto rico as an example in that contest he won 
the popular vote but the governor awarded all of the islands 
delegates to michael dukakis party rules allow for such practices 
although in many states the delegate allocation is tied directly to 
the popular vote 
a successful challenge could narrow the gap of roughly 600 
delegates between dukakis and jackson and make the delegate tallies 
more closely reflect the popular vote which currently stands at 
some 37 percent for dukakis to 28 percent for jackson 
if we can mount some credential challenge on fairness this 
thing doesnt have to be over brown said when asked about the 
conclusion by some observers that dukakis all but has the 
nomination locked up 
jackson has said he will talk with super delegates from 
congressional districts where he won the popular vote and appeal 
for their support even though they are not bound to follow the vote 
totals 
super delegates attend the convention by virtue of their 
position as public or party officeholders 
on sunday jackson took that a step further saying that white 
democratic officeholders especially those in the south who have 
benefited from the black vote should be willing to support him on 
that basis 
he singled out north carolina sen terry sanford and former 
north carolina gov jim hunt who angered jackson supporters by 
endorsing tennessee sen albert gore jr gore narrowly defeated 
jackson in the north carolina primary 
its reasonable to expect that sen sanford will endorse my 
campaign thats a reasonable expectation jackson said in 
greensboro nc noting that the black vote was crucial to 
sanfords 1986 election 
sanford is a super delegate 
jackson has also hinted that his supporters might stay away from 
the polls in november if they perceived he was being treated 
unfairly he indirectly raised the possibility again on sunday 
we define our friends by their willingness to be fair and to 
be just jackson said one thing about politics it does not go 
up and down it goes round and round anything that goes around 
comes around 
regardless of the outcome of the race for the nomination 
jackson officials are confident their delegate strength will ensure 
their influence on the party platform and are working on what 
issues they want to include 
we wont have to worry about getting every plank we want 
considered said brown 
in the meantime jackson is unveiling the themes that he hopes 
will increase that strength in california the nations biggest 
delegate prize 
jackson has an active and broad organization of supporters but 
he like dukakis must figure out how to appeal to the wider 
population in this state of 25 million that appears to lack 
enthusiasm for this years election 
most democratic officeholders so far are sitting out the 
campaign apparently reluctant to endorse either jackson or dukakis 
many of them had earlier endorsed one of the five democrats who 
have since dropped out of the race 
brown characterized his nonendorsing colleagues in the state 
legislature and other neutral politicians as mostly mainstream 
traditional democrats who would not be expected to endorse the 
liberal jackson and who dont feel they know enough about dukakis 
jackson has been targeting women environmentalists hispanics 
gays and peace activists and continuing to sound his antidrug and 
antireaganomics themes 
brown said campaign strategists are to meet this week to 
determine what kind of television commercials will be aired in what 
campaign manager gerald austin said will be about a 2 million ad 
campaign 
california is a hotbed for peace and jacksons positions on 
peace in central america and the middle east and africa should sell 
well especially on the states more than 140 college campuses 
said brown

when rebels kidnapped peanut farmer 
ibraimo danancha and stole the shirt off his back he solved his 
problem in a manner familiar to many clothesless mozambicans he 
tailored an outfit from tree bark 
danancha had worn the sturdy bark for about a month when he 
escaped from the guerrillas april 17 and turned up at the refugee 
camp in the village of malema in nampula province 
the bark is rough and grating and none too comfortable which 
also describes life in general for most of mozambiques 145 
million people 
mozambiques 11yearwar for independence from portugal 
196475 and the current civil conflict which began in 1977 has 
left the country one of the poorest in the world despite extensive 
resources and fertile lands for many their lives have been 
reduced to a daily lesson in survival 
it is gods business a mozambican will say stoically when 
calamity strikes thats life another will add 
almost 6 million hungry people will need more than 900000 tons 
of food aid in the next year the government says rural villages 
throughout the country have been destroyed by guerrillas of the 
mozambique national resistance crops have been wiped out by 
droughts and floods in recent years 
in the cities food is easier to find but there are other 
difficulties beira the second largest city is without 
electricity during the day and the water system works only 
sporadically in the capital of maputo public transportation 
consists of an occasional standingroomonly bus 
while the war has left mozambique in shambles it also has 
brought forth a certain resiliance and adaptability among its 
people 
in the northeastern city of nampula residents stage a 
fleamarket every sunday displaying their talents for improvising 
the tops of discarded beer cans are cut off and turned into cups 
and flower pots used nails are meticulously straightened and 
resold to people rebuilding homes 
condensed milk tins are used as the base for oil lamps small 
cracker boxes are turned into toy trains with rubber rings used as 
wheels clear plastic in mens wallets is sought for use as 
protective covering for pictures hung in the home 
a stick attached to a can and some strings is transformed into a 
banjo shards of glass are collected and glued to the tops of walls 
as a security barrier 
in recent weeks waves of grasshoppers have begun to appear in 
nampula every night residents with glass jars go out under street 
lights and catch the grasshoppers which are fried and served as a 
proteinrich delicacy 
women of limited means have learned to rely on capalanas a 
multifunction wraparound garment 
its used primarily as an everyday dress which can easily be 
loosened if the women becomes pregnant it also can be wrapped and 
folded in a manner that creates a pouch to carry a child at night 
capalanas are employed as blankets 
most mozambicans have a very slim understanding of what the 
war is about said rodney sidloski the care representative in 
nampula but they continue to bounce back and adapt no matter 
what happens 
nonetheless most feel there is no substitute for returning to 
their village and their land 
carlos marques 32 and other members of a refugee camp on 
nampulas outskirts walk more than 12 miles every morning to tend 
their fields they walk back to the camp in the evenings because 
the military cant guarantee their security against nighttime 
guerrilla attacks 
we cant stay on the land until it is safe said marques 
but i think we will go back that day will come

although jesse jackson has been dramatically 
successful in the democratic primaries this year analysts say he 
has not repeated a major accomplishment of his 1984 presidential 
campaign expanding the black share of the vote 
four years ago jackson drew a vastly higher black turnout in 
many states blacks made up a fifth of the democratic electorate in 
ohio up from 8 percent in 1980 a sixth in pennsylvania also up 
from 8 percent 
but while he has drawn enthusiastic crowds expanded his support 
among whites and raised his own share of the black vote this time 
around he has not galvanized more blacks to register and vote 
his first candidacy brought a lot more black voters to the 
polls there was a clear pattern of increased black 
participation said abc news poll analyst john brennan that 
pattern is not repeating itself this year 
black voter turnout is crucial for the democrats because blacks 
make up one of their core voting blocs strategists say jackson 
could boost the democrats chances if he could deliver an expanded 
black vote in the general election and hurt the partys odds if 
he should discourage black support of the ticket 
viewing the primary results so far the major implication is 
that you cannot expect an unusual black turnout this year said 
independent pollster peter hart 
if the democrats are counting on a disproportionate black 
turnout it seems to be its going to be difficult to achieve 
hart said if jesse cant achieve it when theres a direct 
onetoone relationship its more unlikely to happen when its not 
a onetoone relationship 
jackson increased black voting in 1984 through massive voter 
registration drives he has not conducted such intensive drives 
this year and exit polls in many states have found the black vote 
virtually unchanged from 1984 as a share of the electorate 
cbs newsnew york times polls said blacks made up 19 percent of 
the democratic voters in ohio last month compared to 20 percent in 
1984 in pennsylvania 16 percent this year 17 percent in 1984 in 
new york 24 percent this year 24 percent in 1984 
abc news poll results have been similar in illinois despite 
the publicity about the crowds that greeted jackson black turnout 
actually was down a bit from 1984 said brennan it was steady 
in pennsylvania steady in ohio down a bit in indiana up a bit in 
new york 
polls have shown sizable increases in some states in georgia 
blacks made up 35 percent of the turnout in the cbstimes poll up 
from 28 percent in 1984 in alabama though an nbc news poll said 
blacks made up 32 percent in 1988 little changed from 30 percent 
in 1984 
in many cases more blacks may have voted this year than in 
1984 but not in numbers any greater than the increase of other 
voters pollsters noted 
another issue for democrats is whether black turnout may 
fluctuate in the general election as it has in the primaries or is 
more likely to remain stable in 1984 some analysts expected a 
greater share of blacks newly energized by jackson to vote 
democratic in november brennan said but blacks made up 8 percent 
of the general election vote down a point from 1980 and three 
points below their share of the voting age population 
the 1984 general election may be a poor example pollster hart 
said because that wasnt a fight that was turning a lot of 
people on still he said he was surprised that jackson has not 
broadly boosted black voters electoral share this year 
it just lets you know institutionally how difficult it is 
hart said even one man as good as he is isnt able to 
disproportionately shift the electorate

a former political boss convicted of 
corruption in a mountain coal mining county charged in a national 
news broadcast sunday that he turned down a 12000 payment from 
gov arch moore jr 
the nbc news broadcast two days before an election in which 
moore is locked in a tough primary battle with morgantown 
millionaire john raese brought an angry response from the 
governors spokesman 
as a former journalist i think its a piece of garbage 
said spokesman john price 
the governor said that 16 years ago he had no idea of the 
existence of johnie owens 
owens the former mingo county political boss charged that 
moore offered him money to buy his organizations backing in 1972 
arch moore laid down in the back seat of a car holding 12000 
up in his hand like a common criminal instead of a governor and 
begged me to take it owens said on the broadcast 
the governor said its strange that 36 hours before west 
virginians go to the polls a supposedly responsible network would 
air the comments of a convicted felon price said 
a federal court last month sentenced owens to 14 years in prison 
on four charges stemming from his role in a 1982 conspiracy to sell 
the mingo sheriffs job 
raese said he was dismayed by nbcs preelection broadcast of a 
previously unaired excerpt of a wsaztv interview conducted on 
april 19 as owens was about to report to prison 
im very saddened by the whole event raese said its a 
dark moment for republican politics in west virginia

rodrigo borja a centerleft lawyer who 
promised to distance his administration from the current 
governments prous foreign policy was elected president of 
ecuador 
borja 52 leader of the democratic left party defeated 
populist abdala bucaram 36 in an runoff on sunday to select a 
successor to conservative leon febres cordero washingtons closest 
ally in south america 
with the vote count virtually complete borja had 1631747 
votes to bucarams 1401153 votes nearly 450000 votes were blank 
or nullified more than 46 million ecuadoreans were registered to 
vote 
bucaram speaking on national television from his power base in 
guayaquil the countrys largest city and its major port conceded 
defeat sunday night and congratulated borja 
there are no excuses dr rodrigo borja is the president of 
ecuador said bucaram a fiery campaigner who had sworn to 
punish the oligarchy if elected 
speaking over television in quito borja said thank you 
ecuador thank you 
it was borjas third bid for the presidency he was narrowly 
defeated by febres cordero in a bitterly fought runoff in 1984 and 
has pledged to reverse his foes freemarket economic policies 
but he also told ecuadors business community not to be 
frightened by his election our victory should not make anyone 
nervous no one should set off a financial panic borja said 
sunday night we intend to respect private enterprise 
borja has promised to back a moratorium on payment of ecuadors 
92 billion dollar foreign debt if creditors dont agree to 
negotiate easier terms i do not believe it is possible to pay 
the foreign debt under the conditions they want to collect he 
said in a recent meeting with foreign correspondents either we 
pay the debt or we develop the country we cant do both things at 
the same time 
the febres cordero government suspended payment on the debt last 
year after severe economic damage from devastating earthquakes 
borja and bucaram defeated eight other candidates in the first 
round of elections jan 31 to qualify for the runoff febres 
cordero of the social christian party came in third a sign of 
his governments low popularity 
the victory by the leftleaning borja and bucaram sent tremors 
through ecuadors financial circles the ecuadorean currency 
plunged in value from 275 sucres to the dollar to nearly 500 sucres 
since the first round of voting 
borja has said he plans to establish exchange controls and 
restrict imports to protect ecuadors dangerously low dollar 
reserves he also plans price controls on basic consumer goods 
he says he will seek close ties to the nonaligned movement and 
reestablish diplomatic relations with leftistled nicaragua 
febres cordero severed relations in 1985 after an argument with 
nicaraguan president daniel ortega 
borja will be sworn in aug 10 for a fouryear term he will be 
the third elected president since democracy was restored in 1979 
after nine years of civilian and military dictatorships 
borja will confront the challenge of a governing a nation that 
is in its deepest recession since it began exporting oil in the 
early 1970s 
the economy shrank 35 percent last year thanks in great 
measure to the sharp drop in the price of oil ecuadors major 
source of income inflation is running at an annual rate of 70 
percent the highest level since 1983 and less than half the work 
force has fulltime employment

us and soviet artists are trying to draw the 
cultural gap between the two countries to a close and the idea has 
people laughing 
the traveling ussrusa cartoon exchange features cartoons 
from both countries that sponsors hope will erase walls of 
misunderstanding 
is it working 
da exclaimed the shows curator eric swenson of san 
francisco big yes 
cartoons communicate the universal wordless art that can make 
people laugh he said during the shows debut here this weekend 
im overwhelmed by the instant rapport the artists from the two 
countries develop listen to the sound in this building 
the sound saturday in the gallery was laughter through a live 
videophone hookup about 10 us artists serenaded a group of 
soviet artists in moscow they requested a typical american 
song and got take me out to the ball park the americans got 
a longdistance ovation 
im literally blown away by the quality and the humor said 
brian bassett editorial cartoonist for the seattle times who draws 
the syndicated comic strip adam 
i guess thats an indication of how little our two cultures 
have touched he said 
iuri ivanov a 41yearold cartoonist from moscow on hand for 
the opening picked his favorite american exhibit of the 40 being 
shown and sent it electronically to his colleagues in moscow 
i like it because its stupid ivanov said not being 
critical it describes the stupidity of the situation perfectly 
the cartoon by wiley of san francisco showed a complacent soviet 
bear and casual uncle sam standing in front of two television 
cameras one camera soviet the other amercian 
the lens in the american camera shows the bear trying to devour 
uncle sam conversely the lens in the soviet camera shows uncle 
sam with a gun to the bears head 
very definately the perceptions are changing ivanov said 
the more of these type of exchanges the more this picture wont 
be true 
not even the most optimistic of the 50 or so people at the 
opening saw rosy sovietus relations being painted with one 
stroke of the brush ivanov however hailed increased cultural 
exchanges made possible by soviet leader mikhail gorbachevs policy 
of glasnost which has opened doors for soviet artists 
the few political jabs in the cartoons shown by the soviet 
artists were light and any political satire tended to generalize 
bureaucracy was lampooned not the bureaucrats 
in one of ivanovs watercolors a man tied to a noose serves as 
the clapper in a bell a smiling man in a uniform swings from the 
hapless clappers feet 
the common man suffers so others can enjoy ivanov 
explained but he quickly pointed out the picture isnt 
representative of capitalism or communism 
its like that everywhere he said 
some americans are slow to accept glasnost as anything more than 
a concept he said 
for instance he pointed to a picture by milt prigee editorial 
cartoonist for the spokane spokesman review 
the cartoon shows a man behind bars with the familiar smiley 
faces drawn around it along with the soviet sickle and the word 
glasnost 
the artist doesnt understand the situation of glasnost 
ivanov said the bars are cut that was a problem before but not 
anymore things are immensely better under gorbachev 
asked for an example ivanov replied for example i am here 
the show continues here through june 7 before heading to los 
angeles dallas atlanta chicago and washington dc after that 
it moves to the soviet union

what makes a good sentence go bad 
like an expensive sports car finetuned and wellbuilt 
portia was sleek shapely and gorgeous her red jumpsuit moulding 
her body which was as warm as the seatcovers in july her hair as 
dark as new tires her eyes flashing like bright hubcaps and her 
lips dewy as the beads of fresh rain on the hood she was a woman 
driven fueled by a single accelerant and she needed a man a 
man who wouldnt shift from his views a man to steer her along the 
right road a man like alf romeo 
that awful thing was submitted to the annual bulwerlytton 
fiction contest by 20yearold journalism student rachel sheeley of 
franklin college in indiana it brought her to the top or the 
bottom of the heap of more than 11000 entries 
the top honor or again the lack of it was announced sunday 
by san jose state university professor scott rice founder and 
grand panjandrum of the literary disgrace he calls the 
baltimore orioles of literature 
whether a boon or bane for the winners career rice points out 
that the competition is not a jokewriting contest it really 
takes a very good writer to deliberately write bad he said 
the contest trashes the battered memory of 19th century english 
writer edward george earle bulwerlytton whose turgid style is 
captured in the opening line of one of his novels it was a dark 
and stormy night 
rice notes that bulwerlytton also is remembered for such 
ringing cliches as the pen is mightier than the sword and the 
great unwashed 
the contest also is a gentle reminder to the world of letters 
that it is ok to lighten up forget the grammar books for a minute 
and have some fun to approach the language recreationally as 
well as practically rice said 
for her effort sheeley wins a word processor this rice noted 
illustrates the computerterminology adage garbage in garbage

about onethird of chinese youth suffer from 
malnutrition despite overall gains made in height and weight in the 
past decade the official china daily reported today 
the report quoted state education commission deputy minister zuo 
shiyin as saying that under standards of the world health 
organization based on heightweight ratio 2898 percent of male 
students and 3616 percent of female students are undernourished 
the findings came from a twoyear study of nearly 1 million chinese 
aged 7 to 22 
the survey found that urban schoolboys have grown an average 12 
inches and are 48 pounds heavier than they were 10 years ago city 
girls are one inch taller and 31 pounds heavier young people in 
rural areas showed somewhat larger increases in both height and 
weight 
but the daily said the growth rates are still far below those of 
japanese students owing mainly to the gap in nutritional levels

separate strong earthquakes rocked northern japan 
and the main philippine island of luzon today swaying buildings 
and trees but apparently not causing any serious injuries or 
damage officials said 
the japanese quake registered a preliminary 52 on the richter 
scale and was the second strong temblor to hit the northern island 
of hokkaido in less than three days central meteorological agency 
officials said 
they said it struck at 744 am 644 pm sunday and was 
centered in the hidaka mountain range 45 miles away from 
saturdays earthquake which measured a preliminary 64 on the 
scale local police said there were no immediate reports of damage 
or casualties 
the predawn philippine earthquake struck at 345 am 355 
pm sunday and registered a preliminary 54 richter reading the 
royal observatory of hong kong said the philippine institute of 
volcanology and seismology said it was centered 110 miles northwest 
of manila under the luzon sea 
earthquakes measuring 5 on the openended richter scale are 
classified as strong and capable of causing considerable damage in 
populated areas however both quakes were located deep below the 
earths surface and therefore caused little damage officials said 
both earthquakes also occurred in quakeprone areas where edges 
of the earths crustal plates are thought to rub together a 
central meteorological agency official said 
its been some time since we had earthquake activity in that 
area of hokkaido so its not surprising to have some now caused by 
a buildup of pressure between the plates he said speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
the official said there was no way of knowing whether the 
japanese quake was related to the one in the philippines 2250 
miles away 
the philippine islands are thought to be located on the edge of 
a separate smaller crustal plate which extends up to southern 
japan 
institute spokesman ulpiano trillanes said the philippine 
earthquake affected a wide area of luzon island including manila 
but apparently caused no serious damage or injuries 
in the past 35 years there have been two major earthquakes in 
hokkaido in 1968 the tokachioki earthquake measuring a 79 on 
the richter scale killed 52 people 
the richter scale measures the total magnitude of an earthquake 
every increase of one digit in the scale represents a tenfold 
increase in magnitude thus a reading of 45 would be 10 times 
stronger than one of 55

crew members on a 25 million yacht 
seized under a us drug policy called zero tolerance say the 
coast guard unfairly targeted the craft and was thrilled to find 
some marijuana seeds and stems 
the 133foot ark royal a white fiberglass floating villa 
trimmed with teakwood and polished brass was escorted into port 
sunday night to be turned over to the government under the 
monthold order to seize any vessel carrying even a tiny amount of 
drugs 
its punishment for no just cause said john koch of san 
diego one of the six crew members which included one woman 
its just a lot of malarkey 
the coast guard cutter tampa stopped the yacht saturday in the 
yucatan channel between cuba and mexico and a search turned up 
less than onetenth of an ounce of marijuana authorities said 
they followed us for maybe one or two hours koch said 
they didnt respond to any of our radio calls they didnt let 
us out of their sight 
but capt norman saunders commander of the coast guard key west 
station said such searches are random and the yacht was not 
singled out as an example 
we generally look at any northbound vessel going through that 
area saunders said the yucatan channel is a natural 
bottleneck from the caribbean to the gulf of mexico 
coast guard officials say the vessel initially was stopped for a 
courtesy boarding to check paperwork and safety equipment but a 
full search was ordered after marijuana residue was found in a 
trash can 
they found five seeds in a trash can and they rooted through 
the whole place said a crew member who gave his name only as 
roy ten seeds and a couple of stems are all they found 
crew members say the coast guard party then came aboard with 
saws and drills hoping to find more illegal drugs but the yachts 
captain refused to allow any more searching until the ship reached 
port 
koch said the yacht departed from san diego more than a month 
ago and was headed to fort lauderdale and then to the mediterranean 
for charters 
its the most beautiful boat ive ever seen said coast 
guard ensign william brewer part of the search party the inside 
of it looks like something out of the great gatsby 
the yacht is decorated in artdeco style and contains works of 
art a grand piano and two jacuzzis brewer said 
the ark royals registered owner is michael j rogerson 
president and chief shareholder of tomima corp said coast guard 
lt john felker neither rogerson nor any passengers were on board 
said felker 
the american civil liberties union said the seizure was 
excessive 
it violates a sense of proportionality said mary coombs a 
member of the aclu miami chapter its putting people at enormous 
risk with no effective way of protecting themselves she said 
boater ken seger said the coast guard is trying to seize private 
vessels and sell them as a way of making up money it lost from its 
recent 100 million budget cuts 
but key west charter boat captain steve knowles said he is 
refusing anyone on his boat who intends to use drugs 
its fine if you want to do it but not on my boat he said 
i dont want to lose my boat and lose my whole livelihood

the following dispatch is from robert kearns of 
reuters the press representative in the pentagon news pool in the 
gulf 
aboard the uss copeland ap us navy divers have exploded a 
mine found drifting in the northern persian gulf by the missile 
frigate simpson 
the mine found sunday was the first discovered in the area since 
the us missile frigate samuel roberts was nearly sunk by a mine 
last month 
also sunday three motor boats raced toward a convoy of us 
ships but veered off a navy official said they were probably 
operated by smugglers 
lt cmdr mark van dyke a navy spokesman told a pentagon media 
pool the simpson reported the mine was 85 miles southwest of farsi 
island where the iranians have a military base navy divers 
detonated it an hour later 
van dyke said the mine was an encrusted myamtype mine that 
apparently had broken loose from its mooring 
the myam is smaller than the type of mine containing 250 pounds 
of explosives that holed the roberts on april 14 off qatar 140 
miles southeast of farsi wounding 10 crewmen 
president reagan has accused iran of laying the mines to disrupt 
gulf shipping in retaliation for the roberts mining he ordered 
attacks on iranian oil platforms april 18 
that led to a string of clashes between us and iranian ships 
the us navy claimed it sunk three iranian warships and damaged 
three others 
a multinational mine sweeping force has detonated at least six 
mines since the roberts was hit french warships have reported 
finding other mines further south in that period 
the us navy backed by the british french belgians and 
italians has dealt with scores of mines in or near the gulf since 
last summer 
sundays mine discovery came as shipping traffic picked up in 
the waterway after a lull caused by last months clashes 
but the shipping community remains edgy tehran has sworn 
revenge for its losses last month 
earlier sunday three fastmoving motor boats raced across the 
strait of hormuz gateway to the gulf toward a usescorted 
convoy 
one darted under the copelands guns across the warships bow 
that jarred already jittery nerves aboard the convoy ships as the 
whalertype boat sped past into the wake of the supply ship uss san 
jose and the oil tanker ranger 
all three unidentified boats then disappeared into the 
sweltering haze heading toward the oman coast 
the copelands captain cmdr gm ziller jr radioed a warning 
to the apparently unarmed boats but raised no response 
ziller said they may have been smugglers who decided to ignore 
what he joked was the law of gross tonnage by zipping in front 
of the heavily armed 3600ton frigate i dont think there was 
any hostile intent he said 
the convoy passed within range of chinesemade silkworm missiles 
on the nearby iranian coast 
the pace of usescorted convoys has returned to what it was 
before the april 18 fighting and iranian navy ships have all but 
disappeared 
four convoys have moved through the strait in the past week and 
navy officials say the escort operations will continue as needed 
irans 354foot supply ship booshehr glided within 2500 yards 
of the 3700ton missile frigate uss jack williams early saturday 
the two ships sailed past each other without incident in the the 
closest encounter between the two navies since last months battles 
some us navy officers believe the iranians are licking their 
wounds and deciding what went wrong before making the next move 
i think theyre doing what we would be doing in the same 
situation the skipper of the 24000ton san jose capt willard 
j halley told the media pool saturday 
theyre figuring out what happened to the chain of command and 
whos responsible and what should be done about it 
this could be a lull while they work on the next step he 
said noting a longstanding split between the regular iranian navy 
and the revolutionary guards who have attacked neutral shipping 
with armed speedboats 
since the april 18 fighting reagan has laid down new rules for 
us warships patrolling the gulf allowing them to help 
nonamerican ships under attack if us intervention is requested 
the navy has 28 warships in the region including an aircraft 
carrierled task force stationed in the north arabian sea

mourners wanting to getting their loved ones 
to the cemetery in comfort may want to consider the latest in 
funeral coaches one with velvet seats and options like a stereo 
refrigerator and microwave oven 
the airstream family funeral coach gets 9 to 12 miles per gallon 
and eliminates traffic snarls resulting from caravans of mourners 
traveling to the cemetery according to its manufacturer 
all this comfort and practicality doesnt come cheap however 
funeral home directors can expect to pay 52000 to 73000 for the 
aluminum coaches 
the 28foot vehicle constructed from a motor home chassis can 
carry 16 people up front and the dear departed in a separate 
compartment toward the rear the casket can be surrounded by 
shelves of flowers and be bathed in spotlight 
some of the relatives may not have seen each other for 20 
years said karl h croel salesman for the ohiobased airstream 
the time that they get a chance to talk together is when theyre 
together in the privacy of this coach 
airstream displayed one of its coaches at a recent funeral 
directors meeting in indianapolis 
needhamstorey funeral service which has funeral homes in 
marion and gas city owns one a strictly nofrills model lacking 
many of airstreams available amenities such as lavatory 
we were somewhat skeptical but we still voted to go ahead and 
buy it said steven wampner coowner of needhamstorey we 
knew without a doubt that it is the funeral vehicle of the 
future 
not every funeral director liked the silverandblack vehicle 
i think its a little much said christina burkholder who 
works at her familys funeral home in seymour 
she said a hearse or a limousine commands respect but if 
onlookers saw the airstream coach cruising down the street youd 
think it was the brady bunch going to the grand canyon

the world wildlife fund arguing that endangered 
animals should not be used to boost zoo profits plans to oppose a 
scheduled visit by a touring pair of chinese giant pandas to zoo 
atlanta 
the fund already has filed objections to panda visits at the 
toledo ohio zoo and the michigan state fair in detroit however 
the us fish and wildlife service which must approve the visits 
has approved the toledo visit 
the agency will not rule on michigans panda request until at 
least june 6 said spokesman dave klinger in washington 
the fund contends that the exhibits would serve no scientific 
purpose and that shortterm loans inhibit panda breeding 
a delegation from toledo is in china to pick up the pandas and 
is expected to return with the animals friday toledo zoo 
spokeswoman nancy foley said 
the atlanta visit scheduled for september was arranged by former 
president jimmy carter during a trip to china last year 
rich block the funds director of public programs said an 
american law and an international agreement prohibit commercial 
exploitation of endangered animals 
block a former curator of education at zoo atlanta said it was 
painful for him to oppose the exhibit because he considers zoo 
director terry maple a great proponent of conservation 
zoo atlanta officials said they are still preparing their 
application 
klinger said the toledo permit requires that china use loan 
profits for panda conservation projects toledo zoo officials 
ensure the money is used for conservation and the zoo reports 
annually on how china used the money for conservation 
block said china typically gets 300000 to 500000 for a 
threemonth panda exhibit 
none of the applications submitted thus far contains a provision 
to use profits to help pandas he said 
i can see where panda exhibits could be a great boon to panda 
conservation block said if all the extra money realized from 
a panda exhibit was returned to conservation then that would mean 
using that creature for its own protection and that would be fine

and promotion budgets and school board meetings 
if the teachers new roles do not improve student performance 
the plan and most of the gains teachers stand to make will end with 
the contract extension said william moloney superintendent of the 
easton area school district 
if we find out that dictatorial governance works better then 
by god well do it moloney said but we believe thats not 
true 
the idea called shared governance also calls for creation 
of a labormanagement panel to hear concerns about teacher 
transfers assignments or schedule changes and a master teacher 
panel to recognize superior teachers and to encourage them to 
assist colleagues falling short of expectations 
shared governance says you are a professional and were now 
going to give you control over what you are entrusted to do said 
jo anne bailey a fifthgrade teacher and presidentelect of the 
teachers union 
the plan was proposed by moloney and revised during eight months 
of discussion with principals teachers union representatives and 
school board members 
the contract extension includes significant increases in 
teachers and principals salaries beginning in 1990 moloney said 
the average teacher salary in the district is about 28400 but 
the parties refused to provide specific figures on increases before 
the vote 
known as an advocate for teachers moloney gained their trust 
soon after arriving here in late 1984 in 1985 he won approval of 
a fiveyear contract in a district where bitterness led to strikes 
in 1976 and 1980 
moloney said much of the proposal was based on his 
interpretations of recommendations made in the may 1986 carnegie 
corporation task force report called a nation prepared teachers 
for the 21st century 
some of its recommendations have been tried in rochester ny 
where moloney was assistant superintendent before coming to easton 
large salaries for teachers and limited shared governance have made 
rochester a muchscrutinized laboratory for school reform but 
moloney wanted to go further 
the easton proposal differs by forcing teachers and principals 
to bet major contract provisions on plans scheduled to take effect 
two years later 
all participants the school board teachers and principals 
can veto the plans which include a new evaluation system for 
teachers and administrators and a new program to recognize 
outstanding teachers 
if any provision fails to take effect as scheduled the 
principals forfeit their hefty salary increases and the teachers 
lose their personnel committee for reviewing teacher transfers 
this is serious carrot and stick stuff moloney said 
the pact is part of moloneys larger goal teaching the 
districts 7600 students to read and write add and subtract 
moloney said his plan will mean nothing if it does not produce 
bettereducated children the bottom line is demonstrably 
improved outcome moloney said the name of the game in 
education reform is better outcomes

stunned leaders of chancellor helmut 
kohls governing christian democrats gathered today after their 
party was ousted from power in state elections in 
schleswigholstein for the first time in 38 years 
the partys top officials led by kohl met in bonn to assess 
the damage done to the conservative christian democrats in the 
sunday elections in the northern west german state 
the results marked one of the worst defeats for the governing 
party since kohl took office five years ago 
the schleswigholstein poll also was a decisive victory for the 
opposition social democrats who had lost ground in a string of 
state elections over the past 18 months 
while the schleswigholstein election will have little immediate 
effect on kohls coalition government in bonn it will boost the 
social democrats flagging morale nationwide 
the results may also increase bickering with kohls often 
fractious threeparty federal coalition 
the election will also narrow but leave intact the christian 
democratic majority in the bundesrat or upper house of the west 
german parliament 
unofficial results showed the christian democrats polled 333 
percent of the vote which was called to break the stalemate in the 
states government that followed an inconclusive election in 
september 1987 in the september vote the christian democrats had 
polled 426 percent of the vote 
the social democrats posted a surprising 548 percent of the 
vote well above the 452 percent it polled in september according 
to the unofficial figures 
the results were the bestever posted by the social democrats in 
schleswigholstein and gave the party 46 of the 74 seats in the 
states parliament 
the liberal free democratic party the junior party in kohls 
governing coalition also posted decisive losses falling from 52 
percent of the vote in september to 44 percent sunday 
the loss was key because it means the free democrats failed to 
win 5 percent of the vote and are thus barred from taking any 
parliamentary seats under west german law 
the environmental greens party also failed to win parliamentary 
seats posting just 29 percent of the vote well below the 39 
percent it won in september 
under west german voting procedures it will be several days 
before the results based on reported returns from polling 
stations are verified and declared final 
political analysts say the social democratic majority assures 
that the state governors post will go to bjoern engholm who led 
the opposition party through what was a largely lackluster campaign 
engholm was the target of a political dirty tricks campaign last 
year by former christian democratic governor uwe barschel 
after the campaign came to light barschel was found dead in a 
geneva hotel in october and authorities ruled the death an 
apparent suicide

striking shipyard workers today rejected a 
compromise that would have forced them to end their weeklong strike 
and drop their demand for legalization of solidarity in exchange 
for a pay raise 
there is no freedom without solidarity the workers chanted 
at a rally this morning as they rejected the compromise offered by 
management following a fourhour negotiating session with the 
strike committee union sources said 
piotr konopka an aide to solidarity founder lech walesa said 
the 400 to 500 workers at the shipyard repeatedly screamed no 
when told of the offer 
the tentative deal had taken shape in talks revived at the 
initiative of a politburo member on sunday strike leaders said 
interior minister czeslaw kiszczak a ranking communist party 
politburo member twice telephoned a lawyer acting as a mediator to 
revive the talks after they broke down late sunday afternoon 
according to accounts given by strike committee members 
the conversations between kiszczak and lawyer wladyslaw 
silanowicki a former solidarity member who has since agreed to 
serve on polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelskis consultative 
citizens council led to new talks 
as a result the strike committee wrote a letter to management 
on sunday in which it agreed to end the strike and postpone its 
longterm goal of reinstating solidarity under the following 
conditions 
guarantee of safe passage from the shipyard for strikers and 
the people who have assisted them 
promises of no discipliantry action against strikers including 
fines dismissals or prosecutions 
a wage increase of 38 dollars on the average monthly wage of 
the last three months or about 105 
formation of a joint committee from members of the strike 
committee and the shipyard workers council to oversee 
implementation of the agreement 
management ultimately agreed to a raise of 39 monthly based on 
the average wage in the third quarter of 1987 when wages were 
somewhat lower strike sources said the average pay for that 
quarter was not immediately available 
in addition strike sources said there was a promise that fired 
solidarity activists would be rehired but only if the shipyard was 
short of manpower and an oral promise that some unspecified 
political prisoners would be freed 
the number of strikers was only about half the 8001000 
reported inside the yard friday according to western reporters 
there sunday walesa has remained among the workers at the plant 
the strike began may 2 
a settlement would have ended a twoweek wave of labor unrest 
which the government has said is threatening polands reputation 
abroad and its economic reform plans at home it has been polands 
worst labor upheaval since the 1981 military crackdown the preceded 
the outlawing of solidarity 
the union born in the gdansk shipyard in august 1980 was the 
first independent trade union in the east bloc 
meanwhile polands roman catholic primate cardinal jozef 
glemp spoke out sunday for the right of all people to participate 
in societys decisions his sermon followed a statement saturday by 
polishborn pope john paul ii that strikes can be justified and 
poland lacked true democracy 
and 55 intellectuals and oppositionists charged in an open 
letter that the governments policy of national reconciliation is a 
game of appearances 
on sunday management told workers inside the shipyard they 
could face discipline or arrest if they did not leave by 6 pm 
said konopka the workers ignored the ultimatum 
the government has never ruled out the use of force to end the 
strike a predawn raid by a police antiterrorist unit and riot 
police crushed a 10day strike by steelworkers in nowa huta in 
southern poland on thursday 
on sunday morning at least 7000 sloganchanting people 
attended a church service to support the workers on strike for a 
seventh day 
thousands of police reappeared on the streets of this baltic 
port city to maintain order around st brygidas church where 
worshippers rallied and heard a rousing speech by the rev henryk 
jankowski a friend and adviser of walesa 
food supplies were choked off in a police blockade in place 
since thursday children as young as 8 and 10 have been sneaking 
into the shipyard with a little food notes and cigarettes he said 
in the wave of strikes that began april 25 workers have pressed 
for higher wages to counteract inflation hitting 42 percent in the 
first three months of 1988 authorities have argued that some of 
the strikes were instigated by professional politicians 
especially leaders of solidarity who want to exploit polands 
economic troubles for political ends

the former us ambassador to 
panama denied telling vice president george bush as early as 1985 
that gen manuel antonio noriega may have been involved in drug 
trafficking 
the ambassador everett ellis briggs said on sunday there was 
not enough evidence against noriega panamas de facto ruler at 
that time 
i could not have briefed the vice president on noriegas 
drugrunning drugsmuggling or moneylaundering activities because 
we simply did not have evidence of those activities at that time 
and so any statement to the effect that i did brief him on such 
matters at that time simply is not true briggs told a news 
conference in tegucigalpa 
the new york times reported in its sunday editions that briggs 
had sent cables to the us state department about allegations of 
noriegas drug dealings and that briggs told bush about the 
substance of those cables during a meeting on dec 16 1985 
bush a republican presidential candidate has said he knew of 
no clear evidence that noriega was involved in drugs until february 
noriega commands panamas defense forces and is the power behind 
the civilian government in that nation the general was indicted by 
two federal grand juries in florida on drug trafficking charges and 
has rejected us demands that he resign 
briggs was ambassador to panama in 1985 and is now ambassador to 
honduras he acknowledged that there were persistent reports about 
noriega and drug trafficking 
panamanian sources would come to us and say why do you have 
dealings with this man when it is well known that he is a drug 
smuggler and our answer always was provide us the evidence and 
unfortunately during the time i was in panama that evidence was not 
forthcoming he said 
now i am sorry it took so long for us to get the evidence 
he said i am sorry that we werent able to get it sooner and i 
am very very glad that the evidence was available finally so that 
noriega could be indicted i consider him probably the most 
pernicious element in this hemisphere at this time 
a us embassy spokesman in tegucigalpa read a partial 
transcript of briggs news conference statements to the associated 
press 
the new york times quoting unidentified reagan administration 
officials reported that a memo from bush aides to the vice 
president before his meeting with briggs said the meeting was to 
discuss us relations with panama and narcotics matters 
briggs said he did not have a written record of what he and bush 
discussed during their meeting but he imagined it would have been 
the slaying of hugo spadafora a critic of noriega and the 
circumstances leading to noriegas ouster of elected president 
nicolas ardito barletta 
he said he doubted he would have discussed with bush the cables 
he was sending to washington at the time

right in the world 
i call on all the french particularly those who supported the 
antisocialist candidate to organize with us and with the national 
front the unification of the french people to assure the identity 
the survival the greatness of our country france le pen said 
moderate rightists reacted angrily 
it is the national front which to a great extent allowed mr 
mitterrands victory said jean lecanuet president of the 
centrist union for french democracy that has been part of chiracs 
governing coalition 
social affairs minister philippe seguin rejected any alliance 
between the conservatives and extreme right 
there will never be a political accord he said we will 
continue the path which has always been ours that is to say there 
will never be a national accord with the front

alliance with the national front said the fronts

danes vote in a parliamentary 
election tuesday that will serve as a referendum on this nations 
future in the nato alliance 
prime minister poul schlueter called for the elections just 
eight months after the last vote because the socialistdominated 
parliament ignored his objections and passed a resolution 
toughening denmarks nonnuclear status 
under parliaments resolution denmark must notify each visiting 
warship that nuclear arms are barred from danish ports in peacetime 
that has been the danish stand for 31 years but until now it 
has been merely a general statement of policy 
nato said such a resolution would undermine the unity of the 
western alliance and could threaten the ability of the united 
states and britain to protect denmark in an emergency 
schlueter leader of the minority centerright government 
called for new elections rather than implement the resolution 
the opposition campaign has taken on an antiamerican tint 
centered around the slogan denmark decides for itself 
if there are two people agreeing on danish politics its 
ronald reagan and margaret thatcher says an election poster 
depicting the us president and the british prime minister in an 
embrace 
fortythree years ago denmark again became part of the free 
world counters a poster for the liberal party a member of 
schueters fourparty centerright alliance 
polls indicate that most danes agree with the traditional 
antinuclear position one recent survey said 82 percent of those 
asked favored a nuclearfree zone in scandinavia and 46 percent 
said they would support the idea even if it meant denmarks 
expulsion from nato 
early polls indicate that neither the conservativeled 
government nor the socialist opposition may emerge as a clear 
winner on tuesday and denmark could once again be governed by an 
unwieldy minority coalition 
surveys trying to forecast tuesdays outcome have been 
inconclusive but several have shown modest gains for the 
opposition partnership of the social democrats and the socialist 
peoples party 
in last septembers election schlueters coalition won 70 seats 
in the 179member folketing and the socialist bloc took 81 seats 
each side also had two more supporters from the autonomous 
territories of greenland and the faroe islands 
the balance of power is held by the 11seat socialliberal 
party which usually supports the governments economic policies 
and the oppositions foreign and defense policies 
the antitax progress party with 9 seats and the farleft 
common course party with 4 seats make up the balance 
the shape of the next government could be determined by niels 
helveg petersen the socialliberal leader who could even make a 
bid to become prime minister in the event of a deadlock between the 
two traditional blocs 
three other parties are contesting the election but none is 
expected to pass the minimum of 2 percent of the votes cast needed 
to gain a seat 
polls open at 9 am for the 39 million eligible voters 
results should be known shortly after they close at 8 pm 
schlueter argues that the antinuclear resolution could lead to 
a refusal by allied ships to pull into danish ports it would be 
totally devastating for denmarks defense he told a news 
conference thursday 
we will not accept a resolution that brings our full 
membership of nato into doubt added foreign minister uffe 
ellemannjensen the liberal party leader 
if the resolution is allowed to stand and visiting ships are 
given a letter the next step would be to ask for an 
acknowledgement of that letter the next step would be to demand 
guarantees and the next step would be the right to inspection 
he said on friday

using tanks mortars and rockets 
todays casualties brought the overall toll to 129 dead and 322 
wounded since the fighting began friday between the syrianarmed 
amal militia and the iranianbacked hezbollah or party of god 
most of the 18 foreign hostages in lebanon are believed held in 
the labyrinthine slums 
the fighting flared after two weekend ceasefires collapsed in 
the battle for control of slums that stretch for 16 square miles 
along beiruts southern edge the clashes began when four amal men 
were killed in a street ambush and amal blamed hezbollah 
gunbattles flared in the alsahel hospital where a doctor said 
militiamen forced surgeons to operate at gunpoint on dead comrades

first lady nancy reagan prevented president 
reagan from speaking out at the height of the irancontra affair 
because her astrologer told her the time was not right to go out in 
public former white house chief of staff donald t regan said 
today 
the president was practically immobile during that period of 
december 1986 january and february of 87 all because the first 
lady was saying no no no he cant go out regan said on 
nbctvs today program 
now she used as an excuse the fact that he had a minor 
operation right after the christmas holidays but i said no this 
president is going to get shot down in flames hes not out talking 
to the people about irancontra he should be making his own case 
but he didnt 
in his book for the record from wall street to washington 
which went on sale today regan said he believes the presidents 
contention that he knew nothing of the irancontra affair in which 
proceeds from secret us arms sales to iran were diverted to the 
nicaraguan rebels until told about it by attorney general edwin 
meese iii on nov 25 1986 
the president is a ruddy man with bright red cheeks he 
blanched when he heard meeses words the color drained from his 
face leaving his skin pasty white nobody who saw the 
presidents reaction that afternoon could believe for a moment that 
he knew about the diversion of funds before meese told him about 
it he was the picture of a man to whom the inconceivable had 
happened regan wrote 
he said that he urged the president to conteract the effects of 
the irancontra affair by undertaking an active speaking schedule 
outside washington but was balked by astrological advice to the 
first lady that harm would come to reagan if he went out of the 
white house 
by humoring her we had given her control he said of mrs 
reagan 
regan in his memoir portrayed the president as a hesitant and 
unassertive chief executive controlled by a wife who relied heavily 
upon the predictions of an astrologer 
former press secretary larry speakes who also wrote a kiss 
and tell book about his years in the white house said today he 
was not aware of the first ladys reliance on astrology 
i didnt see it and had no evidence of it speakes said on 
cbss this morning show ive got no reason to doubt but i 
never saw any crystal balls in the cabinet room from time to time 
strange people did come into the white house but i didnt know 
that they were astrologers if they were 
the white house issued a brief statement about the book on 
sunday that said vindictiveness and revenge are not admirable 
qualities and are not worthy of comment donald regans attempts 
to defame the first lady on mothers day no less are certainly in 
that category 
asked about the white house statement regan responded they 
ought to know it when they see it

sikhs inside the golden temple opened 
fire today on nearby government security posts police said 
setting off a gun battle in which two civilians died and five 
paramilitary troops were injured 
the sikh extremists began firing automatic rifles at 115 pm 
and the troops returned fire with light machine guns according to 
police superintendent baldev singh the fighting continued for at 
least three hours 
singh said it was not known if any militants where killed or 
injured in the exchange 
the civilians killed in the crossfire outside the golden temple 
complex were identified by police as venod kumar 30 a hindu who 
worked with the red cross and dilip kaur an 80yearold sikh 
among the injured was the deputy inspector general of the 
paramilitary central reserve police force ss virk he was out of 
danger after surgery for a bullet wound on his chin the united 
news of india said 
virk and other senior paramilitary officers had gone to 
government security posts on rooftops near the shrine to look at a 
bunker sikh militants were building at the western end of the 
golden temple complex 
police said the militants opened fire from at least 16 sites in 
the temple complex mainly with chinesemade ak47 automatic rifles 
the troops returned fire with light machine guns according to 
singh 
shops and businesses in bazaars around the golden temple closed 
their shutters and an indefinite curfew was imposed on the old 
walled central part of amritsar to keep civilians indoors 
more than 1000 police and paramilitary troops were rushed to 
the temple to seal exits and prevent people from entering 
sikh extremists have been waging a guerrilla campaign since 1982 
for more political autonomy or an independent homeland for sikhs in 
punjab the golden temple is sikhisms holiest shrine 
in june 1984 the indian army stormed the golden temple to drive 
out militants and more than 1200 people were killed later that 
year prime minister indira gandhi was assassinated by two sikh 
bodguards in revenge for the raid setting off antisikh rioting in 
which 2000 people died 
the gun battle today was the worst in a series that began 
shortly after jasbir singh rode was restored as the temples chief 
priest in early march rode had been in custody under the 
governments antiterrorism rules but was freed in an effort by 
prime minister rajiv gandhi to placate the extremists and lure them 
into negotiations 
since rodes return there have been persistent reports that the 
militants have been building bunkers and firing ports in the temple 
complex 
the militants fired on police outside the temple last week when 
security forces tried to arrest a sikh militant as he was heading 
for the shrine the militant escaped and fled into the temple but 
he was believed wounded 
sikhs whose religion was founded about 500 years ago as an 
alternative to hinduism and islam claim they are discriminated 
against by indias majority hindus sikhs make up less than 2 
percent of indias 800 million population but are a majority in 
punjab 
meanwhile five more people were reported killed by sikh 
extremists in overnight attacks in punjab the united news of india 
reported the slayings followed an attack by the radicals in 
neighboring haryana on saturday in which 13 hindus were killed 
during a wedding party 
the latest killings raised to about 940 the number of deaths 
blamed on the sikh separatists this year 
the rate of killings is more than twice that of 1987 when 1000 
people were killed by sikh extremists most victims have been 
hindus or moderate sikhs in punjab

pope john paul ii today met privately 
with president julio sanguinetti the agnostic leader of this 
nominally roman catholic but highly secularized country 
the pope bundled up against a 45degree chill on a foggy south 
american fall morning rode in a bulletproof limousine to the 
75yearold french baroquestyle presidential residence in the 
prado district once the capitals most elegant but now a bit 
rundown 
aides say john paul has been buoyed by the official reception he 
has received in tiny uruguay population 3 million which is 
considered the most secular country in south america it maintains 
strict separation of church and state and calls christmas 
families day to avoid religious connotations 
the pontiff who is on the last day of his visit to uruguay 
today was to travel to the orangegrowing city of salto on the 
northwestern border with argentina he is then to fly to la paz 
the 2milehigh capital of bolivia the next country on his 
12day fournation pilgrimage 
since arriving in uruguay on friday the pope has taken on one 
of the most difficult issues in latin america how to spread the 
wealth controlled by a few 
in a stop sunday in uruguays gaucho cowboy country john paul 
came up against the contrasts that have bedeviled governments for 
generations throughout much of latin america 
herds of cattle grazed peacefully on large estates outside melo 
a northeastern city of 40000 near the brazilian frontier that 
church officials say is one of the poorest regions in uruguay 
speaking to a crowd of 50000 gathered on a dirt field john 
paul said he was directing an appeal to all catholic faithful and 
all uruguayans of good will 
those who own land and other categories of wealth must take 
into account that there is a social mortgage on all private 
property john paul said in spanish explaining that this meant 
the property must be used for the good of the entire community 
he cited church documents that wealth should be used to create 
jobs and that farmworkers should be paid enough to prevent the 
swelling of migrations to the cities nearly half of uruguays 3 
million residents live in this capital beside the river plate 
the pope also spoke out strongly for union rights saying that 
those who sought to better the conditions of workers deserve 
unconditional support 
vatican officials say they have been delighted at the turnout of 
government officials at papal events and by the local medias 
coverage of the visit president julio sanguinetti an agnostic 
flew to melo for the papal stopover 
the church says 80 percent of the country is roman catholic but 
only about 5 percent attend mass regularly in montevideo divorce 
has been legal since 1907 separation of church and state is 
mandated by law and teaching religion is banned in public schools 
a vatican official briefing reporters on grounds of anonymity 
noted that two cabinet ministers have attended each event in 
montevideo melo and florida we hope this is the start of a new 
climate the official said 
the popes tour is his ninth to latin america in his 
nineyearold papacy reflecting the vaticans interest in the 
region 
latin america is expected to contain half the worlds roman 
catholics by the end of the century there are an estimated 860 
million roman catholics now in the world 
after uruguay and five days in landlocked bolivia the 
67yearold pope will visit peru and paraguay before returning to 
rome on may 19

described as incoherent the jury returned to court today for a 
sixth day of deliberations on whether wayne carl coleman should die 
for his part in the six 1973 slayings of the alday family 
superior court judge hugh lawson on sunday morning excused a 
juror and replaced her with one of three remaining alternates at 
330 pm he sent the jurors back to their hotel with instructions 
to return today 
the jury met briefly with lawson this morning before resuming 
its talks 
defense attorney tom west moved again sunday for lawson to 
declare the jury deadlocked that would bring coleman an automatic 
life sentence 
coleman was one of three men originally convicted and sentenced 
to die for the 1973 slayings of six members of the ned alday family 
in seminole county the verdicts were thrown out in 1985 by a 
federal appeals court which cited pretrial publicity 
the juror who was excused did not accompany the other jurors to 
the dekalb county courthouse sunday morning she arrived separately 
and then testified before lawson 
much of her testimony was inaudible several times she said 
they put a bug in my ear remember mary alday 
mary alday was raped and killed in a field near the mobile home 
where her husband jerry alday and four other alday men were 
killed on may 14 1973 
a deputy assigned to watch the sequestered jurors testified the 
juror was mumbling nonsense she was not coherent she is not 
physically or mentally capable to continue

only by force

on wednesday the jurors began deliberating whether he should be 
sentenced to death or life in prison

jesse jackson spent the night at the home 
of an unemployed coal miner then declared at a rally today that 
his message of economic equality is crossing racial lines in the 
nations depressed areas 
democratic rival michael dukakis and republican george bush took 
a break from the rigors of the presidential race by tending to 
business at home today one day before west virginia along with 
nebraska has its primary 
jackson who spent sunday night at the home of junior and becky 
cook said that in the poorer sections of west virginia his message 
is wellreceived even in a town such as allwhite arnett 
they have their race but they dont jobs jackson said 
they have their race but they dont have health insurance they 
have their race but they dont have hot and cold running water 
their race does not address those needs 
the town of arnett has only 300 residents but more than 500 
people showed up to greet jackson when he arrived at the cook home 
sunday night 
the overwhelming number were very favorable and very 
supportive jackson said though becky cook said some made some 
smurky remarks 
jackson said of the detractors we have to displace peoples 
fears with security and give them assurances theyve never had 
before 
on sunday speaking at tristate airport near huntington and 
later at a rally in beckley jackson criticized both bush and 
president reagan asking what is reaganomics but reverse robin 
hood what is reaganomics but unionbusting 
jackson also reacted to reports that bush was briefed three 
years ago about a panamanian drug connection the democratic 
candidate said the reason mr bush has not led the charge to 
fight drugs is because he knew of the administrations dealings 
with the drug dealers 
he called bushs alleged knowledge of contacts between 
panamanian strongman manuel noriega and drug dealers 
intolerable 
meanwhile however in honduras the former us ambassador to 
panama everett ellis briggs denied telling bush as early as 1985 
that gen manuel antonio noriega may have been involved in drug 
trafficking 
the new york times reported in its sunday editions that briggs 
had sent cables to the state department about allegations of 
noriegas drug dealings and that briggs had told bush the 
substance of those cables on dec 16 1985 
dukakis the democratic frontrunner and bush who has the gop 
nomination locked up were taking today off from campaigning with 
dukakis back home in massachusetts and bush in washington 
in beckley an obviously weary jackson occasionally stumbled 
over his words even so he managed repeatedly to bring the crowd 
to its feet despite a twohour wait for the candidate 
a town heavily dependent on the coal industry beckley is the 
site of some of west virginias worst economic conditions and 
jackson referred to that situation in attacking reaganomics 
profits are up wages are down plants are closed mines are 
closed and workers are abandoned jackson said 
he attacked absentee coal mine companies which he said 
drain the coal and drain the coal miner strip the soil and strip 
the people then leave you abandoned 
he advocated a panamerican energy alliance to coordinate 
policies for oil from canada the united states and central 
america coal from appalachia and hydro and solar power 
jackson ended his beckley speech by citing president franklin 
roosevelt who he noted used a wheelchair jackson then climbed 
through the crowd to greet a disabled woman jan lilly of 
huntington who had listened to his speech while sitting in a 
wheelchair

very lucky to survive an attack by a rhinoceros that charged 
and badly wounded him while he was working in the jungle with his 
5yearold son 
david smith 46 of st paul minn was attacked saturday while 
on a research outing with his son alex and local hunters 
he told the associated press he hoped to return to his work soon 
in southern nepal i was very lucky it the rhinoceros did 
not open my abdominal cavity he said i hope to be out of the 
hospital in a couple of weeks time 
the university of minnesota researcher was taken to the hospital 
in patan south of katmandu by army helicopter 
his wife francie cuthbertsmith a bird specialist at the 
university of minnesota said of her husband plans to return to 
work he is always happiest when he works in the chitwan 
jungles

about 160 feet from their living quarters smith said his party was 
setting traps to catch small animals for research when the 
rhinoceros appeared 
we did not hear the sounds of any animal on that morning 
smith said but all of sudden i saw a rhino rushing towards me 
charging from a distance of about 15 feet 
i turned around and started to run but i realized that i 
could not escape so i used my hands pushing to keep the animal 
away 
it gored my chest he said the animal hit me about 12 
times sometimes i was able to roll i did this so the animal 
would miss me 
smith received four major wounds to his head chest leg and 
buttocks

animals razorsharp lower teeth not from its huge horn

mahendra trust for nature conservation in katmandu he handled it 
very coolly 
mishra told the st paul minn pioneer press dispatch by

cashiered army gen carlos suarez 
mason argentinas mostwanted military fugitive was extradited 
from the united states today to face trial for the murders of 
suspected leftists in the 1970s 
the extradition was ordered april 27 in san francisco by us 
district judge lowell jensen who ruled suarez mason could be tried 
in argentina on charges of 39 murders allegedly committed by troops 
under his command if convicted the maximum sentence is life in 
prison 
the 64yearold former general fled argentina in 1984 and was 
arrested by federal marshals in foster city calif a san 
francisco suburb where he has been living under an assumed name 
federal police chief juan pirker confirmed that suarez mason 
arrived at ezeira international airport at 905 am aboard an 
aerolinas argentinas flight from new york pirker said suarez mason 
was accompanied by five guards but he refused to provide further 
details 
the handcuffed prisoner was escorted off the plane by federal 
police officers witnesses said was put aboard an armored vehicle 
and taken to federal police headquarters in downtown buenos aires 
suarez mason was stripped of his military rank in april 1984 
after he was declared in rebellion when he failed to appear 
before a military tribunal for questioning in connection with the 
abduction torture and murder of suspected leftists 
at least 9000 argentines disappeared in a socalled dirty 
war waged against leftists by the military regime that seized 
power in 1976 after ousting former president isabel peron 
suarez masons trial was personally ordered by president raul 
alfonsin shortly after he took office in december 1983 ending 
nearly eight years of rightist military rule 
suarez mason was commander of the buenos airesbased 1st army 
corps from 1976 to 1978 when he was promoted to head of the joint 
chiefs of staff he retired in 1981 and was named president of the 
state oil monopoly yacimientos petroliferos fiscales a post he 
held until 1982 
argentina sought suarez masons extradition on 43 separate 
charges of murder he also has been accused of 635 cases of human 
rights abuse as well as misappropriation of more than 2 million 
while he headed the state oil monopoly 
in approving suarez masons extradition jensen ruled he could 
be tried on 39 murder murders as well as an additional charge of 
forging a passport renewal 
but the judge rejected the four other murder charges after 
ruling that identification of the victims was inadequate he also 
ordered the dismissal of 23 kidnapping charges saying the 5year 
legal deadline for filing the charges expired in 1984 
under the extradition law suarez mason can be tried only on 
charges for which extradition is approved

two american physicians have been allowed to 
perform an autopsy on a political activist and visit a jailed 
dissident in czechoslovakia apparently the first time a 
sovietbloc country has agreed to such concessions 
the doctors part of the somervillebased physicians for human 
rights performed an autopsy last wednesday on pavel wonka a 
35yearold imprisoned dissident who died april 26 wonka had been 
arrested in 1986 for his political activities among them running 
for office human rights officials said 
jonathan fine executive director of the somerville 
organization said the czech government allowed the american 
doctors into the country after they requested permission to perform 
an autopsy 
in january one american doctor from the group visited 
czechoslovakia in the hope of meeting with wonka but it could not 
be arranged at that time fine said 
fine said the czech government did not explain why they allowed 
the doctors into the country but its speculated that because 
czech officials had already completed an autopsy on wonka they 
believed they had nothing to hide 
both fine and the helsinki watch human rights monitoring 
organization in new york said they believed no other sovietbloc 
country had permitted american physicians such access 
doctors robert s lawrence and robert h kirschner who 
performed the autopsy said they found no evidence of torture or 
beatings and said the probable cause of death was pulmonary emboli 
or blood clots on the lung 
but fine said it was unusual for a 35yearold man to die from 
the disorder and speculated that harsh prison conditions may have 
contributed to wonkas death 
after performing the autopsy the two doctors also spent 90 
minutes with jiri wolf 36 who is serving a prison term of 
undetermined length on charges of slander against the state

president francois mitterrand who steamrolled to 
reelection over conservative premier jacques chirac faces the 
task of forming a new socialistled government while the right 
controls the parliament 
chirac offered to resign tuesday and was awaiting a response 
from the socialist president sources in chiracs office said today 
chirac lost to mitterrand in runoff voting sunday final results 
from the interior ministry showed mitterrand with 54 percent of the 
vote to chiracs 46 percent 
the leading candidate to succeed the premier appeared to be 
michel rocard a former agriculture minister and socialist party 
member other possibilities were former finance ministers jacques 
delors and pierre beregovoy 
the sources in the premiers office speaking on condition of 
anonymity said chiracs chief of staff maurice ulrich called 
mitterrands advisers to propose to transfer the reins of 
government on tuesday afternoon 
there was no immediate indication from mitterrand on whether he 
would be ready to name a successor so soon 
reporters who gathered at chiracs hotel matignon offices on the 
left bank saw aides busily packing up files in cardboard boxes and 
plastic sacks to clear the way for the new premiers staff 
the financial markets responded favorably this morning to the 
election results the french franc was steady to higher in early 
trading while the stock market was steady to higher in calm trading 
shortly after the exchange opened the general market indicator was 
up 106 percent after 30 minutes of trading 
currency traders said the francs steady opening level was 
expected since mitterrands economic policies are not viewed as 
differing widely from chiracs 
mitterrand 71 is the first president elected twice by popular 
vote charles de gaulle was elected in 1958 and 1965 and two other 
men served twice but before a 1962 constitutional amendment 
french presidents always were chosen by indirect election 
unlike 1981 when socialists danced at the bastille to mark a 
historic victory for the left victory celebrations this year were 
subdued mitterrand supporters did honk their car horns along the 
champselysees and 40000 people waved french flags and rallied at 
the place de la republique 
in the first round of elections on april 24 mitterrand won 341 
percent of the vote to lead a field of nine candidates chirac was 
second with 199 percent 
mitterrands election to a new sevenyear term puts an end to 
two years of uneasy cohabitation between a socialist president 
and a rightist premier 
but the immediate future may be even more confusing 
to govern mitterrands premier could form a coalition of 
minority socialists who hold 215 seats in the 573seat parliament 
with some centrist deputies now allied with the right or he could 
ask the president to dissolve the national assembly and hold new 
elections 
more likely the new premier will try to survive as head of a 
minority government without any formal coalition avoiding defeat 
in the hostile assembly by steering clear of controversial issues 
for several months 
the one significant program mitterrands aides have said he 
would pursue is reestablishment of a wealth tax with the proceeds 
used to pay most of the cost of a minimum guaranteed income of 
about 350 per month 
in an interview published friday in the leftist magazine le 
nouvel observateur mitterrand said france needs to increase 
investment in education the economy social programs and the 
building of a united europe 
in all these areas the state has a major role to play he 
said but we cant expect everything from it the final 
responsibility falls to business we need a new generation of 
business leaders who understand that it is the quality of their 
products and the competitivity of their prices that will bring 
success 
but francis perigot head of the french employers association 
said his members will be keeping a close eye on the new 
governments moves 
i will be watching that the next government pursues and 
expands policies favorable to the competitivity of business 
perigot said 
national front leader jeanmarie le pen said sunday that chirac 
was condemned to failure because he refused to do enough to 
attract the fronts extremeright supporters 
the strength of le pen who drew 144 percent of the vote in the 
elections first round increased speculation that some prochirac 
centrists would join a coalition with the socialists 
simone veil health minister under former centerright president 
valery giscard destaing said she saw no problem in principle 
in a governing alliance between centrists and socialists 
many centrist leaders though ruled out supporting a 
socialistled government 
we have absolutely no intention of making a pact of alliance 
with socialism said culture minister francois leotard president 
of the republican party the largest component of the centerright 
union for french democracy coalition

education secretary william j bennett a 
frequent critic of low standards in americas schools and colleges 
announced today he will leave president reagans cabinet in 
midseptember 
bennett often a magnet for controversy during his 3year 
stint signalled last month that he intended to step down in the 
fall a few months before the reagan administration draws to a 
close 
bennetts spokesman loye miller issued the following statement 
secretary bennett met today with the president and 
subsequently with education department staff to say that he intends 
to leave his position in midseptember he expressed his gratitude 
to president reagan for the opportunity to serve in his cabinet 
the secretary reiterated to his staff his intention to continue at 
full speed ahead during the next few months 
bennett told the staff he had recommended that linus wright the 
undersecretary of education and a former superintendent of schools 
in dallas be nominated to fill the post for the final months of 
reagans term there was no immediate word from the white house 
however on who reagan would nominate 
bennett was unavailable for further comment he told the staff 
and the president that he wants to do some speaking and write a 
book 
in a jocular reference to the furor over former white house 
chief of staff donald regans memoirs bennett said to the 
president not that kind of book a book about education his 
spokesman related 
what lies ahead for the brash combative bennett who has 
clashed repeatedly with teachers unions quarreled with the 
surgeon general over aids education accused college presidents of 
being greedy and upbraided harvard and stanford for changes in 
their curriculum 
bennett said after delivering the commencement address saturday 
at the university of southern mississippi that he hasnt made any 
definite plans 
but he is likely to hit the lecture circuit and says he wants to 
write a book capsulizing his critiques of the quality of americas 
schools and colleges 
bennett who converted from the democratic to the republican 
party on may day in 1986 has already proven a big draw on the gop 
fundraising circuit where he has been much in demand as an 
afterdinner speaker 
one speculated post is apparently not in the cards the 
vicepresidency on george bushs tickets 
although bennett is widely believed to have had his eye on that 
spot bush has been conspicuously silent about bennett during all 
his talk about being the education president aids to bennett 
who asked not to be identified said they have had virtually no 
contacts with the bush camp in recent months and bennett is not 
expecting to play any formal role in the bush campaign 
but bennett is expected to attend his first republican 
convention in new orleans this august where party chairman frank 
fahrenkopf has asked him to be on hand for the platform 
deliberations spokesman miller said 
in the past three years according to the trade publication 
education week bennett has spoken at 63 republican functions 
across the country 
he has been a peripatetic cabinet officer visiting nearly 100 
elementary and secondary schools and 50 campuses and giving dozens 
of speeches to school groups 
bennett 44 was chairman of the national endowment for the 
humanities for two years before succeeding th bell in the 
cabinet previously he ran a humanities thinktank in north 
carolina and taught at several universities he holds both a phd 
in philosophy from the university of texas and a law degree from 
harvard 
he has been a relative pauper in reagans inner circle 
renting not owning a home in a pricey suburban maryland 
neighborhood he and his wife elayne have a young son 
but his personal fortunes could pick up quickly if as expected 
he lands a big advance contract for a book and pulls down lecture 
fees running into thousands of dollars for each appearance 
there has been speculation that bennett may eventually run for 
office possibly from his adopted state of north carolina he 
resisted an overture from maryland gop officials to seek the 
nomination to challenge sen paul sarbanes dmd 
bennett said at the education writers association meeting in new 
orleans april 17 i probably will step down in early fall 
people tell me that once you get past the convention everyone 
focuses on politics and its hard to get other things done if 
thats the case i will leave and see whats available 
bennett said i want to write a book that tells the truth 
about education 
bennetts latest report american education making it work 
concluded that american schools have improved somewhat over the 
past five years but still have a long way to go

troops have crossed into southern chinas guangxi zhuang autonomous 
region two dozen times in the past 10 days and stolen cattle grain 
and cloth from local residents 
china and vietnam have regularly accused each other of small 
attacks along their 800mile border ever since they fought a brief 
border war in 1979 
china claimed vietnamese troops made a series of harassing 
attacks into guangxi zhuang in april beating one chinese to 
death and kidnapping others it said each time the chinese militia 
sent the invaders fleeing

two years ago in his state 
of the union message president reagan launched a venture to take 
aviation into the 21st century 
we are going forward with research on a new orient express 
that could by the end of the next decade take off from dulles 
airport outside washington accelerate up to 25 times the speed 
of sound attaining low earth orbit or flying to tokyo within two 
hours he said 
research on an aerospace plane already had been going on for 
years in the part of the national aeronautics and space 
administration that gets little public attention nasas first a 
for aeronautics sometimes also known as the little a 
we are called the space agency by many probably including 
yourself jeremiah f creedon the director for flight systems at 
the langley research center told a visitor many of us here 
think the aeronautics a is a large one 
together with other nasa research centers ames and dryden in 
california and lewis in ohio langleys business is to develop 
technology and to pass it on without cost to aircraft companies 
few planes fly today without engines designs materials and 
structures conceived at nasa no single company alone could afford 
the agencys 2 billion investment in wind tunnels 
reagans rosy prediction followed years of research by nasa 
engineers before they decided that the aerospace plane dubbed the 
x30 was even possible 
in the summer of 1990 engineers will decide whether to actually 
build the x30 if the answer is yes it could begin flight tests 
that would finish when the 21st century is ushered in 
it will be the largest experimental aircraft project ever 
undertaken by the united states costing 33 billion 
the idea of the x30 is to develop technologies that will be 
useful for planes at a slower speed such as 3 times the speed of 
sound or mach 35 
the military and perhaps package delivery firms such as federal 
express and united parcel service are the only ones that have use 
for a plane flying 25 times the speed of sound 
there is tremendous potential for all kinds of vehicles 
operating at high mach numbers said douglas dwoyer manager of 
hypersonic technology at langley the national aerospace program 
is aimed at an experimental aircraft to demonstrate technologies 
for this family of hypersonic aircraft 
although the big airplane manufacturers have little interest in 
building a mach 25 plane they do want a craft capable of flying 
between mach 2 and mach 35 for the years 2000 to 2010 
at mach 27 a trip from los angeles to tokyo would take just 
under four hours 
the united states did research in the 1960s on a supersonic 
transport the sst but dropped the program in 1970 because of 
costs and environmental concerns 
the nation essentially allowed its entire research and 
technology base in hypersonics to disappear said dwoyer we 
are bringing tunnels on line that havent operated in almost 20 
years with instrumentation systems that are 20 yearsplus old 
meanwhile the british and french produced the concorde capable 
of twice the speed of sound 
the concorde was designed with 1960s technology and can barely 
carry enough fuel to make it from europe across the atlantic the 
business of the future is with the pacific rim japan china 
south korea where a fast 6000mile airplane is needed 
roy harris jr director of aeronautics at langley sees a real 
need for a longrange sst 
the airlines that serve that market are pushing hard he said 
boeing and douglas are trying to determine how many mach 35 planes 
might be needed by the year 2000 it looks like its on the order 
of 300 to 400 airplanes for the world market said harris 
holding out the prospect of a world market for an american plane 
that would help untilt the trade balance 
but the british the french the soviets and the japanese also 
have ambitious aeronautics programs 
despite such competition the united states treats its 
aeronautics limb as a poor relative out of a 9 billion nasa 
budget aeronautics rampd this year gets only 430 million 53 
million of that is earmarked for the aerospace plane 
the money issue is a sensitive one at langley 
i think we are grossly underfunded said dwoyer on a 
400millionayear program we cannot maintain our capability 
until 1970 the us jet transport industry had 90 percent of 
the longrange market now thats down to 70 percent 
for 70 years you could go to any airport in the world and look 
out on the ramp and you see made in the usa harris said now 
the europeanbuilt airbus a superb plane can be seen at most 
airports too

prince andrew took a bumpy step monday 
toward a longterm career in the royal navy 
the duke of york stumbled over a coil of rope as he boarded his 
new ship the guidedmissile destroyer hms edinburgh at the rosyth 
naval base in eastern scotland he recovered quickly to stride up 
the gangplank and report for duty as the destroyers newest junior 
watchkeeper 
andrew 27 second son of queen elizabeth ii joined the navy on 
a mediumterm commission in 1979 and after serving in the falkland 
islands war against argentina became a helicopter warfare 
instructor 
he switched to the navys general list last fall so he could 
continue his naval training and advance beyond his current rank of 
lieutenant 
the destroyer sails from rosyth on june 13 for six months in the 
far east and australia which means andrew will have to apply for 
special permission to return to england in august when his wife 
the former sarah ferguson is expected to deliver their first child 
the navy tries wherever possible to free men in his 
situation who want to be at home when their children are born 
said a defense ministry spokesman 
he will be able to apply to take leave but whether or not he 
gets it is up to the captain and depends on whether he can be 
spared 
andrew is fourth in line to the throne following his older 
brother prince charles and charles two sons princes william and

not wanting to take a bath on an old water 
tower city officials have been advertising it for sale but its 
not easy finding a buyer 
its a cute tank says the mayor of this dallas suburb lou 
duggan its not like the other tanks the cylindrical looking 
type of tanks 
its the kind that has a bell shape to it it looks like a 
golf ball on the end of a golf tee 
coppells use for the decadeold 250000gallon tower dried up 
in january with the installation of a 15 milliongallon tank to 
service its more than 15000 residents 
theres no used water tower lot where you can go and sell a 
used water tower councilman tom morton said recently 
duggan said hed accept a 200000 offer for the tank which he 
said probably would cost about 250000 new 
one thing that may discourage a potential buyer is the cost of 
dismantling and moving the tower which could cost as much as the 
tower itself city officials say

expertise in botany isnt a requirement 
to be a lawman says randolph county sheriff steve shults 
if it were the sheriff noted sunday officers might have 
noticed sooner that the five little green plants growing outside a 
county courthouse door werent tomatoes they were marijuana 
back in the winter we made a drug arrest and marijuana 
was seized growing in a flower pot well we plucked the little 
plant and we dumped the dirt outside the back door shults said 
in late april sprouts poked through the dirt in a spot where 
tomatoes used to grow 
we thought it was the tomatoes back again the sheriff 
said chuckling again 
finally a city officer said are you sure those are going to 
be tomato plants and we werent so sure the sheriff said 
they watched the plants a while longer and decided they were 
marijuana sprouted from seeds in the dirt they dumped they were 
pulled and trashed shults said 
everybody kind of took it as a joke and of course theres 
nobody in the courthouse suspected of growing this marijuana 
shults said dirt has always been dumped in the spot where 
plumbing work left an indentation in the soil the practice will 
continue he said 
but next time well poke around in the dirt a little more

a us cargo ship accidentally struck and sank a 
chinese fishing boat in the east china sea leaving 17 fishermen 
missing the official xinhua news agency said monday 
xinhua said the us ship the president monroe left the scene 
immediately after the accident friday afternoon and made no effort 
to rescue the fishermen 
us embassy spokesman mckinney russell said the chinese foreign 
ministry notified the embassy of the accident but that he had no 
other information 
its still an alleged incident as far as we are concerned 
russell said we havent been able to confirm there was a 
collision we dont know where the us vessel would have come 
from or where it was bound 
lloyds register of ships says the president monroe belongs to 
american president lines of san francisco it is a 860foot long 
container weighing 40627 tons 
xinhua said the accident took place off the port of lianyugang 
in coastal jiangsu province it said the chinese boat carried 20 
fishermen and was registered to the jiangsu fisheries corp 
the report said the foreign ministry reserves the right for 
further representation 
russell said he interpreted that to mean the chinese might sue 
the american shipping company if an investigation supported their 
version of events he said he did not expect any political 
repercussions

lawyers for a man accused of killing 16 
people including 14 members of his family have decided against a 
defense based on the insanity plea prosecutors have pledged to 
seek the death penalty 
juror selection began today in the murder trial of r gene 
simmons 47 a retired air force master sergeant hes charged with 
killing two people during a 45minute shooting spree dec 28 in 
russellville 
we plead not guilty and were just going to make them prove 
their case defense attorney john harris said sunday were 
just going to see that they dont get out of line that they give 
him a fair trial 
harris said he expected jury selection to last two days and 
that testimony would take three days 
it was only after simmons surrendered in connection with the two 
killings that police found the bodies of his wife and 13 children 
grandchildren and inlaws at his home in rural pope county he 
faces a july 18 trial on murder charges for those killings 
tests on simmons found no evidence of a problem such as a brain 
tumor that could have affected his behavior doctors said 
todays trial is for the deaths of a former coworker kathy c 
kendrick 24 who officials say spurned dimmons advances a year 
before she was killed and james d chaffin 33 apparently killed 
by chance 
it was a cruel and senseless act that was committed and the 
death penalty would certainly be justified prosecutor john bynum 
said simmons could be sentenced to die or to life in prison 
without parole if convicted 
he also faces five counts of attempted murder and one count of 
kidnapping but harris hopes to get those charges incorporated into 
the two murder charges 
the trial has been moved 50 miles to this town of 3500 people 
because of pretrial publicity yet bynum harris said has stated 
emphatically he has no intention of bringing up the 14 other 
deaths during the trial 
i dont think he can get a fair trial anywhere in arkansas 
because of all the pretrial publicity harris said 
bynum said an impartial jury can be found in franklin county 
but acknowledged i dont expect to find a juror who hasnt heard 
about the case 
after simmons arrest deputies went to his home and found the 
bodies of five relatives including two of his children and their 
spouses four had been shot and simmons 11yearold granddaughter 
had been strangled 
they apparently died after arriving for a christmas gathering 
the next day police found seven bodies including simmons other 
children and his wife becky in a shallow kerosenesoaked grave 
some had been shot others strangled apparently before 
christmas police said they also found the strangled bodies of two 
infant boys in trunks of abandoned cars on simmons land 
the gun that killed miss kendrick and chaffin had been used to 
kill some of simmons relatives ballistics experts said 
feelings are running high in this eastcentral arkansas county 
sheriff gordon mccain said 18 to 20 officers will provide court 
security and spectators will have to pass through a metal detector 
to enter the courtroom 
robert wood president of woodline woodline motor freight in 
russellville where simmons surrendered said last week it was 
unfortunate we have to go through the motions of a trial 
i would be severely upset if he were found innocent wood 
said on the other hand if he were found innocent he wouldnt 
make it far past the front door of the court

ethiopias red cross society has 
cut its ties with the international committee of the red cross 
because the international group refused to hand over its food 
supplies in the wartorn north 
ethiopian red cross chairman dawit zewdie announced the break 
sunday in a speech marking red cross day and the 125th anniversary 
of the international red cross movement 
the genevabased red cross was part of a massive relief effort 
to save an estimated 7 million ethiopians from starvation following 
severe crop failures last year 
more than 3 million of those people are in the northern 
provinces of eritrea and tigre where the international committee 
was feeding about 500000 people until last month when the 
government expelled all foreign aid workers from the provinces 
citing security reasons the government is battling two separate 
insurgencies in the region 
before leaving international red cross workers locked up about 
53000 metric tons of food and equipment including approximately 
40 trucks 
jeanjacques fresard the international bodys chief delegate in 
ethiopia said the action was according to the groups general 
policy 
supplies are never handed over without having our 
expatriate presence to monitor and control the operation fresard 
said in a telephone interview 
fresard said the move by the ethopian red cross had been 
expected 
they wanted to go on with the joint agreement only if we 
handed over all our supplies said fresard we couldnt do 
that 
it was not immediately clear what practical effect the break 
will have since the government expulsion last month put a stop to 
international red cross operations in eritrea and tigre 
fresard said he did not believe it would affect operations in 
gondar where the international organization is feeding 100000 
people and hopes eventually to reach 230000 drought victims 
bekele geleta secretarygeneral of the ethiopian red cross 
said he was unsure whether the ethopian group would allow the 
international red cross to go on working in gondar 
we would like to continue but the icrc is causing a lot of 
problems he said 
relations between the international red cross and the ethiopian 
government have deteriorated since the expulsions ethiopia has 
accused the international group of running covert operations in the 
north and of supporting guerrillas who have been fighting for 27 
years in africas longest civil war in eritrea 
the international red cross which has an international mandate 
under the geneva convention to operate in regions of conflict has 
maintained an office in ethiopia since the east african nation 
fought a fullscale war with somalia in 197778

paparazzi and starwatchers may be disappointed 
when the 41st cannes film festival opens wednesday its going 
back to basics 
apart from the participation of clint eastwood and possibly 
robert redford both as directors rather than actors the famed 
festival is being billed this year as a cozy gathering of movie 
buffs and professionals 
after the 40th anniversary extravaganza last year some film 
purists find the change a welcome return to the style of previous 
festivals when the films themselves outshined the stars fancy 
receptions and big deals being signed 
the choice facing the cannes jury each year is whether to select 
films which are certain to be a commercial success or to innovate 
and bring some newcomers into the limelight it is difficult to 
achieve the right balance 
by favoring less commercial films the festival runs the risk of 
losing the big ones completely if it loses a prestigious 
highbudget film loses a lot but a lowbudget film can only gain 
if it wins a glittering prize at the worldfamous festival 
festival officials say the focus this year will be on a search 
for the talent of tomorrow the jury has decided to help the 
cinema build its future festival president pierre viot said at a 
recent news conference 
fifteen countries are represented by 21 films in the main 
competition 
this years festival will be an opportunity for film makers 
outside the commercial circuit to show their worth the jurys 
selection includes many films by young directors and works from 
countries just beginning to gain a reputation for their movie 
industries 
for example china makes its cannes debut with king of 
children by chen kaige and new zealand is represented by vincent 
wards the navigator 
one of two french entries is chocolat a story of colonial 
life in the african cameroons it is the first fulllength film of 
claire denis who made her mark as assistant to german new wave 
film maker wim wenders 
a world apart a british film directed by chris menges 
tells the story of apartheid in south africa menges made his name 
as a director of photography working on films such as roland 
joffes mission 
a more familiar name on the list of entrants is that of american 
director and scenarist paul schrader known for american gigolo 
and mishima he is represented in cannes by patty based on 
the 1974 kidnapping of patricia hearst william randolph hearsts 
granddaughter 
despite the many litteknown names stargazers will still have a 
chance of seeing a few hollywood greats 
director clint eastwood is expected to present bird a 
biography of the alto sax player charlie bird parker 
robert redford who has been in the soviet union showing some of 
his films may appear in cannes to present his new film the 
milagro beanfield war the feature tells the story of a tiny 
village in new mexico where residents take up arms against big 
business and the establishment 
in an effort to cater to true movie lovers the organizers have 
even restricted the presence of television at this years festival 
critics said the 1987 festival became a vehicle for the small 
screen many televised variety shows used the festival as a 
backdrop 
said viot we do not want the festival to become the 
battleground for a television ratings war

a moderate earthquake rattled portions of 
southcentral alaska early monday but there were no immediate 
reports of damage or injuries the alaska tsunami warning center 
reported 
the 833 am temblor measured 47 on the richter scale the 
center reported the quake was centered about 20 miles northeast of 
valdez and was felt strongly in that city said tom sokolowski 
head of the warning center 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude thus a reading of 75 reflects an earthquake 10 time 
stronger than one of 65 
an earthquake of magnitude 35 can cause slight damage 4 
moderate damage 5 considerable damage 6 severe damage a 
magnitude 7 quake is a major earthquake capable of widespread 
damage 8 is a great quake capable of tremendous damage

cities may have been made significantly 
smoggier than previously predicted by an unrecognized form of auto 
pollution a source that planned new regulations should clear up 
according to several analysts 
the newly recognized source is evaporation of gasoline from fuel 
systems while cars are running the environmental protection agency 
has been assuming these running losses could be neglected in 
assessing the formation of ozone the major component of smog from 
volatile compounds like gasoline 
new findings suggest the amount of gasoline that evaporates from 
a cars fuel system when the vehicle is being used on a hot day may 
be five times to 25 times greater than the amount of unburned 
gasoline that is permitted to escape in exhaust 2 grams to 10 
grams per mile in running losses compared with 041 grams out 
the tailpipe 
ten grams of gasoline is about half a liquid ounce 
if all these things fall into place its logical to expect 
this is a big source and another explanation that could be offered 
as to why attainment of the air quality standards has been so 
hard said tad wysor an engineer in epas emissions control 
technology division in ann aror mich 
official predictions have been underpredicting future 
improvement said tom austin a partner in sierra research of 
sacramento calif air pollution consultants 
all cars must pass tests for gasoline emissions while parked 
newly proposed epa regulations are designed to reduce this 
stationary evaporation along with vapors lost during refueling 
they will require refiners to cut summertime gasoline volatility 
its tendency to evaporate by 22 percent from the current often 
exceeded voluntary standard they also will require the existing 
auto vapor recovery system to be enlarged to capture refueling 
vapors 
ozone worsens breathing problems epa last week released the 
names of 68 urban and rural areas where air did not meet the 
federal ozone standard in 1987 up from the 62 on the previous 
years list 
though epa said a warm summer in the east in 1987 helped push up 
ozone violations environmental groups immediately claimed that the 
data showed that the smog problem was getting worse 
epa has known for years that todays gasoline volatility 115 
pounds of vapor pressure is the summer standard in much of the 
country will cause cars to flunk its stationary emissions test 
badly the fuel used in that test must be 90 pounds the pressure 
the agency wants to make the mandatory maximum 
nine pounds was typical of gasoline in 1975 when test 
specifications were drawn up 
sam leonard director of automotive emissions control for 
general motors corps environmental activities staff said gm has 
found that emissions on one part of the stationary test are 16 
times greater with 115 pound fuel than with 90 pound fuel 
hugh shannon of exxon research corp outlined one explanation 
for the unexpectedly high running losses at a briefing on vapor 
recovery systems sponsored by the american petroleum institute last 
week the nearabandonment of carburetors for fuel injectors by 
engine manufacturers 
fuel injection systems continuously recycle uninjected fuel back 
to the tank accordig to shannon the returning fuel picks up heat 
in the engine compartment making fuel in the tank run 20 degrees 
warmer than the outside air 
this heat raises the pressure of the highervolatility fuel 
that appears to overwhelm the existing charcoal cannister in the 
vapor recovery system leaving the vapor nowhere to go but to the 
atmosphere 
leonard said he believed the running loss problem was mostly a 
warmclimate phenomenon affecting probably less than 1 percent of 
miles traveled nationwide 
but michael walsh a consultant often used by environmental 
groups said one percent sounds like a low number to me 
the ozone problem is a warmweather problem we have a lot 
of places in this country with plenty of hot days in the 
summertime walsh said

a juror in the trial of a woman accused of 
killing her husband and another woman with cyanidelaced medicine 
received an anonymous telephone call saying the defendant had 
failed a liedetector test a detail jurors were not allowed to 
hear the judge said today 
the anonymous caller asked the juror dont you all know that 
she failed the lie detector test us district judge william 
dwyer told attorneys in the case this morning 
dwyer called the incident a most regrettable occurrence and 
most irresponsible by whoever did it he said he would interview 
the juror before making a decision on how to proceed 
the woman juror wrote him a letter in which she reported 
receiving the phone call friday night dwyer said the juror said 
she did not recognize the callers voice and that the caller hung 
up before she could ask who it was dwyer said 
the development came as jurors prepared to return to 
deliberations today after a weekend off although they told him 
friday they were deadlocked dwyer urged them to keep deliberating 
the trial began its fourth week today 
he also agreed to provide them with addition information they 
requested on the legal definition of reasonable doubt 
today dwyer promised the court reporter would read backximum sentences 
of life in prison while the maximum for 
tampering is 10 years on each count 
mrs nickells husband bruce nickell 52 and sue katherine 
snow 40 died in june 1986 after swallowing cyanidelaced 
extrastrength excedrin capsules 
the deaths resulted in a nationwide tampering scare and prompted 
excedrin manufacturer bristolmeyers to recall all its 
overthecounter drug capsules 
prosecutors argued that mrs nickell wanted to end her marriage 
and financial problems by killing her husband and collecting as 
much as 176000 in lifeinsurance benefits and then tried to 
cover up the crime by placing more tainted capsules in stores to 
give the appearance of random tampering 
ms snow was an innocent stranger caught in the scheme the 
prosecution said

the danish election campaign drew to 
a close monday in a race that could decide the strength of 
denmarks commitment to the nato alliance 
conservative prime minister poul schlueter in a final appeal 
before tuesdays vote said he sought a mandate to restore 
denmarks credibility in the north atlantic treaty organization 
schlueter called the election after he failed to block a move in 
parliament last month to toughen denmarks antinuclear stance the 
move was sponsored by the opposition social democrats 
if implemented the resolution would require denmark to notify 
each visiting warship of denmarks peacetime ban on nuclear weapons 
in its territory 
the resolution was seen as a challenge to natos policy of 
keeping a nuclear option under that policy us and british ships 
refuse to say whether they are armed with nuclear weapons 
schlueter who has led minority governments for six years 
called the snap election on the issue just eight months after the 
last vote 
it was denmarks 19th election since war war ii a european 
record and the first time since then that danes were asked to 
vote mainly on a foreign policy issue 
twelve parties are contesting the election three more than are 
currently represented in the 179member folketing or parliament 
schueters fourparty alliance of centerright parties controls 70 
seats 
schlueter said in an interview published monday that the social 
democrats motion had undermined denmarks credibility with its 
western allies 
this is a referendum about nato he told the conservative 
newspaper berlingske tidende 
he also said he expected a long period of postelection haggling 
to form a workable coalition and that he hoped for a broad 
alliance that would command a majority in parliament 
he did not rule out a partnership with the social democrats 
denmarks largest party 
there is an undeniable need for a group of parties to 
thoroughly discuss the major political problems he said 
i would go so far as to say that it is not advisable to 
appoint a prime minister or a government if there is the least 
doubt that a new majority is behind them schlueter said 
preelection polls indicated another election standoff is 
likely between the two major blocs with the socialliberals again 
holding the balance the party with 11 seats supports the 
government on domestic policy and the opposition on foreign issues 
as many as half a million voters nearly one in eight will 
decide at the last minute how they will vote said ole borre 
political science professor at aarhus university 
many havent decided who they will vote for or whether they 
will vote at all he told berlingske tidende turnout last 
september was 86 percent about average in denmark where 39 
million citizens are registered to vote 
polls show the farright progress party campaigning on a 
platform of deep tax cuts and limiting immigration is the only 
party likely to advance strongly 
in the latest poll published sunday the progress party took 
eight percent compared with the 48 percent it won in the previous 
election 
social democratic leader svend auken has denied that his party 
is antinato and has accused schlueter of exaggerating the meaning 
of the resolution 
auken 44 facing the electorate for the first time as party 
leader is taking over from former prime minister anker joergensen 
who resigned after the last round of balloting 
the social democrats campaigned under the slogan denmark 
decides for itself posters depicting president reagan embracing 
prime minister magaret thatcher implied that the united states and 
britain wanted to dictate denmarks nuclear policies 
the social democrats who dominated danish politics for 40 years 
until they relinquished power in 1982 led denmark into nato as a 
founding member in 1949 
the party drifted toward a hardline antinuclear stance shortly 
after it became the opposition and sponsored a motion to stop 
denmarks payments toward the stationing of cruise missiles in 
europe

a presidential veto of the omnibus trade bill 
could hold up ratification of the ussoviet mediumrange missile 
treaty senate majority leader robert c byrd said monday 
lots of things could happen if the president carries out his 
threat to veto the 1000page bill byrd told reporters 
he stopped short of any specific threat to hold the 
intermediaterange nuclear forces pact hostage to a presidential 
signature on the trade bill but he said an effort to override a 
presidential veto could shoulder aside floor debate on the treaty 
the treaty which was signed last december in washington calls 
for the elimination of all us and soviet missiles with ranges 
from about 300 miles to 3000 miles 
president reagan has called on the senate to ratify the measure 
by may 29 the opening date of his moscow summit with soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev 
when the president promises that well have another trade 
bill he has got to remember that a veto would take precedence over 
the treaty byrd said 
under senate rules he said house override of a trade bill veto 
would automatically force senators to take up a similar effort 
thus debate on an override could be the order of business on the 
floor on may 29 he said with the arms pact still pending 
may 29 is just a date on the calendar byrd said it means 
absolutely nothing to me or this senate 
the trade bill was passed by congress two weeks ago instead of 
sending it to reagans desk however lawmakers retained it on 
capitol hill while they attempted to make further revisions 
the house last week passed a technical corrections resolution 
that also would drop restrictions on export of alaska oil 
that measure simply would authorize an official known as the 
enrolling clerk to dot the is and cross the ts in the bill and 
erase the alaska provisions 
byrd said he hoped to bring up the resolution in the senate as 
soon as possible but would need the unanimous consent of senators 
to do so he said he would discuss that with minority leader bob 
dole rkan 
it was expected the senate would take up the resolution this 
week 
major provisions of the trade bill would streamline procedures 
for use of import restrictions to aid us industry and to 
retaliate against international trade violations 
scores of other provisions range from billions of dollars in 
agricultural subsidies to repeal of the windfall profits tax on oil 
companies

the following is a text of a statement that 
chief white house spokesman marlin fitzwater issued today in 
response to the release of a new book by former white house chief 
of staff donald t regan 
the new book by donald regan is a kissandtell story in the 
mold of all such books which seek to exploit the presidency or the

several days ago indicating his deep personal disappointment in 
this breach of confidence in addition the president emphasized

astrology after the march 30 1981 attempted assassination of the 
president she reached out to friends to ministers family and her 
friend who advises on astrology but we cannot comment on her 
private communications with the chief of staff

barbra streisand says she has been hearing 
unusual noise since she was a child and it helped her understand 
st joan whose character she used for a radio audition when she 
was 13 
i knew she was telling the truth when she said she heard 
voices streisand said in an interview in the june issue of ladies 
home journal 
i dont hear voices but i hear noise all the time the 
singer said 
streisand evidently hears a wider range of sound on more levels 
and registers than most people 
doctors cant do anything about it she said i used to 
put scarves around my head to muffle the noises but it only 
made it worse its annoying and ive never gotten used to it 
sometimes when im under more stress the noises become louder but 
if im having a good time i sort of forget it momentarily 
she also talked about her latest beau don johnson star of the 
miami vice television series 
when im with don i can enjoy my celebrity because i dont 
have to apologize to the man im with for getting all the 
attention she said don gets as much attention as i do

an error by an air traffic controller 
may have contributed to the 1987 jet crash that killed actor dean 
paul martin the riverside pressenterprise reported 
a controller warning which incorrectly gave the location of 
mount san gorgonio may have caused martin to turn too sharply and 
lose control of his f4c phantom jet said veteran lockheed test 
pilot tony levier 
levier made his conclusions after reviewing an analysis by the 
us air force and air national guard according to reports 
obtained by the newspaper through the freedom of information act 
leviers conclusions were published sunday 
martin a captain in the california air national guard and son 
of entertainer dean martin and his weapons officer capt ramon 
ortiz 39 died march 21 1987 when the jet traveling at 600 mph 
crashed into a san bernardino mountains canyon 
the accident report draws no conclusions about what happened 
during the last seconds of martins flight 
air force pilots and air traffic controllers declined to comment 
on what might have caused the crash which killed ortiz and the 
35yearold martin 
but levier said it is clear martin made too sharp a left turn 
probably in a moment of panic as he feared hitting the mountain 
ahead 
if you turn the f4 too quickly the nose will pull the airplane 
up disrupting the planes aerodynamics said levier who has 
tested 70 aircraft during his 46year career 
the airplane simply becomes uncontrollable the thing goes 
ape levier said 
according to the accident analysis martin was at 11500 feet 
flying in clouds and had not heard two previous instructions to 
turn left his plane was far off its route and heading toward the 
peak the controller reportedly told the pilot he was three miles 
south of a 13000foot peak but the analysis said the peak is 
11502 feet not 13000 feet and martins aircraft was 8 miles 
from the summit not three miles 
air guard maj steve mensik spokesman for the guard in 
sacramento said the controllers erroneous communication with 
martinortiz was a contributing factor to the crash 
faa officials at ontario international airport said the 
controller who handled the martinortiz flight committed no error 
david fowler the controllers supervisor said there were many 
factors including the workload and weather that might cause the 
controller to miscalculate the distance of the fighter from the 
mountain he said his office has not read the latest accident 
investigation report 
a spokesman for the pilots family called leviers analysis an 
assumption mort viner said he had heard other equally plausible 
causes for the crash

secretary of state george p shultz will make 
his fourth trip to the middle east this year in a fresh attempt to 
promote arabisraeli peace talks the state department announced 
today 
there are problems there that need to be resolved charles 
e redman the state department spokesman said in announcing that 
shultz would travel to israel egypt jordan and syria next month 
redman said arabs and israelis had urged shultz to return to the 
region but he declined to say whether any of the parties had 
changed their positions 
all the people in the region have been very insistent on the 
fact that the secretary and the administration continue these 
efforts redman said 
he said president reagan had directed shultz to return to the 
region 
there shultz again will promote a mideast peace conference to 
be followed by negotiations in two stages the first would be 
designed to provide some form of selfrule to the 15 million 
palestinian arabs who live on the west bank and in gaza under 
israeli control the second would deal with an overall middle east 
settlement 
it is the only workable alternative redman said 
shultz will fly to the middle east at the windup of the moscow 
summit meeting june 2 and then attend a meeting of the north 
atlantic treaty organizations foreign ministers in madrid june 
910 said the us official who spoke only on condition of 
anonymity 
three trips by shultz to the middle east this year failed to 
produce peace talks but he refuses to give up whos afraid to 
struggle against odds he said at the end of the last venture in 
april what am i saving myself for anyway 
shultz told a senate appropriations subcommittee two weeks ago 
that under the right circumstances king hussein of jordan would 
be agreeable to the us proposal for a peace conference 
shultz also testified however that israeli prime minister 
yitzhak shamir had made the conference the centerpiece of his 
objections to shultzs plan 
shultz also was unsuccessful last month in moscow in trying to 
persuade the soviet union to accept a limited role in the 
negotiations 
shamir and shultz are opposed to giving the soviets a chance to 
shape the outline of a mideast settlement but hussein is insisting 
on soviet involvement 
on the other hand jordan is reluctant to negotiate with israel 
without a guarantee that it would recover all the land it lost 
during the 1967 mideast war shultz has advised hussein that was 
not in the cards but he backs the idea of israel trading some 
territory on the west bank for peace and said the future of 
jerusalem should be decided in negotiations 
despite the long odds shultz said he did not think his plan was 
fated to failure 
shultzs plan called for a peace conference in midapril the 
opening of negotiations on the palestinians may 1 and a second 
stage of talks on an overall settlement beginning dec 1 
the first two deadlines have passed but redman said we need 
to get this underway as soon as possible

civil aeronautics officials today 
accused us ambassador arthur davis of taking a panamanian plane 
to a us military base without authorization 
as far as we are concerned until we conclude the 
investigation that plane was hijacked or stolen maj pascual 
gonzalez director of the civil aeronautics board said at a news 
conference 
a us embassy official said sunday that the plane carrying 
davis flew to an american air base because panamanian agents 
harassed his security detail at a commercial airport 
the private plane carrying davis and members of his family 
landed briefly at the commercial airport then departed after the 
confrontation was reported by the security detail awaiting his 
arrival the official said 
davis did not leave the aircraft while it was at the commercial 
airport the embassy official terrence kneebone did not say 
precisely what the panamanian agents did 
long lines formed outside banks early today as people waited to 
make limited withdrawals from their accounts for the first time in 
more than nine weeks some customers said they had waited for more 
than two hours before the banks opened this morning 
a government order shut down banks march 3 following a run on 
savings by panicky depositors and the imposition of us economic 
sanctions in an effort to force gen manuel antonio noriega to 
resign as chief of the defense forces 
bankers and government officials agreed to reopen after 
negotiations 
noriega the power behind the government was indicted in the 
united states in february on drug trafficking charges the general 
has denied the charges and said they are politically motivated 
the sanctions including the freezing of an estimated 50 
million of government funds in us accounts helped produce a 
severe cash shortage in panama which uses the us dollar as its 
currency 
davis and family members were returning from a day trip to the 
pacific coast island of contadora when the plane approached 
paitilla airport in panama city as the small jet landed davis saw 
several panamanian security agents armed with rifles harassing 
his security detail kneebone said 
us security officials were in contact with the plane by radio 
as it prepared to land kneebone said and spoke with davis on the 
ground davis decided to fly elsewhere because of the panamanian 
agents fairly hostile actions kneebone said the plane then 
requested and received takeoff clearance from the airport tower 
before flying to howard air base five miles northwest in the 
former panama canal zone 
one of the panamanian security agents at paitilla airport 
demanded to know who was on the plane with davis said kneebone 
maj gonzalez said the plane also was carrying gabriel lewis 
jr soninlaw of deposed president eric delvalle and son of 
gabriel lewis galindo cofounder of an opposition group 
gonzalez said the incident started when four armed embassy 
security men all us citizens were seen by airport security on 
restricted grounds 
when they were being questioned the plane came in according to 
gonzalez the aircraft taxied to the apron and the embassy security 
people then talked by radio with those on the plane the major 
added then the plane took off for howard air force base 
gonzalez said it appeared the passengers were afraid when 
they saw the airport security people 
he said there are procedures that must be followed by all 
civilian aircraft when landing at a militay base and spending the 
night those procedures were not followed he said 
the incident could have been avoided if the four embassy 
security men had first reported to the airport security when they 
came in gonzalez said 
the owner of the plane hugo giraud identified the aircraft as 
a twoengine sixseater piper seneca giraud said it had been 
leased by a pilot rigoberto ng 
it was the second incident in which panamanian security agents 
apparently sought to interfere with the ambassadors movements in 
panama on april 3 a military vehicle unsuccessfully tried to stop 
davis chaufferdriven limousine as he was leaving the residence of 
the vatican ambassador

of the shin bet security service referred to as yossi who says 
awad posed as a moderate but his actions were a serious 
threat to security and public order

which issued a call for violent and hostile actions against the 
state by residents of the territories 
in washington state department spokesman charles e redman said 
secretary of state george p shultz dispatched a message to 
shamir on monday about the awad case last week the department 
objected to deporting him without a hearing 
awad who advocates nonviolent resistance denies allegations

issued by underground leaders it urged palestinians to use

the israeli army does not have enough shells 
for its tanks and artillery which could affect its readiness for 
war the government comptrollers office declared in a report 
issued monday 
it also said the military does not keep close enough track of 
us aid 
ammunition stockpiles are a central part of army preparedness 
for war the report said the findings of our survey show 
significant malfunctions which must be rectified as soon as 
possible 
comptroller yaacov maltz presented the 983page report at a news 
conference about onefifth of it was devoted to the military 
it said management problems have eroded the profitability of 
israels large weapons industry and investigators could not 
determine exactly what use was made of 18 billion in us 
military aid in 1986 because it was lumped with other 
foreigncurrency expenditures 
maltzs report did not suggest the money was misspent but said 
records of how it was used were inadequate 
some of the budget in foreign currency is allocated along with 
american assistance funds without any differentiation to monitor 
what is being purchased with what money it said 
the comptroller said the investigations conducted last year 
found shortages of essential weapons he blamed them on cuts in the 
defense budget red tape and a need to divert funds to other 
projects he did not name 
his report said surveys found inadequate supplies of 105mm tank 
shells 155mm and 175mm artillery shells and mortars in keeping 
with army regulations no figures were given 
maltz said a more detailed report was delivered to the military 
eitan haber a defense ministry spokesman said the army is 
prohibited by law from responding publicly to such reports 
other parts of the maltz document said training courses for 
soldiers were inadequate and lists of ammunition storage depots 
were outdated raising questions about public safety it cited 
shortages of emergency medical supplies food water and shelters 
in northern settlements bordering lebanon 
a section on the weapons industry criticized one of israels 
leading arms developers rafael armament development authority for 
losing money in major arms deals most losses are covered by the 
defense ministry 
it mentioned a 35 million deal by rafael in which the military 
was expected to absorb a 33 million loss instead projected 
losses had reached 117 million and could total nearly 15 
million according to the report 
because of censorship regulations it gave no further details of 
the 1966 contract but said the economic viability of the project 
was not adequately checked 
elsewhere in his report maltz was critical of the public health 
system which has been disrupted by strikes and other job actions 
by doctors nurses and maintenance staff the report said more than 
30000 israelis had to wait up to three years for operations as a 
result

western europe welcomed the reelection of 
francois mitterrand as president of france and political leaders 
of all persuasions sent their congratulations monday 
commentators foresaw uncertainty for france with a socialist 
president and rightistdominated parliament but that was the case 
before the election they complimented mitterrand for running a 
shrewd campaign and criticized the tactics of his conservative 
opponent premier jacques chirac 
congratulations from around the world cut across ideological 
lines 
chancellor helmut kohl of west germany looked forward to 
continued cooperation between the two governments his conservative 
christian democrats said in a statement the proven 
europeoriented tandem of kohlmitterrand will be able to continue 
its successful work in the future 
austrias socialist chancellor franz vranitzky expressed 
satisfaction that chirac failed and praised mitterrands moderate 
and statesmanlike policies another socialist prime minister 
andreas papandreou of greece said those policies would strengthen 
his countrys relations with france 
some conservative newspapers welcomed the reelection despite 
their idealogical opposition to mitterrand 
if not more than two cheers are in order for mr mitterrands 
triumph it is hard to weep many tears of chagrin over mr chiracs 
defeat said londons financial times 
it accused chirac of grotesque attempts to win votes 
gaining the release of french hostages in lebanon after scarcely 
glorious negotiations with their captors ordering a bloody 
attack on new caledonian separatists and allowing a french secret 
service agent convicted in the bombing of a greenpeace 
environmentalist ship to return home despite an exile agreement 
the leftleaning guardian said mitterrands victory is not 
only deserved but also in his countrys best interests as well as a 
relief for frances western allies 
it said of chirac the nakedness of the losers ambition and 
his readiness to mortgage french interests at home and abroad in 
the pursuit of personal power finally outweighed his undisputed 
talents and phenomenal energy 
el pais a spanish centerleft daily said said chirac dared 
to put at risk traditional values and interests to win votes it is 
the opposite of what a responsible statesman must do 
swedens main social democratic paper aftenbladet said the 
result placed chiracs future in doubt and seriously diminished the 
legacy of charles de gaulle 
one thing is certain it said in an editorial most of the 
gaullism that has so long dominated the picture is now eliminated 
a conservative belgian paper la libre belgique said the 
french did not let themselves be impressed by the increased 
spectacles put on in recent days by a jacques chirac visibly on the 
ropes and for whom defeat is all the more scalding 
in opposition to mitterrand said switzerlands independent le 
matin there was nothing but unrest divisions sectarianism and 
demagogy 
in the soviet union leader mikhail gorbatchev hailed 
mitterrands success and expressed a wish for our personal 
contacts to play their positive role in promoting disarmament 
building the common european house settling regional conflicts 
building trust and improving the international climate on the 
whole

nebraska sen david karnes and west virginia gov arch moore 
face tough republican primary fights tuesday while senate majority 
leader robert byrd is heavily favored to win west virginias 
democratic nomination to a sixth term 
karnes 39 was a political unknown when he was appointed last 
year by gov kay orr to complete the term of the late democratic 
sen edward zorinsky he is being aggressively challenged by 
fourterm rep hal daub who wanted the senate appointment for 
himself 
daub 47 has accused karnes of being a rubber stamp for orr 
and president reagan and said he had flipflopped on many votes 
to please the president including the trade bill and last years 
highway bill that raised the speed limit to 65 mph 
karnes has said he will not answer such namecalling but mrs 
orr said last week it was sad that daub feels he has to take 
a desperate approach 
an omaha worldherald poll last week showed karnes backed by 41 
percent of those interviewed while daub was supported by 40 
percent nineteen percent were undecided and the margin of error 
was 4 percentage points 
whoever wins the gop primary is expected to face 44yearold 
former gov bob kerrey whose only opponent in the democratic 
primary is ken michaelis a 45yearold disbarred lawyer 
in nebraskas 2nd congressional district where daub is giving 
up his seat four democrats are seeking the nomination including 
cece zorinsky widow of the senator 
in west virginia moore is seeking a fourth term as he battles 
morgantown millionaire john raese in the republican race for 
governor on the democratic side seven candidates are vying for 
the nomination 
moore 65 trailed in early polls but has surged ahead pushing 
the theme that his state is making an economic recovery he takes 
credit for cutting taxes by 311 million in the past four years 
although he fought most of the cuts when they were imposed by the 
legislature 
he also cites his accomplishments at bringing news businesses 
and bringing 30000 jobs to the state although the total number of 
employed west virginians has increased by just 5700 since moore 
took office in 1985 
raese 38 maintains the state is in perilous financial shape 
and said moore made just 10 percent of 385 million in budget cuts 
recommended by the governors task force on waste management 
raese who has a reputation as a rich kid who loves fast 
boats and hard living lost to another millionaire jay 
rockefeller in his first try for office in the 1986 senate race 
moore was the subject of an nbc report sunday in which former 
mingo county political boss johnie owens said moore offered him 
12000 to include his name on a list of recommended candidates 
when moore was running for reelection in 1972 a moore spokesman 
called the report a piece of garbage and raese said he was 
saddened by the whole event 
the leading democratic contenders for governor appear to be 
former house of delegates speaker clyde see the 1984 nominee 
and charleston insurance executive gaston caperton who waged an 
increasingly bitter war of negative television commercials 
byrd 71 is opposed in the democratic primary by huntington 
moving company owner bob myers byrd says he will give up the 
majority leaders job to become senate appropriations committee 
chairman if he is reelected and democrats retain control of the 
senate 
in the gop senate primary state sen jay wolfe is expected to 
defeat bernie lumbert of buckhannon an unemployed welfare 
recipient 
of west virginias four us representatives all democrats 
only nick joe rahall of the 4th district is opposed he faces 
former state legislator ted stacy and lawyer william sanders

iraq is building a new pipeline that will 
allow it to pump oil through either turkey or saudi arabia the 
middle east economic survey reported monday 
the pipeline is expected to be completed by 1990 and would 
increase iraqs ability to maintain exports vital to baghdads war 
effort against iran 
the respected weekly oil industry newsletter published in 
nicosia said the 400mile 42inch line will parallel an existing 
northsouth pipeline running the length of the country it will 
hook into a network linking iraqi oilfields with outlets across 
saudi arabia in the south and turkey in the north the weekly said 
the project will secure iraqs ability to pump its oil safely 
out of the war zone iran its foe in the 7yearold war has to 
send its tankers to run the gantlet of iraqi fighterbombers 
through the persian gulf 
the pipeline also would remove the threat to the industrialized 
world if iran closed the strait of hormuz the only way in and out 
of the gulf 
the iraqis already have three pipelines linking their southern 
oilfields with saudi arabias red sea terminal of yanbu and their 
northern oilfields with the turkish port of yumurtalik on the 
mediterranean they carry an estimated 25 million barrels of oil a 
day about 200000 barrels a day are trucked across jordan and 
turkey 
the new pipeline will have a capacity of 900000 barrels a day 
the survey said 
the iraqis began building their pipeline network several years 
ago after the war cut them off from their main export terminals in 
the northern gulf and syria closed a pipeline to the mediterranean 
that crossed its territory 
syria irans main arab ally has been feuding with iraq for 
eight years the two countries are ruled by rival wings of the 
baath socialist party 
in the early days of the war iraqs oil exports plummetted to 
about 650000 barrels a day 
now iraq is developing new oilfields in southern and central 
iraq which industry experts say could boost production to around 5 
million barrels a day by the end of the next decade 
the drive to boost exports is vital to iraq the war which 
costs it at least 10 billion a year has increased its foreign 
debt to an estimated 50 billion by next year providing oil price 
remain stable iraq could expect to earn 15 billion from crude 
exports 
in contrast iran has pegged its anticipated oil revenue on 
which it also relies to pay for its war effort at only 9 billion 
the iraqi air force has been pounding irans oil industry and 
tankers in a bid to throttle irans economic lifeline the war and 
the threat to shipping have touched off a frenzy of pipeline 
building and planning by persian gulf states 
saudi arabia is upgrading its network and kuwait and abu dahbi 
are studying new pipelines iran is racing to build pipelines to 
its arabia sea coast to avoid the dangerous gulf route 
the oslobased international association of independent tanker 
owners said in a recent report that pipelines now under 
construction will cut demand for supertankers by 46 cargoes a year 
between the persian gulf and western europe

the white house denounced donald t regan 
today as exploiting the presidency with his book detailing nancy 
reagans interest in astrology but left open the question of 
whether stargazing still plays a role in presidential scheduling 
president reagan said again that he never used astrology to make 
policy decisions 
at a rose garden ceremony honoring small business executives 
reagan was asked whether he permits the consultation of 
astrologists in connection with schedules and public appearances 
well you asked for it he replied i cant because i 
never did 
moments later however reagans chief spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said the president had misunderstood the question 
shouted by a reporter from the rear of the rose garden reagan 
thought he was being asked whether astrology was being used to make 
key policy decisions fitzwater said 
so reagan was in effect merely reiterating a statement he made 
last friday denying that stargazing played a role in policy 
decisions his spokesman said 
earlier fitzwater left open the question of whether astrology 
still plays a role in scheduling 
for her part the first lady says she will keep talking to her 
astrologer her spokeswoman said 
fitzwater told reporters that president reagan feels deep 
personal disapointment with this breach of confidence 
i was taken aback by the vengefulness of the attack it comes 
through to me that don regan doesnt really like me mrs reagan 
was quoted as saying by her press secretary 
fitzwater gave a sharplyworded statement to reporters as the 
first lengthy white house reaction to the book by the former white 
house chief of staff entitled for the record from wall street 
to washington 
in the book regan contended reagan laid down no rules and 
articulated no missions while his wife presided over a shadowy 
distaff presidency heavily influenced by astrological advice 
the new book by donald regan is a kissandtell story in the 
mold of all books that seek to exploit the presidency or the first 
family for personal selfinterest fitzwater said 
the president emphasized last week that he made no policy 
decisions based on astrology we recognize that the first lady has 
an interest in astrology he added 
the spokesman defended the first ladys interest in stargazing 
as well as her input into the preparation of the presidents 
schedule 
she has every reason to make contributions on presidential 
schedules and activities fitzwater said she has every right 
to continue it he added at another point 
asked repeatedly whether she continued to rely on astrological 
predictions in such matters fitzwater replied i dont know 
the spokesman also took issue with regans contention that 
astrology played a major role in decisions about the presidents 
schedule asked about any factual errors in the book fitzwater 
replied there were a whole lot of things but were simply not 
going to go into it 
i know the first lady is very upset about anybody trying to 
exploit her concerns for her husbands safety and welfare he 
said 
elaine crispen the first ladys press secretary said today 
that mrs reagan told her she intends to keep talking to the 
astrologer the woman has been identified as a san francisco 
socialite joan quigley 
asked if the first lady will continue to use astrology in 
helping plan the presidents schedule mrs crispen said only 
she will more than likely continue to talk to this person because 
she does get some comfort from it 
it doesnt control their lives she doesnt see any harm in 
it mrs crispen added 
regans book details his allegations that mrs reagan consulted 
an astrologer about scheduling of presidential events 
the book pictures reagan as a reluctant decisionmaker saying 
never did he issue a direct order although i at least 
sometimes devoutly wished that he would 
he listened acquiesced played his role and waited for the 
next act to be written regan wrote of the president who dumped 
him in favor of former sen howard h baker jr at the height of 
the furor over the irancontra affair mrs reagan was widely 
reported at the time to have a played a major role in influencing 
the president to replace regan 
the white house issued a statement sunday saying 
vindictiveness and revenge are not admirable qualities and are 
not worthy of comment donald regans attempts to defame the first 
lady on mothers day no less are certainly in that category 
in an interview sunday regan said i dont think this is an 
attack on his wife there are no adjectives no deprecation of 
the first lady i merely told the story of what she did or didnt 
do during my period as chief of staff 
the former chief of staff said he regarded mrs reagans 
interest in astrology as a harmless eccentricity at first and it 
wasnt until it began to impinge and in my judgment harm the 
presidency in the latter part of 1986 and early 1987 that i began 
to protest 
regan said he was donating all of his proceeds from the book 
published by harcourt brace jovanovich to charity 
in his book the former chief of staff wrote my admiration for 
reagan as president remains very great although my judgment of 
him as a man in light of my final experience as his chief of 
staff underwent a certain change 
over and over however he described the president as a leader 
who holds the reins lightly 
theodore roosevelt believed that the president could conduct 
his office in any way that was not specifically prohibited by the 
constitution he wrote reagan who laid down no rules and 
articulated no missions conferred a rooseveltian latitude on his 
subordinates 
regan who was secretary of the treasury before moving to the 
white house said that in his four years at the treasury 
department i never saw president reagan alone and never 
discussed economic philosophy or fiscal and monetary policy with 
him man to man 
from first day to last at treasury i was flying by the seat 
of my pants the president never told me what he believed or what 
he wanted to accomplish in the field of economics i had to figure 
these things out like any other american by studying his speeches 
and reading the newspapers 
as for the first lady he said mrs reagan regarded herself 
as the presidents alter ego not only in the conjugal but also in 
the political and official dimensions as if the office that had 
been bestowed upon her husband by the people somehow fell into the 
category of worldly goods covered by the marriage vows 
he said of mike deaver who served as deputy chief of staff 
before regan came to the white house that his function in the 
white house had as much to do with the mysterious process of 
managing this shadowy distaff presidency as with his visible role 
as the custodian of the presidential image 
regan says that virtually every major move and decision the 
reagans made during my time as white house chief of staff was 
cleared in advance with a woman in san francisco who drew up 
horoscopes to make certain that the planets were in a favorable 
alignment for the enterprise 
he said he did not know the womans identity however time 
magazine which published excerpts from the book identified her as 
joan quigley of san francisco ms quigley confirmed in a telephone 
interview that she had been giving mrs reagan astrological advice 
since shortly after the assassination attempt on the president in 
1981

the treasury department urged congress monday 
to proceed cautiously on proposals that would toughen the tax on 
some activities of colleges hospitals and other organizations 
which generally are exempt from taxation 
such changes could force universities for example to pay tax 
on income earned from their cafeterias or tax hospitals on profits 
from their pharmacies 
it would be premature to make farreaching changes to the law 
at this time don chapoton assistant secretary of the treasury 
for tax policy told the house ways and means oversight 
subcommittee 
if numerous proposals being weighed are ever formalized into a 
bill he added it will be important to assess the overall 
impact of such legislation on taxexempt organizations in order to 
determine whether the benefits of the legislation justify the 
imposition of such burdens 
several members of congress favor strengthening the special tax 
on nonprofit organizations income that is not related to the 
purpose for which their tax exemption was granted the levy is 
known as the unrelatedbusinessincome tax 
the tax was enacted in 1950 to protect taxable enterprises that 
find themselves competing with exempt organizations the tax 
produced 119 million last year almost double the 1986 figure 
from 30500 organizations there is some evidence officials said 
that this increase was attributable to subcommittee hearings last 
year which were widely followed by nonprofit groups 
the increased collections said rep jj pickle dtexas the 
committee chairman were a result of either better compliance by 
taxexempt organizations or a dramatic growth in incomeproducing 
activities subject to the tax or both 
the treasury department estimates that if all the toughest 
proposals being considered were enacted the maximum yield would be 
no more than 5 billion a year 
chapoton noted however that the tax does more than produce 
revenue and protect taxable competitors the tax also serves the 
important goals of enhancing the efficiency of the governmental 
subsidy inherent in tax exemption and of helping to ensure the 
accountability of taxexempt organizations 
although chapoton endorsed some of the several suggestions the 
subcommittee drafted last year for tightening the tax he rejected 
two major changes 
present law exempts from tax a nonprofit organizations income 
generated by a business that is substantially related to the 
organizations exempt purpose the proposal would exempt income 
only if directly related that would generate considerable 
uncertainty without improving the standard chapoton said 
he also said the administration opposes a suggestion that 
congress declare what specific incomeproducing activities standing 
alone by themselves should be taxexempt under that test chapoton 
said operations of dormitories dining halls and hospital 
pharmacies likely would be taxable 
a long line of witnesses gave the subcommittee advice on all 
sides of the issue 
american arts alliance due to recent changes in federal tax 
and spending policies rising costs at nonprofit arts institutions 
and stagnant federal funding this is no time to make any further 
changes in policies that have stimulated the growth of the arts in 
america 
national association of college stores some institutional 
bookstores pay more in taxes than many small businesses this 
suggests that the present tax is working 
small business administration present law has allowed 
nonprofits to earn nontaxable income from activities never 
contemplated by congress in carving out their original exemption 
the distinction between the two sectors has become blurred in 
some instances beyond recognition 
independent sector representing numerous charities and other 
nonprofit organizations several proposals being considered by the 
subcommittee would result in changes going far beyond corrected 
perceived abuses and anomalies to radically altering the way the 
tax system affects the viability of charities in this country

vice president george bush knew of allegations 
of drug trafficking by the government of gen manuel noriega well 
before the panamanians indictment earlier this year but viewed 
the information as speculative a campaign official said monday 
peter teeley spokesman for bushs republican presidential 
campaign said panama was just one of a number of countries about 
which there were such reports he repeated bushs central 
contention that he did not have clear evidence of noriegas alleged 
drug dealing until noriegas indictment in florida in february 
the question of exactly when bush learned of noriegas alleged 
role in drugdealing has become a major issue in the presidential 
race it was raised in the republican primaries before bush locked 
up the gop nomination and now is being pressed by democrats michael 
dukakis and jesse jackson 
bush has consistently maintained he had no direct knowledge of a 
noriega role in drug trafficking just as he has said he lacked 
early knowledge in the other case that follows him as he campaigns 
the irancontra armsforhostages affair 
democratic frontrunner dukakis frequently criticizes what he 
calls dealing with drugrunning panamanian dictators by the 
reaganbush administration and jesse jackson asserts the reason 
mr bush has not led the charge to fight drugs is because he knew 
of the administrations dealings with the drug dealers 
critics have asserted that either bush knew more than he is 
saying on the subject or if he didnt he should have as head of 
the south florida task force a federal druginderdiction effort 
in the early 1980s 
bush a former director of the central intelligence agency has 
made the war on drugs a major campaign issue challenging both 
dukakis and jackson to stand with him in supporting the death 
penalty for drug kingpins 
teeley said bushs assertion that he had no prior knowledge of 
specific noriega drug dealings does not suggest bush was completely 
in the dark 
i think anybody who knows anything about whats gone on in the 
world of international narcotics trafficking is fully aware that 
there are all sorts of rumors and reports about foreign officials 
being involved in drug trafficking money laundering and payoffs 
some turn out to be accurate some are not teeley said 
we heard all sorts of accusations about the government in the 
bahamas columbia bolivia peru mexico and panama he added 
but the question is when do you get concrete evidence that 
soemthing of this nature is indeed true 
the new york times quoting unidentified administration 
officials said in sunday editions that the former us ambassador 
to panama everett e briggs told bush during a december 1985 
meeting about the allegations however briggs told reporters in 
hondurus his present post that he had not presented bush with 
evidence of a noriegadrugs link 
i think that the ambassadors comments speak for themselves 
teeley said monday 
asked during a campaign stop in los angeles last thursday 
whether he ever had been told of reports of ties between noriega 
and drug trafficking bush said not that i was ever aware of 
he also said that even now he does not know much about the 
specifics of the indictment asked if he would advocate the death 
penalty for noriega if he is tried and convicted bush said id 
like to see the evidence behind the allegations 
meanwhile administration and bush campaign officials who spoke 
on the condition of anonymity said that president reagan will 
formally endorse bush on wednesday most likely in a white house 
ceremony in advance of a wednesday gop banquet that both the 
president and bush will attend

including a fife and drum corps 
carrington responded by saying he wished he had a nato medal 
that could be presented to carlucci and his predecessor caspar w 
weinberger in thanks for americas commitment to a free europe 
nobody could fail to be impressed by the morale by the 
readiness by the competence of the united states forces assigned 
to the north atlantic treaty organization hen said 
you should be proud of them and we should be grateful i know 
that it is a heavy burden for the united states to keep the forces 
that you have throughout the world 
carrington an englishman who has led the 16nation nato 
alliance since 1984 will be replaced this month by west german 
defense minister manfred woerner 
his reference to the heavy burden born by the united states 
comes at a time when a growing number of congressional leaders are 
demanding that americas allies in europe along with japan and 
south korea contribute more to the common defense 
carrington said he hoped the united states bore the burden 
because you believe its in the interest of the united states as 
well as in the interests of your allies because selfinterest is 
more lasting a basis than general goodwill

moshe biermann 54 a bank clerk who lived through world war ii as 
a boy in romania 
but when i see a german uniform i still feel a stab in my 
heart he added as seven cadets wearing traditional 
whiteandblue sailor suits passed him on haifas bustling main 
street 
the threemast sailing ship gorch fock is in haifa for a 
fiveday stay that will include a soccer match between german and 
israeli cadets visits to israeli families and a trip to the 
holocaust memorial yad vashem in jerusalem 
the port call in haifa is part of an 11month sail around the 
world for the gorch forck before it returns to its homeport kiel 
in june stops have included france mexico the united states 
australia and oman on the persian gulf 
west german ambassador wilhelm haas described the relationship 
between the defense establishments of germany and israel as good 
and said the visit of the ship fits very well into this picture 
israel is selling ammunition aircraft and remotecontrol 
vehicles to west germany and israeli defense minister yitzhak 
rabin visited bonn last year 
asked about the feelings of unease expressed by some israelis 
haas said german officers come here as israeli officers come to 
germany they dont hide their uniforms why should they 
but some cadets said they were apprehensive before coming to 
israel 
its a mixed feeling said peter fromm 21 of duesseldorf 
we dont know what the reaction is going to be we were advised 
that if there was a problem we should remain calm 
added uwe kroll 23 of bremerhaven we are not here for our 
amusement like in australia where we had one party after another 
here especially you feel like a representative of germany 
as the cadets strolled through the steep streets to buy film and 
souvenirs some passersby stopped and turned when they heard the 
young sailors speaking german 
who are they germans one passerby asked this reporter 
you shouldnt be talking to them after what they have done to our 
people 
during a beer break at a downtown cafe the cadets said that 
before their arrival they were briefed about israel especially 
the holocaust in which six million jews were killed by nazi germany 
we were told that nearly every family in haifa was affected by 
the holocaust said kroll whose grandfather served in hitlers 
navy he said he would like to meet an israeli family but that he 
had to stand guard at the time such visits are scheduled 
we talked about the holocaust about the guilt of the german 
people said karl friedrich schinkel a west german navy 
spokesman who briefed the cadets we didnt prettify anything 
an israeli navy vessel was docked next to the gorch fock and an 
israeli reserve soldier who would only identify himself as rafi 
walked over to take a closer look at the 90meterlong white barque 
equipped with 23 sails 
its beautiful he said i dont care if its from 
germany or holland or any other place 
added another israeli soldier time has passed we are buying 
their cars and their machines but we will never forget

president reagan said monday that each year of 
his administration has seen unparalleled growth of small 
business and that the climate has never been better for 
entrepeneurs 
the record quite simply is incredible he said at a rose 
garden ceremony honoring small business small business provides 
well over twothirds of all new jobs about 40 percent of our 
aggregate national output the bulk of new products and 
technologies most of the jobs generated for younger older and 
female workers and over 66 percent of all first jobs 
reagan said the past five years have seen the longest unbroken 
period of peacetime growth on record 
the climate necessary to nurture small business development 
has never been better reagan said clearly the econopmic 
policies of the 1980s have made it immensely easier to start up 
a small business and keep it going 
the ceremony coincided with the administrations seventh report 
to congress on the state of small business 
small business news continues to be good news the report 
said the continuation of this strong small business record is a 
national priority 
reagan presented plaques as business persons of the year to 
boyhood friends ben cohen and jerry greenfield who started ben and 
jerrys homemade inc of south burlington vt and made it the 
third largest distributor in us 
beginning with two employees in 1978 the company now employs 
200 and the 8000 in startup money now generates annual sales of 
30 million selling to grocery stores in 35 states and in 45 ice 
cream parlors around the country reagan said 
the president also told the white house guests that small 
business is about hopes and dreams making dreams come true 
those dreams those hopes he said are a singular and great 
natural resource

conservative premier jacques chirac on monday 
prepared to resign and hand over power to a new socialistled 
government a day after he was trounced in an election by president 
francois mitterrand 
meanwhile the paris stock market responded positively to the 
socialist incumbents victory 
while aides packed files and personal items in cardboard boxes 
and plastic sacks chirac made an appointment to hand his 
resignation letter to mitterrand on tuesday his spokesman said 
the move clears the way for appointment of a new premier 
officials at presidential elysee palace made no comment but 
mitterrand was widely expected to name chiracs successor within a 
day or two 
mitterrand 71 swept away his 55yearold premier in sundays 
voting winning reelection to a second sevenyear term and ending 
two years of uncomfortable cohabitation between the political 
opponents 
final results announced monday afternoon gave mitterrand 
16710723 votes or 54 percent to 14221682 or 46 percent for 
chirac 
michel rocard a 57yearold former agriculture minister was 
billed as the most likely choice to lead the new government 
mitterrand has said he wants nonsocialists included in the cabinet 
rocard has been known for his openness to the political center 
a characteristic that has helped make him suspect among some 
officials in his own socialist party 
other possible premiers include two former finance ministers 
jacques delors and pierre beregovoy and mitterrands chief of 
staff jeanlouis bianco but political commentators said the wily 
president could well surprise everyone with an unexpected choice 
the socialists control only 211 seats in the 577member national 
assembly so the life of the new government could be difficult or 
short 
te new premier could try to negotiate a coalition with centrist 
members of parliament but will probably try to survive at least 
several months by avoiding controversial issues apt to lead to a 
legislative defeat 
mitterrand could also dissolve the body and call new elections 
but he has vowed to do so only if his first government loses a 
parliamentary vote of confidence and falls 
the union for french democracy the centerright coalition body 
that was aligned with chiracs rally for the republic for the past 
two years said in a statement that it would judge the new 
premiers proposals one by one and not automatically vote to 
censure his government 
meanwhile the extremeright national front claimed it was the 
new leader of frances right it issued a statement saying its 
head jeanmarie le pen has become at this hour the de facto 
leader of the national and popular opposition to organize the 
france of french people against socialism 
the national fronts position was greatly strengthened by le 
pens surprising 14 percent of the vote in the first round of 
presidential elections april 24 when chirac drew just 20 percent 
and mitterrand captured 34 percent 
meanwhile the paris stock exchange reacted calmly and favorably 
monday to the election news the general market indicator showed a 
gain of 09 percent at the end of the afternoon session after a 2 
percent jump earlier advances led declines by 118 to 65 with 23 
issues unchanged 
the market responded very differently seven years ago after 
mitterrands surprise first victory investors sold madly 
frightened by mitterrands radical rhetoric and pledges to include 
communists in the government 
analysts said mitterrands victory was widely anticipated this 
time 
morever mitterrand has been moving toward the political center 
in the past few years and it appeared the new government would not 
make major changes in economic policy 
one of the few significant programs mitterrand has said he 
intends to pursue is reestablishment of the socialist wealth tax 
abolished by chirac in 1986 the proceeds would fund a minimum 
guaranteed income

chancellor helmut kohl on monday 
blamed one of his partys worst state election losses in years on 
bickering within his coalition government and backlash from a 
political dirty tricks campaign 
kohls comments came after leaders of his conservative christian 
democratic party gathered to assess the damage done in sundays 
elections in the northern state of schleswigholstein 
the chancellors party was ousted from power in the state for 
the first time in 38 years losing nearly 10 percent of the vote 
but the election was a decisive victory for the opposition 
social democrats who won 548 percent of the vote after they had 
lost ground in a string of state elections over the past 18 months 
according to the unofficial figures 
the results were the bestever posted by the social democrats in 
schleswigholstein giving the party 46 of the 74 seats in the 
states parliament an increase of 10 seats from the previous 
election 
unofficial results showed the christian democrats won 333 
percent of the vote and 27 seats down from 33 seats 
sundays vote was called to break the stalemate in the states 
government that followed an inconclusive election in september 1987 
in that contest the christian democrats polled 426 percent of 
the vote while the social democrats got 452 percent 
the clashes that occurred from time to time certainly did not 
help us said kohl speaking of the infighting within his 
threeparty federal coalition in bonn 
the chancellor also told reporters that a principal cause of the 
unexpectedly large loss was the deep shock that lingered from 
the barschel affair one of the biggest domestic scandals to hit 
west germany in recent years 
uwe barschel served as the christian democratic governor in 
schleswigholstein until he resigned last fall after news of a 
political dirty tricks campaign surfaced in the west german media 
barschel was found dead in a geneva hotel room in october and 
authorities ruled his death an apparent suicide 
meanwhile the youth wing of kohls christian democrats called 
on the chancellor to reshuffle his cabinet as a means of offsetting 
the schleswigholstein election loss 
a fresheningup of the coalition with younger people is 
urgently called for christoph boehr head of the youth union 
was quoted by the bild newspaper as saying 
after meeting with christian democratic leaders kohl 
acknowledged to reporters that his party had suffered a serious 
loss in the state elections 
but the chancellor said he was convinced the coalition would 
continue to be popular and predicted it would be reelected in the 
1990 federal elections 
finance minister gerhard stoltenberg head of the christian 
democrats in schleswigholstein said at the same news conference 
that he had no intention of resigning his party position because of 
the election debacle 
the liberal free democratic party the junior party in kohls 
governing coalition also posted losses falling from 52 percent 
of the vote in september to 44 percent sunday 
the loss was decisive because the free democrats failed to win 
the minimum 5 percent of the vote under west german law a party 
must win at least 5 percent of the vote to take any parliamentary 
seats as a result the free democrats lost all four of their 
places in the parliament 
the environmental greens party also failed to win parliamentary 
seats after receiving only 29 percent of the vote well below the 
39 percent it won in september 
it will be several days before the results based on returns 
from polling stations are verified and declared final under west 
german law 
political analysts say the social democratic majority assures 
that the state governors post will go to bjoern engholm the 
partys candidate for the position 
the election turnout was 774 percent up slightly from 766 
percent last september

western suburbs monday and caused delays at major airports 
no remedies were expected until at least midweek illinois bell 
officials said 
crews at the federal aviation administrations control center in 
aurora were using a backup phone system but the lack of full 
service meant controllers had to stagger the arrival of flights by 
20 miles

fire departments from 15 communities battled the fire at the 
hinsdale station west of chicago for three hours before it was 
brought under control sunday evening

dialed and routing longdistance calls 
customers in the suburbs of hinsdale willowbrook clarendon 
hills and parts of darien burr ridge and unincorporated oak brook 
lost all service said illinois bell spokeswoman laura littel

said 
she said phones were dead for 35000 customers but the number 
of consumers with only partial interruption was unknown 
the cause of the fire was unknown 
at ohare international airport edelstein said 55 to 60 
incoming flights were allowed per hour down from the normal level 
of 75 the aurora air traffic control center also handles traffic 
for chicagos midway airport

the world has shifted to a new standard for 
managing the dollar and other currencies a transition brought 
about through secret negotiations worthy of a spy novel according 
to a new book released monday 
managing the dollar from the plaza to the louvre traces the 
highstakes bargaining between the united states and its major 
allies over the past three years as the reagan administration 
sought desperately for solutions to the huge us trade deficits 
but the book being published by the institute for international 
economics a washington think tank argues that the agreements 
both the public ones and the private deals have proven 
agonizingly fragile 
the possibility of backsliding overcommitting or reneging 
has continually threatened the credibilty of these deals author 
yoichi funabashi told reporters at a briefing 
funabashi a japanese newspaper reporter spent a year 
researching the book which for the first time throws light on the 
shadowy world of international monetary agreements reached between 
the socalled group of seven the united states japan west 
germany britain france canada and italy 
the book traces the shift in the reagan administration which 
until 1985 stood by as the dollar surged to new highs it ignored 
critics who argued that the highflying dollar was devastating 
american manufacturers and farmers whose products were being 
priced out of world markets 
after james a baker iii succeeded donald t regan as treasury 
secretary in early 1985 administration policy shifted 
dramatically funabashi said a principal architect of the change 
was deputy treasury secretary richard darman who wrote a secret 
memorandum to baker in april 1985 outlining a strategy to 
strengthen international coordination and manage currencies 
darman proposed that the administration promote a move away from 
the floating exchange rates to currency reference ranges 
from the end of world war ii until 1973 the world was on the 
gold standard with the price of gold set at 35 an ounce and the 
currencies of other governments set at fixed rates based on the 
dollar 
this system was replaced by floating exchange rates in which 
each currency was set on the open market this process however 
caused extreme volatility and wide swings in the value of the 
dollar and other currencies playing havoc with international trade 
darmans memo argued for the floating exchange rate system to be 
tamed by the adoption of reference ranges which would limit 
currency swings currencies would be kept in specified ranges 
through the use of such tools as intervention by which governments 
buy and sell dollars and other currencies on the open market in an 
effort to influence the value 
the first effort at managing the dollars value came in an 
agreement between the united states japan west germany britain 
and france at a meeting at the plaza hotel in new york on sept 22 
1985 the five countries agreed to use coordinated intervention to 
drive the value of the dollar lower as a way of correcting the us 
trade deficit 
a weaker dollar makes imports more expensive and american 
products more competitive on overseas markets 
the administration considered the negotiations leading up to the 
plaza agreement so sensitive that the talking paper distributed to 
countries before the meeting was called a nonpaper and its 
contents were kept secret 
the united states and its allies switched course again in 
february 1987 with the louvre agreement named for the paris 
building where the meeting took place which said that the dollar 
had declined far enough the nations pledged to intervene in 
currency markets to defend the dollar against continued downward 
pressure and adopted a form of darmans reference ranges 
the book said the participants agreed to stabilize the dollar to 
keep it falling more than 5 percent below a base of 1535 yen to 
the dollar a range that has never been publicly confirmed 
the dollar has continued to fall however and now stands around 
125 yen down more than 18 percent from the lower limit established 
by the louvre accord 
the major story of this book is that it should lay to rest any 
lingering doubts about whether the world is still on a floating 
exchange rate system or something else said c fred bergsten 
executive director of the institute the louvre put into place a 
rather detailed reference range system

leaders of the senate intelligence committee 
said today serious differences have developed between the kremlin 
and the white house over onsite verification provisions of the 
mediumrange missile treaty and urged the senate not to open debate 
on the pact until they are resolved 
there are serious problems and until they are resolved i think 
it would be very difficult to proceed with a fullfledged debate in 
the senate said sen william cohen rmaine 
my feeling is that until these disputes are resolved we should 
not proceed cohen said 
sen david boren dokla the chairman of the intelligence 
panel agreed there are serious ambiguities that remain there 
simply has not been a meeting of the minds on verification 
problems there are a number of things that have to be resolved 
he said 
soviet officials have been quoted in recent weeks as backing 
away from certain onsite inspection procedures spelled out by the 
treaty boren told reporters this is no way to begin a 
relationship under a treaty as important as this if these 
deliberate ambiguities remain 
if they are not resolved quickly i would be very reluctant to 
proceed boren said 
cohen said that administration officials have said they are 
encouraged by the nature of recent contacts with soviet officials 
on the dispute over the treaty but cohen said he is less 
optimistic that differences can be resolved quickly 
senate debate on ratification of the treaty had been tenatively 
been set to begin wednesday 
but senate majority leader robert c byrd of west virginia said 
monday that he will not permit the debate to begin as long as 
serious problems remain 
the intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty requires the 
elimination of all us and soviet missiles with a range of between 
300 and 3400 miles worldwide

ronald reagan held both gorbachevs spellbound 
with hollywood stories during the geneva summit according to the 
latest tales from the white house but after raisa gorbachev 
sparkled in dinner table conversation nancy reagan fumed who 
does that dame think she is 
former white house chief of staff donald t regan in his book 
for the record published monday portrayed a first lady who 
tried to keep presidential spokesman larry speakes from uttering 
the word cancer when a malignancy was found in her husbands 
colon and who kept regan from riding the helicopter to bethesda 
naval hospital because helicopters were too presidential for 
staff members use 
and he told of a president who perks up in the presence of women 
and unfailingly offers a fatherly wave to the pretty stewardesses 
across an airport tarmac 
beyond his disclosure of mrs reagans reliance on a nob hill 
astrologist regans book gave outofschool tales about a first 
lady with a pervasive protective role in her husbands presidency 
the irancontra arms and money affair made mrs reagans 
sensitivity to criticism more acute than ever regan wrote and 
as a result mrs reagan gave him frequent directions on how to 
handle the matter 
the first ladys telephoning was so frequent that i was 
spending two or three times as much time talking to her as to the 
president he said 
mrs reagan was influential in regans unceremonious departure 
from the white house by then hard feelings between the two were 
common knowledge in washington 
in recalling all the latest in a series of white house gossipy 
memoirs about disarray within the reagan presidency regan 
described how raisa gorbachev the stylish wife of the soviet 
leader upstaged nancy reagan at their first social session a 
dinner during the 1985 geneva summit 
mrs reagan was hostess he wrote but mrs gorbachev did not 
confine herself as most other wives of heads of state and 
government did in such meetings to crosschat with mrs reagan on 
palace housewifery and other harmless subjects 
mrs gorbachev was a highly educated woman a professor of 
marxistleninist theory regan said at this dinner party and 
the later one at the soviet mission she did not hesitate to make 
use of the opportunities offered to her to educate the president of 
the united states on the intellectual and philosophical basis of 
soviet policy 
it was evident that she was mistress of her subject an 
intellectual with a truly impressive grasp of a specialty that she 
regarded as the key to understanding soviet society and the world 
beyond regan recalled reagan listened to mrs gorbachevs 
extremely detailed and fervently argued opinions with gallant 
courtesy 
gorbachev like any husband in his circumstances kept his 
peace regan said mrs reagan however chaffed under the 
monologue after the door had closed behind the gorbachevs she 
said who does that dame think she is 
as for reagan he entertained the gorbachevs with stories about 
his acting career they questioned him about how movies are made 
and how the hollywood stars live 
the gorbachevs devoured every detail regan said like any 
other movie buffs they were very pleased to be in the company of 
somebody who had known jimmy stewart john wayne and humphrey 
bogart and nearly every other famous movie star personally and was 
able to describe what they were really like 
regan wrote dryly that the president did not tell the leader of 
the communist world about his role of driving communists from the 
union during his terms as president of the screen actors guild 
reagan tends to glow in the company of women regan wrote the 
presence of ambassador jeane kirkpatrick or secretary of 
transportation elizabeth dole at a cabinet meeting always made for 
a heightened presidential mood he was more amusing more 
talkative more of a participant than a presence 
regan said everyone who travels with the president has come to 
believe that pan american world airways assigns its prettiest 
stewardesses to the plane carrying the white house press corps 
this happy circumstance did not escape the presidents 
notice he said when air force one landed the president 
always looked for thepan am stewardesses from the press plane and 
gave them a fatherly wave they waved back enthusiastically pretty 
young women in their uniforms smiling at the most famous man in the 
world 
it was a moment everyone looked forward to on presidential 
journeys

after a factfinding tour of the region last october shultz 
flew to the middle east in late february reported to reagan at an 
allied summit meeting in brussels and returned in early march he 
made a separate trip in april but failed to line up any of the 
mideast leaders except egyptian president hosni mubarak 
still shultz vowed to keep at it fighting the long odds 
what am i saving myself for anyway he said at the end of the 
last venture 
redman said arabs and israelis had urged shultz to keep trying 
all of the people in the region have been very insistent on the 
fact that the secretary and the administration continue these 
efforts the spokesman said 
he acknowledged however that the plan for negotiations had not 
won approval and declined to specify any changes in position by the 
various leaders that might make this trip a success 
the real reason the secretary is going is because at this 
stage weve not yet been able to bring about the negotiations to 
which all of this effort is directed redman said 
deputy secretary of state john whitehead said meantime that 
shultz believes that though the prospects for progress may not 
look encouraging at the moment he really has no other course but 
to keep at it he spoke to foreign correspondents at the foreign 
press center 
shultz initially hoped a mideast peace conference could be 
convened in midapril setting up negotiations on the palestinians 
on may 1 between israel and a delegation headed by jordan that 
included palestinians 
his plan called for a second stage of talks opening dec 1 that 
would deal with an overall settlement of the arabisraeli conflict 
syria egypt and lebanon would be invited to join the negotiations 
shultz told a senate appropriations subcommittee two weeks ago 
that under the right circumstances king hussein of jordan would 
be agreeable to the us proposal for a peace conference 
however shultz testified that israeli prime minister yitzhak 
shamir had made the conference the centerpiece of his 
objections to shultzs plan 
shultz also was unsuccessful last month in moscow in trying to 
persuade the soviet union to accept a limited role in the 
negotiations 
shamir and shultz both are opposed to giving the soviets a 
chance to shape the outline of a mideast settlement but hussein is 
insisting on soviet involvement 
on the other hand jordan is reluctant to negotiate with israel 
without a guarantee that it would recover all the land it lost 
during the 1967 mideast war shultz has advised hussein that was 
not in the cards but he backs the idea of israel trading some 
territory on the west bank for peace and said the future of 
jerusalem should be decided in negotiations 
despite the long odds shultz said he did not think his plan was 
fated to failure

presidentelect rodrigo borja a 
centerleft politician urged business leaders not to be frightened 
by his election despite his criticism of the free market policies 
of his predecessor 
our victory should not make anyone nervous no one should 
start a financial panic we intend to respect private enterprise 
he said late sunday night after winning the presidency 
borja a 52yearold law professor defeated abdala bucaram a 
36yearold populist by a margin of 528 percent to 472 percent 
the presidentelect whose fouryear term begins aug 10 will 
replace leon febres cordero an archconservative who has 
championed free enterprise and has been washingtons closest ally 
in south america 
borja who lost a bitterlyfought runoff contest to febres 
cordero in 1984 has pledged to reverse his opponents freemarket 
policies and seek close ties with the nonaligned third world 
movement 
now it is dr borjas turn to show that his political 
alternative is valid interior minister heinz moeller said monday 
borja will face the challenge of governing a small nation that 
has seen its oilgenerated prosperity fade away in the past few 
years as the price of petroleum has dropped 
oil has been the main source of income for ecuador since the 
early 1970s 
the countrys foreign reserves have dropped to under 50 
million and febres cordero who took pride in keeping up payments 
on ecuadors 92 billion foreign debt was forced to stop 
repayments last year after devastating earthquakes crippled the 
countrys oil industry for nearly six months 
the economy shrank by 35 percent in 1987 and annual inflation 
is running at nearly 70 percent the highest level in five years 
less than half of the work force is fully employed 
borjas democratic left party espouses a social democratic 
doctrine 
he has said he will impose exchange controls restrict imports 
to save dollar reserves and regulate prices of basic consumer goods 
to fight inflation 
he also announced plans for a more restrictive foreign 
investment policy and a moratorium on foreign debt payments if 
creditors do not agree to negotiate easier terms 
either we pay the debt or we develop the country we cant do 
both at the same time he said in a recent meeting with foreign 
correspondents 
febres corderos policies ran against the trend of 
leftofcenter governments in south america but borjas victory 
pushes ecuador back into the regional pattern 
us officials say they expect no problems in dealing with 
borja who is widely described as highly intelligent hardworking 
and honest 
but analysts say demands from organized labor for huge wage 
increases and for quick economic solutions will prove to be a 
formidable test for the new president who even his backers say he 
may not have the strong leadership ability needed to keep the 
confidence of the population while he seeks solutions 
borja reflected a sense of the limitations of his power when he 
said sunday night the condition of the country does not permit 
miracles 
borjas biggest weakness is his lack of charisma said 
benjamin ortiz editor of the independent quito newspaper hy 
but borja in contrast to the stormy political climate 
surrounding febres cordero is expected to enjoy a relatively 
tranquil relationship with congress which his democratic left 
party controls 
febres cordero had engaged in bitter fights with an 
oppositioncontrolled congress throughout his term during which 
opposition legislators talked about impeaching him

house speaker jim wright announced monday he 
has set a june 21 deadline for committees to draft legislation to 
step up the governments fight against illegal drugs 
wright dtexas said he hoped the package would build upon the 
antidrug programs congress passed two years ago just before the 
last election but he denied it was just an electionyear ploy 
anything we do that people like is denigrated as motivated 
by reelection politics he said but that should not deter 
lawmakers we cannot sit by as the united states loses the war 
against drugs he said 
congress has already been attaching antidrug amendments to 
existing legislation 
the senate voted to bypass congress commitment to limit overall 
spending in order to add 26 billion to its fiscal 1989 budget for 
an upcoming antidrug bill 
the house has voted for additional money for the coast guard and 
new powers for the military to intercept drugs coming into the 
country 
the legislation wright said would be completed next month would 
be like the senate proposals with money for programs such as 
treatment of addicts law enforcement and prison construction he 
said the cost had not yet been determined 
well see how much it takes and then well find ways to pay 
for it he said 
wright said house majority leader thomas foley dwash would 
be working with republicans to make the bill bipartisan however 
republicans said the democrats already were drafting the 
legislation without gop input 
while the democratic proposals center on increased federal 
spending republicans are drafting alternatives that would increase 
penalties for drug offenders including capital punishment for 
traffickers involved in deaths

the man michael dukakis left minding the store 
in massachusetts while running for president is a veteran of 40 
years in and around government 
hale champion has been a reporter a harvard official an aide 
to california gov pat brown and a health official in the carter 
administration 
balding rotund and 65 champion gives the impression that hes 
seen it all and that nothing fazes him not complaining 
legislators or angry lobbyists budget shortfalls or the way the 
news media covers it all 
to read one boston newspaper dukakis chief secretary said in 
an interview last week you would have thought blood was coursing 
through the corridors of the statehouse entrails draped over the 
balconies 
where who i mean its simply a bunch of people doing their 
work 
just doing your job thats the way he looks at it champion 
said of his boss the governor who has risen to become the 
democratic presidential frontrunner sometimes thats why people 
think hes not exciting enough not emotional enough 
but said champion thats what i like about him i mean 
thats what gets things done thats what gets things taken care 
of not emoting hour after hour 
and if that says i am unemotional about those things maybe i 
am 
champions strength is that there isnt anything that he can 
think of that he hasnt seen before said dukakis press 
secretary james dorsey hes sort of like a deeply set 
foundation for the administration 
champion himself was a press secretary and then executive 
secretary and finance director for brown who was ronald reagans 
predecessor as governor of california 
his career also includes financial vice presidencies at the 
university of minnesota and harvard university a stint as director 
of the boston redevelopment authority when he first met dukakis 
and two years as undersecretary to joseph califano at the 
department of health education and welfare in the carter 
administration 
he was in semiretirement as executive dean of harvards kennedy 
school of government when dukakis tapped him to become his chief 
secretary a year ago 
i was never interested in working you need to understand 
he said with a smile he resisted my arguments and persuaded my 
wife and here i am 
considering champions background and symmetry of thinking with 
dukakis little had to be discussed between the two on what the job 
entailed he and i both assumed that i knew what minding the 
store meant champion said 
he has faced comparisons to john sasso the politically savvy 
longtime dukakis associate who had been chief secretary before 
moving over to run the campaign sasso later left over his part in 
the attack video episode that helped drive sen joseph biden 
from the presidential race 
some lawmakers have criticized the lack of courting they get 
from champion i dont do as much of it as john did never 
will never did when i did this kind of job before for brown 
champion said 
but he keeps in close contact with legislative leaders and that 
to champion is most important 
while champion frequently remarks on how there is nothing new 
under the sun in his job there are some aspects that are different 
in keeping an administration going while the chief executive is 
running for president 
first he must make sure dukakis is abreast of events back in 
the state while the governor spends three or more days a week on 
the campaign trail second he has been chiefly in charge of 
bringing dukakis constitutional successor lt gov evelyn murphy 
more into the daily operations of the administration 
and third he has found that virtually every administration 
initiative from a universal health care bill to the state budget 
and many bills being pushed by individual lawmakers are publicly 
cast in the context of the impact on dukakis presidential campaign 
at first i did get a little bit upset said champion 
its ridiculous but its every single thing 
but champion said dukakis and his administration have tried to 
solve any problems in that area by living the old saying whats 
good politics is good government 
if you look like you are doing what you ought to be doing 
generally as against a gimme here and a gimme there thats the 
best politics champion said as a matter of fact thats why 
michael is where he is today because he has always taken that kind 
of attitude 
champion said he isnt interested in a return trip to washington 
if dukakis is elected rather hes counting down the last months 
he believes he will be in his present post and is looking beyond 
the parttime teaching position waiting for him at harvard what 
hes really looking forward to he said is that time when i am 
not even teaching

city government came to a standstill monday 
while thousands of people streamed by the coffin of richard s 
caliguiri in the citycounty building where he governed pittsburgh 
i didnt know him personally but i liked him he was one of 
the nicest persons im going to start crying and im not even 
related to him said mary ronschke 75 a pittsburgh resident who 
waited in line 
an estimated 2000 people viewed the flagdraped coffin in the 
first hour after the doors were opened gov robert casey was among 
those who filed past the coffin 
caliguiris heart stopped friday from what his doctors said was 
an accumulation of protein caused by the rare incurable disease 
amyloidosis he was 56 and in his 12th year as mayor he was 
credited with steering pittsburgh through the collapse of 
steelmaking in the area 
monday was an official day of mourning city offices courts 
public and parochial schools and buildings were closed 
after a funeral mass on tuesday caliguiri will be buried two 
plots away from his mother catherine in calvary cemetery in 
pittsburgh 
itll be quite a while before we have another one like him 
said jerry esposito i dont think anybody perceived what a 
symbol this young unpretentious man came to be he remained true 
to the common man kept his honesty and his values 
esposito an emergency medical services official recalled 
caliguiris efforts as a city council member to help improve 
ambulance service in western pennsylvania 
richard was the first member of this city body who was 
perceptive enough to know that that was an issue worth giving his 
support and understanding to he said this young man had the 
courage to support that issue through all the turmoils and battles 
that ensued 
this city now enjoys as fine a paramedic protection as any 
municipality in the country 
william parker social service administrator for the 
neighborhood centers association said he liked caliguiri for 
something else the mayor helped give the city 
he has never done anything for me personally but i appreciate 
the fact that he was able to keep our streets in good condition 
he said he had begun to make pittsburgh a city that one could be 
proud of i often have visitors from out of town and im just so 
pleased to be able to show them the progress that has been made 
he was a gift at a time when we needed a gift state labor 
department spokesman mike acquaviva said as he waited in line 
acquaviva credited caliguiri for his reaction to the collapse of 
steelmaking in the cradle of the steel industry 
most politicians would be defensive when things are crumbling 
but he drew upon both the public and private sector to make some 
pretty bold initiatives acquaviva said when we deal with 
unemployment numbers were dealing with numbers but he looked at 
it as people

congressional investigators have determined 
that the immigration and naturalization service is wasting millions 
of tax dollars on unneeded equipment it cannot use a house 
subcommittee chairman said monday 
rep glenn english dokla said a oneyear review by the 
general accounting office found the ins apparently has no 
consistent method of deciding what it needs or how to purchase 
equpment that would fill those needs the result is that at best 
were getting equipment that doesnt really do the job 
the ins responded monday to concerns raised in the report with 
plans to establish a research and development steering committee 
that will develop procurement procedures based on some gao 
recommendations said spokesman verne jervis 
the ins planning office which includes research and 
development will also be moved so that it reports directly to the 
ins commissioners office where it will receive enhanced 
visibility and increased access to top management jervis said 
english said he was concerned efforts in the war on drugs were 
being hurt by the ins apparent waste of millions of dollars on 
equipment the ins cant really use 
theres no question that ins and particularly the border 
patrol are underfunded when it comes to the war on drugs 
therefore money wasted on unwise purchases is money that cannot be 
used to halt the flow of drugs across our borders he said in a 
statement 
the gao report to be released thursday at a hearing by 
englishs government information justice and agriculture 
subcommittee found that the ins had no defined formal method of 
technology selection 
in one instance the gao found the ins had ordered the purchase 
of 11 undercover vans outfitted with an extendable infrared scope 
for monitoring the us borders at a cost of more than 130000 
for each vehicle even though operational tests were incomplete 
and the report said the infrared scopes which could have been 
used to support linewatch operations in various border patrol 
sectors sat unused for at least 7 months at fort huachuca ariz 
had those scopes been available for use in detection in 
various sectors some ins agents could have been deployed for other 
activities the value of the agents work that was foregone by the 
ins as a result is estimated to be in the range of 14 million to 
34 million the report said

the nation milk producers federation asked 
dairy farmers monday to join its lobbying effort to stop a further 
cut in federal milk price supports scheduled by the agriculture 
department next year 
the 72yearold federation which represents most of the 
nations dairy cooperatives wants agriculture secretary richard e 
lyng to use his authority in the 1985 farm law to cancel the next 
reduction in milk supports on jan 1 1989 in favor of an 
alternate plan to cut production 
enough is enough said federation president tom camerlo of 
canon city colo dairy farmers are tired of suffering continual 
price reductions after having done more to address federal policy 
concerns than any segment of us agriculture 
camerlo said lyng has the authority to set up a new wholeherd 
buyout or a diversion program both of which have been used in 
recent years to trim us milk production 
however lyng has been steadfast against reviving the buyout and 
diversion programs as an alternative to the reduction in price 
supports 
camerlo and other federation officials told a news conference at 
the national press club that the 50cent reduction scheduled for 
next jan 1 would put the milk support level at 1010 per 100 
pounds of milk the lowest since 1979 
dairy farmers will have to live at 1979 income levels with 
1989 costs he said 
milk price supports have been lowered progressively from a 
record high of 1310 per 100 pounds since 1983 to help discourage 
surplus production a diversion plan to pay farmers for cutting 
back production and a wholeherd buyout or dairy termination 
program also were used 
the 18month wholeherd buyout program began april 1 1986 and 
continued through october 1987 more than 122 million dairy cows 
heifers and calves were sent to market by thousands of producers 
who agreed to quit the dairy business for at least five years 
about 38 percent of the buyout programs cost of 18 billion 
was paid by dairy farmers themselves who were charged assessments 
on milk they sold similar arrangements helped hold down costs on 
the earlier diversion plan 
camerlo said the 50cent reduction next jan 1 would come as 
milk production costs including feed are on the upswing the 
twoway crunch would add up next year to a 37 percent slide in 
dairy farm income from 1987 levels he said 
dairy farmers have contributed 29 billion in assessments since 
1983 to reduce the costs of their programs by 50 percent overall 
camerlo said 
federation leaders have met frequently with usda officials 
including lyng in an attempt to persuade them to abandon the path 
of lower milk supports 
the secretary has been consistent as has his staff that they 
will cut the price camerlo said they do not intend to 
utilize the authority that they have in the 85 act to implement a 
wholeherd or dairy termination program

the national organization for women on monday 
released a list of prominent democratic women and said the 
democratic party should consider them for key convention roles as 
well as for the vice presidential nomination 
now also urged the democrats to continue official support of the 
equal rights amendment abortion rights and gay rights and to add 
a new platform plank promoting women candidates 
we think it would be a very serious mistake to eliminate all 
potentially controversial issues from the platform now president 
molly yard said at a news conference a day before she was scheduled 
to testify before the partys platform committee 
yard distributed a list of 47 prominent democratic women saying 
she wants the party to consider them as national convention 
speakers and officers as well as potential running mates 
on the list are current and former officeholders from congress 
down to city council including former new york rep geraldine 
ferraro who was chosen by walter f mondale as his running mate in 
1984 womens groups including now heavily lobbied mondale to put 
a woman on the ticket 
others on the list include rep patricia schroeder of colorado 
vermont gov madeleine m kunin rep barbara kennelly of 
connecticut houston mayor kathy whitmire former san francisco 
mayor dianne feinstein and sen barbara mikulski of maryland 
asked which vice presidential nominees would be acceptable or 
unacceptable to now this year former now chief eleanor smeal named 
sen sam nunn as a negative example 
citing the georgia senators support for banning abortion and 
for an era only with amendments she said his position on 
womens issues would not be called exemplary 
we want both parties to consider a woman vice presidential 
candidate smeal said there are plenty of prospective 
candidates out there who are women and we think they should be 
considered seriously 
smeal and yard said they are confident era abortion and gay 
rights as well as others supporting child care family leave pay 
equity and a minimum wage hike will remain in the platform 
they dont have the votes to delete these planks theyre just 
not there smeal said she said there would be a strong feminist 
contingent at the atlanta convention in july 
smeal said she would introduce a new platform plank requiring 
equal representation of women candidates in primaries she noted 
the democrats already have a rule requiring equal numbers of men 
and women on committees and at conventions 
under her proposal endorsements by democratic organizations 
would have to be split 5050 between male and female candidates 
she said she intends to press it at the republican convention as 
well 
smeal said the current system amounts to incumbent protection 
clubs that give people 30 years of job security whether theyre 
doing the job or not this is just suicide to have a policy 
that is keeping their decisionmakers virtually all white men 
democratic leaders including party chairman paul kirk have 
said they may try to win a brief platform acceptable to all 
democrats that excludes specific mention of controversial topics

police broke down the doors of a country cottage 
where a dissident group planned to meet and arrested five people 
monday sources said 70 other activists met nearby and founded an 
alternative party to the communist party 
the new group calls itself the democratic union it seeks a 
multiparty parliamentary democracy in the soviet union independent 
trade unions a new constitution and withdrawal of soviet troops 
from eastern europe and areas of the present soviet union seized in 
world war ii 
over the weekend 60 of its supporters were reported arrested in 
moscow and one of the groups founders yuri mityunov said monday 
that 14 remained in jail after being arrested sunday night 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev has called for more 
democratic election procedures including multiplecandidate 
elections but the communist party he heads has given no sign that 
it will accept any organized opposition to its monopoly on 
political power which is enshrined in the soviet constitution 
andrei babitsky an editor of the dissident journal glasnost 
said uniformed and plainclothes police encircled a cottage in the 
woods near the village of kratovo 25 miles southeast of the 
capital where the democratic union planned to meet monday 
afternoon 
the twofloor wooden cottage has been used for meetings of the 
staff of glasnost an unofficial publication that takes its title 
from the russian word for openness gorbachev has used glasnost to 
describe some of his reforms 
a militia officer asked to see our identification documents 
but we refused saying there was no grounds babitsky said in a 
telephone interview he then went for reinforcements and about 
50 uniformed militia plainclothesmen and kgb officers suddenly 
appeared they had obviously been waiting nearby 
sergei grigoryants a former political prisoner who is the 
founding editor of glasnost was arrested on the lawn outside 
babitsky said we closed all five doors to the dacha but police 
broke them in he added 
babitsky said he was arrested along with yuri petrovsky who 
also works with glasnost viktor kuzin a founder of the democratic 
union and a man known only as volodya who babitsky said was in the 
vicinity of the cottage by chance 
babitsky said he was held for almost nine hours without being 
charged then released by police shortly before 9 pm with no 
explanation 
another dissident was in the country house but fled before he 
could be detained another glasnost editor andrei krivov said in 
a telephone interview monday night 
krivov said people who talked to grigoryants at the police 
station in ilinskoye near kratovo reported that grigoryants was 
frisked his clothes were ripped and a large sum of money he was 
carrying was taken 
mityunov reported by telephone that about 70 members of the 
democratic union kept from meeting at the cottage gathered at a 
nearby rural club 
in a halfhour they adopted the basic program for the party 
a declaration and a charter he said 
i think the formation of the party is a big event in the 
unification of forces to fight against the bureaucratic 
totalitarian regime said mityunov a former member of the 
communist party who was fired from his editorial job on staterun 
radio moscow in 1986 
babitsky said he learned from grigoryants wife tamara that the 
glasnost editorinchief was sentenced to seven days in jail for 
resisting authorities i saw him arrested and he did not such 
thing babitsky said 
petrovsky kuzin and the man known as volodya received fiveday 
jail terms but the dissidents group did not know on what charges 
babitsky said 
the kratovo cottage was sealed by police and newspapers and 
books inside may have been taken away by investigators babitsky 
said 
i fear this action may be the defeat of glasnost he added 
the typewritten journal began appearing last year 
kratovo is located in a region foreigners are barred by law from

the united states cannot afford from a 
military perspective to fall further behind in its star wars 
research the pentagon said monday 
the defense department in a required annual report on the 
strategic defense initiative or star wars program said even 3 
percent annual increases in funding for the research would not be 
enough to keep pace with the soviet union 
the russians continue to modernize their offensive as well as 
defensive weaponry gradually improving their ability to destroy 
us forces with a surprise attack the pentagon report said 
the resulting asymmetry between soviet and us forces has led 
to a destabilizing situation one that must be redressed the 
pentagon said 
a star wars defense system that could shoot down soviet missiles 
offers the promise of a more stable peace the pentagon insisted 
the mere process of attempting to develop such a system complicates 
soviet military planning and strains the russian economy 
if on the other hand congress continues to cut deeply into 
star wars funding the united states will not only waste its 
greatest leverage the innovation possible in a free society but 
it cannot expect to do more than react to soviet initiatives in 
strategic defense the pentagon said 
we are faced with either delaying the time when a decision on 
whether to deploy defenses could be made or eliminating some 
technology efforts thereby reducing the number of defense options 
that can support a decision 
the pentagon included the new plea for funding in a report that 
runs to several hundred pages reviewing the work done over the 
past year in various technological fields 
release of the report comes just a week after defense secretary 
frank c carlucci warned he would recommend that president reagan 
veto the pentagons fiscal 1989 budget bill if cuts are made to the 
45 billion requested for star wars 
while the administration has been forced to abandon its goal of 
increasing overall defense spending by 3 percent a year it 
continues to request steep hikes for star wars since 1983 
however congress has cut almost 5 billion from the roughly 18 
billion requested for star wars 
while the congress has increased star wars funding every 
year the difference between what the administration has requested 
and what the congress has appropriated is so large that it has had 
a substantial and increasingly detrimental impact on the program 
the defense department asserted

im not saying massachusetts gov michael dukakis would have 
to have foley to win the west said the governor who formally

a pat robertson supporter says vice 
president george bush could lose voters in november if the georgia 
republican party fails to resolve complaints by robertson backers 
a party credentials committee met in columbus on saturday but 
took no action on appeals concerning disqualifications of delegates 
to the upcoming state convention most of the appeals were filed by 
robertson supporters 
if its not settled to our satisfaction we may not vote for 
bush said john spencer coordinator of muscogee county americans 
for robertson we may write in another candidate robertson or 
dole or kemp 
the party has disqualified 928 delegates out of 2300 to attend 
the state convention in albany may 2021 robertson backers contend 
party regulars are trying to keep them out of the convention by 
invoking trivial and previously unenforced rules such as one 
requiring proof of advertising of county conventions 
of the 30 national convention delegates chosen earlier at 
district conventions 20 were party regulars and 10 were robertson

antiabortion activists expressed 
disappointment monday at nancy reagans reported declaration that 
i dont give a damn about the righttolifers but they praised 
president reagans steadfast support for their cause 
the first lady was quoted by former white house chief of staff 
donald t regan in his new book for the record from wall street 
to washington 
regan wrote that during a telephone conversation from washington 
with mrs reagan at camp david md on jan 24 1987 the first 
lady demanded that all mention of the abortion issue be eliminated 
from the draft text of her husbands state of the union address 
i pointed out that the president had particularly wanted some 
language on this subject included in his address regan said he 
responded 
he quoted mrs reagan as saying i dont give a damn about the 
righttolifers 
the state of the union speech that the president delivered three 
days later contained no references to abortions 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters monday 
that i dont have any knowledge at all whether mrs reagan 
actually made such a statement 
elaine crispen the first ladys press secretary refused 
comment 
antiabortion leaders asked for reaction refrained from any 
direct criticism of mrs reagan and chose instead to praise her 
husband for his unwavering support 
if in fact mrs reagans quote is accurate we are very 
disappointed but it does not affect the respect we have for how 
the president has helped the prolife movement throughout his 
administration said tom glessner executive director of the 
christian action council an evangelical protestant organization 
we would ask mrs reagan to let us know if in fact this 
is how she regards the righttolife movement glessner said 
kay james public affairs director for the national right to 
life committee the largest us antiabortion organization 
refused to discuss the first lady or her remarks 
i think whats important is what the president has done she 
said what is apparent to us is that the president has always 
been extremely supportive in all his speeches his initiatives and 
his policies and thats what we have to go on 
said jack fowler washington bureau chief of the ad hoc 
committee for life an antiabortion lobbying group its 
upsetting if it is true although it doesnt change our attitude 
toward the president himself we know the president is prolife

american hostage terry andersons greatest fear is 
a commando raid against his captors in lebanon an action that 
would mean his certain death a frenchman who shared a cell with 
anderson said monday 
marcel fontaine 45 a diplomat released last week after nearly 
three years of captivity said he and anderson were in the same 
cell for six months and frequently spoke of the possibility that 
either the french or the americans would turn to military action 
we were afraid fontaine told andersons sister peggy say 
of batavia ny during a meeting in his home every time 
anybody knocked on the door two guards immediately stepped in 
pointed guns at us and waited for whoever was going to come in 
there is no chance that any commandos would ever get in 
without us being killed we were all of us always afraid that there 
would be a commando raid by the french or the americans 
mrs say arrived in paris monday to meet with fontaine and two 
other french hostages released wednesday in beirut journalist 
jeanpaul kauffmann and diplomat marcel carton 
anderson 40 chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press was kidnapped in west beirut march 16 1985 by proiranian 
lebnanese and is the longest held western hostage in lebanon 
lebanese kidnappers are holding 18 foreigners including nine 
americans 
fontaine said anderson does not know that his father and his 
brother have died since he has been in captivity the frenchman 
said he knew of those deaths because he had heard of them earlier 
on the radio but he didnt tell anderson for fear it would have a 
serious effect on his morale 
probably the second greatest worry of the hostages said 
fontaine is becoming seriously ill he said no medical treatment 
is allowed and if they should suffer a serious ailment they would 
simply die 
that is what happened to another frenchman michel seurat the 
islamic jihad organization which claims to be holding anderson and 
others claimed seurat was killed but the recently returned 
frenchmen said he died of illness probably cancer 
fontaine said andersons morale is high the diplomat frequently 
praised andersons courage he said anderson exercises 
continuously walking round and round in his cell to keep fit 
fontaine said he began teaching anderson french and he has 
learned to read it rather well anderson in turn taught fontaine 
english

democrat michael dukakis preparing for his expected role as the 
partys presidential nominee talked foreign policy with sen bill 
bradley of new jersey on monday rival jesse jackson exhorted coal 
miners to help him turn the race around on the eve of primaries in 
west virginia and nebraska 
an aide to republican george bush meanwhile acknowledged that 
the vice president was aware of allegations of drug trafficking by 
the government of panamanian strongman gen manuel noriega well 
before noriegas indictment this year an issue on which both 
dukakis and jackson have been attacking bush 
bush campaign spokesman peter teeley said bush viewed the 
information as speculative at the time 
jackson alone among the three remaining presidential candidates 
was actively campaigning monday 
he spent sunday night at the home of an unemployed coal miner 
and his wife junior and becky cook in allwhite arnett wva 
more than 500 people showed up to greet him in the economically 
depressed town of only 300 residents 
they have their race but they dont have jobs jackson said 
they have their race but they dont have health insurance 
they have their race but they dont have hot and cold running 
water he said their race does not address those needs 
jackson visited a coal mine in southern west virginia then 
visited a toxic waste dump as he toured the state saying his call 
for economic help was cutting across racial lines 
there are 37 democratic delegates at stake in the west virginia 
primary and 25 in nebraska 
dukakis made only brief campaign forays into both west virginia 
and nebraska last week he has a commanding lead in delegates to 
the democratic national convention 
still jackson told 1500 people in martinsburg wva were 
within striking distance west virginia you can make a 
difference 
the race is tight jackson said im coming to the last 
lap im running longer and running stronger because my mind is 
made up weve come too far weve got to go on now press on 
press on press on 
dukakis spent the day at the statehouse in boston where the 
massachusetts governor met with bradley for a briefing on 
ussoviet relations dukakis did not come out to comment to 
reporters after the hourlong meeting 
bradley said the subject of the vice presidential spot on a 
dukakis ticket was not discussed he added thats not in the 
cards massachusetts and new jersey dont go well together 
dukakis planned meetings with other members of congress during a 
stopover in washington on thursday before flying west to campaign 
in oregon and california 
dukakis aides said the governor will begin receiving secret 
service protection wednesday dukakis has previously declined the 
protection 
questions about bushs knowledge of noriegas alleged drug 
dealing have emerged as an issue in the presidential race with 
dukakis and jackson both asserting the reagan administration 
continued to deal with the panamanian dictator despite evidence of 
drug invovlement 
they have pointed to bushs experience as former head of the 
cia and head of the admnistrations task force on federal drug 
interdiction as evidence he knew or should have known about 
noriega 
teeley answering questions about the issue said bushs 
assertion that he had no prior knowledge of noriegas specific drug 
dealings does not suggest he was completely in the dark on the 
possibility he said panama was one of a number of countries about 
which there were such reports 
i think anybody who knows anything about whats gone on in the 
world of international narcotics trafficking is fully aware that 
there are all sorts of rumors and reports about foreign officials 
being involved in drug trafficking money laundering and payoffs 
teeley said some turn out to be accurate some are not 
in other developments 
dukakis came under fresh attack from former democratic gov 
edward j king of massachusetts who beat him in 1978 but lost 
their rematch in 1982 king now a republican has appeared on 
television and radio shows in recent weeks to criticize dukakis 
with his expenses paid for by the bush campaign 
in a cambridge mass speech king said dukakis deserves no 
credit for the states economic turnaround 
dukakis was endorsed by gov robert casey of pennsylvania 
where dukakis won the states primary overwhelmingly two weeks ago 
he also picked up public backing from rep harley o staggers jr 
dwva and rep david bonior dmich both of whom will attend 
the democratic convention as super delegates 
house majority leader tom foley dwash one man mentioned as 
a democratic running mate said in idaho falls idaho that he was 
flattered to have his name mentioned but what id like to do is 
stay in the house of representatives 
the national organization for women listed 47 democratic women 
it said should be considered for roles at the democratic national 
convention and for the vice presidency 
now also urged the democrats not to exclude from the platform 
statements of support for the equal rights amendment abortion 
rights gay rights and other issues democratic leaders including 
party chairman paul kirk want a brief platform that avoids such 
controversial topics

robert a heinlein whose science fiction 
explored the future while questioning the morals and beliefs of the 
present has died at the age of 80 it was announced monday 
heinlein who added the word grok to the language and 
dreamed up the water bed was ranked with isaac asimov and arthur 
c clarke among the greatest practitioners of science fiction his 
fiction explored the seeming contraditions of his own philosophy 
which embraced libertarianism and a passionate faith in the 
military 
he died of heart failure sunday at his home in this small 
tourist community about 130 miles south of san francisco said 
terry rice of the monterey county coroners office 
heinlein had suffered for many years from emphysema and had 
undergone numerous operations including one to relieve restricted 
blood flow to his brain 
robert heinlein has been writing science fiction now for 48 
years and from the very start he was recognized as a grand 
master asimov said monday in 1975 the science fiction writers 
of america set up just such an award and he was the first to get 
it there was no argument much like george washington becoming the 
first president 
asimov said he and heinlein had served together in philadelphia 
during world war ii during heinleins second navy hitch and 
formed a close friendship wich never entirely broke up 
his favorite bit of heinlein writing was the opening to door 
into summer in which he described a cat better than anyone has 
ever described a cat the work that impressed me the most was 
solution unsatisfactory written before the manhattan project in 
which he accurately described the current nuclear stalemate 
robert anson heinlein was born in butler mo on july 7 1907 
he graduated from the us naval academy and served for five years 
but was forced to retire after contracting tuberculosis 
flat broke after a failed campaign for the california 
legislature in 1938 heinlein saw an ad in thrilling wonder stories 
magazine offering a 50 prize for a story by an amateur instead of 
entering that contest heinlein sent his first story to astounding 
science fiction magazine which paid him 70 
his books were written in a spare matteroffact style but 
presented readers with thoughtful questions about how life should 
be lived 
in his most popular novel stranger in a strange land 
valentine michael smith is a human raised by martians smith 
challenged his home planets values with his own priorities 
including universal free love nudity and many sexual encounters 
he also discorporated or made disappear authority figures he 
felt were bad 
the book which became something of a text for the 
counterculture of the 1960s introduced grok heinleins word 
for intuitive understanding in that book heinlein also introduced 
the water bed 
in methuselahs children and later in other books character 
lazarus long provides more food for thought for instance on how 
to get help long says never appeal to a mans better nature he 
may not have one invoking his selfinterest gives you more 
leverage 
another heinlein invention now in common use worldwide is a 
device known as a waldo named for the principal character in 
the short story magic inc waldo who was handicapped 
invented remotecontrolled robot arms 
two years ago heinlein told writer eric hoffman that writers 
dont know how to retire 
the bottom line he said then is pay to the order of 
with the right figures in the blanks thats the most 
important measure of a writers work freelance writing is free 
enterprise 
heinlein won numerous awards for his novels and short stories 
and was popular with both children and adults and he was not at 
all ashamed that much of his work was for pulp magazines under 
his own name or pseudonyms 
they didnt want it good heinlein told the new york times 
in 1980 they wanted it wednesday 
heinlein won the best science fiction novel award from the world 
science fiction convention in 1956 1959 1961 and 1966 the nebula 
award from the science fiction writers of america in 1975 and an 
unprecedented four hugo awards in 1956 for double star in 
1959 for starship troopers in 1961 for stranger in a strange 
land and in 1966 for the moon is a harsh mistress 
other works include the green hills of earth and puppet 
masters 
heinlein is survived by his wife virginia whom he married in 
1948 the couple had no children

the defense has removed a minor obstacle to 
the review of classified documents in the irancontra conspiracy 
case according to a transcript of a closed court hearing released 
monday 
retired marine lt col oliver l north and former national 
security adviser john m poindexter and their lawyers will review a 
small group of ultrasensitive documents that government security 
officials were reluctant to show to arms dealers albert hakim and 
retired air force maj gen richard v secord 
gesell is allowing the defense to review the material to verify 
prosecution claims it is not relevant to charges that the four 
defendants conspired to illegally divert profits from the usiran 
arms sales to the nicaraguan contra rebels 
we dont want to be viewed as obstructing this process 
hakims lawyer n richard janis told us district judge gerhard a 
gesell according to the official court transcript of fridays 
closed hearing 
janis said he and secords lawyer james e sharp agreed to 
abide by the determination of the other defense lawyers that the 
documents are not relevant to the case 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh estimated that between 35 
and 70 pages of sensitive material not relevant to the case have 
been identified by his office and government security experts 
the defense concession does not dispose of the larger problem of 
disclosing sensitive information that may be determined to be 
relevant when the case goes to trial 
gesell issued an order monday giving walsh until may 30 to draw 
up a list of secret documents he wants to use as evidence that 
wont be declassified by the government 
under the classified information procedures act only the 
government can declassify documents before they are introduced into 
evidence if walsh is unable to persuade government agencies to 
declassify important evidence gesell could drop some or all of the 
charges 
no trial date has been set 
at a hearing two weeks ago walsh described some of the most 
sensitive documents in his possession as containing information 
about us intelligence and military planning the disclosure of 
some secrets could subject some people in the middle east to 
torture or death walsh had said apparently referring to hostages 
held there 
gesell has ruled that each defendant has the right to examine 
the classified material that walsh has deposited in a secure 
facility where the defense lawyers are sifting through a massive 
amount of classified documents compiled by the prosecution 
but government security officials have refused secord and hakim 
access because the material contains a small number of pages of 
ultrasensitive material 
hakim an iranianborn us citizen has never had a security 
clearance and secord has not had one since he left government 
several years ago 
an interdepartmental task force is reviewing some 300000 pages 
of classified material more than 105000 pages of documents have 
already been put in the secure room that was constructed by the 
justice department

lech walesa led a strike rally at the 
lenin shipyard monday and some 700 workers responded well win 
well win they shouted down a management offer and took their 
strike into its second week 
walesa who founded the independent union solidarity at the 
shipyard in the turbulent summer of 1980 told his comrades he 
still has a couple of beautiful cards to play 
in his speech before the workers were asked whether they wanted 
to continue striking walesa said i was afraid we were broken 
but the mood is changing people are coming back to the 
strike their wives are saying you cant abandon them 
at a prayer meeting in the morning walesa had told the 
strikers were in good shape those who wanted to leave are 
gone only the tough ones are here 
the solidarity founder a shipyard electrician who won the 1983 
nobel peace prize and strike committee leader alojzy szablewski 
spoke at the 45minute afternoon rally walesa 44 told the 
strikers last week he was too tired to lead the strike but would be 
the last to leave the shipyard 
strikers in poland customarily occupy the plants rather than 
leaving them 
szablewski said late monday that tadeusz goclowski the roman 
catholic bishop of gdansk was trying to get talks with management 
started again but there were no signs of resumption 
shipyard workers turned down the management offer of pay raises 
and reinstatement of some fired activists because it did not 
include a legally recognized chapter of solidarity the independent 
union first in the soviet bloc was suppressed and then outlawed 
after martial law was declared dec 13 1981 
state television reported the rejection of the management offer 
and said in an official commentary 
the hint of hope for a positive solution which we presented on 
saturday and sunday in our newscasts turned out to be illusory the 
organizers of the illegal strike are rejecting every initiative for 
a conciliatory and humanitarian settlement 
polands communist government has not ruled out ending the 
strike with force a predawn police raid last thursday crushed a 
10day strike by steel workers at nowa huta in southern poland 
workers at the 15000employee ursus tractor factory outside 
warsaw tried to mount a strike monday in sympathy with those at 
gdansks lenin shipyard but it fizzled 
opposition spokeswoman ewa milewicz said most of the tractor 
plants first shift refused to work and employees leaving the plant 
told a photographer at 2 pm the strike included about 1000 
people from three departments 
employees leaving later however reported only about 100 
strikers occupying a canteen and said they ended the protest by 9 
pm the official news agency pap denied there had been a strike 
western reporters who were at the 11000worker lenin shipyard 
late sunday said about 300 strikers remained their number appeared 
to have more than doubled by the time walesa spoke at midafternoon 
monday 
if i can find a way to win this strike ill have a second 
nobel in the pocket walesa said 
well win well win the workers shouted 
i have a couple of beautiful cards in my hands that i havent 
played yet walesa said 
rejection of the settlement offer came after talks that lasted 
more than four hours and ended soon after 8 am 
a morning rally ended with the crowd chanting there is no 
freedom without solidarity 
the second rally was held because the strike committee said it 
wanted the workers to give the matter more thought a mediator 
lawyer wladyslaw silanowicki also advised them to reconsider the 
proposal but the strikers again rejected it 
silanowicki said he had spoken several times with gen czeslaw 
kiszcaak the interior minister the lawyer said kiszcaak assured 
the workers they would not be prosecuted or fired for striking if 
they took the offer 
silanowicki said management had agreed to a joint commission of 
strike committee members and management to oversee implementation 
of the agreement management had rejected that point sunday 
management agreed to a 15000zloty 38 monthly pay raise but 
the total included some raises already promised and said 
solidarity activists fired after the imposition of martial law in 
1981 would be rehired as needed martial law was lifted later 
replaced with tough new regulations 
pay at the lenin shipyard averages 42000 zlotys 105 monthly 
kiszczak also promised the release of most political prisoners 
including some jailed since the strikes began two weeks ago 
silanowicki said 
ten western journalists were detained monday after leaving the 
shipyard held about 2 hours and released after polite

queen elizabeth ii presided monday at 
the opening of australias new parliament house which took nearly 
1 billion and eight years to build about 2000 aborigines 
protested outside 
the british queen called the building a crowning expression of 
australian faith in parliamentary democracy and noted that it 
replaces a provisional parliament building opened 61 years earlier 
by her father king george vi 
aboriginal activists and sympathizers began gathering at dawn to 
protest the proceedings and their number grew to about 2000 by the 
time the queen arrived 
chants of shame shame shame and we want land rights 
now virtually drowned out the national anthem advance 
australia fair during welcoming ceremonies attended by prime 
minister bob hawke and other dignitaries 
robyn dass an aboriginal activist said the new building is on 
a site sacred to the aborigines 
police said cables of the outdoor public address system were cut 
before the queen arrived but were restored about 10 minutes into 
the ceremony 
the opening of parliament house is a highlight of yearlong 
celebrations of the 200th anniversary of the european settlement of 
australia 
at a final cost of 11 billion 836 million us it also is 
the nations most expensive building there is enough concrete in 
it to build 25 replicas of sydneys landmark opera house

threeweek tour that was her 11th visit to the country as queen 
huge crowds welcomed her and her husband prince philip the 
aborigines turned their backs on the royal couple and sat down en 
masse

aboriginal girl left the crowd and thrust a bouquet of flowers into 
her hands 
she accepted the flowers wrapped in aboriginal ribbons of 
black red and gold but did not speak to the girl zena wickes 
in dedicating the bulding the queen said i rather doubt that 
the founding fathers of the australian federation could have 
foreseen that their work would be crowned by such a confident 
expression of australias faith in parliamentary democracy 
hawke paid tribute to australias indigenous people in his 
speech noting that they had lived in the area for 21000 years 
the aboriginal word canberra means meeting place

rival militias fought handtohand monday 
for control of shiite slums and rained shells on each others 
positions in the grim shantytowns despite syrian army orders to 
stop the four days of carnage 
police said 65 people were killed and 150 wounded monday 
bringing total casualties in the shiite territorial war to 154 dead 
and 367 wounded 
the thunder of shellfire rolled over the city all day and into 
the night gunmen atop racing ambulances fired into the air to 
clear traffic so the wounded could reach hospitals radio stations 
appealed for blood donations 
doctors confirmed allegations by both sides that wounded 
fighters were dragged from ambulances and hospitals and slaughtered 
by their rivals 
fighting began friday between the moderate militia amal which 
means hope and has syrias backing and the radical proiranian 
hezbollah or party of god 
syria has 25000 soldiers in lebanon about 7500 in beirut it 
is the main power broker after 13 years of civil war but is being 
challenged by iran which the syrians support in its 8yearold war 
with iraq 
the battle for control of beiruts southern slums where an 
estimated 250000 shiites live raised fears about the fate of 18 
foreign hostages they include nine americans and most are believed 
held by hezbollahaffiliated kidnappers in the 16squaremile 
shiite enclave 
late monday six committees each grouping a syrian officer an 
iranian embassy official a representative of amal and one from 
hezbollah were formed and charged with enforcing a ceasefire 
fighting eased as the committees drove into the slums but 
sporadic bursts of cannon and machinegun fire echoed in the region 
well into the night 
lebanons 12 million shiites are its largest sect with syrias 
blessing amal crushed hezbollah last month in predominantly shiite 
south lebanon the fourday battle cost 62 lives and 150 people 
were wounded 
among mondays victims were three amal militiamen killed with 
axes their bodies were taken to beiruts american university 
hospital officials there said it was full to capacity and could 
not handle more casualties 
an amal spokesman said privately the three were axed to death 
after they were taken prisoner by hezbollah 
brig gen ghazi kenaan syrian military intelligence chief in 
lebanon said he told both factions to stop fighting 
it is impermissible to let the current state of affairs 
continue he told reporters after meetings with government 
religious and militia leaders 
asked whether syrian troops would intervene he said we hope 
it wont come to that but we shall not allow the bloodshed to 
continue 
syria moved 7500 soldiers into moslem west beirut in february 
1987 to end a monthslong power struggle between amal led by 
justice minister nabih berri and walid jumblatts druse militia 
senior moslem clerics urged syria to repeat in the southern 
slums the successful west beirut experiment of the past year 
gun battles were reported in alsahel hospital a doctor said 
some militiamen forced surgeons at gunpoint to operate on dead 
comrades to bring them to life 
an american university hospital employee said we take only 
victims needing emergency surgery then send them to recuperate 
at inadequately equipped clinics in druseheld mountains outside 
beirut 
police said hezbollah fighters wearing red headbands appeared 
to have gained ground monday in the densely populated ghobeiri bir 
elabed hay madi and mesharafieh districts 
amals fighters whose headbands are green or black control 
most of haret hreik mreiji roweiss shiyah and kasskass a police 
spokesman said 
hezbollah has established control over half of the slums he 
said it only controlled onethird before the current fighting 
the spokesman whose name cannot be used because of regulations 
said amal had an advantage because it and the syrians control 
entrances to the slums 
this is amals trump card he said it can move in 
supplies and reinforcements from several other areas at will while 
hezbollah cannot get a fly in or out 
an amal fighter in the shiyah district tarek saad aimed his 
shoulderfired rocket launcher toward hay madi and said to 
reporters god willing we will liberate hay madi and bir elabed 
and free all the foreign hostages we know they are imprisoned 
there 
there has been no word on the hostages since the fighting began 
police said about half the slum residents had fled to west 
beirut camping on sidewalks or taking refuge in mosques sports 
stadiums or schools 
ahmed kurdi an associated press photo technician was trapped 
with his wife and six children friday in a shelter in bir elabed 
but escaped monday 
shells rained nonstop around us he said kids screamed 
and there was no way to comfort them or feed them 
when fighting abated for a short time monday kurdi said i 
told my wife this is our chance to get out we did dodging 
sniper fire as we ran out of bir elabed

his longtime friend e robert wallach about wedtech came to 
thenwhite house counselor meese in 1982 as well as in 1981 the 
white house policy barring contact by white house staff with 
procurement officers about a contract in which a friend has a

and sealed off the temple police said at least five people were 
killed and five others wounded 
witnesses said the fighting continued late monday 
militants began shooting from the golden temple after they 
spotted officers inspecting their positions from outside the 
temple security forces fired back with light machine guns said 
baldev singh superintendent of police in amritsar 
sikh radicals have used the complex as a haven before in june 
1984 the army raided it more than 1200 people mostly sikhs 
were killed

assassinated by two of her sikh bodyguards setting off antisikh 
riots in which more than 2000 people were killed

civilians and three suspected militants were seen lying in and near

80yearold sikh later died in a hospital

district of amritsar to keep civilians indoors

nation in the northern agricultural province of punjab and 
thousands of people have been killedsikhs make up less than 2

president reagan was quoted monday as telling 
a luncheon guest that donald t regans tellall book was a bunch 
of falsehoods and the white house denounced it as a breach of 
confidence 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater refused to say whether 
astrology was used to determine the presidents schedule but said 
first lady nancy reagan would continue to consult an astrologer and 
said she has that right 
as regans new insider account went on sale syndicated 
columnist carl rowan who had lunch with reagan on monday quoted 
the president as calling the book by his former chief of staff a 
bunch of falsehoods and saying ill be damned if ill just 
stand by and let them railroad my wife 
he claims for example that mrs reagan never asked him to 
fire former cia director william j casey rowan said of his 
conversation with reagan he says mrs reagan didnt fire regan 
he says regan got ticked off when somebody leaked the story 
that howard baker was going to replace him as chief of staff 
regan was ousted as white house chief of staff in early 1987 
reportedly at the urging of mrs reagan among others 
rowan in an interview on wusatv in washington also said the 
president told him a threemonth period of inactivity following his 
july 1985 colon cancer surgery had nothing to with astrology 
as maintained in the book 
he said reagan told him mrs reagan was only trying to get 
regan to honor what the doctors had put on paper and said the 
president could or couldnt do 
he said she was very upset and had said to him that she feared 
that she had brought all this down on his head and he had told 
her no honey i brought all this down on your head by taking 
this job rowan quoted reagan as saying 
fitzwater meanwhile repeatedly sidestepped requests to say 
whether mrs reagans stargazing has had any connection with her 
husbands public outings 
every first lady since martha washington has had a role in the 
presidency fitzwater said and i dont think anyone denies a 
role of a wife and her husband but im not going to try to 
characterize any specific responsibilities 
the new book by donald regan is a kissandtell story in the 
mold of all books that seek to exploit the presidency or the first 
family for personal selfinterest fitzwater said 
regans book for the record depicted a passive president 
unduly influenced by his wife on many matters including the 
scheduling of public appearances regan suggested that mrs 
reagans interference in scheduling harmed her husbands presidency 
at times 
fitzwater said reagan feels deep personal disappointment with 
this breach of confidence mrs reagan was quoted by her press 
secretary as saying i was taken aback by the vengefulness of the 
attack it comes through to me that don regan doesnt really like 
me 
asked about a weekend white house statement labeling his book as 
a product of vindictiveness and revenge regan responded in an 
nbctv interview they ought to know it when they see it 
white house officials have acknowledged mrs reagans interest 
in astrology which it said was heightened in the aftermath of the 
march 30 1981 assassination attempt on reagan 
but the officials never have conceded that astrology was a 
factor in setting reagans schedule as regan alleges in his book 
as some contents of the book became public late last week 
reagan emphatically denied that astrology played any role in policy 
decisions 
at the conclusion of a rose garden ceremony monday honoring 
small business executives reagan was asked whether astrology 
played any role in the making of his schedule 
it cant because it never has reagan said 
fitzwater quickly told reporters the president had misunderstood 
the question and had thought he was being asked the more general 
question of astrologys role in policy decisions 
reagans answer the spokesman said should be taken as a 
reiteration of the presidents statement of last friday in which 
reagan denied using stargazing in the decisionmaking process 
earlier fitzwater was pressed during a news briefing to say 
whether astrology still plays a role in deciding the presidents 
schedule and public appearances 
both fitzwater and elaine crispen the first ladys press 
secretary said mrs reagan will continue to consult with an 
astrologist who has been identified as san francisco socialite 
joan quiqley 
she doesnt plan to stop talking to her mrs crispen said 
she said these conversations will take place on an asneeded 
basis its not a daily weekly type of thing 
an administration official discussing the atmosphere at the 
white house on grounds he remain unidentified said im not 
noticing any disruptions as a result of the furor over the regan 
book 
fitzwater denied that the brouhaha was adversely affecting 
reagans ability to perform 
the presidents management style and his personal methods of 
leadership and management have been discussed in any number of 
forums the spokesman said the bottom line is that they work 
fitzwaters predecessor larry speakes who touched off a furor 
with his earlier book acknowledging that he had fabricated quotes 
in reagans name said monday he had some qualms about the newest 
revelations 
whos to say his style isnt the best speakes said in a 
cable news network interview he had a good grip on the 
presidency he managed it just right and it worked well with one 
notable exception irancontra 
fitzwater repeatedly suggested that reporters were blowing the 
stargazing matter out of proportion 
why does every newspaper in america carry a horoscope does 
every editor and publisher think its unwieldy as a personal 
comfort millions of people look to astrology fitzwater said 
the rev jerry falwell a staunch reagan political supporter 
expressed dismay over the allegations in the regan book 
im sincerely hopeful that mr regan was exaggerating or 
misstating the facts falwell said in a statement issued by his 
office 
as one who believes in god as the creator of the universe it 
is incomprehensible to me to think of consulting the stars rather 
than their maker he said a belief in god and a belief in 
astrology cannot be reconciled

argentinas mostwanted military 
fugitive cashiered army gen carlos suarez mason came home in 
handcuffs monday to face 39 murder charges linked to argentinas 
dirty war against leftists 
extradited by a us district court in california the balding 
stocky exgeneral arrived aboard a regular flight of aerolineas 
argentinas the argentine airline from new york 
the plane was stopped 300 yards from the airport terminal and 
suarez mason dressed in grey slacks a sweater and white tennis 
shoes was removed and placed aboard an armored prisonertransport 
vehicle 
escorted by three police cars an armored car and an ambulance 
the exgeneral was taken first to federal police headquarters in 
downtown buenos aires then removed to a special topsecurity jail 
and finally placed in a small cell reserved for prisoners facing 
trial at the somber federal court building 
federal prosecutor luis moreno ocampo said suarez mason 64 
would be held in isolation there until questioning later this 
week by federal judges 
we also have to wait for the official translation of the 
sentence dictated by us judge lowell jensen who ordered suarez 
masons extradition on april 27 after 15 months of hearings in san 
francisco moreno ocampo said 
he said i am going to request a life sentence the 
maximum and he will be sentenced to life 
moreno ocampo predicted the trial could begin in late july or 
the beginning of august 
jensen ruled that suarz mason who fled argentina in 1984 and 
was arrested by us marshals in january 1987 in a san francicco 
suburb could be tried in argentina on charges of 39 murders 
allegedly conducted by troops under his command 
argentina supporting its case with 1600 pages of documents 
had sought suarez masons extradition on 43 charges of murder as 
well as other crimes he had been accused in argentina in 635 
separate cases of human rights violations as well as 
misappropriation of more than 2 million in government funds 
the us judge rejected four of the murder charges ruling that 
identification of the victims was inadequate approved a charge of 
forging a passport renewal and also rejected 23 kidnapping 
charges saying the fiveyear legal deadline for filing the charges 
had expired in 1984 
under extradition law suarez mason can be tried only on charges 
for which extradition was approved 
suarez masons trial had been personally ordered by president 
raul alfonsin shortly after the civilian president took office in 
december 1983 ending nearly eight years of rightist military rule 
the former commander of the buenos airesbased 1st army corps 
was stripped of rank and pension in april 1984 after being 
declared in rebellion for ignoring repeated summonses to appear 
for questioning in connection with the abduction torture and 
murder of suspected leftists in the late 1970s 
a governmentappointed commission has reported that at least 
9000 argentines disappeared in the dirty war against leftist 
subversives waged by the armed forces regime that seized power in 
1976 after ousting former president isabel peron 
from 1976 to 1978 suarez mason commanded the 1st corps in 
whose area more than half of the disappearances took place then he 
was named head of the joint chief of staff 
when he retired in 1981 he was named president of the huge 
state oil monopoly yacimientos petroliferos fiscales a post he 
held until 1982 
the misappropriation of government funds charge is linked to 
suarez masons period as head of the oil company 
in other trials ordered by alfonsin five former ruling junta 
members including two expresidents were convicted in december 
1985 of human rights offenses and sentenced to prison terms ranging 
from life to four years they now are serving their terms at a 
military prison 
the argentine congress last may approved a socalled law of 
due obedience which absolved most of the more than 300 military 
officers from trial on rights abuse charges on grounds that they 
were following orders from superiors the law did not absolve 
highranking officers who directed the antisubversive campaign

the former fiancee of a sailor carrying the 
aids virus testified monday that she filed an aidsrelated assault 
charge against him to protect other women he might date 
jeannine elmer 28 said she learned of his test results only 
one or two days after having sex with petty officer 2nd class john 
e crawford she told the judge and jury at crawfords 
courtmartial that she worried that he might have sex with someone 
else without telling them about the test 
what i went through what im going through i dont want 
any female to go through elmer said in the first day of 
crawfords trial 
the aidsassault trial is a first of its kind for the navy

elmer also said that since the encounter in april 1987 she had 
tested negative three times for hiv antibodies crawford tested 
positive in march 1987 for hiv human immunodeficiency virus the 
virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
scientists do not know if everyone infected by the virus 
eventually will develop the incurable ailment which destroys the 
bodys ability to fight off disease 
crawford has said the test result surprised him because he does 
not consider himself to be in any of the highrisk groups normally 
associated with aids 
he could be stripped of rank dishonorably discharged and 
sentenced to up to a decade behind bars if found guilty of the 
charges which include adultery or wrongfully having sexual 
intercourse with a married woman not his wife elmer was 
separated from her third husband when she was dating crawford 
the trial at the navys treasure island facility is expected to 
last three days 
the 27yearold sailor denies the charges saying that he wore a 
condom during sex and that elmer knew he had tested positive for 
the hiv virus he claims her charges are based on jealousy 
elmer testified that she confronted crawford about his test 
results about a week after she learned about his condition from a 
mutual friend 
i asked him why did he take me to bed with him if he knew 
she said he said im sorry i dont know why 
elmer said that she told crawford she loved him and wanted to 
take care of him and that he then proposed to her however she 
said crawford ended their engagement about two weeks later 
elmer was composed as she testified before the judge capt rm 
mollison and the sevenmember jury however she heatedly denied a 
suggestion that she brought the charge to avenge herself after 
crawford broke off their brief engagement 
crawford a magnolia ark native lives offbase with another 
woman to whom he has been engaged for six months 
lt cmdr george farrar a navy spokesman at the treasure island 
naval station where the trial is being held said the case was the 
first of its kind in the navy an army private is charged in 
another aidsrelated assault case and his courtmartial is set to 
resume on wednesday in fort huachuca ariz

foreign minister shimon peres of israel 
said monday the soviet union and sovietbloc countries could play 
an increasing role in the search for peace in the middle east 
he came to madrid to attend a meeting of the council of the 
socialist international after stopping off in italy on his flight 
from hungary on monday 
his weekend visit to hungary was unexpected and was the first by 
a top israeli official to that communist state 
peres told reporters in madrid the position of the soviet bloc 
is becoming more and more important in the peace process 
he met in budapest sunday with prime minister karoly grosz 
foreign minister peter varkonyi and janos berecz secretary of the 
hungarian communist partys central committee 
an official at the israeli embassy in madrid who spoke on 
condition of anonymity said it would not be surprising for 
peres to hold talks with soviet observers attending the socialist 
international meeting 
peres and foreign minister guilo andreotti of italy discussed 
the mideast situation in a 50minute meeting at the military 
airport in milan 
the two also discussed the arab uprising in the israelioccupied 
west bank and gaza strip 
they later met briefly with reporters andreotti said italy 
supports the idea of an international middle east peace conference 
he also said that while italy maintains friendly ties with israel 
it supports the palestinian cause 
yossi beilin directorgeneral of israels foreign ministry 
accompanied peres to hungary beilin said upon his return to 
jerusalem monday that hungary is interested in expanding its 
economic ties with the jewish state 
hungary along with all other sovietbloc countries except 
romania cut diplomatic ties with israel following the 1967 middle 
east war but last year the two countries established lowlevel 
diplomatic relations 
israels foreign ministry said in jerusalem without elaboration 
that the peres party and the hungarian leaders discussed the middle 
east conflict and hungarianisraeli ties including economic issues 
and tourism 
i think that this visit conducted upon hungarys initiative 
raises our bilateral ties to another level beilin said on israel 
television 
but he did not predict a full renewal of diplomatic ties 
peres said in madrid that the visit of us secretary of state 
george shultz to the middle east in june is positive for the 
peace process but its significance depends on the outcome of the 
may 27 summit between president reagan and soviet leader mikhail 
gorbachev in moscow 
peres head of israels socialist labor party is to leave 
wednesday for a working trip to washington that will include talks 
with shultz

gov richard bryan formally sought 
federal disaster aid monday for a community battered by a fuel 
plant explosion while a funeral was held for one of two plant 
executives killed in last weeks massive blasts 
classes resume in 11 of the 12 schools damaged wednesday in the 
series of thunderous explosions which are estimated to have caused 
nearly 73 million in damage 
the blasts injured 326 people and destroyed nearly 3 million 
pounds of the ammonium perchlorate oxidizer manufactured for the 
air forces titan missile program 
company counsel keith rooker said his firm has been the sole 
supplier to the titan rocket program since its inception over 20 
years ago and has been the principal supplier to the space shuttle 
program 
bryan asked for a federal disaster declaration in a letter to 
president reagan outlining the destruction caused by explosions at 
the pacific engineering and production co ammonium perchlorate 
plant 
bob king the state director of emergency management said the 
estimate included 545 million in damage to more than 8000 homes 
surrounding the plant and 174 million for the two plants and 
other businesses 
verne paule a federal emergency management agency spokesman in 
san francisco said a disaster declaration might not be warranted 
because an estimated 90 percent of the damage was covered by 
private insurance 
seven investigators have been assigned to analyze videotapes and 
still photographs taken of the explosions along with evidence from 
the debris said clark county fire department spokesman bob 
leinbach 
basically were taking things very gingerly said leinbach 
were concerned about life safety we want to make sure what we 
touch and move is the right thing to do 
a funeral was held monday for plant manager bruce halker whose 
body was found 25 yards from the front entrance to the plant 
another executive company controller roy westerfield was 
killed but his body has not been found 
company officials are scheduled to meet with department of 
defense and nasa officials sometime this week in washington where 
they will seek emergency help in rebuilding the plant at a site 
outside the las vegas valley 
a second ammonium perchlorate plant remained closed monday while 
its owners the kerrmcgee corp wait to see what caused the 
pacific engineering explosions the plant the only other in the 
country to produce the chemical is about a mile from the 
demolished plant

president reagan on monday ruled out the 
possibility of pardons before trial for any of the defendants in 
the irancontra case according to a columnist who had lunch with 
the president 
in addition reagan said he may not have to face that issue 
at all if the trial isnt concluded before his term ends 
syndicated columnist carl rowan said 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater has said the president 
has refused to discuss the issue of pardons in the past 
rowan reported on the presidents comments during an interview 
on wusatv in washington on monday evening 
the president said he didnt believe in giving pardons before 
people are convicted of anything rowan related adding that 
reagan reasoned it leaves the cloud of guilt on through the 
years 
rowan noted that reagan left the door open for pardons after the 
trial but given the delays in the start of the trial reagan said 
i wont have to face that issue 
at issue is whether reagan will consider either pretrial or 
posttrial pardons of his former national security adviser john m 
poindexter oliver l north a former national security council 
staffer retired air force maj gen richard v secord and his 
business partner albert hakim 
the four are charged with conspiring to illegally divert profits 
from the usiran arms sales to the nicaraguan contra rebels 
fitzwater said last month i have raised the issue with the 
president four or five times myself ive heard it raised by 
others and every time the president says the same thing which is 
im not discussing pardons 
white house chief of staff howard baker has said i think the 
president made it abundantly clear that he expects the legal 
process to run its course

matriarch vickie singer innocent of one count of attempted murder 
of fbi agents and two firearms charges including possession of a 
sawedoff shotgun she was convicted on five counts 
on the charges of attempted murder against the other three the 
jury returned guilty verdicts in the seconddegree meaning the 
panel did not find the crimes premeditated 
us district judge bruce jenkins scheduled sentencing july 1 
the siege at the clans farm in marion by 100 lawmen ended in a 
shootout jan 28 that killed state corrections lt fred house and 
injured clan leader addam swapp 
swapp 27 was found guilty of maliciously damaging the church 
building attempting to kill fbi agents assaulting resisting 
impeding intimidating and interfering with federal agents and 
possession of an unregistered bomb 
he also was found guilty of a corollary charge of use of a bomb 
on the malicious damage count and two counts of use of a firearm 
linked to the assault and attempted murder charges 
the jury found mrs singer 45 guilty of the same charges with 
the exception of the attempted murder charge and the corollary 
firearms charge 
swapps brother jonathan swapp 21 and mrs singers son john 
timothy singer 21 were found guilty of assaultresistance and 
attempted murder charges and the two accompanying firearms counts 
weve already won the victory addam swapp shouted to 
reporters as he was led into court but there was little 
discernible reaction when the verdicts were read 
we were very pleased and satisfied said assistant us 
attorney richard lambert 
the maximum penalty for attempting to kill federal agents is 20 
years 10 years for bombing the chapel the corollary firearms and 
useofabomb charges carry minimummandatory fiveyear penalties 
assaulting federal agents and possession of a bomb each carry 
maximum 10year prison terms 
jury deliberations began wednesday afternoon 
prosecutors called 67 witnesses while the defense called only 
three witnesses including the buckskinclad addam swapp who 
tearfully and defiantly defended the clans actions 
addam swapp admitted he bombed the kamas stake center on jan 16 
with 87 sticks of dynamite but insisted he never fired at any of 
the authorities who surrounded the 2acre farm in a standoff often 
punctuated with gunfire 
no charges have been filed in houses death which authorities 
have linked to the wheelchairbound john timothy singer but 
assistant attorney general creighton horton iii said his office 
intends next week to file state murder charges against an 
unspecified number of the defendants 
the governments final word in the case came wednesday as us 
attorney brent ward denounced the clan as a band of outlaws who 
committed the crimes in the name of religion 
trust in the lord but pass me my m1 rifle ward said of 
addam swapp 
while admitting that mrs singer my not have directly 
participated in crimes prosecutors charged her with the most 
counts alleging her aiding and abetting of family members made her 
just as culpable 
she wasnt exactly sitting back in a rocking chair in her 
bedroom crocheting and reading scriptures ward said 
clan members maintained the bombing and standoff were ordered by 
god as a sign of the impending collapse of church state and 
nation but also were intended to draw attention to the 1979 
slaying of polygamist patriarch john singer mrs singers husband 
and swapps fatherinlaw 
singer was shot following an 18day standoff at the same farm by 
authorities trying to arrest him on warrants stemming from his 
refusal to send his children to public schools and his defiance of 
a court order that he relinquish the children of his second wife to 
their father 
the family contended singer was murdered in a churchstate 
conspiracy 
i guess you could say it started back in 1973 when john singer 
took his children out of public schools addam swapp testified

pope john paul ii began a tour of south 
americas poorest country monday with an appeal to its people not 
to lose hope 
i will spend five days among you sharing your aspirations 
seeing firsthand this nation stricken by poverty and a lack of 
development and resources he said in an arrival speech at the la 
paz airport which is 13150 feet above sea level and ringed by 
snowcapped andean peaks 
president victor paz estenssoro said in a welcoming speech the 
visit would help bolster the flagging spirits of bolivians 
you come at a time when bolivia is suffering bitter tests that 
could weaken its spirit or perhaps sink it into a state of 
desperation the 80yearold president said 
he said technological and scientific advances had heightened 
aspirations of the third world without providing the means to 
fulfill them the bolivian people have perhaps been more harshly 
punished than most in this respect he said 
thousands of people including many peasants in colorful indian 
dress and traditional bowler hats greeted the roman catholic 
leader at the airport he arrived from uruguay on a boeing 727 of 
the state airline lloyd aereo boliviano at 516 pm 
the pontiff a skier spoke in a strong voice and showed no 
outward signs of being affected by altitude sickness which 
bolivians call sorocche la paz is the worlds highest capital 
and the altitude makes many visitors uncomfortable if not ill 
however in a meeting with bolivias 39 bishops at the end of 
the day the pope seemed to be wearying bishop julio terrazas 
head of the local episcopal conference did not deliver a prepared 
speech to the pontiff because we see that the pope is tired 
i believe these words have no place right now because of the 
weariness that your first day here has caused to the holy father 
terrazas said to the pope he instead handed the pope a copy of the 
speech 
in the text of terrazas speech he told the pope bolivia 
suffers from a situation of injustice that consumes thousands of 
brothers in degrading misery and inhumane unemployment to this are 
added other ills such as delinquency immorality and drug 
trafficking and other social calamaities that constitute a 
devastating scourge to the very being of our people 
the pope was spending the night in the papal nuncios residence 
dealers in compressed oxygen said church officials rented 
several tanks and facemasks for use if needed by the papal 
entourage 
to review the military honor guard and groups of whitesmocked 
schoolgirls at the airport the pope rode in a green army jeep 
rather than taking the long walk 
from the airport the papal caravan descended to la paz which is 
11930 feet above the sea in a mountain ravine 
the vehicles moved down a cliffside highway that was lined by 
tens of thousands of people crowds cheered and waved banners of 
yellow and white the vatican colors and the yellow red and green 
bolivian flag 
peasant shacks perched precariously on the mountainsides were 
brilliant white freshly painted by their owners the city 
government offered special tax incentives to those who painted 
their homes 
john paul standing in the glass booth of the popemobile 
traveled 11 miles through the city center to the papal nuncios 
residence where he is staying 
he will spend five days in bolivia the second and longest stop 
on his fournation tour which began friday in uruguay and will 
include visits to peru and paraguay he returns to rome on may 18 
the pontiff will visit seven bolivian cities ranging from the 
tin mining center of oruro devastated by mine closures to the 
lowland boom town of santa cruz a center of cattle ranching 
agriculture and cocaine trafficking 
government austerity measures eliminated an annual inflation 
rate of 20000 percent in bolivia but they caused serious labor 
unrest because of mass layoffs the country is also a major source 
of coca leaves the raw material for cocaine 
this visit is the popes tour ninth to latin america since he 
became head of the 860millionmember roman catholic church nearly 
10 years ago he has made 37 pilgrimages abroad from the vatican 
john paul is scheduled to spend his 68th birthday in paraguay on 
may 18

ask the state supreme court which is the final judge of hills 
conduct to overturn the findings by the sevenmember conduct board 
the board said in a report to the supreme court that serious 
violations of the code of judicial conduct were committed by 
justice hill and found the entire judicial system is still 
suffering from the fallout of his misconduct 
the board made no specific recommendation of discipline leaving 
it up to the supreme court to determine whether hill should be 
reprimanded or forbidden from coming out of retirement to hear 
cases 
hill who turns 71 on tuesday retired from the supreme court 
last year a few months after the misconduct charges were filed in 
january 1987 against him and two other justices 
the charges against justice ernest gibson iii were dropped and 
justice thomas hayes died 
meanwhile the scandal worsened a backlog in the states highest 
court as the justices refused gov madeleine kunins request that 
they step aside and instead disqualified themselves from hundreds 
of cases involving people connected with their case 
all three justices were originally accused of improperly using 
their clout on the court to advance the interests of wheel who was 
then an assistant judge in chittenden county 
a court employee testified that wheel had been seen with her 
arms around hill but hill and wheel testified they were not close 
and did not have an affair hill described the relationship as 
collegial 
the judicial conduct board ruled that hill presided over cases 
involving wheel when he should not have and that he improperly 
helped her 
the board found hill innocent of many of the misconduct charges 
dealing directly with the wheel relationship but two members filed 
a dissent arguing that a significant relationship did exist 
marks said his interpretation was that the board felt there was 
an appearance of wrongdoing but no real wrongdoing 
wheel who lost her reelection bid in 1986 has been convicted 
in a separate criminal case stemming from allegations that she 
billed the state for days she did not work she has yet to be 
sentenced

i have 29 percent he said of cumulative popular votes won by 
both candidates an associated press tabulation gives frontrunner 
michael dukakis 37 percent of the primary vote won to date and 
jackson 28 percent 
were within striking distance west virginia you can make a 
difference were winning every day and when i win you win he 
said 
at several stops in west virginia jackson tailored his talk to 
the economically depressed region he called west virginia a 
state of extremes good minds reduced opportunity

awry he said i call for fairness fair wages for workers 
fair prices for farmers fair taxes for the rich and the powerful

onelane roads to visit the minden elementary school located not 
far from an abandoned pcb dump that the federal environmental 
protection agency estimates will cost 21 million to clean up

environmental violence that government particularly the reagan

time in the state could help him at the polls tuesday the 
democratic candidate who spends the most time in nebraska 
traditionally does well in the presidential primary in the mostly 
republican state 
jackson insisted he could still win the battle for the 
nomination 
i have the longest legs the strongest legs as the days

william j bennett a scourge of school 
bureaucrats teacher unions and slipshod standards during 3 years 
as secretary of education said monday he will resign his cabinet 
post in midseptember to return to private life 
the department of education made the announcement after bennett 
met privately with president reagan at the white house and then 
informed his senior staff of his departure plans 
bennett told the staff he had recommended that linus wright the 
undersecretary of education and a former superintendent of schools 
in dallas succeed him 
bennett told education reporters last month he probably would 
not stay for the final few months of the reagan administration 
in somewhat uncharacteristic fashion he refused to take calls 
from reporters monday to discuss his plans which include hitting 
the lecture circuit and writing a book spelling out his vision for 
improving americas schools and colleges 
his spokesman loye miller read this terse statement 
secretary bennett met today with the president and 
subsequently with education department staff to say that he intends 
to leave his position in midseptember he expressed his gratitude 
to president reagan for the opportunity to serve in his cabinet 
the secretary reiterated to his staff his intention to continue at 
full speed ahead during the next few months 
bennett plans to issue two new reports on a model elementary 
school curriculum and on improving colleges before he steps down 
said bill kristol his chief of staff the college book will try 
to shed some light on the black box of higher education with 
practical advice for parents policymakers and others he said 
bennett made headlines throughout his tenure with acerbic 
criticisms of teacher unions the blob of school bureaucracy 
the greed of colleges raising tuitions twice as fast as 
inflation and the jim crow math and backofthebus science 
meted out to black children in ghetto schools he called chicagos 
schools the nations worst and said that system was in an 
educational meltdown 
the national education association said in a statement monday 
that it wishes bennett well and and expressed hope that the next 
secretary of education will use the power of the office to be a 
positive force in support of public education 
the nation needs a secretary of education who will work 
cooperatively with parents teachers school administrators 
college faculty and the community at large the nea statement 
said 
two weeks ago in a report called american education making 
it work bennett warned that the public has little to show for 
five years of school reform the schools are slightly improved 
he said but we are certainly not doing well enough and we are 
not doing well enough fast enough 
he called for using the us military to wage war against drug 
traffickers and quarreled with the surgeon general over what to 
teach children about aids and condoms 
his penchant for controversy was evident from his first news 
conference in 1985 when he suggested that college students cope 
with aid cuts through stereo divestiture automobile divestiture 
threeweeksatthebeach divestiture 
the remark drew howls from outraged college administrators and 
tongueincheek ripostes from collegians on spring break in fort 
lauderdale fla 
bennett 44 championed what he called the three cs of 
education choice character and content 
he failed to convince congress to offer poor parents vouchers to 
buy remedial education at either public or private schools but his 
criticism of bilingual education led congress to ease restrictions 
on aid for englishimmersion programs 
he argued strenuously that teachers had a duty to impart strong 
morals to their students 
and as with his attack on jim crow math he insisted that 
tough unyielding standards such as those he outlined in a model 
curriculum called james madison high school were essential 
for all children he said the civil rights challenge of the 1990s 
was to ensure equal intellectual opportunity in school 
he was an unapologetic defender of reagan efforts to slash the 
federal education budget arguing that more money did not guarantee 
better results and that state and local school budgets were rising 
inexorably anyway 
bennett has been a peripatetic cabinet officer visiting nearly 
100 elementary and secondary schools he has also proven a big draw 
as an afterdinner speaker on the republican fundraising circuit 
bennett who switched from the democratic to the republican 
party two years ago has spoken at 63 gop functions in the past 
three years according to the trade publication education week 
there has been speculation that bennett may eventually run for 
office possibly from his adopted state of north carolina

soviet journalists debated the meaning 
and the future of glasnost with their western colleagues monday at 
the international press institutes annual meeting 
this was the first ipi general assembly attended by soviet and 
chinese representatives about 400 publishers and editors from 43 
countries are taking part in the ipi assembly 
alexander pumpyansky editor in chief of the soviet weekly novoe 
vremia described soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs policy of 
glasnost or greater openness on certain issues in soviet society 
as realism seeing the world as it is not in ideological 
dogmas 
delegates laughed and applauded when he added it is like in 
the fairy tale when the little child says the king has no clothes 
or badly dressed if dressed in a soviet suit 
conor cruise obrien of dublin university in ireland said forces 
exist in the soviet union that want to reduce the substance of 
glasnost 
he said the policy would have a better chance for success if 
confined to the soviet union developments in other warsaw pact 
countries could prove to be the achilles heel of glasnost 
letting loose revolutionary forces obrien stated 
there are ominous signs in poland he said 
pierro ottone of italys la repubblica said glasnost should be 
viewed as the instrument of a power struggle in the soviet union as 
a new class wants to get rid of the old mentality in search of a 
pragmatic solution to soviet problems 
there could be unpredictable consequences of this struggle 
ottone said he said it could let loose tensions not only in the 
other warsaw pact countries but in the soviet union as well citing 
recent armenian unrest as an example 
in mondays opening ceremony of the general assembly ipi 
officials demanded a lifting of restrictions on the press in turkey 
ipi president peter galliner said turkey had made significant 
progress in restoring democracy since the return to civilian rule 
in 1983 
but he said a constant threat to the news media exists from 
legislation providing for prosecution and imprisonment of 
journalists and hefty fines for publications deemed pornographic 
the publishers and editors of two mens magazines playboy 
turkey and bravo were fined a total of 750000 on dec10 
the fines have not yet been paid and the government has 
announced plans for legislation to substantially reduce the fines 
galliner also noted that stateproduced newsprint prices have 
gone up 200 percent in the past 16 months 
he and juan luis cebrian ipi board chairman appealed for an 
amnesty for political prisoners jailed during military rule in 
turkey and an end to prosecution of journalists for what they write 
the ipi an independent organization with offices in london and 
zurich represents 2000 publishers and editors in more than 60 
countries and is dedicated to defending press freedom 
the turkish military took over in 1980 following widespread 
political violence which claimed 5000 lives in the three years 
prior to the coup the generals relinquished power after 1983 
general elections won by the motherland party of premier turgut 
ozal 
since return to civilian rule no journalists have been 
imprisoned but several are on trial on charges of insulting the 
president or the premier or dealing with taboo subjects such as the 
problem of the kurdish minority 
ozal defended his pricing policies saying state subsidies 
including those on newsprint were lifted as part of his program to 
establish a freemarket economy in turkey 
he conceded that a chief function of the press is criticism of 
the government but complained that a pervasive pessimism is 
spreading through the society because of too much negative news 
ozal without citing specific examples told the delegates that 
in turkey people are shying away from a political career 
because of invasion of privacy 
the premier recommended a peaceful approach in covering foreign 
news so not to fan hostilities among nations especially with 
neighbors 
on the agenda for the threeday meeting are among other topics 
problems on reporting from islamic countries protection of privacy 
and the future of unesco

of the breakout by the three escapees all of whom were serving 
life sentences without chance of parole

reputed mob boss nicodemo little nicky scarfo and eight 
associates monday after hearing the prosecutor defend her two key 
witnesses in the murder case

albert sabo on tuesday morning to continue deliberations

boss and that scarfo organization eliminated problems and 
dissension by simple execution

driven in a van across the delaware river and dumped along a road

their closing arguments 
when are delgiorno and caramandi telling the truth and when 
are they lying simone asked we have to guess and you cant

shop you would have evidence blood something

that the murderers were caramandi and delgiorno

was convicted last year of trying to extort 1 million from a 
developer

a study of schizophrenics brains suggests a 
possible answer to a decadesold mystery about an abnormality 
associated with the illness a researcher said monday 
brain scans of 17 living patients pinpointed a site of a 
reduction in brain tissue that apparently produces enlargement of 
normal brain cavities said richard suddath of the national 
institute of mental health 
the enlargement of the fluidfiled spaces called ventricles 
had been observed since the 1930s but nobody has known which part 
of the brain produces it he said 
failure of part of the brain to develop or shrinkage could 
produce the enlargement he said 
if the new finding is confirmed it points the way to an 
anatomical target for further study of schizophrenia he said 
suddath spoke to reporters at the annual meeting of the american 
psychiatric association he did the work with colleagues at the 
mental health institute 
the brain scans using a technique called magnetic resonance 
imaging found an average of a 20 percent reduction in the gray 
matter of the temporal lobes compared with the volume found in 17 
normal people of similar age and size 
the temporal lobes lie beneath the temples on each side of the 
head 
the less temporal lobe gray matter a patient had the larger his 
lateral ventricles tended to be implicating that tissue was at 
least part of the explanation for enlargement of the ventricles 
suddath said 
researchers do not know when the reduction in gray matter 
appears in comparison to when schizophrenia appears he said it 
may be a failure of the tisue to develop before birth or around the 
time of birth he said 
daniel freedman director of the division of adult psychiatry at 
the university of california los angeles neuropsychiatric 
institute noted that the study included few patients 
its too soon to say whether it will pay off in better 
diagnosis or predicting response to treatment he said 
but it is a promising start in using magnetic resonance 
imaging to seek clues to brain abnormalities in schizophrenia he 
said

fire officials said monday that they failed 
to determine how a fire ignited in californias tallest building 
because 2000degree flames destroyed clues but they said arson 
was not suspected 
city fire investigators and agents from the us bureau of 
alcohol tobacco and firearms completed their inquiry and turned 
over control of the building to first interstate bank on sunday 
they pretty much ruled out it being a case of arson said 
bank spokesman bob campbell 
at this time the cause has been listed as undetermined in 
origin said city fire capt ralph ramirez the extent of the 
damages prevents us from listing a definitive cause 
further questions about the investigators inquiry were referred 
to fire chief donald manning who scheduled a tuesday news 
conference to discuss the findings 
earlier battalion chief gary bowie played down suggestions that 
the banks decision to sell its securities unit the day of 
wednesdays fire played a role in the blaze that killed one person 
and injured 40 others 
no one interviewed has said that theres a possibility of an 
incendiary fire of any type he said 
meanwhile suitcase and boxtoting employees of companies with 
offices in the first interstate bank tower retrieved documents from 
the firescarred 62story tower 
wearing hard hats and accompanied by security officers 
employees boarded elevators for the ascent to offices above and 
below gutted floors 12 through 16 many of the employees filled 
boxes bags suitcases and briefcases with files computer disks 
and telephone lists 
they had 15 minutes to select the things they need the most 
said bank spokesman john popovich 
he said the bank had gotten many of its employees back to work 
either in the undamaged parts of the building or in nearby leased 
space thanks to an emergency plan designed for earthquakes he 
said it would take 10 days to four weeks to clean up smoke and 
water damage but there was no estimate on the time to rebuild the 
gutted floors 
the fire departments preliminary estimate of 450 million was 
exceedingly high popovich said

the former governor had not to anyones knowledge suffered a 
previous heart attack sanders said but ogilvie did have a 
history of risk factors the doctor said adding he did not have 
the background to elaborate

emergencyroom instrument readings which indicated ogilvie 
suffered a massive coronary

at the hospital ogilvies wife dorothy was en route from florida 
ogilvie was stricken at his downtown law office he was awake

smoggy air in the nations cities may become 
significantly cleaner than official projections indicate new 
discoveries about auto pollution suggest 
planned new federal regulations to make gasoline less volatile 
harder to vaporize may cure a problem only now being recognized 
some analysts say 
this is the evaporation of gasoline from cars in use called 
running loss 
all cars have systems designed to control evaporation while 
parked the environmental protection agency has assumed the system 
also prevents significant vapors from escaping when the car is 
driven 
on a hot day it now appears the system can be overwhelmed and 
release five to 25 times more unburned gasoline than is permitted 
in exhaust 
the findings are so new that no one has had a chance to 
calculate their effect but they suggest that plans for less 
volatile gasoline may significantly reduce this previously 
underestimated contributor to smog

landlords with rifles and sticks ride 
motorcycles menacingly across fields where peasants work often 
for a wage of grain not money 
but the hopes of many peasants are riding with communist 
guerrillas whose aim is the violent overthrow of those they deem 
oppressors the highcaste landlords of bihar indias poorest and 
most backward state 
officials concede that the landlords are a law unto themselves 
in bihar and are resisting peasant demands for something better 
than payments in grain a common practice in rural india 
the landlords dont give us wages peasant worker mateshwari 
devi said as she sat recently on the floor of her mud hut if we 
fight they rain bullets on us we neither have land nor grain how 
are we to survive 
in recent years however the maoist guerrillas have been 
organizing peasants and have become enforcers meting out their own 
instant justice known as naxalites after naxalbari the town 
where their movement was founded the guerrillas have been gunning 
down landlords judged by them to be oppressors of the poor 
the naxalites red army also has clashed with the landlords 
private armies which peasant leaders and press reports say 
terrorize lowcaste communities 
at least 205 people have died in 898 violent incidents in 
bihar since 1983 according to official figures news reports and 
civil libertarians put the toll at more than 450 
the states 85000member police force has tried to stop the 
killings but officials say the problem goes deeper than just 
establishing law and order they maintain it stems from the abject 
poverty of the lowcaste masses and alleged injustices of landlords 
who are almost always from the upper castes 
the caste system of hereditary social grouping was legally 
abolished in india in 1949 after independence from britain but it 
still fuels tensions between the haves and havenots 
rn dash bihar states home secretary said the naxalites do 
get results 
this is an economic issue and the naxalites provide an 
aggressive forum for airing peoples grievances he said when 
they agitate roads get built and things happen 
bihars 80 million people have an annual per capita income the 
equivalent of 111 in contrast to a national average of 254 
in april 1987 police opened fire on a meeting of about 300 
peasants and laborers killing 23 people local activists charged 
that it came about at the instigation of kd singh a local 
landlord 
the rally had been called to protest singhs claim to a tiny 
piece of land the government had granted to poor families 
the findings of an official inquiry were never made public but 
officials speaking only on condition of anonymity said the 
inquiry found the police action justified on grounds of 
apprehension of breach of peace 
the activists claimed that singh had arranged for the police to 
open fire and that he himself joined in the shooting 
singh was shot to death this past feb 27 local people say the 
naxalites killed him 
shia sharan whose eldest son was killed in the shooting a year 
ago said he fully supports the naxalites tactics he added that 
he has been unsuccessful in his attempts to bring his sons killers 
to justice 
i have tried everything legal i have sent telegrams to the 
authorities but no action has been taken he said showing a 
neat file of documents and newspaper clippings 
we wont leave this land my son died for it and the 
government can fire on us again if it wants 
in nearby haibetpur village another story unfolds 
residents said supporters of awadhesh singh a landlord from the 
warrior rajput caste opened fire on aug 27 1987 on farm 
laborers who were demanding better wages they were receiving about 
a kilogram 22 pounds of grain as a days wages and were seeking 
115 a day 
at least 26 workers were wounded police later filed charges 
against some of the laborers many of whom are now fugitives 
a police post has been set up next to awadesh singhs house to 
protect him from naxalite attack he said his supporters opened 
fire because the laborers had attacked him 
his workers live in mud and thatch huts and sleep on straw piled 
on the dirt floors 
he lives in a twostory eightroom house which has large 
wooden beds radios glassware and china status symbols of rural 
india 
some top officials in patna bihars capital agree that reforms 
are needed 
the system has lost its credibility with the people and the 
naxalites they say this system stands for vested interests said 
dinesh nandan sahay inspector general of police 
bihjars newly elected chief minister bhagwat jha azad said 
land reforms must be implemented because many landlords own 
hundreds of acres of land far in excess of government ceilings 
but he denounced the naxalites instant justice 
no one should take the law into his hands azad said a 
society has both good and bad people the problem is that bad ones 
are very well organized and we need to organize the good people

on a frozen peninsula on the fringe of 
soviet territory fishing boats riding at anchor tell the story of 
the plight of this small japanese town and its people of the sea 
at one time numeros ships chased salmon across the pacific soon 
after the harbor ice thawed in april now they lie in port victims 
of shrinking fish quotas in nearby waters shortened fishing 
seasons and an offlimits zone around islands where many of 
numeros people were born all laid out by the soviet union 
the japanese lost its kuril islands to the soviets at the end of 
world war ii in the late summer of 1945 soviet troops arrived on 
the southernmost of the islands and routed their 17000 japanese 
dwellers 
nemuro in northern hokkaido is just two miles from kuril 
islands now occupied by soviet troops weapons and warplanes 
nemuros is caught in a chokehold and its population of 39000 
is in decline because of it 
this town is sinking economically said mayor kaiji ohya 
for more than 100 years fishing has been our livelihood now we 
cant fish near the islands we pioneered 
we want them back 
japan maintains the soviet occupation of the kurils is illegal 
the soviet union however cites a wartime allied pact giving it 
control of all the kurils the dispute keeps the two countries from 
signing a formal world war ii peace treaty 
but the worst part for nemuro is that the harder japan campaigns 
for the islands return the tighter the soviets draw the net 
around japanese fishing 
if we raise our voices they take it out on us fishermen 
said akimi kubota captain of a 90ton ship 
nowadays he has to steer his vessel past the islands where he 
was born to waters south of the soviet territorial line to fill his 
50ton quota 
thirty years ago before the limits began to shrink his ship 
could take on 100 tons the salmon and trout seasons then were 
twice as long as the current threemonth season and the fishable 
waters were closer to home 
nemuros preeminence in japans lucrative salmon market has 
faded and businesses in nemuro are going bankrupt at an increasing 
rate from four in 1977 to 25 eight years later 
if you squeeze the fishing industry nemuro becomes 
unlivable kubota said there is that basic link half my 
friends are gone many are still without work it may be all right 
to lose your job while youre young but what do you do if youre 
already getting old 
nemuros people speak hopefully of the new course set out by 
mikhail s gorbachev the soviet leader his signing of the missile 
treaty with president reagan in december and the upcomming 
withdrawal of soviet troops from afghanistan have eased two major 
obstacles to normalizing japanesesoviet relations 
this is a golden opportunity said professor hiroshi kimura 
director of hokkaido universitys slavic research center fish 
must be sacrificed for the islands be patient three or four more 
years 
foreign minister sosuke uno of japan has applauded gorbachevs 
actions 
one former islander is sadao nishida a fisheries dealer who 
keeps a rock in his hallway from shikotan the island he left as a 
child 
he remembers summers riding wild horses and swimming with them 
in clear icy waters 
he was 10 years old on sept 1 1945 two weeks after japan lost 
the war 
we never thought the russians would come he said japan 
lost to the americans after all 
that night we saw the lights of a ship was it american and 
then around six in the morning we saw the red flag with the hammer 
and sickle 
onethird of the islands people fled that day and eventually 60 
percent of the territories 17385 residents resettled in nemuro 
nishida said the soviets permitted him to return to shikotan 
twice to visit graves of relatives 
there wasnt a single house from the past he said all 
the buildings were russian and most of the soviets were women 
they were such nice people if you gave them something they 
absolutely had to give you something in return 
i thought they might give back the islands

the longest ceasefire in history the tension is there at all 
times

so youre a television producer and you want to 
get a show on the air and once you get that show on the air you 
want it to stay on the air 
what do you do hire the best talent in hollywood butter up 
network executives who can put you on after cosby hire a 
detective agency to locate nielsen families 
nope throw out all those theories about nielsen samples and 
demographics and time periods and counterprogramming 
in the primetime game its all in the name 
the right kind of punctuation will sell a show just look at 
cbs put an ampersand in the title and its a go kate amp 
allie eisenhower amp lutz cagney amp lacey amp of course 
simon amp simon the law and harry mcgraw was canceled 
precisely because it had no ampersand 
this of course does not explain beauty and the beast but 
hey a prediction by the third season theyll open a private 
detective agency and call it beauty amp beast or maybe just b 
ampb 
cbs is also partial to commas they make shows sound more 
intelligent murder comma she wrote magnum comma pi 
you know these people didnt just drop off a dangling participle or 
something 
those daring abc executives eschew such mundane punctuation as 
commas and periods and go more for such exotic symbols as question 
marks colons quotations within quotations ee cummingsstyle 
lowercase and even exclamation points whos the boss 
thirtysomething spenser for hire the slap maxwell 
story sledge hammer dolly 
to get a news show into prime time it must have a number in the 
title which explains why our world didnt make it though a 
fictional show called a different world did that may have 
something to do with one being opposite cosby and the other 
following it 
note 60 minutes 48 hours west 57th and 2020 
which also has the distinction of being the only network slash 
show numbers did not help 1986 but that was because it was 
doomed to be out of date within the year 
nbc doesnt care for oddball punctuation despite having once 
had one of the pioneers in oddball punctuation the ateam and 
settling for one allcapitals show this season alf which 
stands for alien life form nbc also has one allnumbers show 
227 a street address nbc goes in more for mainstream 
catchphrases facts of life family ties amen 
cheers a year in the life day by day 
nbc also likes short titles which may explain some executive 
consternation about the days and nights of molly dodd many 
words yes but at least theres no punctuation 
another way to help your show with any network give it a 
oneword title macgyver newhart alf 
moonlighting thirtysomething wiseguy matlock 
hunter hooperman dynasty the equalizer the 
the doesnt count cheers ohara hunter and 
amen 
talk show hosts have long since learned this lesson 
donahue oprah geraldo even the tonight show and 
late night are more often referred to simply as carson and 
letterman 
who can say that once a hero the first show canceled last 
fall wouldnt have been a smash hit if it was called simply 
hero how about the oldest rookie as rookie top 10 
show no doubt about it whos to say tour of duty wouldnt 
have beaten the cosby show always trimmed to the more familiar 
cosby if it had been called simply say war 
of course there are exceptions valerie became valeries 
family and still did ok downtown wizard and starman 
didnt make it despite catchy oneword titles 
surely cbs leg work would have been a hit without the 
space twoword titles are acceptable but only for cop shows 
miami vice crime story houston knights not private 
eye shows which must have one or threeword titles hunter 
the equalizer the the doesnt count beverly hills 
buntz spenser for hire 
nbc would never have had ratings problems with jj starbuck 
if they dropped the darn initials all right all right so theres 
la law 
some shows will be hits no matter what theyre called a 
different world could have been called the show after cosby 
or in keeping with short simple titles show and it would 
still be no 2 
its just a theory

the national chamber of commerce has issued an 
economic policy paper challenging the widespread fear that the 
economy is expanding into a period of dangerously rapid inflation 
it calls the growing references to inflation by economists 
bankers and investment advisers a phobia based in part on the 
assumption that economic growth per se is inflationary and partly 
on misreadings of the evidence 
it states that while the inflation rate could grow this year and 
into 1989 it is unlikely that anything similar to the double digit 
inflation of the 1970s lies in the future 
in fact says graciela testaortiz forecast director of the 
economic policy division the possibility exists that the 
national economy has enough momentum to continue to grow with a 
declining rate of inflation 
inflation fears have intensified recently for several reasons 
including a declining unemployment rate rising rates of factory 
utilization a lowering of the dollars trade value and increases 
in food and housing prices 
among the most oftcited evidence of an upturn in inflation was 
the sharp increase in monthly consumer prices of 05 percent in 
march compared with a 02 percent rise in february and the 
graphic depiction of that increase on widely published bar charts 
the chamber challenged such usage of charts however by showing 
that inflation plotted quarterly instead of monthly shows steady 
declines from the first quarter of 1987 through the first quarter 
of 1988 
when the quarterly data are plotted the real inflation trend 
is revealed and it is starkly different than the one portrayed 
it said adding 
these numbers are not a fluke or a statistical construct the 
decline in inflationary pressures as measured by the cpi is 
corroborated by the implicit deflation for gross national product 
a broader measure of inflation 
many analysts posit that economic growth is inflationary because 
it is assumed there are strict limits to economic growth with 
shortages and inefficiencies developing as industries reach 
productive capacity 
but the paper contends such reasoning assumes plant capacity 
is a given and cannot be changed whereas the truth is that 
american firms have been expanding their capacity to produce since 
the recovery began 
moreover it continues wage increases that often accompany a 
declining jobless rate have been muted by foreign competition in 
addition output per hour per person has also risen further 
alleviating inflation pressures 
the paper counters the argument that a rise in oil prices is 
likely by arguing that lower oil prices are just as possible the 
reality of the oil picture is one of plentiful supplies it says 
while many forecasters say the dollars lower value will 
eventually force inflation into the system mainly because foreign 
producers may have to raise us prices the paper notes that so 
far such increases have been small 
the paper contends the major inflation concern relates to the 
federal reserve it is the rapid increases in the money supply 
that causes inflation to rise and its volatility which thwarts 
growth 
it calls for stability and moderation in the growth of the money 
supply and a deemphasis on monthtomonth statistical evidence 
and sudden reactions to them in favor of longerterm trends

a year after a military coup ended democratic 
government in fiji the south pacific nation is still reeling in 
the aftermath of a conflict that arose over fijian fears of 
domination by the indian population 
the economy is shaky and skilled professionals and civil 
servants mostly indians are leaving for canada australia and new 
zealand at a rate of 500 a month double the precoup figure 
sugar production the countrys major cash crop is down 203 
percent tourism has dropped 269 percent the currency has been 
devalued 33 percent inflation has tripled to 6 percent 
unemployment has reached 75 percent and the gross domestic product 
is down 11 percent 
the coup of may 14 1987 was led by lt col sitiveni rabuka 
who claimed that a newly elected coalition government dominated by 
the decendants of immigrants from india threatened the future of 
ethnic fijians 
the indians outnumbered fijians 348704 to 329305 at the time 
and controlled trade and commerce 
the election of an indiancontrolled government led to the army 
coup prime minister timoci bavadra a fijian and his cabinet were 
arrested the constitution was suspended and rule by decree was put 
in force 
since then ethnic fijian fears of indian political supremacy 
have eased 
but the coup virtually ended organized political activities but 
the country is now seeing factional and clan rivalries among fijian 
chiefs in a feud over a fijian king 
it was to solve just such rivalries that king seru cakobau 
handed over the islands then known as the cannibal isles to queen 
victoria of britain in 1874 after first having tried to interest 
the united states 
ratu sir george cakobau grandson of the king and a former prime 
minister now claims the royal title which had been vacant since 
the british took control 
but other chiefs and clans are disputing cakobaus claim to the 
title 
bavadra the ousted prime minister said he feared squabbling 
among the chiefs could provoke a violent reaction from fijians 
feeling the effects of the economic downturn since the coup 
watching the tribal feuds with interest is the 39yearold 
rabuka who is a commoner 
he has become a cult figure to many ethnic fijians who regard 
him as the savior of their culture 
he is the minister for home affairs in the interim government he 
appointed to run the country until a new constitution is drafted 
and elections held 
a new book rabuka no other way giving rabukas account 
of the coup became an instant best seller 
also in demand is an autographed color poster of rabuka in an 
army tshirt and bearing the slogan fiji in gods hands 
a documentary film titled operation surprise the code name 
for the coup has been showing to packed houses fiji has has no 
television 
one of the first acts by rabuka a methodist lay preacher 
former rugby star and veteran of the united nations middle east 
peace force was to make the religious observance of sundays 
compulsory 
no shops are allowed to open no sports can be played public 
transport halts and the populace is expected but not yet 
compelled to go to church 
but the sunday observance law has become so unpopular that even 
the fiji council of churches has called for its repeal 
in the bestselling book written by a fijian and an australian 
rabuka says the majority of fijis indians are heathens and should 
be converted to christianity most of the indians are hindus 
i dont think they will resent it rabuka is quoted as 
saying because all we are trying to do is the same thing that 
missionaries did here in fiji when we were cannibals and heathens 
in the year since the coup indian leaders have fled or taken a 
low profile 
but one indian who remains prominent is irene narayan 56 
rabukas minister for indian affairs 
she said in an interview the indian community is now without a 
political leader but added she saw little likelihood of communal 
violence between fijians and indians 
she expressed the view that while some indians have left the 
majority will remain and probably accept their loss of political 
rights 
if fijians want dominance and they are happy with it perhaps 
thats not high a price for indians to pay mrs narayan said 
meanwhile fijis relations with traditonal friends and 
neighbors are taking time to mend australia new zealand and the 
united states condemned rabukas coup they called their 
ambassadors home and suspended aid but the envoys of all three 
have since returned 
australia and new zealand have resumed nonmilitary aid but 
relations remain chilly

the hitide is no longer your 
runofthemill fish and chips shop the american hamburger fried 
chicken and pizza have seen to that 
instead of the greasy colorless decor that typifies many 
british fish and chips places the hitide is a large combination 
restauranttakeout business refurbished with old english decor 
of wood beams exposed brick and lanterns 
the kitchen gleams and the large staff is eager to please 
the reason for this is just down the main shopping street of 
this tidy northeast london suburb a hamburger stand a kentucky 
fried chicken outlet and a pizza parlor mcdonalds is coming soon 
fish and chips are still britains biggestselling fast food 
but the trade is under siege and having to fight back 
the competition is very very fierce said hitides owner 
eric laycock id be lying to you if i said it didnt hurt 
not only is there competition there are image problems too the 
healthconscious are shunning fried foods and young britons say 
eating fish isnt trendy 
bob kennedy marketing director for edinburghbased sea fish 
industry says fish and chips shops are maintaining their level 
of sales but they are not sharing in the expansion of hot food 
takeaway as a whole 
said brian phelps president of londons fish friers 
association were having to pull our socks up obviously 
fish and chips have been a national food since the 19thcentury 
industrial revolution when trains and steam trawlers started 
bringing it to the neighborhoods of the new working class 
the meal usually consists of succulent cod deepfried in 
batter and stubby french fries called chips all sprinkled 
liberally with malt vinegar and salt mushy peas are optional 
until the advent of modern packaging the fish and chips came 
wrapped in an old newspaper to soak up the grease a order now 
costs an average of 125 pounds 234 about half the price of a 
big mac fries and soft drink 
nicknamed chippies fish and chips shops generally have been 
small businesses run by married couples out of the front rooms of 
their terraced houses 
but gentrification of these terraces has driven out many shops 
and they are scarce even in central london today 
as the new competition has intensified in the past 10 years 
chippies are becoming larger and chains and partnerships are 
forming although most shops remain englishowned chinese greek 
and indian immigrants are moving in 
britain had 9500 fish and chips shops in 1986 representing 
521 percent of the multibilliondollar fast food market down from 
10750 shops and 553 percent in 1981 according to sea fish 
industry 
today annual fish and chips sales total the equivalent of about 
935 million the national federation of fish friers said 
the fight for survival is multipronged 
more are providing seating for their customers 
laycock who offers 42 seats says takeaway is too blunt it 
is too quick you cant converse with a customer like in a 
restaurant 
the shops have improved flavor by using better batters and oils 
and are packaging meals in lidded cardboard boxes phelps said 
industry associations now run training courses for their members 
and are countering the health issue with a lowkey public relations 
campaign 
people say that fried food is unhealthy and too much fried 
food will lead to heart disease said arthur parrington head of 
the leedsbased national federation we say moderation in all 
things 
laycock 45 says he spent 100000 pounds 187000 renovating 
the rundown fish and chips shop he bought in 1974 he reports 
business is better and he is considering getting a liquor license 
as a director of old bylands ltd a 20shop chain laycock 
travels to outlets to teach managers how to fight the competition 
from the hamburger fried chicken and pizza 
there will be less of us the ones that are left will be 
highly specialized and efficient he said 
this is a very dying trade but i think we still have a place 
in english society

reminiscent of the 1970s oil crisis 
around the world sudanese wait in line these days as long as 12 
hours for gasoline lines form as well for sugar bread and other 
necessities in short supply 
two years after army generals gave power to prime minister sadek 
elmahdi his civilian government is having to contend with a 
faltering economy and a costly war in the south 
inflation reaching 70 percent has sent prices soaring and 
strikes are commonplace as workers try to deal with it 
the war costs the government an estimated 1 million a day in 
borrowed money 
elmahdi won national elections in april 1986 a year after the 
military overthrew gaafar nimeiri the president for 16 years 
but elmahdi sees a bright side to his two years as the nations 
leader 
we have moved the country from a faminestricken collapsed 
economy to a working economy which is able to feed itself and which 
has resumed its contacts with the international community on an 
equitable and just basis he said in an interview 
many sudanese and foreign diplomats disagree 
sudanese joke about it theres democracy a lot of democracy 
but thats about the only commodity available 
said a diplomat in theory if elmahdis government continues 
to drift with no firm program that plus economic distress surely 
will affect the democratic process and increase the possibility of 
a military takeover thats been the cycle historically 
it has taken most of elmahdis time and all his political 
prowess in the last two years to maintain equilibrium among the 
countrys 35 diverse political parties and 597 tribes 
he fired his cabinet on grounds of inefficiency in the spring of 
1986 and the next one lasted less than a year 
the crisis that followed remains unresolved as elmahdi seeks to 
put together and effective coalition of the five largest political 
parties a mixture of centerright moslem fundamentalists and 
nonmoslem southerners 
the major stumbling block is finding alternatives to islamic law 
that nimeiri implemented in 1983 although ignored since the 1985 
coup the law of islam remain officially as sudans basic law 
nimeiri avoided economic problems by securing foreign loans the 
transitional military council that replaced him froze interest 
payments on those loans 
elmahdi whose government must deal with a 12billion foreign 
debt says his government cant be responsible for the mistakes of 
past leaders 
that position enticed countries like canada sweden and norway 
to write off sudans debts to them 
but sudan is not likely to hold out much longer on the foreign 
aid it is now getting and foreign lenders are expected to extend 
more loans without some form of economic reform 
saudi arabia libya kuwait britain japan the united states 
and other foreign donors pour in 700 million to 800 million 
annually in cash oil and other commodities a western economist 
estimated that sudan needs 1 billion to 15 billion a year for 
the next four years just to keep up its present position 
the civil war in southern sudan is a constant financial drain 
as is the huge public sector 
for example the governments railway corporation which moves 
less than 10 percent of sudans freight employs 370000 people it 
moved more than 80 percent of the freight 30 years ago with fewer 
than half as many people 
government sugar factories produce 600000 tons of sugar a year 
which should satisfy local annual consumption needs of 560000 
tons nevertheless the government imports 200000 tons a year 
because 250000 tons of domestic sugar are smuggled to neighboring 
countries for higher prices 
the international monetary fund and other lenders are calling 
sudan to cut back on such costly ways 
the oxfordeducated elmahdi said in the interview that one of 
the first tasks once the new government is formed will be to adopt 
a fouryear economic reform plan it will include rehabilitation of 
agricultural industrial and service institutions and the 
construction of new roads and dams he said 
closely linked to the economic morass is the civil war in 
southern sudan where the rebel sudan peoples liberation army has 
held the upper hand for almost a year its first sustained success 
since the conflict began in 1983 
the ethiopianbacked rebels mainly christians and animists 
fighting the moslemdominated government in khartoum demand 
autonomy and a larger share of sudans assets for the southern 
zone they also want islamic law abrogated 
the country is thought to have extensive oil reserves mostly in 
the south but the war prevents exploitation southern farms cant 
till their fertile fields because of the fighting and work has been 
halted on a major canal project which if completed would divert 
nile river water throughout sudan

editors note despite being regarded as secondclass citizens 
in most of south asia women in the past three decades have emerged 
as powerful political leaders in several countries in the region 
as one political scientist put it i think there is a very strong 
substrata of matriarchy in the society 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
time after time the scenario has been 
replayed in the asian subcontinent the powerful leader falls 
sometimes to an assassins bullet and beside the body is the 
grieving wife or daughter 
then tears brushed away and replaced by determination she 
picks up the mantle of power in a part of the world where many 
women still are sold into marriages or brothels cast aside for 
failing to produce sons or consigned to lives of serving men 
in the past three decades several women have emerged as 
powerful political leaders in this way they include 
the late prime minister indira gandhi of india rivaled by few 
men anywhere in the world for iron will and ability to leave an 
indelible stamp on the fabric of a nation 
sirimavo bandaranaike of sri lanka the worlds first woman 
prime minister and a strong contender to govern her nation once 
again 
benazir bhutto of pakistan head of the most visible opposition 
force confronting president mohammad zia ulhaq 
sheik hasina and khaleda zia of bangladesh leaders of the 
longest sustained opposition protests against any leader of their 
coupprone country 
each of them has handled power skillfully although mrs gandhi 
and mrs bandaranaike were doomed by their excesses not one of 
them could be considered a feminist 
each pledged at least in the beginning to uphold the ideals of 
her late father or husband 
the people feel that the wife is the best to carry on mrs 
bandaranaike says during an interview in the colonnaded home in 
colombo where prime minister swrd bandaranaike was gunned down 
by a buddhist monk in 1959 
they trust the wife to carry on the husbands policies more 
than anyone else 
the 72yearold mrs bandaranaike pauses for a moment then 
adds there is a certain amount of sympathy for the widow you 
cant deny that also helps 
in mrs bandaranaikes case her husbands sri lanka freedom 
party was in shambles after his death the partys men squabbled 
for nearly a year then enlisted her to restore unity she served 
as prime minister from 1960 to 1965 and again from 1970 to 1977 
when voters rebelled against tight economic controls that banned 
most imports and saw people standing in line for bread 
older and wiser mrs bandaranaike is ready for office again 
and is said to have a good chance of winning elections scheduled 
for 1989 
president junius r jayewardene who defeated mrs bandaranaike 
in 1977 replaced the parliamentary system with a presidential one 
and is barred from seeking another term his united national party 
is under attack for failing to end a fouryear war by tamil 
guerrillas against the sinhalese ethnic majority 
mrs bandaranaike like the regions other powerful women said 
her sex has not been an issue 
despite being secondclass citizens in most south asian 
societies women have a market value in the political arena 
says ashis nandy of new delhis center for the study of developing 
societies 
i think there is a very strong substrata of matriarchy in the 
society he says its a cultural phenomenon that transcends the 
regions dominant religions hinduism in india buddhism in sri 
lanka and islam in pakistan and bangladesh 
traditionally in all these societies femininity has been 
associated with activism and power says nandy who trained as a 
clinical psychologist before entering political science 
he noted that hinduisms female deities invoke greater fear than 
male deities paintings of krishna and other gods have a gentle 
almost androgynous quality while kali goddess of destruction is 
drenched in blood with human heads hanging from her waist and is 
unmistakably female 
the king of the gods is a man but the crucial powerful gods 
relevant to everyday life are women nandy says pestilence 
health child care fertility these are goddesses 
indira gandhi daughter of indias first prime minister 
jawaharlal nehru was known as bharat mhata mother of india 
she was loved hated feared but above all respected she 
abolished the princely estates of the maharajahs intervened in 
pakistans civil war to create the new nation of bangladesh in 1971 
and led india into the nuclear age

mrs gandhi was installed as prime minister in 1966 by men who 
thought she would be pliable she soon proved them wrong and stayed 
in office until a crushing election defeat in 1977 when democracy 
was restored after 20 months of heavyhanded emergency rule but 
she rebounded back into office in 1980 and served four more years 
before she was assassinated by sikh bodyguards 
i think being a woman in politics is an asset in india says 
maneka gandhi widow of indiras younger son sanjay and political 
foe of the older son current prime minister rajiv gandhi 
we treat our country as very feminine mother earth of 
course i do tend to be patronized but its not because im a 
woman but because im 31 
i think most women in this part of the world come up in 
politics because of family maneka says but whether they are 
successful or not really depends on their own qualities 
in bangladesh the two major opposition parties trying to force 
president hussain muhammad ershad to resign are headed by women 
sheik hasina of the awami league and khaleda zia of the bangladesh 
nationalist party 
hasina daughter of assassinated president sheik mujibur rahman 
was tutored in politics from childhood but mrs zia sought a 
political role only after her husband president ziaur rahman was 
assassinated 
both hasina and mrs zia were installed as party leaders by male 
politicians who needed someone who could unite the ranks by 
invoking memories of oncepopular presidents 
hasina in an interview in the house where her father mother 
and three brothers were gunned down in 1975 said she believed 
women leaders have strengths sometimes lacking in men 
they dont corrupt very quickly they can sacrifice more they 
are very organized women are mothers they preserve they nurse 
says hasina 40yearold mother of two teenagers and wife of 
atomic scientist wazed miah 
the 43yearold mrs zia whose husband was killed in 1981 
professed to see no difference between men and women but she 
added that if her husband had lived there would have been no 
need for me to be involved in politics 
pakistani opposition leader benazir bhutto had brothers who also 
were active in politics but benazir emerged as the foremost heir 
of the pakistan peoples party after the 1977 overthrow and 
subsequent execution of her father prime minister zulfikar ali 
bhutto 
returning home from selfimposed exile in 1986 benazir was 
hailed by adoring masses who thought bhuttos daughter would lead a 
peoples power revolution like the one ignited in the 
philippines by president corazon aquino widow of a slain 
opposition leader 
two years later ms bhutto recently married to wealthy 
businessmanpolo player asif zardari heads a party wracked by 
infighting among functionaries who accuse her of being dictatorial 
and abrasive 
it may be my personality overshadows many events ms 
bhutto 34 told one of indias national newspapers the indian 
express 
she also said that before she returned home someone told her 
that politics was a very dirty game for a woman 
she said she replied dont you worry i will face 
everything 
although women have reached the top echelons of power in the 
subcontinent only india routinely places some women in the lower 
and middle levels of government 
krishna sahi one of seven women in indias 63member council of 
ministers a sort of expanded cabinet believes women always played 
a big role in decisionmaking in india but often it was from 
behind the curtain 
now she says awareness has come into womenthey are 
getting rid of the oppression 
in south india the death last january of movie starpolitician 
mg ramachandran the leader of tamil nadu state sparked a fierce 
battle for succession between two women his 64yearold widow and 
his 39yearold close companion of the last decade 
the squabble between janaki ramachandran the widow and 
jayalalitha who costarred with ramachandran in 25 movies is 
still going on

editors note two questions what was the first human 
transplant and which is the most successful the answer to both is 
the cornea which gives sight to 35000 people a year the irony is 
that the very success of americas eye banks has caused their 
biggest frustration a lack of donors 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
their battle cry could properly be an eye for 
an eye but there is no vengeance in the hearts of these 
crusaders only mercy 
they work in a small quiet lab high above manhattans blare and 
glare and with dawntomidnight effort seem to be gaining on 
their quest the gift of sight for all who can have it without 
delay 
were providing more corneas for transplant every year says 
patricia dahl dramatically more in recent years but still not 
enough 
when i came here seven years ago the waiting period was four 
months now its down to five weeks the pity is that there 
shouldnt have to be any waiting time at all the eyes are there 
the donors are not 
ms dahl is the lab director for new yorks eyebank for sight 
restoration inc it is the nations first and largest eye bank 
among the more than 100 throughout the nation last year it 
provided 1400 corneas for transplant all it could obtain but as 
ms dahl said not enough 
the irony is that the very success of corneal transplants the 
first human tissue transplanted successfully is the eye banks 
biggest problem 
the large organ transplants the hearts the kidneys the 
lungs are the ones that get all the publicity and national appeals 
for donors says mary jane oneill the eye banks executive 
director corneal transplants have become so commonplace people 
assume one will be available every time one is needed that of 
course is far from the case 
since its beginning two generations ago new yorks eye bank has 
provided corneas for 30000 transplants and yes the procedure 
has become so routine that that number now equals almost as many as 
are done in america every year on an average day in america one 
heart 20 kidneys and 65 corneas are transplanted one cornea 
every 22 minutes more corneas than all other transplants combined 
the new york eye bank was established in 1944 by a pioneering 
physician the late richard townley paton he used eyes donated by 
consenting convicts on death row at sing sing prison just up the 
hudson river and lost a housekeeper in the process when she opened 
the fridge one morning saw two eyes in a saucer of liquid and 
left paton who died four years ago wrote the first textbook 
published in the united states on corneal transplants forerunner 
of all organ transplants 
the cornea is not an organ the eye is the organ the cornea a 
tissue at least at this stage doctors see no way the eye once 
severed from the optic nerve can ever be transplanted 
the cornea is the transparent front surface of the eye about 
the size and thickness of a dime it is the window through which 
light passes to the lens and onto the retina the brain completes 
the job the result vision for it all to work the cornea must be 
crystal clear 
its an amazing thing the cornea said ms dahl the lab 
director 
its the most sensitive tissue in the body which is why the 
tiniest grain of sand on it will hurt yet it also is very 
resilient and the fact that it contains no blood vessels makes it 
easily passed on rejection by the recipient is extremely rare the 
success rate is better than 90 percent 
some recipients who received a transplant when they were 
young from a middleaged or even elderly donor are looking 
through corneas perhaps 100 years old 
ms dahls education was in biology and chemistry not medicine 
she got her job at the eye bank through a helpwanted ad and 
trained on the job she was certified by the eye bank association 
of america sort of a national clearinghouse which sets the 
standards for technicians

her lab is a simply furnished room no microscopes or bubbling 
beakers or any of the exotic paraphernalia you might expect in a 
place where medical miracles are wrought 
it contains only a table brightly lit where the corneas are 
removed and a single instrument called a splitlight a device 
like one an eye doctor uses for examinations except less 
complicated 
ms dahls eyes 2020 hazel brighten with enthusiasm when she 
explains what goes on there 
we have four people in the lab and four in the field 
collecting eyes from donors as soon as we hear of a donor we 
dispatch someone to the hospital to collect the eyes we cover 138 
hospitals in an 11county area unlike other organs the eye can be 
taken six to eight hours after death its a simple job and leaves 
no disfiguration takes about 20 minutes 
we receive the eyes in the lab and examine the cornea through 
the splitlight if it is acceptable we remove it and send it 
right away to the next recipient on the list if not it is used in 
research none is wasted our procedure takes about 20 minutes as 
well 
we maintain the recipient list by computer the corneas go out 
first come first served unless theres a priority such as 
someone being in danger of losing the entire eye because of an 
accident 
the doctor removes the damaged portion of the patients eye 
with an instrument called a trephine sort of a cookie cutter he 
cuts out the donor cornea with the same instrument so the 
replacement fits exactly he works through a highpowered 
microscope and stitches it in with nylon thread finer than a human 
hair he can do the operation in his office using local anesthesia 
if he chooses 
some patients can see when the bandages come off the next day 
with others its more gradual 
what we do here is the easy part the hard part is getting the 
donors 
even many doctors well aware of the need are often reluctant 
to approach a family at the moment of their grief to ask permission 
to remove their loved ones organs 
the result is the loss in america each year of an estimated 
18000 to 20000 potential kidneys livers hearts lungs and other 
organs but especially eyes since the eyes do not have to be 
removed as urgently the braindead body does not have to be 
maintained artificially and the cornea may wait four or five days 
before transplanting 
to prevent this loss two years ago new york california and 
oregon enacted laws not simply encouraging but requiring that 
hospitals where 80 percent of americans die make that painful 
request of the bereaved since then all except eight states idaho 
wyoming south dakota vermont south carolina iowa alabama and 
utah have passed similar required request laws 
new york among other states sends out counselors including 
the energetic ms dahl to teach nurses and other hospital workers 
how to make the delicate request 
they have discovered that in many cases the request actually 
comforts a family since they can feel the relative lives on through 
someone else 
there is one final act of love you can do for your beloved 
one hospital chaplain tells sorrowing relatives others approach a 
relative with a gentle question do you know whether the person 
was an eye donor 
twothirds of those asked say yes says ms dahl since 
the laws enactment donations to the new york eye bank increased 
78 percent 
still not enough 
a decade ago only 7000 corneal transplants were performed in 
the united states but eyes judged beyond repair back then can now 
be restored last year 35000 americans received corneal 
transplants and another 5000 who needed them lacked donors 
doctors say that technology continues to develop and todays demand 
could double in the next decade 
i dont know whether we ever will have a cornea immediately 
for everybody who needs one but thats the goal ms dahl says 
until it happens well continue to be a bank in name only no 
deposits here only withdrawals

editors note in a program that began under president lyndon 
johnson more than 300 white house fellows have spent a year 
working in various federal departments and agencies learning the 
ways of government from within some have stayed and now occupy 
high posts in the government others have gone home but with a 
different outlook

in the old executive office building next door 
to the white house james l nuzzo scans column after column of 
numbers in a budget book and prepares a memorandum for vice 
president george bush 
nuzzo is a neurologist from boston 
over at the agriculture department george m drysdale makes his 
way through the intricacies of farm price supports soil 
conservation and consumer services 
drysdale is a venture capitalist from san francisco 
in the office of the us trade representative karen s 
kellerhouse fields inquiries from mayors and governors about us 
foreign trade policy 
ms kellerhouse is a financial executive on leave from the port 
authority of new york and new jersey 
nuzzo drysdale and ms kellerhouse are among a dozen americans 
in their early or middle 30s who are working as white house fellows 
in a program that has survived from lyndon johnsons great society 
to ronald reagans new american revolution 
since 1965 more than 300 of them have passed through 
washington spending 12 months working in federal departments and 
agencies to learn the ways of government some have stayed and 
occupy high posts in the government others have gone home 
white house fellows work at the national aeronautics and space 
agency the department of energy the pentagon the office of 
management and budget the justice department the arms control and 
disarmament agency and in the white house 
of the current crop one is a newspaper marketing executive 
three are attorneys one is vice president of a scientific products 
firm three are army majors one a captain in the marine corps 
during their septemberthroughaugust stint for which they were 
chosen from among about 800 applicants they receive a salary of up 
to 55000 a year officials say most of them successful in their 
own careers absorb a pay cut anyone is eligible except federal 
civil servants 
some of the programs graduates have big offices in washington 
lt gen colin l powell who worked as a fellow under thenbudget 
director caspar weinberger in 197172 is now president reagans 
national security adviser another alumnus michael h armacost is 
undersecretary of state for political affairs 
another david karnes says i wouldnt be united states 
senator today if it werent for the white house fellows program

haas 6869 is president of levi strauss company doris kearns 
met lyndon johnson when she was a fellow and became his biographer 
several former fellows are generals or admirals 
it all started in 1957 with john gardner then president of the 
carnegie foundation for the advancement of teaching 
i had been doing quite a bit of reading about the founding 
fathers and i was struck with the fact that just about every single 
one of them had very early opportunity to observe government 
gardner recalls it was right across the street so to speak the 
government of their colony he also found he says that the 
ablest kids in the country today never saw anybody governing 
i wrote a memo proposing the idea of a group of white house 
fellows and had the idea that it could be financed by 
foundations he said the only problem was the bill was very 
high and there wasnt any foundation interested in it 
seven years later gardner was having lunch with eric goldman a 
princeton university historian then an aide to president johnson 
goldman said johnson was concerned that too few young people were 
interested in government 
look ive got a memo says gardner who would later become 
johnsons secretary of health education and welfare goldman 
showed the memo to the president and first lady lady bird johnson 
and the program was launched 
today it has a budget of slightly less than 500000 a year 
supplemented by private funds raised by a foundation set up by 
former fellows 
in its early years the program was limited to applicants 
between the ages of 24 and 36 but the age requirement was 
abandoned in response to an antidiscrimination suit all of the 
current fellows however would have qualified under the original 
limits

the youngest fellow in history david neuman was 23 when he 
served in the white house office of cabinet affairs neuman says 
the experience has been very useful and helpful in his present 
job vice president for current comedy programs at nbc 
relationships between the white house and the departments and 
agencies are much like that between a television network and the 
various studies and production companies he says the 
political dynamic is very similar 
neuman says the program needs to be better publicized 
everybody knows what the rhodes scholarship is and very few 
people know what the white house fellowship is 
applications are first reviewed at a january reunion of alumni 
who cut them to about 130 those applicants are invited to travel 
at their own expense to 11 cities to be interviewed by panels of 
prominent citizens 
this cuts the field to 33 who come to washington at government 
expense for a weekend for more interviews by members of the 
presidentially appointed commission on white house fellowships 
for some like karnes the interview will be their first trip to 
washington for others the capital is familiar ground nuzzo for 
instance had been a house page and attended georgetown university 
medical school 
nuzzo 31 said he heard about the program while in college 
after completing medical school and residency he applied so he 
could decide whether im going to be a practicing clinician or 
whether i wanted to get involved with policy full time 
he says he reached his decision on his third day in the job he 
chose a life of public service 
on one recent day nuzzo sat in on a meeting of the subcabinet 
interagency trade policy review group from 830 until sometime 
after 930 am came back to the office and did some reading in 
the budget and the annual economic report to the president sort 
of summarized some of the key kernels of material that were 
necessary from that analyzed some taxation and civil rights 
issues and looked at the whole notion of banking deregulation 
that was in the morning in the afternoon he had a meeting about 
aids financing 
not everybodys cup of tea but for nuzzo its heady stuff 
here i am im a doc from massachusetts he said a couple of 
months ago my big thing was figuring out whether i ought to give 
somebody a high colonic and now im writing memoranda for the vice 
president 
in addition to their regular duties the fellows spend at least 
a day on capitol hill following a member of congress around 
that from the fellows point of view is a real eye opener 
says ann lavin assistant director of the program i think up 
until then a lot of them have really believed in their government 
textooks on how it works 
drysdale 32 a general partner in hambrecht amp quist venture 
partners of san francisco for instance was assigned to track rep 
e kika de la garza dtexas chairman of the house agriculture 
committee 
there are parts of it that are very very different from the 
way decisions are made in the business world drysdale says 
often in business one or two people make a decision in the 
political process its much more open 
the fellows also attend meetings about once a week at which 
big names in government and journalism speak 
they also make trips abroad which come out of the budget of the 
agency they work for this years group went to the soviet union in 
april when president reagan met with the fellows on jan 5 
according to nuzzo he asked them please let me know what you 
find out 
although one out of three of the current fellows are from the 
armed services officials deny there is any tilt in favor of the 
military 
whatever their background said nuzzo there is almost a white 
house fellows mafia of both old and new fellows people from 
outside and inside the government who talk to each other a great 
deal 
one alumnus of the program elaine chao recently named chairman 
of the federal maritime commission came to the fellowship from a 
career in banking to which she expects to return 
being an immigrant to this country i was personally 
interested in how the government works the taiwanese native 
said but she added it was only through my business dealings 
that i began to understand that business and government really 
didnt understand each other

editors note before massachusetts gov michael dukakis surged 
far ahead of the pack new york gov mario cuomo was the most 
talkedabout noncandidate for president of this primary season 
heres a look at the statehouse record of cuomo whos keeping the 
door slightly ajar for another mario scenario 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
mario cuomo one of the democratic partys 
most eloquent voices has toiled for 5 years as chief executive of 
the nations secondlargest state much of the time at the center 
of waxing and waning speculation about a possible run for the white 
house 
from his base in albany cuomo has tackled national issues such 
as the federal deficit international issues such as third world 
debt and the most basic issue of all life and death 
we do innovation so casually that we dont even get credit for 
it says cuomo who with one 1984 speech became an instant 
national celebrity and kept people talking about him as a likely 
presidential candidate even while he insisted he had no intention 
of being one 
until recently cuomos avowed noncandidacy was regarded with 
much skepticism now the march toward the democratic nomination by 
a fellow governor michael dukakis of massachusetts seems to have 
all but obliterated lingering thoughts of a mario scenario 
whatever cuomo might have wrought as a candidate in new york 
state his handiwork has accumulated and is plain to see though 
not as usual in matters political uncontested 
a list of administration accomplishments compiled in cuomos 
office includes the mandatory seat belt law the nations first 
the start of the largest tax cut in the states history and 
raising the drinking age from 18 to 21 
the seat belt bill originated in the legislature and the 
governor at first expressed reservations about its effect on 
short people who might find wearing the belts uncomfortable 
reminded of this recently cuomo said i signed it 
in 1984 cuomo fought hard to raise the states drinking age 
but members of the state assemblys majority complaining of the 
administrations strongarm lobbying voted it down it passed the 
following year after the federal government threatened to withhold 
federal highway money from any state that failed to raise its 
drinking age to 21 
the tax cut approved last year was on the legislatures 
initiative says state assembly speaker mel miller a brooklyn 
democrat after initial opposition to the taxcut proposals first 
championed by the senates republican majority cuomo came on board 
and signed the measure into law 
in march a television reporter noted in a broadcast the critics 
were saying the governor hadnt come up with many new ideas its 
an accusation cuomo has heard repeatedly and it makes him bristle 
the official keeper of the cuomo administrations scorecard 
first assistant to the governor elaine ryan sent the reporter a 
threepage list titled highlights of cuomo administration 
innovations 
said the governor himself when asked about initiatives it 
would probably be difficult to find a fiveyear period in the 
history of the state where you had more innovation he cited a 
string of them 
one such was his fight for creation of the national economic 
commission to study the national deficit third world debt and 
productivity with a strong push from congress president reagan 
signed legislation in december creating the commission 
the governor of a state gets an idea the vice president 
doesnt want it the president doesnt want it and we get it the 
president signs it i think that was kind of innovative says 
cuomo 
that certainly has the sound if not 88 then 1992 says 
cuomos chief albany antagonist warren anderson the republican 
majority leader of the state senate suggesting that cuomo has his 
sights set on the white house 
the commission derisively labeled the cuomo commission by 
vice president george bush this years expected gop presidential 
nominee is composed of luminaries such as new york financial 
expert felix rohatyn and chrysler chairman lee iacocca cochaired 
by former democratic party chairman robert strauss and republican 
drew lewis a former secretary of transportation the commission 
will report after the november election 
a real cuomo commission is the governors commission on trade 
and competitiveness a group of nationally known executives labor 
leaders and economists brought together by the governor to study 
the same problems as they affect new york

among other things cuomos commission has recommended the 
creation of industry task forces to adjust to new technologies and 
foreign competition worker participation would be expanded to 
increase productivity and corporations would be granted trade 
relief but only if they produced plans to revitalize their 
production the commission has also suggested consideration of a 5 
percent valueadded tax to reduce imports stimulate exports and 
cut the deficit 
other initiatives that cuomo alone can take credit for include 
at his insistence new york became the first state in the 
nation to create a task force on life and the law the group of 
theologians lawyers physicians scientists and civil rights 
activists has come up with a legally acceptable definition of death 
the absence of brain activity and legislation that permits 
people to refuse intrusive medical efforts that might prolong their 
lives the task force is also studying surrogate parent contracts 
and policies for organ transplants 
cuomo has begun a program using schools as community centers 
that provide care for students after regular school hours and hes 
proposed liberty scholarships a plan that would guarantee poor 
seventh graders a public college education if they stay in school 
and get accepted into a college 
he has secured passage of major bond issues for environmental 
work and for rebuilding the states decaying roads and bridges 
cuomo persuaded the legislature to establish a statesubsidized 
prescription drug program for the elderly to adopt a fiscal 
strategy that will gradually reduce the states recurring 
shortterm debt and to approve legislation that would allow 
victims of longago exposure to toxic substances to sue for damages 
cuomo has used his executive powers to create an inspector 
generals office to ferret out corruption in state agencies to 
adopt regulations that insure against race sex or 
sexualpreference discrimination by the state and to improve 
productivity in state government 
in the wake of corruption scandals in new york city and 
allegations of wrongdoing by state legislators he also battled 
bitterly with the leaders of the legislature last year to win new 
laws to police the conduct of elected and appointed officials 
a newsweek poll of the nations governors conducted two years 
ago rated massachusetts gov dukakis as the most effective 
governor cuomo was eighth 
its a question of communication cuomo says if i had 
said for five years what george bush is now saying if i had said 
for five years i want to be known as the education governor and 
just done all the things weve done for five years i would now be 
nationally regarded as an education governor i didnt do that the 
programs and substance are there but i never identified it as the 
thing we wished to be known for 
fellow democrat miller who has not always been on good 
relations with cuomo suggests another theory new york states 
economy has been healthy and the money has flowed in he says 
your ultimate test is always in emergencies you can be great if 
there are no emergencies 
he doesnt think cuomos has been a peculiarly innovative 
administration but he says cuomo has borrowed ideas freely from 
the legislature and other states and somebody who takes the best 
of whats around is smart 
ultimately miller says the governor is resultminded and 
compromiseminded a real strength but also a weakness because 
sometimes you let a lot of stuff go 
but getting things done is what counts cuomo argues the 
governor is the quarterback he has to get you across the goal 
line 
miller says the governor has yet to get ahead of the game in 
dealing with the mentally ill the retarded the homeless housing 
and democrat miller and republican anderson say he hasnt 
consistently appointed topflight officials both praise his 
ability as a communicator 
as for the 55yearold governor he says he loves his job and is 
making plans to run for a third fouryear term in 1990 he is 
careful nonetheless not to commit himself to seek reelection or 
to close the door completely on a presidential bid in 1992 should 
the democrats lose this year 
only god knows whats going to happen he says

editors note they were early exiles of the atomic age 
removed from their rich fishing grounds at bikini atoll so the 
united states could test its nuclear bombs today 42 years later 
some 1500 bikinians are scattered across the marshall islands 
living on us aid and waiting for america to fulfill its promise 
and clean up their homeland

kilon bauno looks out on 
the lagoon that once provided his people an abundant life and 
recalls those better days before us atomic bomb tests poisoned 
this remote coral atoll with radiation 
when i was here life was great we had fish we had turtles 
we had coconuts we lived together and we took care of each 
other bauno the ceremonial chief of the bikini islanders says 
through an interpreter 
you always felt you were getting a big gift from god adds 
bauno who is believed to be in his late 80s although elderly 
bikinians dont keep track of their ages 
today 42 years after 167 bikinians left so their atoll could 
become a laboratory for the bomb tests they see a glimmer of hope 
that their nuclear exile will be coming to an end 
under an outofcourt settlement to a lawsuit in 1985 the 
united states agreed to pay for bikinis cleanup and the eventual 
resettlement of the atoll 
scientists are still trying to determine how best to get rid of 
the lingering radiation however its no longer a question of 
if the exiles can return home but when 
an estimated 1500 bikinians are scattered throughout the 
marshall islands living off aid from the us government and 
longing for the day when america fulfills its promise 
when we left they promised us we would be the children of 
america bauno says the only thing we can do now is look to 
america and wait for them to do something 
so far the united states has spent 123 million on the 
bikinians including 95 million in trust funds to resettle house 
and feed them america also has paid for studies of the radiation 
problem in the atoll site of 23 atomic blasts between 1946 and 
1958 
with each passing day the elder bikinians believe the chances of 
resuming their traditional way of life become slimmer 
there are only a few elders left who know our traditional 
customs and it will not be long until they are gone also says 
tomaki juda mayor of kili island which has the largest population 
of bikinians we hope it will not be long before we can restore 
our traditions 
the bikinians described in 1946 as a primitive fishing people 
now enjoy a lifestyle they couldnt have imagined 42 years ago 
with american dollars they have bought westernstyle clothes tv 
sets videotape recorders and even cars but bauno and his fellow 
elders say those comforts are only sedatives to ease the pain of 
their exile 
some 700 of the bikinians now live on kili a 200acre island 
500 miles south of bikini which was uninhabited when they arrived 
unlike bikini whose 23 remaining islands enclose a 240squaremile 
lagoon teeming with fish kili is an isolated coconut island 
pounded by heavy surf 
a 6 million trust fund provides each bikinian about 30 a 
month giving them a higher standard of living than most 
marshallese the bikinians depend on canned meat and surplus food 
provided by the us government to supplement the coconuts and 
breadfruit grown on kili 
us aid has provided the bikinians plywood houses electricity 
and medical care the bikinians also have built what local pilots 
call the best airstrip in the marshalls outside of majuro the 
capital

some people call them rich but a toyota and a plywood house 
isnt rich says jack niedenthal an american who is an adviser 
and interpreter for the bikinians 
while the bikini elders try to keep tradition alive on kili the 
american influence is strong some of the 100 children attending 
kilis threebuilding school have first names such as rambo george 
bush kennedy and chuck norris 
a popular activity on kili is to drive one of the islands 
30odd japanese cars at midday with the air conditioner running 
an event they call jumbo 
the cars are a way of taking away the burden of living on 
kili says mayor juda getting in a car and riding around gives 
you a feeling of not being so stuck even though driving from one 
end of kili to the other takes only a couple of minutes 
twenty police officers take turns patrolling kilis two miles of 
dirt road in a pickup truck equipped with a 15 dollar siren 
police hand out tickets of up to 25 for offenses ranging from 
running one of the islands dozen stop signs to exceeding the 5 mph 
speed limit established in the islands living area 
the greatest thrill for the bikinians is when the elders return 
to check the progress of work at bikini the latest trip was made 
in early april when 50 joined us officials to mark the start of 
construction of a 30 million base camp once the method of cleaning 
bikini is agreed upon 
the bikinians and their washington attorney jonathan weisgall 
continue to lobby the us government for money for the cleanup and 
resettlement which is expected to cost between 120 million and 
215 million so far the government has appropriated a few hundred 
thousand dollars to begin construction of the base camp weisgall 
says 
weisgall has proposed that the us government establish another 
trust fund that would allow the bikinians pay for the resettlement 
themselves the plan which weisgall said would involve a 
commitment of about 100 million has received support from some 
congressional leaders and from larry morgan of the department of 
the interior the bikini project officer 
i think all our problems can be addressed and resolved by a 
trust fund morgan says the trust fund we think puts the 
responsibility on the bikinians themselves rather than bureaucrats 
in washington 
for the past 10 years american scientists have studied the 
radiation problem on the main island of bikini whose soil is laced 
with radioactive cesium137 from the explosion of americas most 
powerful hydrogen bomb in 1954 the researchers say it will take 
between five and 10 years to clean bikini island where most of the 
bikinians will live 
scientists say that without treatment locally grown food wont 
be safe until well into the 21st century 
they are considering three cleanup alternatives removing the 
topsoil in which the radioactive material is concentrated treating 
the soil with potassium to prevent the uptake of radioactivity by 
plants and irrigation with sea water 
for now the bikinians remain at the mercy of america 
they give us a little money and we buy our food bauno says 
then we stare at them again and they give us a little more 
thats all we can do we just look to these americans saying 
continue helping us because were still away from where we want to 
be

scientists have once again 
descended upon bikini atoll this time to find a way to remove 
radiation that lingers from atomic bomb tests and bring the bikini 
islanders home to stay 
twentythree atomic tests between 1946 and 1958 turned bikini 
atoll into a radioactive nomans land three of bikinis 26 
islands were vaporized 
the enemy on bikini island where most of the resettled 
bikinians would live is radioactive cesium137 the isotope fouled 
bikinis soil after the explosion of americas most powerful 
hydrogen bomb in 1954 
the cesium has made its way into the islands food plants and 
scientists say that without treatment locally grown food wont be 
safe until well into the 21st century 
if we solve the cesiumuptake problem weve essentially 
solved the whole problem of rehabilitating bikini according to 
dr william robison a scientist at californias lawrence livermore 
national laboratory who has been heading field tests here 
robison says researchers have come up with three alternatives 
for making bikini safe scraping up the topsoil in which the 
radioactive material is concentrated treating the soil with 
potassium to prevent the uptake of radioactivity by plants and 
irrigation with sea water 
removing the topsoil on the 500acre island is the most 
straightforward approach and also is the most expensive 
alternative robison says the bikini atoll rehabilitation 
committee set up by congress to study the radiation problem 
determined that removing the topsoil would cost as much as 96 
million 
to be effective the removal would have to take the top 16 
inches of soil off bikini island robison says such a procedure 
would be a serious environmental insult removing all bikinis 
plants and devastating the islands ability to grow vegetation 
in addition to all the cesium its going to remove all the 
topsoil that contains all the nutrients that carry all the organic 
material its taken decades to build up robison says 
workers removed plutonium from enewetak atoll another nuclear 
test site in the marshall islands by scraping the topsoil 
drenching topsoil with sea water has drastically reduced cesium 
uptake in test plants robison says but scientists are unsure of 
its longterm effectiveness there also is some question about how 
much damage the salt water would inflict upon plants 
researchers believe the sea water treatment works in one of two 
ways either electrically charged sodium particles block the cesium 
from entering plant roots or the water filters the cesium further 
into the soil and out of the reach of plants 
robison favors a third approach which involves saturating the 
soil with potassium cesium is closely related to potassium which 
plants crave scientists believe plants mistake the cesium for 
potassium which is rare in bikinis coral soil 
robison says plants prefer potassium to cesium and will absorb 
potassium if given a choice between the two 
the salt water and potassium treatments control the radioactive 
cesium leaving it in the soil until natural decay renders it 
harmless the cost of both options is estimated at between 57 
million and 80 million 
the scaping option although frowned upon by scientists has won 
wide support among bikinis leaders even though it means staying 
away from their home longer the bikinians like the fact that soil 
removal gets rid of the cesium instead of simply controlling it 
until it loses its potency 
its the position of the bikinian people that the radioactive 
soil be scraped up says henchi balos a senator representing the 
bikinians as laymen its the only way we can have our peace of 
mind 
a small group of bikinians returned in the early 1970s when 
radiation levels were thought to be safe but tests in 1978 found 
they were ingesting dangerous amounts of cesium and they were 
evacuated 
tomaki juda mayor of kili island where some 700 bikinians now 
live says bikinis leaders favor the scraping method in part 
because of the experience in the 1970s 
president johnson said it was safe to come back after they 
supposedly did a cleanup juda says we came back here and 10 
years later we got moved off again that makes it hard for us to 
believe them now 
jonathan weisgall a washington attorney representing the 
bikinians says the united states should abide by the bikinians 
wishes 
theres a very strong psychological factor at work here and 
if the bikinians are not convinced bikini is safe im not 
convinced theyre going to go back he says

editors note a want ad for a cook at the mississippi 
governors mansion might read only convicted killers need apply 
the first family recruits its household servants from the state 
penitentiary if they do a good job they are set free when the 
governor leaves office

convicted murderer frank gholar owes his 
freedom and a wellpaying job to mississippis resumption of an old 
southern tradition using prison inmates as servants in the 
antebellum governors mansion 
only prisoners convicted of violent crimes qualify to serve the 
states first family and inmates facing life sentences are 
preferred says joseph nix director of executive security at the 
mansion 
they tend to make the best workers nix says explaining 
that the lifers have the most to gain if they dont betray the 
governors trust 
for four years gholar whipped up everything from gourmet french 
sauces to downhome cornbread in the kitchen of the whitepillored 
governors mansion built in 1842 when gov bill allain left 
office last january he kept the tradition of commuting the 
sentences of his faithful servants and gholar is now on the 
payroll of a hazlehurst oil company owner he met while at the 
mansion 
gholar a 42yearold former oil field worker recalls serving 
time at the isolated state penitentiary at parchman in the 
mississippi deltaive been behind those walls and fences he 
says you go to parchman and you think that thats it but it 
isnt if you try to improve yourself 
hes now working as a general repairman at hood petroleum co 
inc offices in hazlehurst but gholars employer says he plans to 
train him to become a manager of one of the hood convenience stores 
the program at the mansion gives you a chance to prove 
yourself gholar says everybody aint against you theyll 
trust you 
gholar was sentenced to life in prison for the 1981 fatal 
shooting of the woman he lived with in the small southern 
mississippi town of prentiss he claimed he shot her in self 
defense 
gholar had no previous criminal record but no matter how good 
his behavior at parchman gholar probably would have stayed behind 
bars much longer than the minimum 10 years before he became 
eligible for parole if he hadnt been selected for the mansion 
post says his new employer carroll hood 
hood is good friend of allains and visited the mansion often 
hes also on the state parole board 
gholar was among the four mansion servants whose sentences were 
commuted in january two for murder and two for manslaughter nix 
who has been at the mansion since 1965 says some previous 
governors had as many as eight inmates newly inaugurated gov ray 
mabus has four inmates cooking cleaning and doing other odd jobs 
the inmates live in a trailer behind the mansion because of the 
housing situation only male inmates qualify for the program nix 
says 
gov bill waller was the only mississippi governor in recent 
years to decline to use prison trusties 
a 1977 book coauthored by wallers wife carroll and 
university of mississippi history professor david sansing a 
history of the mississippi governors mansion explains how the 
tradition of commuting the sentences of the mansion trusties began 
in 1912 mississippi voters elected earl leroy brewer governor 
and theodore bilbo who later became governor and kingpin of state 
politics for many years lieutenant governor the administration 
was rife with political intrigue and bilbo was indicted 
according to the book during the sensational bribery trial 
stemming from charges against theodore bilbo and his law partner 
ga hobbs a series of anonymous threats against gov brewer and 
his family forced the governor to take special precautions to 
protect his family 
henry trott one of the trusties on duty at the mansion was 
assigned to guard brewers 6yearold daughter claudia against 
the possibility of kidnapping for several weeks henry accompanied 
the small child whenever she left the mansion 
sometime later the book says gov brewer discovered a 
note under his dinner plate in his young daughters scribbled hand 
the note read simply please set henry free 
although inmates had been used as servants at the governors 
mansion throughout mississippis history the legislature passed a 
resolution in 1912 allowing the governor a small allowance for the 
prisoners food and clothing 
customarily only negro prisoners who had been convicted of 
murder committed in passion were selected waller and sansing 
wrote beginning with gov brewer and continuing through his 
successors the inmates received an executive pardon following 
their service at the mansion partly due to the new pattern of race 
relations in mississippi and in part due to general prison reform 
and in spite of its record of success the practice was 
discontinued in the waller administration 
the practice was resumed when gov william winter succeeded 
waller in 1980 
several southern states have used inmates in their governors 
mansions in the past but anthony travisono executive director of 
the american correctional association says he doubts more than a 
few governors have convicted murderers as servants today 
as hood notes recent governors see no racial problem with the 
mansion program the majority of the parchman prisoners are black 
so its only logical that most of the mansion inmates also are 
black he says 
gholar is black but feels anything but a racial slight for 
being selected as a mansion servant hes just glad it has removed 
the stigma of being an inmate 
thats not me gholar says i aint parchman material

jobeth williams says that playing the role of 
surrogate mother mary beth whitehead in a new tv miniseries altered 
her views about the controversial baby m case 
the miniseries baby m which abc will televise sunday and 
monday tells the story of what turned into a historic custody 
battle between whitehead and william and elizabeth stern 
whitehead a new jersey homemaker signed a contract three years 
ago to bear a child for the sterns when the baby was born she 
could not give the child away and fought to keep her daughter the 
sterns were awarded custody but a new jersey superior court 
recently granted broad visitation rights to mary beth who in the 
meantime was divorced and remarried and uses the name mary beth 
whitehead gould she is also pregnant again 
the fourhour miniseries is an unauthorized show done without 
any input from whitehead or the sterns 
you would have to get all the rights or youd have to tell it 
from one viewpoint williams says 
she said whitehead declined to cooperate if the sterns 
participated 
before i became involved my sympathy more or less was with the 
sterns williams says but as i played mary beth i began to see 
her point of view i found myself more torn when i began to see 
the kind of pain both sides went through it became less easy for me 
to make a judgment 
in the beginning from what i had seen in the media mary beth 
had done some very extreme things i couldnt understand some of 
her behavior the more i got into it the more i began to see the 
kind of stress she was under and how she could do these things 
eight months of preparation and research went into the making of 
the series 
there is an enormous amount of material available on the 
case williams says i had followed the story in the papers and 
on tv but i didnt know any details but like everyone else in the 
country i was fascinated by it 
baby m also stars bruce weitz as rick whitehead mary beths 
husband john shea and robin strasser as the sterns anne jackson 
as lorraine abraham the legal guardian appointed to protect the 
babys interests dabney coleman as gary skoloff sterns attorney 
bruce mcgill as harold cassiday whiteheads attorney and dakin 
matthews as the trial judge harvey r sorkow james sadwith wrote 
and directed 
i think people are not aware of the number of people in this 
country with fertility problems williams says i was 
sympathetic to the sterns because of that 
later she says im a woman who very much wants a child i 
think mary beth subconsciously really wanted the babyrunning 
away with the baby is something i can relate to her maternal 
feelings were very strong 
the sterns signed a contract in january 1985 to pay whitehead 
10000 to become pregnant with semen from stern by artificial 
insemination she agreed to carry the child to full term and turn 
it over to the sterns at birth 
mrs stern suffers from multiple sclerosis and pregnancy would 
have been too great a risk for her whitehead at the time was the 
mother of two children 
this is the fourth time williams has played a real person she 
was reve walsh in adam and again in adam his song 
continues as the mother of the child who was kidnapped and 
murdered in florida in murder ordained she was lorna 
anderson who is now serving a prison sentence for her involvement 
in the deaths of her husband and the wife of her lover who was a 
minister in kansas 
its different when you play a real person she says you 
sort of work in a different way when you play a fictional 
character you can let your imagination run free you can find your 
own parameters 
when you play a real person you start with the physical things 
and look for the emotional links then you have to find the things 
that support those emotions you work backward its more 
challenging i would certainly never do an imitation but you do 
try to capture the essence 
before baby m williams completed memories of me with 
billy crystal and alan king she describes it as a serious story 
but adds when you get billy and alan together youre going to 
have a comedy 
williams a native of houston is best noted for such movies as 
the big chill stir crazy kramer vs kramer 
poltergeist and teachers 
this september she and kris kristofferson will star in 
passage to be directed by franklin schaffner she plays a 
woman who has long believed her husband was killed in vietnam 
until the day he comes home 
williams husband is john pasquin who specializes in directing 
pilots williams says she would do a series herself if the right 
script came along she has turned down a few that have gone on to 
become very successful

when clarence fountain was 9 years old he 
joined a gospel troupe called the happyland jubilee singers nearly 
50 years later he is still praising the lord in song 
he and the group now called clarence fountain and the five 
blind boys of alabama are appearing in the musical the gospel at 
colonus the show sets sophocles tale of oedipus the king within 
the framework of a black pentecostal church service and its rousing 
gospel music 
i learned most of my gospel singing in school says 
fountain sitting backstage at broadways luntfontanne theater 
where colonus is playing his school which went from grades 
one through 12 was the talladega institute for the deaf and blind 
in talladega ala 
fountain who has been blind since he was 2 sang in the school 
choir but gospel music was a part of his life even before that 
his father was a steward in a methodist church in selma ala 
i was the only one in the family who sang though he says 
it became something that grows on you 
the happyland jubilee singers continued to perform after 
fountain and the other members left school early to perform during 
the mid1940s in 1947 they moved to chattanooga tenn where 
they had a 15minute gospel broadcast each weekday at 645 am 
the name five blind boys of alabama was born the following 
year courtesy of a newark nj promoter who began to manage the 
troupe the blind boys would play onenight stands all over the 
country appearing in schools churches and auditoriums they 
eventually worked their way up to such places as the apollo theater 
and carnegie hall in new york and made a lot of records 
one of their songs precious lord take my hand was a best 
seller in 1953 it was a touching song fountain recalls 
people responded 
we always sang gospel fountain says that was the big 
thing you couldnt sing rock n roll and then turn around and 
sing gospel people wouldnt follow you 
a lot of those people singing rock n roll started by 
singing gospel in church people like sam cooke and aretha 
franklin there were a lot of them thats why they can sing it so 
good 
today fountain says there is a contemporary gospel sound 
religious music that has a rock n roll beat the five blind boys 
have adapted to it 
you have to keep up with the style fountain says if you 
dont keep up with the style youre automatically behind the 
times 
fountain writes some of the groups songs with sam butler who 
plays guitar for the troupe 
writing songs is just like writing a poem fountain says 
as long as it rhymes and comes out right you can take any poem 
and turn it into a song 
if fountain gets an idea for a song he turns it over in his 
head memorizes it and then tells butler who writes it down 
it was through butler that fountain and the blind boys met 
composer bob telson and director lee breuer the creators of the 
gospel at colonus 
they had the lyrics and the tunes but they didnt have the 
ingredients to go along with it fountain says its just like 
cookin bread you got the bread but you dont have the salt so it 
dont taste like bread we put the salt in 
the show has played at the walker art center in minneapolis and 
in 1983 at the brooklyn academy of music as well as all over europe 
before tackling broadway 
the gospel at colonus stars actor morgan freeman who 
narrates the church service and it features several other gospel 
groups such as jj farley and the soul stirrers and the jd 
steele singers 
but the blind boys get to sing in the evenings two 
showstopping numbers no never and lift me up they bring 
down the house 
its easier to do than a concert fountain says with a 
concert you dont rest you have to really get down in the 
musical we get a chance to breathe a little 
today fountain who has been married three times makes his 
home in detroit the rest of the blind boys live all over the 
country from north carolina to minnesota before a concert tour 
starts they all meet to rehearse their material and then hit the 
road fountain and the rev olice thomas are the only original 
members of the group still performing 
we all have good ears he says if it doesnt sound right 
we just leave it alone we all agree on one thing if it sounds 
good to us we cut a record 
my dream was to sing to the masses of people and when this 
play came along that was my dream and its happening just like i

thirteen years after the vietnam war 
noncommunist southeast asia is taking in the welcome mat for 
vietnamese boat people casting them off into a sea of uncertainty 
a recent rise in the wave of fleeing vietnamese is largely 
responsible for the new gettough policies and brings to a boil the 
longsimmering problem what to do with people nobody including 
vietnam itself seems to want 
southeast asians maintain that many vietnamese are fleeing these 
days not because of political persecution but because of 
deteriorating economic conditions at home 
the solution some officials believe might be to send them back 
people found to have fled because of political persecution do 
qualify for asylum and eventual resettlement elsewhere 
since the end of the vietnam war in 1975 neighboring nations 
have offered temporary asylum to fleeing vietnamese with the 
understanding they would be accepted by the united states canada 
britain and other western countries 
about 600000 boat people have found new homes since the war 
according to united nations statistics 
but officials in the region now talk of compassion fatigue 
throughout the world so that resettlement does not keep up with the 
tide of new boat people entering cramped refugee camps 
what were finding now is that horrifying phrase compassion 
fatigue is all too true sir david wilson the governor of hong 
kong told a recent news conference whereas we have a continuous 
flow of vietnamese refugees coming here the resettlement countries 
are not prepared to take so many 
under that pressure the policy of offering temporary asylum to 
all boat people is crumbling in thailand and malaysia and being 
reevaluted in the british colony of hong kong 
earlier this year thailand pushed back to sea vietnamese boats 
attempting to land and several deaths were reported the new 
policy brought sharp international criticism the thais backed off 
and reopened its doors but insisted the new arrivals would no 
longer be eligible for resettlement 
malaysia recently announced it will begin turning away boat 
people at some unspecified future date 
nobody wants to be hardhearted about the issue turning away 
helpless people to take their chances again with the elements and 
pirates but malaysia cannot afford to provide indefinite shelter 
for thousands of refugees the new straits times newspaper of 
malaysia said in a recent editorial 
in hong kong legislators angrily demand the colony no longer 
offer asylum while the government seeks elusive alternatives to 
the current policy that will not result in turning away boat people 
in unseaworthy craft 
vietnamese boat people began appearing in 1975 but not until 
four years later did they turn into a human tide 
southeast asian nations agreed on the temporary asylum policy in 
1979 when more than 200000 boat people poured out of vietnam and 
were presumed to be fleeing political persecution in their 
homeland which now was under a communist regime the world opened 
its arms and most of refugees were resettled within a few years 
according to the united nations high commission for refugees 
vietnamese boat people arrivals in the region declined annually 
from nearly 75000 in 1981 to about 20000 in 1986 the number of 
refugees resettled also declined during that period but always 
exceeded the number of newcomers 
last year however boat people arrivals shot up 30 percent to 
about 28000 while resettlement totals declined slightly to about 
21000 the high commission said 
some countries reported a sharp increase in arrivals this year 
as of may 2 more than 2400 boat people sailed into hong kong 
more than five times the total from the same period a year earlier 
about 40000 boat people were languishing in the regions 
refugee camps by the end of march a 27 percent increase from the 
year earlier according to un statistics nearly 34000 were in 
thailand malaysia and hong kong 
resettlement also was up in the first quarter from the same 
period last year but still was not keeping pace with new arrivals 
the un statistics showed 
one reason why boat people now receive frosty receptions is the 
widely held view that many are fleeing vietnam not for fear of 
persecution but to improve their economic conditions 
those now coming are not the traditional boat people said 
one official in bangkok thailands capital most are looking for 
better economic opportunity 
many officials in the region believe the only longterm solution 
is repatriation for such people 
i think everybody would agree that a solution that provides 
for repatriation would be the answer said fazlul karim the 
leading un refugee official in hong kong the problem is we do 
not have any workable solution yet 
the main hurdle officials say lies in getting the vietnamese 
government in hanoi to take its boat people back so far they say 
vietnam has agreed on a casebycase basis to take back the limited 
number of people who had volunteered to return 
vietnamese officials maintain that boat people are leaving 
because they are disaffected and that there is no point in taking 
them back because they wuld only try to leave again because of 
vietnams economic conditions 
while vietnam says its inability to recover from the war and the 
paucity of western economic help may be responsible for these 
conditions wilson the hong kong governor places the blame on 
hanoi 
the government of vietnam bears a very heavy responsibility 
for the appalling situation in which thousands of people continue 
to risk their lives at sea to get away he said 
even if vietnam were to allow the return of boat people says 
the un high commissions karim a system would be needed to 
screen the economic migrants to be repatriated from genuine 
political refugees 
the southeast asian nations also would have to decide what to do 
about the boat people who have received temporary asylum but remain 
in refugee camps pending resettlement 
the next likely step for the southeast asian nations is to seek 
a longterm regional solution 
the association of southeast asian nations made up of thailand 
malaysia indonesia brunei the philippines and singapore will 
discuss the refugee situation in june at a meeting also to be 
attended by hong kong

they are not soldiers but 
they live in military barracks they are not prisoners but guards 
watch over them 
soldiers and prisoners usually know when their terms are up but 
the 2000 or so vietnamese boat people at this camp have little 
idea when they will find a home 
they are not allowed to leave the prisonlike camp in hong 
kongs rural new territories about 500 miles northeast of the 
homeland they fled until the united nations arranges for their 
permanent resettlement elsewhere 
for some refugees the wait already has lasted a decade and the 
effects of lengthy confinement are reflected on their blank faces 
a woman sitting on the top deck of a threetiered bunk bed 
stares into space a man stands motionless outside his barracks 
children who have known no other life run and play 
for all the refugees the matless wooden bunks are the center of 
their lives family pictures calendars clothes and other 
belongings are packed nearby 
no one knows how long they will remain some meticulously count 
the days theyve been here 
nine months and 19 days said pham my linh 29 
you dont understand what its like in vietnam she said in 
explaining why shes doing it there are wars in cambodia and all 
17yearolds have to join the army 
she was happy this day because she had an interview with a us 
delegation the day before although she received no promises of 
going to the united states 
another refugee 17yearold le thi luyen left north vietnam 
five years ago her mother and brothers had planned to leave with 
her but could not find space on the boat 
i dont know why im here she said i was only 12 when i 
left everybody left so i left 
miss le said she is willing to return to vietnam to rejoin her 
family but dares not ask about doing so 
some people have applied to go back in 1984 but were 
refused she said 
despair also is widespread in the many other camps dotting 
southeast asia 
two vietnamese refugees recently hanged themselves one in a 
thailand camp and another in malaysia one had complained of being 
in the camp too long and going nowhere the other reportedly missed 
his family in vietnam

fierce fighting is overwhelming 
foreign relief efforts in ethiopias droughtstricken north where 
more than 3 million people are threatened with starvation 
the government expelled foreign aid workers and withdrew from 
much of the northern provinces of eritrea and tigre where rebels 
are waging war against ethiopias marxistled government in addis 
ababa 
the government now forbids food distribution to the regions 
leaving as many as 2 million people beyond the reach of the foreign 
emergency aid 
a limited emergency operation continues through the governments 
relief and rehabilitation commission and a consortium of christian 
and indigenous groups organized under the joint relief project 
after intervention by a special united nations envoy the 
government allowed un personnel to return to the area where they 
coordinate the relief efforts trucking and airlift operations 
but officials say that at most only 15 million people can be 
reached under current conditions and of that number just 1 million 
now are being fed 
overall an estimated 32 million people are in danger of 
starvation and depend on food aid following neartotal crop 
failures last year 
weve got a lot of people who are not going to get food 
said patrick johns of catholic relief services the primary 
coordinator of the joint relief projects food distribution efforts 
relief officials and diplomats are expecting hungry peasants to 
migrate from the cutoff areas 
all aid officials interviewed in addis ababa said such a mass 
movement almost certainly would create huge hunger camps like those 
of ethiopias famine of 198486 when diseases caused by 
overcrowding and unsanitary conditions accounted for many of the 
estimated 1 million deaths then 
this time people arriving at food distribution centers still 
looked relatively healthy when the foreign aid workers were 
expelled said vincent bernard of the international committee of 
the red cross which has employed about half of the foreigners 
working in the northern relief effort 
however he and others said the peasants health could 
deteriorate rapidly unless they get food 
were talking about people who cant wait days or weeks til 
their next meal said james cheek the us charge daffaires in 
addis ababa i think were going to see people moving pretty 
soon the future looks pretty grim right now 
an added complication is the thousands of local government 
officials and leaders of the marxist workers party of ethiopia who 
are fleeing rebel retaliation in the contested areas they now are 
gathered in asmara eritreas capital and in mekele in tigre 
the governments chief relief official in addis ababa berhanu 
jembere said in an interview that full relief operations would be 
resumed and foreign aid workers would be allowed to return to the 
north only after the area is cleansed of bandit activity he 
could not say when that might be 
secessionist rebels in eritrea have been fighting for 27 years 
in africas longest civil war in tigre guerrillas seeking greater 
autonomy and a say in the government took up arms in 1974 
relief officials fear the foreign aid workers were withdrawn 
from the northern provices to keep them from seeing what is 
happening in the war zone they say the governments exemption of 
un personnel from the expulsion order weakened its argument that 
the foreigners were removed from eritrea and tigre for their own 
safety 
at best they say the government hopes to avoid the 
embarrassment of foreigners becoming war casualties or the 
inconvenience of dealing with relief convoys while it tries to 
fight the rebels 
the worst case offered is that the governemnt wants to conceal a 
scorchedearth policy in the embattled territories or to hide a 
policy of genocide by starvation 
despite the limited access western diplomats and relief 
officials said they had been able to confirm a government air 
strike on an important food distribution center in the tigrean town 
of wukro which in recent weeks had fallen into rebel hands 
these sources citing accounts of eyewitnesses said the bombing 
april 8 killed at least 50 people and wounded many more minutes 
after several thousand peasants were given emergency food rations 
berhanu said he could not confirm an air attack but added that 
the governments policy against the rebels would be an eye for an 
eye if not more 
he also said the safety of the droughtsticken peasants depended 
on their own patriotism 
they are expected to join hands with the military so that the 
enemies can be wiped out he said the people themselves i 
think should decide and that decision is just to cleanse 
themselves of bandits 
the military priorities also are impinging on relief efforts in 
other provinces less severely affected by the drought but still in 
need of aid 
relief workers in hararghe province east of addis ababa and 
northern shoa north of the capital say some peasants have been 
afraid to leave their homes either to plow their fields or 
receive food rations for fear of being picked up by local 
officials and taken to the war zone 
sources say an emergency conscription is reaching into all 
corners of this north african nation to bring tens of thousands of 
ablebodied young men into military ranks to fight in the north 
the military difficulties inhibit a wellprepared relief 
operation in contrast to the food disaster three years ago when 
foreign assistance arrived too late to save many of those who died 
with the drought this time food distribution began early 
before malnourishment reached desperate levels and enough grain 
was pledged to fulfill the projected need estimated at 123 
million metric tons by the un food and agriculture organization 
but even before the expulsion of foreigners from the north and 
rebel offensives in march the war already was hindering the relief 
effort rebel attacks and land mines destroyed more than 100 trucks 
used in the relief effort and often forced the closing of roads 
over which food moved now hundreds of governentcontrolled trucks 
that had been hauling relief food have been diverted to the war 
effort 
the transportation shortage exacerbates problems at ethiopias 
two red sea ports massawa and assab where food is piling up 
without sufficient storage facilities said david morton of the 
un world food program 
were particularly concerned it could be diverted to the 
military said ambassador david macdonald of canada 
cheek the us diplomat said the united states would not allow 
its relief assistance to be administered by indigenous 
organizations whose operations were not subject to onthescene 
monitoring by foreign aid officials 
we now have a war disaster imposed on a drought disaster he 
said we have yet to solve that to figure out how in the 
context of the double disaster to perform our humanitarian 
function

in the mean terrain of northern 
ethiopia secessionist rebels and black africas biggest and 
bestarmed military force are fighting one of the worlds longest 
and most obscure wars 
every so often the conflict pops to the worlds attention only 
to fade like a smothered flare 
it has gained attention once again because a spate of recent 
rebel victories drought and a cutoff of routes for food aid have 
combined to raise the threat of famine for 32 million people in 
the area 
eritreas civil war began in 1961 against the feudal rule of 
emperor haile selassie today it is against the marxist 
sovietbacked government that ousted selassie in 1973 
the original rebel group the eritrean liberation front elf 
broke up into four groups over religious and ideological 
differences the largest and most powerful of the splinter groups 
is the marxist but antisoviet eritrean peoples liberation front 
eplf with 30000 fighters 
the elf which is predominantly moslem and conservative now 
numbers about 5000 fighters and has not been effective since its 
clash with the eplf in 197274 
the east and the west particularly the soviet union and the 
united states have a stake in the outcome of the conflict because 
of ethiopias place on the strategic horn of africa 
conservative arab states like saudi arabia kuwait egypt and 
sudan fearful of the soviet unions current influence in ethiopia 
openly support the eplf even though it is mainly christian 
because it opposes the soviet presence in ethiopia 
syria and iraq back the elf 
black africa generally has remained aloof from the conflict 
while the ethiopian government receives weapons from the soviet 
union and troops from cuba the west does not provide any similar 
support to the rebels most of their weapons and supplies are 
captured from the government 
cuba one of the first countries to back the rebels at the start 
of their campaign against selassies prowestern government nearly 
three decades ago now sides with the central government libya 
followed in cubas path 
the palestine liberation organization and israel both train the 
rebels 
president mengistu haile mariam has said his ethiopian forces 
soon will launch a major offensive against the rebels a dozen 
previous major offensives failed in the past 
the rebels have eritreas rugged terrain as their chief ally and 
they have been able to stand off 120000 ethiopian soldiers 20000 
cubans and hundreds of soviet advisers 
the rebels main tactics are hitandrun attacks and ambushes of 
government troops as they move through narrow mountainous passes 
for most of its 3000year history eritrea has been coveted by 
foreign powers and neighbors 
it is about the size of pennsylvania and has mineral resources 
including gold iron and copper none of which is exploited because 
of the war its 35 million people are mostly peasant farmers 
eritreas allure is its geographical position 
the province sits strategically at the crossroads of the horn of 
africa and the middle east commanding the gateway to the bab el 
mandab strait from the indian ocean nowadays one of the main 
routes for middle eastern oil 
its 625mile red sea coastline includes the ports of assab and 
massawa 
it has the only nonarab access to the red sea 
without eritrea ethiopia would be landlocked

colors 
 
colors marks the return of dennis hopper to directing and 
that should have been news in itself 
his 1969 easy rider changed the face of the hollywood film 
industry forever then hopper fell from grace after two decades of 
drugs and booze he turned his life around and returned as an actor 
of remarkable depth 
reportedly the insistence of sean penn resulted in hoppers 
chance to direct again a good thing colors reveals hopper as 
a filmmaker of great skill though a glimmer remains of the 
indulgences that contributed to his downfall 
as a director of action hopper is superlative just when you 
think you had seen every kind of car chase he provides one through 
the streets and back alleys of los angeles that is truly 
breathtaking and a fugitives rampage through a crowded 
restaurant pursued by penn is a kinetic wonder 
on the downside hopper betrays his existential tendencies 
staging confrontational scenes that have no real motivation or 
payoff this partly may be due to michael schiffers rather 
formless script 
penn and duvall are unlikely partners on the gang war scene 
duvall is nearing retirement a cool head who tries to establish a 
rapport with gang members penn is hotheaded and himself prone to 
violence both try to act as un peacemakers in the growing war 
between the bloods and the cripps 
colors manages to portray the gang members as human beings 
not senseless criminals penn who may be the brando of his 
generation continues his string of impressive performances and 
duvall performs with his usual authority maria conchita alonso is 
wasted as the obligatory love interest 
the orion release was produced by robert h solo and scored with 
fine thumping style by herbie hancock the r rating is well 
deserved because of the street language violence nudity and sex

white mischief 
 
while europe broiled with the ravages of world war ii british 
colonists frolicked at happy valley near nairobi kenya the war 
for them was a distant thunder theirs was a life of sex drugs and 
endless perversions mirroring the downside and downfall of the 
british empire 
michael radford captures that aristocratic decadence in columbia 
pictures white mischief a nelson entertainment and goldcrest 
release starring sarah miles charles dance and greta scacchi 
the arrogant and carefree earl of erroll dance leads the pack 
in a round of parties costume balls group sex club romps polo 
matches and horse races he has had affairs with every white woman 
in the area and possibly some black african women as well 
into his seedy sphere steps the eversostraight sir jock delves 
broughton joss ackland a reserved 57yearold and his sensual 
27yearold bride diana scacchi with one smoldering glance 
erroll and diana soon find their way to bed and a tumultuous affair 
that leads to his murder 
jock is put on trial for the homicide and acquitted but in the 
aftermath his colder more vicious side is revealed and the happy 
valley community realizes its last gasp 
one would think that decadence and death would be good fodder 
for a fastpaced flick but white mischief is like a 
puritanical stripteaser it promises more than it delivers 
still there are some outstanding performances and delicious 
dialogue especially from sarah miles as the kinky alice de janze 
alice who bed hops with the best of them is said to have murdered 
her first husband during the trial reference is made to this 
without naming her later reporters ask alice if shes the woman 
in question her response which one the woman who killed her 
husband the reporter says which one she deadpans 
her straightfaced equal is john hurt who has a much too small 
role as the rancher who also sets his sights on diana 
acklands cuckolded broughton is perfect in his restraint 
dance however seems almost miscast he is not a looker nor 
particularly sensual but he makes his character full of 
indifference with unbridled decadence and that is the mood we are 
to feel throughout

export subsidies liberal credit and food aid 
have become increasingly important parts of us agricultural 
trade efforts the agriculture department says are needed to help 
the american farmer meet foreign competition 
the export enhancement program is the hottest program at 
present and is being used in a virtual headtohead confrontation 
with the european economic community over trade policy 
us exporters operate in a competitive trade environment 
influenced by other exporters subsidies and importers barriers 
says analyst mark smith of the departments economic research 
service 
for example the eec operates a system of export subsidies which 
enables highpriced wheat from the 12nation trading bloc to be 
sold on world markets at competitive prices he said since 1978 
the eec has joined the traditional big four argentina australia 
canada and the united states as a wheat exporter 
it was the use of export subsidies to reduce high internal 
prices that enabled the eec to change from a net importer of wheat 
to a net exporter 
the united states had used some kinds of export subsidies in the 
past but it was the advent of the export enhancement program or 
eep in 1985 that caught the attention of world traders 
under the program us exporters are given bonuses or 
subsidies of governmentowned commodities to compensate for 
reduced prices paid by a foreign buyer the usda does this only for 
the sale of certain commodities to designated countries 
as of april 28 exporters had sold more than 481 billion worth 
of commodities to foreign buyers that is the amount paid by the 
overseas customers 
the exporters then collected bonuses of surplus commodities 
owned by the departments commodity credit corp those bonuses or 
subsidies had a ccc book value of 286 billion the amount the 
ccc had paid for them under its domestic price support operations 
but the actual market value of the bonus commodities was less 
than 205 billion reflecting their estimated worth on the us 
domestic market at the time 
thus according to the figures supplied by the departments 
foreign agricultural service the commodities sold by exporters for 
481 billion would have cost the foreign buyers at least 686 
billion if it had not been for the 205 billion in the market 
value of the bonuses 
in other words the bonuses reduced the purchase prices of the 
eep commodities by about 30 percent 
since the program began three years ago more than 40 million 
metric tons of us wheat have been sold at subsidized prices the 
agency said although wheat is by far the largest eep commodity 
other items include barley sorghum rice poultry feed vegetable 
oil frozen poultry live dairy cattle and eggs 
in his report smith said the chief markets for wheat under eep 
have been the soviet union china morocco algeria and egypt 
saudi arabia has been the main barley purchaser 
smiths analysis in the may issue of agricultural outlook 
magazine refers to other export programs as well as eep those 
include programs for shortterm export credit financing targeted 
export assistance or tea in which producer groups are helped to 
carry out overseas promotional activities and food for peace or 
pl 480 assistance for needy countries 
although the impact of tea is difficult to measure smith said 
the other programs account for a significant share of us 
commodity exports in the case of wheat for example 60 percent to 
70 percent of the exports in the 198687 fiscal year that ended 
sept 30 were covered by usda programs 
four of the top five markets for us wheat in 1987 were chief 
markets for wheat under the eep ccc credit guarantees or food 
aid he said japan the top market in value terms for us 
wheat was the exception purchasing its wheat outside us export 
programs 
but the soviet union the secondlargest buyer used the eep 
program extensively egypt and algeria which were third and fifth 
last year bought us wheat under a combination of eep and the 
export credit program south korea which was the fourthlargest 
market also bought significant amounts through credit arrangements 
smith said that more than half of the 1987 exports of vegetable 
oils involved us programs primarily credit and food aid rice 
also benefited including credit sales to iraq and food aid 
shipments to the dominican republic and sierra leone 
the united states holds about 60 percent of the world feed grain 
trade up from a low of 45 percent two years ago he said most 
export sales are without the use of us export programs cotton is 
another major commodity that is not involved in the programs in a 
major way

japanese automakers will claim a larger share of 
the us automobile market without having to boost exports because 
they will build more cars in this country according to a new study 
japans market share will grow as that of general motors corp 
ford motor co and chrysler corp shrinks according to booz allen 
amp hamilton inc a new yorkbased management firm 
the analysis was released last week in washington during a 
meeting of the society of automotive engineers government and 
industry panel and reported in sunday editions of the detroit news 
the analysis predicted that by 1990 
new plants will add about 30000 jobs but not all will be 
unionized 
us automakers share of the domestic market will fall to 56 
percent compared with 68 percent in 1987 
japanese automakers us market share will pass 30 percent as 
production at north american factories increases while import 
levels stay at 22 million a year 
in the late 1970s as imported japanese cars zoomed in 
popularity cries of trade protectionism were heard in turn the 
japanese instituted voluntary restraints on the number of cars 
exported to the united states every year 
but since honda north america inc opened an auto assembly plant 
in december 1982 in marysville ohio japanese companies have been 
building increasing numbers of cars in the united states sometimes 
in joint ventures with one of the big three automakers 
its going to be more and more difficult to define what is a 
us company in the near future said james mateyka a vice 
president with the management firms office in bethesda md 
after honda adds its engine and transmission plants in the 
united states will it be less american than ford or gm he 
asked 
by 1990 japanese production in the united states will reach 
about 22 million cars a year about the same as import 
restrictions allow said the analysis

the bank of england intervened in the foreign 
exchange market to stem a surge in the pound as rumors flew monday 
that chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson was planning to 
resign dealers said 
the intervention was light to moderate dealers said 
a bank of england official declined to comment on the reports of 
intervention a treasury official denied the rumors about lawson 
neither official was identified in accordance with british custom 
the pound rose to 18785 by midday local time from 18730 in 
london on friday it was quoted well above 31300 west german marks 
at 31587 marks 
dealers said sterling began to climb in overnight trading in 
the wake of a bullish report by the investment firm goldman sachs 
international corp which was highlighted in the sunday times 
in the report goldman sachs chief international economist david 
morrison said the pound was significantly undervalued against the 
deutsche mark and could climb over the next few months 
the report contended that british industry would still be 
competitive if the pound rose as high as 327 marks 
dealers said the report served as an excuse to buy pounds 
rumors that lawson would resign sent sterling surging in the 
early afternoon before the intervention took place dealers said 
lawson favors intervention to stem the pounds rise 
when lawson stated on march 10 that any further rise in the 
pounds rise could not be sustained the pound stood at 308 marks 
lawson clashed at that time with prime minister margaret 
thatcher who said the pound should be allowed to rise in foreign 
exchange markets to contain inflation 
morrisons report argued that fears that the pounds rise could 
lead to the devastation of british industry were totally unfounded 
and he said lawsons quest for stability was illfounded 
morrison said the british economys growth rate this year will 
be double west germanys and that while britain has a budget 
surplus west germany is facing an exploding budget deficit 
higher even than americas as a percentage of national income 
at the same time the american economy is on course for higher 
inflation than britain by the end of this year and is saddled with 
huge trade and budget deficits for the forseeable future morrison 
said 
he said the pound could surge over the next few months perhaps 
to 320 marks and 2 
people dont appreciate how dynamic the british economy has 
become morrison said 
he said that because of britains lack of political worries and 
its budget surplus foreign investors see britain as a more 
attractive country in which to invest than the united states or 
west germany 
the sunday times said the goldman sachs report contradicts a 
widely held view in the city of london financial district that 
sterling will slide in response to a rising balance of payments 
deficit 
morrison said the balance of payments deficit in prospect for 
this year which he expects to be between 5 billion and 6 billion 
pounds or 935 and 1122 billion can be readily financed 
without any increase in interest rates 
he said britain has no fundamental balance of payments problem

global economic upheavals such as the october 
stock market collapse show that the world urgently needs a new 
monetary system according to a study released today 
the study sponsored by the institute for international 
economics concludes that the international agreements by which the 
reagan administration has tried to manage the dollar over the past 
three years have proven agonizingly fragile 
the agreements did not go far enough because of political 
obstacles in the united states japan and west germany the study 
says 
the possibility of backsliding overcommitting or reneging 
has continually threatened the credibility of these deals said 
yoichi funabashi the studys author 
the study is titled managing the dollar from the plaza to the 
louvre it traces the effort beginning in september 1985 to 
weaken the dollar as a way of lowering the huge us trade deficits 
the administration reached an agreement with japan west 
germany britain and france at the plaza hotel in new york in which 
the five nations pledged to force the dollar lower through a 
process known as intervention by which governments buy and sell 
currencies in the open market to influence their value 
the administration which for years had boasted about the 
dollars upward surge abruptly reversed course after james a 
baker iii took over as treasury secretary from donald t regan 
baker believed a weaker dollar was needed to fight growing 
protectionist sentiment in a congress alarmed by the soaring trade 
deficit 
a weaker dollar makes american products more competitive on 
overseas markets while making imports more expensive in the united 
states 
the united states and its allies switched course again in 
february 1987 with the louvre agreement which said that the dollar 
had declined far enough the nations pledged to intervene in 
currency markets to defend the dollar against continued downward 
pressure 
despite that pledge the us currency has come under repeated 
selling pressure because of the stubbornly high us trade deficit 
which last year hit a record 1712 billion the downward pressure 
on the dollar and efforts by the federal reserve to prop up its 
value by raising us interest rates last fall were two of the 
factors cited in the oct 19 stock market crash 
financial markets remain convinced that the dollar will have to 
fall farther to correct the trade deficits 
the united states has become the worlds largest debtor nation 
as americans have transferred billions of dollars into the hands of 
foreigners to pay for japanese cars korean television sets and 
french wines 
americas new status as a net debtor makes it imperative for the 
new administration to intensify efforts at international 
cooperation the study said 
the study recommended building on the approach established by 
the louvre agreement by which each nations currency is placed in 
a socalled target zone and any time the currency moves outside the 
agreedupon zone nations launch actions including intervention to 
bring it back into line 
the study said the united states bargaining position would be 
strengthened if the administration made a greater effort to include 
congress in the economic decisionmaking process since such needed 
changes as reducing the federal budget deficit can only be 
accomplished through congressional action 
the study based on interviews with many of the officials 
involved reveals some key details of the secret negotiations over 
the past three years 
the administrations changed position from a handsoff approach 
to the dollar to actively trying to push it lower was engineered by 
thendeputy treasury secretary richard darman a key baker aide who 
has been behind many of the administrations most successful 
economic initiatives darman detailed the proposed change in a 
secret memo to baker in the spring of 1985 soon after baker the 
white house chief of staff in reagans first term swapped jobs 
with regan 
funabashi says the original goal of the plaza accord was to 
drive down the dollars value by between 10 percent and 12 percent 
through an intensive sixweek intervention effort with a price tag 
of 18 billion this goal was realized 
the louvre accord signed in paris in february 1987 sought to 
stabilize exchange rates keeping the dollar from falling by more 
than 5 percent from a base of 1535 yen to the dollar 
the dollar has continued to fall however and now stands around 
125 yen down almost 50 percent from its peak of 2637 yen in 
february 1985 
funabashi who has covered economics for 20 years is the deputy 
editor of economic affairs for the japanese newspaper the asahi 
shimbun he wrote the dollar study during a year in which he was a 
visiting fellow at the institute for international economics a 
sevenyearold washington think tank funded by grants from various 
foundations including the german marshall fund and the ford 
foundation

saudi arabia is drafting a new charter 
for arabianamerican oil co cutting its legal ties to the united 
states but seeking joint ventures with the four us oil companies 
that formerly owned the oil giant an oil newsletter reported 
the middle east economic survey said monday that aramco will 
probably be called saudi national oil coaramco 
aramco is the largest oilproducing company in the noncommunist 
world it is currently incorporated in delaware 
the restructured company will be the vehicle for the kingdoms 
drive to establish a substantial presence in the downstream 
refining and marketing industry overseas by means of joint 
ventures with the former aramco parents as well as with others 
editor ian seymour wrote in the authoritative newsletter 
he said the new aramco will retain its technical and managerial 
assistance contracts with the four former aramco parents exxon 
corp mobil corp texaco inc and chevron corp but not 
necessarily with the same contracts or the same terms 
there could also be scope for similar assistance agreements with 
other companies seymour said 
he mentioned press reports of a deal under which saudi arabia 
would acquire 50 percent of texacos major refining amd marketing 
assets 
the effort to establish joint ventures in refining and marketing 
in oilconsuming countries is designed to counter oil price 
instability by providing secure outlets for saudi crude secure 
supplies for the nonsaudi partners and good profits for both 
parties seymour wrote 
the presence of a foreign partner to provide local knowhow in 
the market concerned is regarded as an absolute prerequisite for 
the saudi newcomer he said the objective is to have an 
integrated national oil company controlled managed and operated by 
saudis 
for years aramco founded in 1933 controlled the production and 
sale of saudi crude oil paying royalties to the saudi government 
in 1973 saudi arabia bought a 25 percent share in aramco and a 
year later raised its stake to 60 percent in 1980 it acquired full 
control 
as recently as 1986 aramco still had nearly 4000 us 
employees including many top executives 
this year saudi oil minister hisham nazer was appointed chairman 
and another saudi ali naimi president since 1984 was named chief 
executive 
seymour said the charter for the restructured aramco was being 
discussed by a ministerial committee set up by saudi king fahd 
aramco now produces around 4 million barrels of saudi oil a day 
it refines 450000 barrels a day at ras tanura on saudi arabias 
gulf coast a barrel is the equivalent of 42 gallons 
the company markets crude through its offices at dhahran saudi 
arabia and through an international affiliate with offices in new 
york houston and tokyo

the worst is over for houstons ailing office 
market and a longterm recovery is gaining momentum that should 
increase occupancy over the next four years researchers said 
most economic indicators point to a bottoming of the market in 
the first half of last year said rice center vice president james 
p gaines who oversees the organizations houston real estate 
forecasting system 
since then weve had positive absorption positive job growth 
and generally positive economic indices gaines said we are 
forecasting a good year for office absorption with just over 2 
million square feet absorbed in 1988 
by 1991 or 1992 the city should not only see marked 
improvements in employment but office absorption should increase 
to between 37 million and 6 million square feet gaines said 
if a national economic downturn occurs in late 1989 or early 
1990 however about 40 percent less space will be absorbed gaines 
said 
yet even during the recession that is predicted by rice centers 
computer models office space absorption the difference between 
the amount of space at the beginning of a certain period and the 
amount at the end will remain positive albeit less robust 
assuming that no more buildings are constructed the overall 
occupancy rate in 1992 is projected to be approximately 81 percent 
which is halfway between the current rate of 70 percent and a 
marginally healthy rate of 90 percent gaines said for class 
a office space however the occupancy rate is expected to be 
slightly above 88 percent by 1992 
a class a building is generally of a highquality finish is new 
or competitive with new structures and has a excellent location 
the largest office market in terms of square footage if 
houstons central business district rice center forecasts an 
overall occupancy rate this year in the central district of 801 
percent with class a buildings having more tenants and a better 
occupancy rate of 84 percent

the champaignurbana newsgazette 
announced monday it will begin printing its newspaper june 1 with 
ink made from soybean oil 
editor john foreman said a commitment to the farm economy 
was the main factor in the decision to become the first illinois 
newspaper to use soy ink full time 
its an acknowledgement that we can use a product thats 
produced in champaign county and do something to boost prospects 
for the eastcentral illinois economy foreman said if we can 
do that and if enough papers do it its going to make a 
difference 
the newspaper conducted a trial in march printing its annual 
farm edition with soy ink and decided the new product worked at 
least as well as conventional newspaper ink 
the most recent estimates indicate soy ink will cost about 
onethird more than conventional lowrub ink but as the demand for 
it increases the price could decrease 
it should come down as more people use it said bill 
stodola pressroom manager at the cedar rapids iowa gazette 
and with the oil situation the way it is abroad who knows 
someday soy ink may end up being cheaper than petroleum ink 
the cedar rapids newspaper began using soy ink last year and 
stodola said said the soy oil makes colors brighter and helps 
prevent the ink from rubbing off on readers hands 
bill tiberend of the land of lincoln soybean association in 
bloomington praised the newsgazettes decision he said he would 
try to persuade other newspapers to do the same 
youre going to be using the soybeans that would be grown by a 
farmer on about 200 acres if he had 50bushel yieldstiberend 
said and if every daily in the state the size of the 
newsgazette changed it would use up 15438 acres of beans a 
year 
tiberend said the land of lincoln soybean association will 
declare the week of june 26 as soybean ink week in the state in its 
efforts to get every newspaper to try the new product

maxtor corp said monday it had built the 
fastest compact disk recorder yet and would bring the datastorage 
device to the market by september 
the tahiti i gives maxtor an edge over other companies such as 
tandy corp sony corp sharp corp and eastman kodak cos 
verbatim corp that are trying to use the laser technology of 
compact disks for storing computerized information analysts said 
they have the most advanced product thats yet been 
announced said robert katzive vice president of disk trend 
inc a market research firm based in mountain view calif 
a highcapacity erasable compact disk that works with the 
maxtor player was announced by philips and du pont optical a joint 
venture of du pont co and nv philips of the netherlands other 
companies will also supply disks 
the system was demonstrated monday at the comdex spring computer 
trade show in atlanta 
compact disks although popular for music have had trouble 
catching on in data storage because they could not be rewritten and 
it took much longer to find pieces of data stored on them 
maxtor said its tahiti i which uses 5inch disks could find a 
piece of data on a disk in an average of less than 30 thousandths 
of a second that makes it more than three times as fast as most 
other compact disk drives and competitive with all but the fastest 
magnetic harddisk drives 
the tahiti i can also erase and rewrite a disk many times 
without causing deterioration 
maxtor based in san jose calif is a leader in the 
traditional kind of datastorage devices which use magnetic heads 
instead of lasers to read and write information on disks compact 
disks have the advantage of much greater storage capacity 
the whole industry is going to watch to see if in fact they 
are on time on that september delivery date katzive said 
but people who have discounted maxtor in the past have eventually 
regretted it 
maxtor said its tahiti i would sell wholesale for about 2500 
a smaller and slower model the fiji i uses 3inch disks and will 
sell wholesale for under 1000 maxtor said 
maxtor said the technology for the fiji i was jointly developed 
with another company which it did not name disks for that device 
will be supplied by seikoepson and other companies 
more than 50 computer companies planned product announcements 
during the fourday comdex trade show that opened in atlanta 
monday the event will draw about 60000 visitors to the massive 
georgia world congress center and the nearby atlanta apparel mart 
where more than 850 manufacturers will be pushing their wares 
hard and soft 
attention at the show was expected to focus on clones of 
international business machine corps personal system2 computer 
tandy corp and dell computer corp already have announced their 
ps2 clones and those and others were expected to be on display

the decade has only about 2000 remaining on indefinite layoff 
the others were recalled or dropped off the recall rolls after 
several years 
in recent months we have in certain locations been able to 
hire new people because even these 2000 people with recall rights 
are limited by certain restrictions to plants in their area ford 
spokesman tom foote told the associated press 
its on a small scale just a smattering here and there he 
said its been going on for a few months 
the latest hiring process takes about a month a big change from 
practices of the past when a worker hired friday was put on the 
assembly line monday new workers are put up in a hotel and given a 
week of orientation by the company and the union 
william novotny time standards representative at united auto 
workers local 879 at fords twin cities truck plant in st paul 
minn said it represents a totally new way of hiring 
at the twin cities plant about 50 workers will be chosen from 
among 2000 applicants novotny said about 150 workers already 
have been hired at the plant most of whom have never worked in an 
auto plant said local 879 chairman doug knight 
the new workers include former teachers and members of the 
military 
some of the applicants not selected were children of current 
workers who failed drug tests novotny said drug use is one of the 
biggest problems in auto plants although few union officials want 
to discuss it publicly 
that has caused some heartbreak novotny said but it will 
make a better work place in the long run 
in addition to twin cities ford also has been hiring at its 
wixom assembly plant which builds the lincoln town car and 
continental at its climate control division plant in plymouth and 
at its plastic products division plant in milan those three plants 
are outside detroit 
the hiring has been prompted by new uaw contract rules that 
allow workers who took jobs at other plants to return to their home 
plants as openings occur when they leave ford often has to hire 
new workers to replace them 
by comparison general motors corp the nations largest 
automaker is doing no new hiring because it still has 60000 
workers on indefinite layoff and is shrinking some of its 
operations 
chrysler corp has at least 8000 workers on indefinite layoff

lucky stores inc said monday it has 
provided confidential information to rival american stores inc in 
exchange for an agreement that it will sweeten or end its hostile 
takeover bid by may 17 
lucky said it continues to recommend that its shareholders 
accept the leveraged buyout offer of 61 a share or 235 billion 
made on april 28 by the new york investment firm gibbons green 
van amerongen ltd 
but analysts said salt lake citybased american stores remains a 
strong contender under the new agreement which lucky said also 
provides a number of protections to its stockholders 
my continuing belief is that american stores will acquire 
lucky said edward comeau of wood gundy corp in new york from 
the beginning it was apparent that american badly wanted lucky 
needed lucky and can afford to pay more for it than anyone else 
lucky closed down 375 cents a share at 6137 on the new york 
stock exchange american stores stock fell 50 cents a share to 
5975 
american stores which initiated the bidding with a 45ashare 
offer that lucky rejected in march is the owner of the alpha beta 
grocery chain with an acquisition of lucky the nations 
sixthlargest supermarket chain american stores would surpass no 
1 kroger co of cincinnati to become the industry leader 
the lucky transaction would be by far the biggest ever for the 
gibbonsled buyout group which specializes in leveraged buyouts 
if lucky breaks the merger agreement the new york investment firm 
must be paid a 20 million fee plus expenses 
comeau said a supermarket chain can afford to pay more than 
anyone making a leveraged buyout 
when you put supermarket chains together one plus one equals 
three because of synergistic and strategic benefits he said 
ron rotter an analyst with morgan olmstead kennedy and 
gardner in los angeles said he would not be surprised if american 
stores makes a new offer even though the pending bid is fairly 
valued 
if this operation is worth 61 to an independent party it 
should be worth more to american stores which could reap many 
benefits by integrating luckys operations into their operations 
rotter said

international business machines corp said 
monday it had produced the first fully functioning computer chips 
to have features measuring just a half micron across 
the microscopically compact chips were made for the defense 
department by ibms federal systems facility in manassas va the 
company said they will be used for such things as capturing and 
processing radar and sonar signals 
this is a significant technological milestone for ibm and the 
us department of defense william gianopulos laboratory 
director of ibm in manassas said in a news release 
ibm is leading the pack sonny maynard the director of the 
defense departments very high speed integrated circuit program 
said in the release 
honeywell inc and trw inc the other two companies that have 
defense contracts to develop halfmicron chips have not completed 
theirs yet trw spokesman timothy dolan said the company was on 
schedule toward a september 1989 deadline on its selfhealing 
super chip which will have about 4 million transistors 
compared to about 100000 for ibms chip 
honeywell spokeswoman susan eich said her company was also on 
schedule 
compact chips run faster because the electricity has less 
distance to travel a micron is onemillionth of a meter or about 
onehundredth the thickness of a sheet of typing paper 
ibms contract with the pentagon restricts how ibm can use the 
halfmicron technology for its commercial products spokesman mark 
root said 
chip companies such as intel corp and advanced micro devices 
inc are planning new fabrication lines for halfmicron chips 
according to scott hudson a market research analyst for integrated 
circuit engineering corp in scottsdale ariz 
this is what all the semiconductor makers are shooting for 
hudson said

billion in annual sales and reported revenue of 18 billion in
