for nearly two years a west german citizen 
gained access to more than 30 computers belonging to the us 
military and military contractors according to a published report 
the new york times reported in mondays editions that the west 
german searched for data related to nuclear weapons intelligence 
satellites the strate initiative the space shuttle and 
the north american air defense command 
the times quoting computer security experts said he did not 
gain access to any classified information or break into a 
secure government computer where classified information is 
stored 
an fbi spokesman confirmed sunday that the matter was under 
investigation 
a west german magazine quick detailed the case last week and 
identified the intruder as mathias speer 24 a computer science 
student in hanover the fbi would not confirm his identity the 
times said 
the electronic breakins may have gone on for a year before 
being discovered in august 1986 the newspaper said 
they were monitored for a year and traced the times said and 
in june 1987 the west german and an american who may have been an 
accomplice apparently were questioned by authorities the breakins 
stopped about the same time 
this kind of penetration could clearly have been used for 
espionage peter g neumann a computer security expert familiar 
with the case told the times i think most of the attacks before 
this have been relatively benign on a global scale this one is 
much more insidious 
computer managers at the lawrence berkeley laboratory in 
berkeley calif which is involved in broadbased unclassified 
scientific research discovered the intrusions the times said 
the laboratory and its sister institution the lawrence 
livermore laboratory which is involved nuclear weapons research 
and sdi are operated by the university of california for the 
federal government 
the breakins involved a variety of us military computer 
systems in this country europe and japan the times said 
including systems at the naval coastal systems command in panama 
city fla the air force systems command in el segundo calif 
the pentagons optimus data base and nasas jet propulsion

a firefighter who pleaded guilty to 
raping a young girl has agreed to make of videotape of his 
confession in order to warn parents that respectable people can be 
child abusers officials said 
john roper was given probation after he agreed to make the tape 
and to apologize for saying he had been falsely accused 
roper represents a typical child molester that is so difficult 
to convict deputy district attorney bob mcgregor said 
hes nice looking had a good job had children of his own 
wellthought of in the community people want to believe that the 
only ones who molest children are the dirtyold men in raincoats 
roper pleaded guilty to firstdegree rape he was charged last 
year with firstdegree rape and firstdegree sexual assault in a 
case involving an 11yearold girl 
circuit judge joseph jasper who had sentenced roper to 15 years 
in prison earlier this month granted him probation the sexual 
abuse charge was dropped as part of the plea bargain 
roper must make the apology tonight to his former coworkers at 
a fire house in suburban hoover for saying the victims mother 
fabricated the story 
the videotape must be made at his expense by july and will be 
used by prescott house a center for child abuse victims to 
educate the public about child sex abuse 
the victims mother said her agreement to probation was based on 
concern about her child having to testify in a trial and her belief 
that the videotape would help other children 
all children in alabama would benefit she said 
defense attorney doug jones called the case a breakthrough 
the ultimate outcome offers a significant way to help the 
community with regard to these cases jones said we gave up 
some things they gave up some things 
jones said roper who resigned as a firefighter already has 
been punished 
the probation agreement requires roper to seek psychiatric help 
which jones said roper began receiving last year

on the one hand michael dukakis has won all 
of two elections in a row and on a good day he draws maybe half the 
crowd and a quarter of the enthusiasm of jesse jackson 
on the other hand over the past 12 days dukakis won an 
invisible primary the size of new jersey and quietly boosted his 
claim on the democratic presidential nomination 
in the hiatus between wisconsins primary almost two weeks ago 
and tuesdays voting in new york dukakis picked up pledges from 
105 national convention delegates and he won another 22 in 
saturdays arizona caucuses 
hes being called el nuevo kennedy in the barrios around 
phoenix the governors western coordinator richard ybarra 
enthused after dukakis defeated jackson and shut out sen albert 
gore jr in arizona 
all told the massachusetts governor stretched his delegate 
margin from a measly 36 to a more substantial 134 
where did all these delegates come from 
half came from puerto rico where gov rafael hernandezcolon 
delivered his blessing and 52 previously uncommitted delegates 
but the 53 other pledges may prove more significant for they 
may signify the first rumblings of an establishment bandwagon 
they came from among the socalled super delegates democratic 
party leaders and officeholders who are beholden to no one and free 
to vote their consciences or to sniff the political winds 
the nomination of dukakis seems all but inevitable except when 
you consider that he faces a stiff test from jackson on tuesday in 
new york and his 872delegate total remains far below the 2082 
needed to win nomination in atlanta 
the popular wisdom is that mike has been a frontrunner from 
the beginning in new york but i said 10 weeks ago that you 
should not take the polls too seriously and that jesse could win 
gov mario cuomo says of the dukakisjackson battle i dont 
think anything has changed since then 
gore is the wild card if he does well it could hurt dukakis 
i dont think theres any doubt that he gore is stronger now 
than he was a couple of weeks ago cuomo said sunday jesse is 
doing well because he draws crowds theyre enthusiastic and that 
may be the very best barometer of all 
dukakis concerned that his ethnic support may be soft and his 
backers must be motivated to vote had some influential surrogates 
campaigning in new york city on sunday 
he brought in one of the notsonuevo kennedys sen edward 
kennedy of massachusetts for a bringoutthevote effort and after 
marching in a salute to israel parade he attended a gaelic 
football game and a reception with gov hernandezcolon 
gore was touring hispanic italian and jewish neighborhoods 
while jackson met with community leaders in a session set up by one 
of his most prominent jewish supporters 
yet for all the attention new york is not the only election 
being held tuesday congressional democrats will caucus tuesday 
and wednesday to choose their super delegates to the atlanta 
convention 
most members were nominated in closeddoor party meetings 
last week and dukakis did very well on both sides of the capitol 
even in the senate which is home to two of his remaining rivals 
most senate delegates remain uncommitted but nine are lined up 
with dukakis gore picked up just four pledges from his colleagues 
as well as his own and sen paul simon who doggedly maintains a 
onestate strategy had two pledges his own and that of fellow 
illinois sen alan dixon 
jackson won no pledges from the senate but fared better in the 
house where 142 memberdelegates are still uncommitted dukakis 
has pledges from 26 jackson 15 gore 12 and simon 10 most of them 
from illinois 
these super delegate pledges provide timely assistance for 
dukakis because while hes favored to win new york has there ever 
been a more invisible frontrunner 
the crowds drawn to jackson and the new york city mayor ed 
koch drawn to gore practically drove dukakis off the local 
newscasts except when he was under attack by the tennessee senator 
delegate counters for the massachusetts governor do not expect 
anyone no matter who wins to pick up more than 150 of the 255 
delegates at stake in new york but thats a lot of delegates in 
the splintered democratic environment it would put dukakis almost 
halfway to a nominating majority

former television evangelist pat robertson 
insists hes not one for tilting at windmills but his refusal 
to lay down his lance formally is posing a few tactical problems 
for vice president george bush 
for one thing it may be helping to keep president reagan on the 
sidelines even though robertsons campaign poses no real obstacle 
to bushs march to the gop nomination 
reagan vowed to remain neutral in the contest so long as there 
was a battle among republicans even though his active support for 
bush was a foregone conclusion 
after bushs main competitor sen bob dole of kansas dropped 
out the white house hinted that reagan wanted to start stumping 
for bush but so far he hasnt scheduled any appearances 
bush has 922 delegates and after the new york primary on tuesday 
may have as many as 970 within easy grasp of the 1039 needed for 
the republican nomination by contrast robertson has a scant 17 
delegates 
bush is still behaving as if he has some competition for the 
nomination he campaigned last week in new york and today begins 
an ohio and pennsylvania swing in anticipation of primaries in 
those states in the next two weeks 
robertsons vow to energize people who support me on issues 
also raises the possibility of a platform battle at the gop 
convention one bush strategists would like to avoid 
for his part robertson has made no effort to contact bush or to 
try to mend fences according to the bush camp 
i think hes plowed under bush said in a recent 
conversation with reporters on air force ii 
asked if some prominent republican perhaps dole might serve as 
a mediator between the two camps bush said we dont need any 
mediation we need our facts clear 
bush still has not spoken to robertson even though the two were 
backtoback speakers last friday before the american association 
of newspaper editors in washington 
robertson still appears to be smarting at the drubbing he 
received from bush insisting to the newspaper executives on friday 
that there were no differences in either education or income 
level of those supporting him and those supporting bush 
the major difference robertson suggested is that george bush 
was regarded as reagan the second or whatever so they were voting 
again for the man who they have voted for twice before 
reaganbush i dont think anybody could have done much better 
im not don quixote i dont believe in tilting at windmills 
its obvious from the delegate count that has come out that george 
bush is going to be the nominee 
but still robertson remains the only candidate of the original 
five republicans challenging bush for the nomination to persist in 
the face of the vice presidents steamrolling candidacy dole 
former delaware gov pete du pont former secretary of state 
alexander haig jr and rep jack kemp of new york have all formally 
withdrawn releasing their delegates in the process 
suggestions that robertson feels he has been unfairly treated in 
the process are absurd bush has said 
bush spokesman peter teeley said no efforts have been made by 
bush or his advisers to try to persuade robertson to bow out 
gracefully 
it would not be proper teeley said 
however the aide said his campaign for the most part is 
dormant hes doing very little traveling its almost as if his 
campaign is nonexistent 
robertsons campaign has acknowledged he has spent nearly all 
the money allowed for the primary season under federal spending 
limits he has laid off most of his staff and confined his 
campaigning to an occasional trip 
as for reagans nonparticipation teeley suggested that might 
change once we have the delegates to go over the top 
according to an associated press delegate count that will come 
no later than may 3 possibly even soonerklzkl c

is about 2 percent of the states 135000 registered democrats

shipley said 
we have an inspiring and fervent and committed group of people 
who think this is going to be a jackson state said vivian

the vote will be awarded delegates to the state convention

delaware since september she said she expects the predominantly 
black 2nd and 3rd representative districts in wilmington to go to 
jackson but she also predicted he omooghout the 
state 
organizers for massachusetts gov michael dukakis have been in 
the state for about a month cynthia r drucker dukakis state 
director saiwrces caused a late start but was 
upbeat about her candidates prospects 
we have a good organization in place were going district by 
district to get the message out to delaware democrats its a 
message of a candidate that can beat bush in november she said 
sen albert gore jr has no organization in delaware

april 25 they will select delegates to the partys state 
convention may 14

r biden jr both homestate candidates subsequently dropped out of 
their respective races

federal investigators havr evidence suggesting 
the nations hospitals are making billions of dollars extra by 
admitting patients who could be treated better and cheaper without 
hospitalization 
a draft report prepared by the inspector generals office of the 
department of health and human services concludes that hospitals 
probably were paid about 2 billion by medicare in 1985 to treat 
patients who should not have been hospitalized in the first place 
although an estimated 939 million would have been spent 
providing care to these patients in other medical settings 
reducing unnecessary admissions to hospitals is one of the most 
effective ways of saving medicare dollars says the report a 
copy of which was obtained by the associated press 
the analysis was based on 7050 patient records at 214 randomly 
selected hospitals from october 1984 to march 1985 it concluded 
that 740 admissions or 105 percent were unnecessary 
there is potential financial incentive to admit patients who do 
not need hospitalization under a plan established by congress in 
1983 which sets a fixed payment for each of 475 diagnosis related 
groups or drgs as they are known in the industry 
a hospital receives the same payment for each admission for a 
particular diagnosis regardless of the actual services provided or 
length of time a patient spends in the hospital 
hospitals retain a profit when patient care costs less than 
the drg payment but must absorb losses when costs are higher than 
the drg the report noted 
against that background the study found that the average length 
of stay for the unnecessary admissions was 44 days compared with 
76 days for necessary admissions 
most of the unnecessary admissions needed medical attention 
but not in an acute care setting the report said it placed 
nearly 78 percent in that category but concluded that almost 12 
percent of the patients did not require immediate treatment of any 
kind when they were admitted 
most of the other medically unnecessary admissions were classed 
as either social admissions such as temporarily hospitalizing 
an elderly person because he or she did not have any other place to 
stay or instances of frail people being hospitalized when they 
should have been admitted to a nursing home instead 
only 25 of the 214 hospitals studies had no unnecessary 
admissions according to the report but there was wide variation 
in the rates of unnec admissions for the others for example at 
least half the admissions were judged unnecessary at two hospitals 
and at least a third at eight other institutions twenty percent or 
more of the sampled admissions at 34 hospitals were found 
unnecessary 
no individual hospitals were named in the study neither were 
any variations among states or regions of the country detailed 
the overall 105 percent unnecessary admissions rate for the 
cases sampled is far higher than the maximum 25 percent 
unnecessary admission rate reported to the health care financing 
administration by any of the state peer review organizations the 
federal agency pays to police hospitals 
one of the major recommendations in the report is that the 
health care financing administration which oversees medicare and 
medicaid determine why those peer review organizations identify a 
substantially lower rate of unnecessary admissions than the 
inspector generals survey found and require them to adopt more 
effective screening techniques 
the inspector generals report found the unnecessary admissions 
tended to be concentrated in five diagnostic groups back problems 
diabetes bone cancer digestive disorders and upper respiratory 
tract infections 
the study methodology involved selecting hospitals at random to 
reflect the overall numbers of small medium and large hospitals 
registered nurses were hired to screen records using objective 
screening techniques approved by the health care financing 
administration if a case looked suspect it was referred to a 
physician for review 
reviewers ignored marginal problems or cases involving honest 
differences in medical judgment about appropriate case 
management the report said 
moreover if documentation in the record was so poor reviewers 
could not make a determination it was given the benefit of doubt 
and considered a necessary admission

from hispanic and irish wards of the bronx to 
jewish crowds in manhattan democrat michael dukakis has reveled in 
this citys ethnic diversity while urging supporters not to be 
overconfident in tuesdays crucial new york primary 
after a sunday of campaigning across new york city under a 
brilliant spring sky dukakis was skipping around the state today 
to deliver final arguments that he would make the strongest 
democratic presidential nominee 
as he did dukakis organization was concluding two weeks of 
telephone calls to a halfmillion likely democratic voters in a 
targeted effort to remind them to turn out when the voting begins 
tuesday 
dukakis aides were trying to spread their view of the race with 
jesse jackson and sen albert gore jr as tightening although a 
late poll by cable news networkusa today put dukakis ahead by 12 
points 
i never talk about polls because i dont pay any attention to 
them i did once and will never do it again dukakis said a 
reference to the reelection defeat he suffered after his first 
term as governor of massachusetts 
on saturday standing in a blustery cold in front of chunks of 
ice floating on lake erie in buffalo dukakis offered a reminder of 
his crushing loss in michigans caucuses a 21 defeat that had not 
been predicted 
what is important is that they vote he said ive been 
ahead in the polls before in my own state and i was way ahead in 
michigan and we all know what happened there 
his new york campaign director paul bograd said volunteers had 
been working 500 to 600 phones a night calling voters in precincts 
where demographic indicators suggest dukakis should be strong 
after meeting his rivals in their last debate of the new york 
campaign sunday morning dukakis walked 25 blocks up 5th avenue 
where he drew warm cheers from thousands of people who lined the 
streets for the citys parade honoring israels 40th anniversary 
he followed out of sight of mayor ed koch and gore who walked 
together 
at gaelic park in the bronx dukakis threw a ball during 
halftime of an irish football game a rough sport that has 
elements of soccer and rugby 
he moved into a dance hall at the park as a band and female 
singer shifted smoothly from a patsy cline countryblues medley to 
the irish tune take me home to mayo and dukakis and his wife 
kitty waltzed for the cameras 
shifting to a latin beat dukakis traveled to another bronx 
neighborhood where a band played rhythmically with conga drums and 
other instruments and the 200 people danced and sang mike 
dukakey presidente 
with him was puerto rico gov rafael hernandezcolon of puerto 
rico and each spoke in spanish to the predominantly hispanic 
audience inside the club cubano americano where pink paint peeled 
from the walls and stairwell windows were broken out 
dukakis talks our own language the puerto rican governor 
told them using spanish

the assistant principal thought it a 
deed most foul when student pranksters released 25 clucking 
chickens in a school auditorium while a theater troupe recited 
shakespeare 
twelve fairview high school students received 10day suspensions 
for the prank friday during the performance of shakespeare on 
broadway and west side story by the cleveland opera on tour 
they may feel it was a prank but we do not consider it 
humorous said assistant principal charles kulik it disturbed 
a very fine program and was not in good taste to think the 
students would let loose live chickens its a very embarrassing 
thing 
the performers didnt realize what was happening until kulik 
interrupted to apologize to the troupe and dress down the seniors 
betsy clark an assistant in the operas tour department said 
she didnt believe the chickens had ruined the performance 
they opera singers did well under the pretty bad 
circumstances she said i saw different teachers trying to 
catch the chickens one teacher caught one and headed out the door 
with it the kids started giggling and clapping and the performers 
couldnt figure out why they were laughing and applauding right in 
the middle of a serious shakespeare dialogue

breakdown of talks with officials of prime minister charles 
haugheys government 
the government said it would use 1000 police officers about a 
tenth of the nations police force and about 300 soldiers to staff 
the prisons the prisons hold about 2000 inmates 
it is the first national walkout by prison guards in the 
nations history 
the prison guards union the irish prison officers 
association said in a statement the strike is a protest against 
the department of justices decision to impose new shift 
arrangements without consulting the guards 
the union also says it wants money used to pay for guard 
overtime to be used to hire more prison staff 
but the department said the cause of the dispute is the guards 
demand for compensation for overtime payments lost last year when 
extra staff was hired the department said the extra staff was 
added partly to meet union complaints about staff shortages 
the strike comes amid reports of unrest in some prisons four 
prisoners at the highsecurity portlaoise 47 miles southwest of 
dublin were reported to have smashed up their cells to protest 
conditions 
about 130 of the 200 prisoners at the portlaoise prison are

government and rebel negotiators met 
saturday in search of ways to achieve peace but the two sides 
remained far apart on the key issue of a permanent truce 
after daylong talks they agreed to resume negotiations sunday 
bosco matamoros a spokesman for the rebels said the 
discussions had been frank and deputy foreign minister victor 
tinoco called the meeting a productive day where we advanced 
quite a bit 
neither side gave details of the talks 
more than 1000 people gathered in front of the us embassy to 
protest the american support for the rebels known as contras and 
demand that their leaders sign a ceasefire during the discussions 
the demonstrators carried signs saying cease north american 
support of the contras 
no incidents were reported 
the delegations met briefly friday night then gathered again at 
the negotiating table at 9 am 11 am edt saturday behind 
closed doors and recessed at 7 pm 
the rebels are demanding the sandinista government take the 
first steps toward returning nicaragua to freely elected democratic 
rule before they sign an armisice 
if we sign a permanent ceasefire without first taking steps 
to lead the country back to democracy it would be tantamount to 
surrender on our part adolfo calero the top contra negotiator 
told the associated press in a telephone interview shortly before 
the start of saturdays session 
gen humberto ortega the sandinista defense minister and head 
of the government delegation said friday the sandinistas believe 
an agreement on a permanent truce comes first 
the victory we should seek is a permanent ceasefire ortega 
told reporters 
but both sides expressed optimism they could reach agreement 
we came here with faith and goodwill and we hope to find the 
same goodwill on the other side to reach agreement that will 
benefit all nicaraguans calero said 
he added however we have reservations to return to costa 
rica on monday afternoon if the negotiations are on the right 
track then we could prolong our stay 
this is the first time the sandinistas have allowed contra 
leaders to come to managua since the revolt began in november 1981 
president daniel ortega has said 26500 people have been slain in 
the conflict 
a 60day ceasefire has been in effect since april 1 and 
continued to be holding on saturday 
even though each side has accused the other of violating the 
ceasefire incidents have been few and minor 
the contra umbrella organization known as nicaraguan resistance 
said in a brief statement saturday that sandinista helicopter 
gunships have been violating the ceasefire by trying to chart 
rebel troop movements it also said sandinista agents have been 
trying to contact rebel commanders to discuss peace 
the statement issued in miami where the contras have their 
headquarters added consequently we are instructing our 
combatants to reject any contact with these elements the majority 
of whom belong to the state security forces or to capture them 
delegates signed the 60day ceasefire on march 23 after three 
days of negotiations in the tiny border post of sapoa 90 miles 
south of managua 
agreement on the technical aspects of the ceasefire was reached 
during talks that ended friday at sapoa and the two sides agreed 
to further technical talks at this weeks highlevel meetings in 
managua 
the sides have agreed on seven ceasefire zones where the rebels 
would gather during the temporary ceasefire until a permanent 
truce is negotiated 
but the logistics of moving into those zones whether the 
contras would give up their weapons and how they would be 
resupplied have kept the sides apart 
although details of fridays talks were not released a joint 
communique said the delegations had made substantial progress 
the sovietsupported sandinistas have been in power since 
defeating the rightwing government of the late president anastasio 
somoza in 1979

first results from rural counties gave 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis a strong early lead over jesse 
jackson in arizonas democratic presidential caucus saturday 
in la paz county in southwestern arizona dukakis had 66 votes 
compared with 21 for jackson tennessee sen albert gore jr got 18 
votes while illinois sen paul simon who has suspended his 
candidacy got four votes and political extremist lyndon larouche 
had one vote three voters expressed no preference 
in greenlee county in eastern arizona dukakis had 144 votes 
compared with 27 for jackson 13 for gore and three each for simon 
larouche and no preference 
we expected to win arizona said richard ybarra dukakis 
director for western states if we do if the preliminary numbers 
hold up it will be a continuation of the dukakis campaign winning 
in the west 
backers of both dukakis and jackson have insisted their 
candidate can capture the caucus because of the traditional low 
turnout 
traditionally only about 25000 to 30000 of arizonas 680000 
democrats turn out for the primarystyle vote which is the first 
step toward choosing 36 delegates to the july 1821 national 
convention in atlanta party executive director glenn davis said 
saturday evening he did not yet have an accurate turnout projection 
i think we can win arizona jackson campaign coordinator 
john norris said earlier saturday people committed to jesse 
jackson tend to be more apt to go out and vote 
dukakis state director jose villarreal was pleased with his 
candidates endorsements this week by phoenix mayor terry goddard 
tucson mayor tom volgy and a number of other state and local 
government leaders 
if the word gets out its significant villarreal said 
these are all very wellknown and respected individuals 
however he acknowledged the vote saturday could be close 
davis agreed earlier in the day saying its anybodys ball 
game 
jackson is the only candidate who visited the state 
gores local coordinator burt drucker said he is disappointed 
the national campaign allocated no money or candidate visits to the 
arizona campaign 
its not the easiest way to put on a presidential race 
drucker said he is the kind of moderate candidate that we feel 
would have appealed to the democratic voters in rural arizona 
thirtysix of arizonas 41member delegation are up for grabs 
saturday the other five are super delegates four top party 
officials and gov rose mofford all of whom are uncommitted 
saturdays vote is conducted like a primary except there are 
only 99 polling places statewide democrats will vote twice first 
for the presidential candidate of their choice and second for the 
delegates they want to represent that candidate 
the top 500 potential delegates in proportion to the candidates 
they represent will go to regional caucuses may 28 at those 
caucuses 23 national convention delegates will be chosen 
later in june another 13 delegates also in proportion to the 
candidate vote will be chosen by the state committee from among 
party and elected officials 
villarreal acknowledged that jackson has a distinct 
advantage in the arizona voting system which is similar to the 
process in michigan where jackson won a few weeks ago 
dukakis was the strong leader in a poll of democratic voters 
conducted several weeks ago it found 36 percent in his corner 
compared with 17 percent for jackson and 4 percent for gore the 
poll did not screen for likely voters

republican jim mccrery claimed victory 
saturday night in an election to fill the northwest louisiana 
congressional seat vacated by gov buddy roemer but his opponent 
refused to concede 
with all 371 precincts reporting from the 4th congressional 
district unofficial returns gave mccrery 63481 votes or 51 
percent to 61900 votes or 49 percent for democratic state sen 
foster campbell 
the winner will serve the remaining months of roemers 198789

great nation has long been a dream of mine i will be a good 
congressman mccrery told supporters he also said he will run 
for a full twoyear term in the fall 
this race is razorthin im not ready to concede said 
campbell i think the race is too close to call i think well 
wait well know more about it when the voting machines are opened 
i still think we can win this 
the governors office state police and private security guards 
will guard all of the districts voting machines until the results 
can be certified mccrery quoted roemer as saying 
there was confusion about the exact vote in caddo parish as 
officials checked and rechecked computer readouts 
in addition secretary of state fox mckeithen said in baton 
rouge that he had talked with federal voting officials about the 
disqualification of 3000 caddo parish voters between the march 8 
primary and saturdays runoff 
mckeithen said he was told voters cannot be disqualified less 
than six weeks before an election 
most recent polls had given mccrery a former roemer aide a 
slight advantage over campbell 
the last precincts to report were from the most populous 
shreveportbossier city area and the narrow edge they gave mccrery 
was just enough to offset the support campbell received in the 
seven rural parishes 
turnout was predicted at about 45 percent said darrell cobb 
director of the elections division of the secretary of states 
office

democratic presidential candidates set aside their differences 
during a one hourdebate saturday and concentrated their fire on 
the republican administration criticizing president reagan and 
vice president george bush on issues ranging from the sale of arms 
to iran to the handling of the aids epidemic 
i dont see any intensity out there for george bush said 
michael dukakis entering the final weekend of the new york 
presidential primary as the frontrunner in the polls 
sen albert gore jr said the administration had a disgraceful 
record in its handling of aids 
we cannot just manage reaganomics were going to have to 
reverse reaganomics jesse jackson said at the debate in 
rochester ny 
before flying to the western new york city dukakis met with 
black businessmen in harlem and toured an italian neighborhood in 
queens 
asked why he has spent so little time campaigning in black 
neighborhoods the massachusetts governor said i understand 
jesses going to get the lions share of the votes in this 
community and thats understandable 
but said dukakis he had always had good support in the black 
community 
jackson in a campaign appearance in niagara falls ny urged 
indians who generally do not vote as a matter of principle to get 
involved in the nations political process to improve life on the 
reservation 
we want to reach out to them and urge them to vote jackson 
said at a rally at an indian museum so many native americans 
have simply been brokenhearted theyve been hurt so long they 
feel a sense of betrayal we have to get them involved 
gore falling deeper in debt and trailing badly in the polls 
began running commercials featuring new york city mayor edward koch 
urging voters to vote positive vote al gore 
koch also planned to march with gore on sunday in a salute to 
israel parade a gesture gore hopes will help him capture some of 
the jewish voters who generally comprise 25 percent of the 
democratic primary turnout 
the three democratic candidates seated on stage at the eastman 
theater on saturday for the league of women voterssponsored 
debate appeared determined to set aside their differences and 
concentrate on the vulnerabilities of their gop opponent 
virtually certain to be bush 
jackson defended his meetings with palestine liberation 
organization leader yasser arafat syrian president hafez assad and 
cuban president fidel castro 
jackson said he had appealed to arafat to recognize israel and 
had thanked assad for releasing a us navy flier 
as for castro jackson said he got the cuban leader to release 
political prisoners and said if we have diplomatic relations 
with chile and south africa on the one hand and china and russia on 
the other we should not reduce our influence in our own hemisphere 
with cuba 
not even a discussion of the middle east which has produced the 
sharpest differences between the candidates during the new york 
campaign could shake their congeniality 
gore who has taken the firmest proisrael stand said the 
united states should not talk to the plo until that group renounces 
terrorism such as blowing up school buses with innocent children 
on them renouncing that kind of act as an instrument of policy 
jackson who has been the most sympathetic toward the plo 
quickly responded you are right then he pointed out that 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir said he wouldnt recognize 
the plo even if they recognized him 
dukakis recalling the step the late egyptian president anwar 
sadat took to end his countrys state of war with israel said i 
dont see why its so difficult for the other arab leaders to do 
what sadat did 
sadat eventually signed a peace treaty with israel 
the candidates greeted each other warmly after the debate with 
dukakis standing on the stages wing while jackson answered 
questions from reporters and gore watched from behind a crowd of 
journalists 
i was going to ask you when are you going to get off that 
stage gore joked to jackson when he finally stepped down 
every published poll of likely new york democratic primary 
voters showed dukakis leading jackson by margins ranging from 6 to 
nearly 17 percentage points all the surveys said gore was running 
a distant third 
in a washington postabc news poll published sunday dukakis was 
supported by 43 percent jackson 37 percent and gore 13 percent 
the survey calculated the responses of 179 likely voters among 392 
democrats interviewed thursday and friday the margin of error for 
the poll was plus or minus 8 percentage points 
gore toured a market in the heart of a polish neighborhood in 
buffalo and conceded that he is running behind in the state 
at a minimum we have to have a strong finish to demonstrate 
continued momentum gore said but im not going to put 
specific numbers on it 
he said he thought he had time to improve his standing and 
added its a very volatile race 
bush was expected to sweep the 96 republican delegates at stake 
on tuesday half of the bush delegates were running unopposed his 
only remaining opponent for the nomination pat robertson did not 
campaign in the state and has said that bush was going to be the 
nominee of the republican party absent any unexpected eventuality 
while the democratic candidates were campaigning and debating in 
new york where 255 delegates are at stake arizona democrats 
whose favorite son former gov bruce babbitt was an early 
casualty in the democratic race held caucuses on saturday to 
allocate 36 delegates 
dukakis held a strong lead over jackson in the earliest results 
from two rural counties in arizona those results involved about 
300 votes reported by late saturday night while an estimated 
25000 to 30000 people were expected to participate in the 
caucuses 
south carolina and north dakota which use a threestep process 
to select delegates on saturday held state conventions 
north dakota democrats gave twothirds of their 15 delegates to 
the uncommitted while dukakis got three and jackson two the state 
convention was the final step in north dakotas delegate selection 
process which began with precinct caucuses last month 
in south carolina where the party completed its 
delegateselection process begun with precinct caucuses march 12 
jackson picked up almost twothird of the delegates on saturday 
jackson came up with 28 delegates while gore won eight and dukakis 
got seven 
allocation of the arizona delegates will be determined by the 
outcome of a presidential preference vote at the caucuses 
jackson was the only candidate to campaign in arizona and his 
state campaign coordinator john norris said i think we can win 
arizona people committed to jesse jackson tend to be more apt to 
go out and vote 
dukakis had the backing of many top state democrats and was the 
leader in a poll taken several weeks ago gore spent neither time 
nor money in the state 
gore borrowed another 100000 from banks in his home state of 
tennessee bringing his total campaign debt to 16 million 
winless since super tuesday when he demonstrated support across 
the south gore was spending 700000 on advertising in new york in 
a bid to get back into contention 
the democratic candidates were scheduled to debate again on 
sunday a televised appearance on wnbc all three also planned to 
appear at a senior citizen forum sponsored by city council

in gaza and six in the west bank 
bernard mills head of the un relief and works agency in gaza 
said of the israeli soldiers from reports we have they used no 
warning shots no tear gas no rubber bullets they just opened 
fire 
a military spokesman said the soldiers fired because their lives 
were in danger he described the clashes as breaking out 
spontaneously and with force and said demonstrators had thrown 
many firebombs at troops 
hospitals un officials and arab journalists said up to 90 
palestinians were wounded the army imposed curfews on 10 refugee 
camps 
it was the highest oneday death toll reported since violence 
began dec 8 in the occupied west bank and gaza strip bringing the 
number of palestinians reported killed to at least 164 an israeli 
soldier and civilian also have been slain 
most of the violence was in the gaza strip where khalil 
alwazir military commander of the plo lived until 1963 and close 
relatives remain he was killed early saturday at his home in 
tunis tunisia by seven commandos who escaped 
palestinian leaders blamed israel for the assassination 
israel is the only party that could have carried out such an 
act said hanna siniora editor of the newspaper al fajr in arab 
east jerusalem his alwazirs portfolio is the occupied 
territories this is an attempt to crush the uprising by force 
spokesmen for the defense ministry and foreign ministry refused 
comment avi pazner who speaks for prime minister yitzhak shamir 
said it was natural for the plo to blame israel they always 
blame israel 
ariel merari an expert on terrorism at tel aviv university 
said the death of alwazir also known as abu jihad father of the 
holy war might have been the result of plo infighting and that 
arafat the plo chairman probably approved it 
riots began in the occupied territories as soon as news of the 
assassination was broadcast 
hospital officials said seven palestinians were shot to death in 
gaza and six in the west bank the previous highest death toll was 
on april 2 when six palestinians were killed 
the israeli army command confirmed 12 arab deaths and said

other palestinians were slain and it was investigating the 
circumstances 
black flags of mourning fluttered in gaza city home of five 
families related to alwazir over streets blocked every few yards 
by barriers of stones and flaming tires 
mobs of angry young arabs clutching rocks blocks of cement 
empty tear gas canisters and anything else that could be thrown 
crowded around approaching cars many masked their faces with 
shirts or arab headscarves 
gaza has not been this tense since the beginning of the 
uprising said a woman who would not given her name 
outside the home of ahmed alwazir the dead mans 
brotherinlaw about 100 mourners sat under a tent as loudspeakers 
from a nearby mosque blared mourning verses from the koran holy 
book of islam 
palestinian flags outlawed by israel were draped over the 
homes entrance and balcony more of the red green white and 
black banners hung from poles in the street obscured occasionally 
by thick smoke from burning tires 
the service was interrupted when mourners spotted israelis armed 
with rifles and tear gas at a nearby street corner 
come here if you are men the palestinians shouted hurling 
stones the troopers responded with tear gas and gunfire was heard 
women in long black mourning dresses screamed at the soldiers 
some carried onions bottles of cologne or buckets of chlorine all 
thought to be remedies for tear gas inhalation 
mourners suddenly rushed at the israelis carrying palestinian 
flags and shouting allahu akbar god is great 
about 30 soldiers charged the protesters firing tear gas and 
some live ammunition the arabs dispersed in a thick white cloud of 
tear gas and no casualties were evident 
inside the house ahmed alwazir the widows brother said he 
had no doubts of who the killers were and denied allegations of 
a feud with arafat 
most of the deaths in gaza were at refugee camps three people 
were reported killed in the khan younis camp in the southern gaza 
strip two at the nearby rafah camp and one each at the bureij 
refugee camp in the central gaza strip and abssan village near gaza 
city 
in the west bank hospital officials said three people were 
killed in the town of jenin and one each at silwad near ramallah

the pilot of a commuter plane that caught fire in 
flight was either very lucky very brave probably very 
skilled officials said after a crashlanding that barely missed 
a crowded airport bar and injured 19 people 
two passengers and their seats were thrown through the side of 
the horizon air de havilland dash 8 in the crash friday night at 
seattletacoma international airport two of the 40 people aboard 
were in serious condition saturday no one on the ground was hurt 
everyone was holding hands i dont know who the man was next 
to me but i sure must have broke his arm holding onto it said 
passenger wilma swartzwelder a spokane nurse she said the plane 
flew five or 10 minutes before she saw the right engine on fire 
the propellerdriven plane narrowly missed the airport control 
tower then it made a hard landing and careened into a boarding 
ramp 
the plane crashed through baggage carts like a bowling 
alley then headed for the busy b concourse bar said douglas 
chadd 29 manager of a restaurant overlooking the b concourse 
if it would have been a few feet the other way the nose would 
have went right into the bar and this is their busiest night 
chadd said 
however a wing punched through a passenger ramp at an empty 
delta air lines gate where chadd said a flight had departed about 
10 minutes earlier 
eight investigators were sent from the national transportation 
safety board along with board member joseph nall to handle the 
investigation said ted lopatkiewicz of the ntsb 
obviously the focus of the probe is centered in the right 
engine nall said 
a 2by3foot panel from the ravaged right engine was found 
saturday about a mile and a half from the airport nall said the 
panel used to gain access to the engine for maintenance or 
repairs was the only piece of the plane found outside the airport 
horizon president john kelly said the accident resulted in the 
first passenger injuries in the airlines sevenyear history he 
said the incident was the third in 19 months involving the 
turboprop engines on the dash 8 
in june an engine fire was detected shortly after takeoff and 
in 1986 a plane returned to seatac when an engine malfunctioned 
he said the incidents involved different aircraft among the 
airlines 10 dash 8s kelly said 
officials at the de havilland division of boeing canada and 
pratt amp whitney canada manufacturer of the engines on the dash 8 
said in telephone interviews they knew of no recurrent problems 
with the aircraft or its engines 
horizon flight 2658 had just taken off on a flight from seattle 
to spokane with a full load of 37 passengers plus three crew 
members said horizon spokeswoman nancy hamilton 
the plane was about three miles from the airport when pilot carl 
carlson reported a hot engine radio jargon for a fire said 
dick meyer of the federal aviation administration regional office 
in seattle 
the plane almost hit the seatac control tower said lee 
fryer duty officer at the faa air traffic control center in 
auburn the controllers thought he was going to hit it 
they had a fire truck waiting and the flames were out in about 
15 seconds fryer said 
it could have been a lot worse said air traffic controller 
marvin k tobosa we consider the pilot either very lucky very 
brave probably very skilled it was pretty quick 
before the plane hit the ground there was very little 
talking said steve lowenstam 42 of eugene ore i heard 
someone in front comforting someone else but there were no 
screams 
when the plane hit i heard the boom they told us to put our 
heads down and shield our faces everybody was real calm said 
ms swartzwelder 
the flight attendant did a good job of explaining how 
passengers should hold their heads down said todd weber 32 of 
clarkston 
the plane came down hard careened across a runway some grass 
and the tarmac then hit the boarding ramp what passengers heard 
was basically a piece of metal scraping concrete a lot of bumps 
a lot of noise weber said 
carol watt 43 of eugene ore and lowenstam said two 
passengers and their seats were ejected from the plane on impact 
after we crashed the whole seat to our right was thrown out 
the side of the plane lowenstan said 
the whole right side of the aircraft basically came apart in 
several places said weber 
in addition to the man in serious condition after chest surgery 
at harborview medical center officials said at least 18 were 
injured four people in all remained hospitalized saturday none of 
the injuries was considered lifethreatening 
carlson 38 of portland ore was treated at virginia mason

a spokesman for prime minister yitzhak shamir 
refused comment sunday on reports that shamir and two other high 
israeli officials approved the assassination of the plos deputy 
commander 
nbc television quoting unidentified sources reported 
saturdays assassination of fatah military leader khalil alwazir 
in tunisia was a joint operation of israels intelligence service 
the mossad and naval and army units 
the report aired saturday night said the attack was approved 
by shamir foreign minister shimon peres and defense minister 
yitzhak rabin after fatah guerrillas hijacked a bus and killed 
three israelis in southern israels negev desert last month 
this story has the same status as all the other stories like 
it which have been published and we dont relate to any of them 
spokesman avi pazner told the associated press 
nbc said mossad had asked three times for permission to kill 
alwazir but that each time israeli officials refused to give 
permission that changed after the bus attack the network reported 
the former head of a defense ministry intelligence unit praised 
the assassination and suggested in an interview sunday with army 
radio that al wazir had been an israeli target in past years 
rafael eytan who stepped down from the unit over the pollard 
spy scandal in 1985 said i have always honored doing justice to 
those people responsible for terrorist attacks 
israeli experts say alwazir was responsible for a list of 
bloody attacks such as the 1975 takeover of the savoy hotel in tel 
aviv in which 11 hostages were slain and a march 1978 bus hijacking 
in which 33 israelis were killed and 82 wounded 
his assassination touched off a wave of protests in the occupied 
gaza strip and west bank saturday at least 15 people were killed 
and up to 90 wounded in the bloodiest single day of palestinian 
rioting since protests began dec 8 
eytan also said there is no doubt there is a parallel 
between the methods of saturdays assassination and the 1973 
slaying of alwazirs predecessor kamel adwan by israeli 
commandos in beirut 
palestinian officials have cited the similarity between the two 
commando raids as showing israel was involved in alwazirs 
assassination 
eytan headed the scientific liaison bureau an intelligence 
unit which israel said it dismantled in 1985 for its involvement in 
recruiting former us navy analyst jonathan j pollard to spy for 
israel 
pollard is serving a life sentence after being convicted of 
selling israel hundreds of secret american intelligence documents 
including information about arab targets 
in an interview published this week by an army weekly the head 
of israeli military intelligence gen amnon shahak who commanded 
the 1973 beirut raid said israel had a policy of striking at 
palestinian guerrilla leaders 
in my opinion whoever leads acts of terror is a proper target 
for liquidation whoever uses terrorism against us should be a 
target shahak told the magazine bamahane

fear of the night twojob couples and the mobile 
society are taking their toll on doortodoor solicitations for the 
american cancer society fundraisers say 
people dont know their neighbors like they once did said 
sheila swimm who is holding an open house to raise money this year 
after more than 20 years of doortodoor canvassing so many 
people now work its hard to find neighbors at home during the day 
and nobody wants to go out at night 
mrs swimm who lives in lenox in western massachusetts and is 
the societys state chairman for residential fundraising said 
local chapters decide how to raise funds 
residential contributions have been going down said jon 
foley of newburyport who heads the state cancer drive it was 
getting more and more difficult to get volunteers 
foley said housetohouse canvassing last year brought in about 
400000 compared to 800000 five years ago 
some volunteers are concerned about safety and residents are 
more reluctant to open doors to strangers some apartment buildings 
ban canvassers 
family structures have changed said don henry society 
national vice president twoincome families have reduced the 
time people spend in their neighborhood 
they dont form the tight acquaintanceships they used to and 
people are less likely to volunteer in strange neighborhoods 
as a result many of the societys chapters are using lunches 
dinners road races house parties and walkathons to replace 
doorknocking 
but some massachusetts groups are sticking to tradition the 
cancer societys brockton chapter reported 51000 canvassers have 
signed up to knock on doors this year

when asked to recall his most distant memories 
hubert everist went way back to the early days of electric light 
everist of sioux falls sd remembered being six years old 
when he saw thomas edisons revolutionary invention the 
incandescent lamp at the chicago worlds fair in 1893 
his recollections are among those of two dozen other people who 
turned 100 years old in 1987 and responded to northwestern mutual 
lifes fourth annual survey of centenarian policyholders 
oddly of the 85 people who were contacted for the survey there 
was only one common surname young 
we could all learn something from the youthful spirit and zest 
for life exhibited by many of those people who have already lived 
full lives donald schuenke president of the insurance company 
said recently in making the results of the survey public 
such youthful spirit was reported by anton lee of falmouth 
mass who said he still plays golf pulls his own cart and 
regularly hits drives around 150 yards 
in his lifetime lee said he has had seven holesinone 
including one at age 94 
hazel marquart of crestline ohio did not learn to drive until 
she was 62 although her vision deteriorated making her nearly 
blind for the past 20 years she described how she has listened to 
talking books and has memorized poems 
other memories reported by the respondents included seeing 
president theodore roosevelt give a speech attending college with 
kansas gov alf landon and decorating a christmas tree with real 
candles 
many said the secret to their longevity was a healthy diet a 
good spouse and high moral standards also more than half of the 
centenarians noted that their parents had lived at least beyond age 
80 and several reported that both parents lived beyond 90 
but adah crane of austin minn said she hasnt the faintest 
idea how she reached the century mark 
being 100 years old has not been to me a time for creating 
philosophy she wrote it was a surprise to me to reach my 
100th birthday but i dont think in terms of years i think in 
terms of friends and occasions

viewer privacy which suddenly became an 
issue when supreme court nominee robert borks videocassette rental 
choices turned up in print would be protected under a bill passed 
by marylands general assembly 
legislation on the issue is pending in iowa and in both houses 
of the us congress 
the maryland bill which awaits the governors signature is 
thought to be the first enacted in the nation that would penalize a 
retail video establishment for violating a viewers privacy 
it would impose up to a 500 penalty and maximum sixmonth jail 
term on anyone who released information about what a person had 
purchased or rented for use on a home videocassette player 
last year a washington publications story listed the movies 
bork and his family had rented from a local movie rental shop 
the story showed the bork family had a penchant for mystery 
movies but raised questions about whether such information should 
be made available particularly in cases of xrated movie rentals 
the maryland law sets up exceptions for authorized law 
enforcement personnel collection agencies or individuals 
designated by the customer 
video industry representatives say they support the bill as a 
privacy protection measure 
rick karpel regional director of the video software dealer 
association in cherry hill nj said his group was generally 
supportive of the maryland bill and had been tracking its 
progress 
weve done a lot of work on this at the federal level other 
states are considering it congress is considering it he said 
the maryland bill was passed in the closing days of the session 
earlier this month and gov william donald schaefer is expected to 
sign it 
the iowa senate voted last tuesday to add a video privacy 
amendment to an uncontroversial bill expanding the confidentiality 
of public library records one of the federal bills has been in the 
house judiciary committee since oct 21 1987 while a senate bill 
remains in draft form the senate version sets up civil rather 
than criminal penalties and allows a video customer to seek up to 
2500 in damages 
vans stevenson a spokesman for erols inc the largest volume 
speciality video retailer in the nation said his organizations 
president had written to a maryland delegate to express support for 
the privacy bill which dovetails with the firms own policy 
customer rental and sales are privileged stevenson said 
we applied your marylands proposal to formally protect what we 
believe has always been a reasonable expectation and right of 
privacy for the video customer the bill essentially mirrors the 
policy we have 
his company doesnt handle xrated or pornographic videotapes 
that might be the target of some inquiries however he said he 
believes that regardless of what categories of videotapes they 
handle the majority of video retailers follow similar policies 
stevenson said computerized records of video transactions are 
held in erols stores 30 days then put in an offsite vault store 
employees are instructed not to respond to questions about an 
individuals membership in the video club or to release information 
to reporters or creditors he said all releases of information are 
made through headquarters 
we dont release membership lists we dont sell lists he 
said the only information we actually use are aggregate numbers 
certain titles like how many times did robocop run

jesse jackson would freeze pentagon spending 
and raise taxes on the rich michael dukakis would shoot down the 
midgetman missile and hire more tax collectors albert gore jr 
would consider a tax on luxuries but supports some weapons his 
rivals oppose 
the budget and defense policy are not the only areas in which 
the three surviving challengers for the democratic presidential 
nomination differ among the others abortion education taxes and 
the middle east 
the middle east particularly has been a topic of considerable 
concern as the candidates head into tuesdays new york primary in 
1984 jews cast 23 percent of the votes in that contest 
jackson the civil rights activist has taken the most 
consistently liberal stands on foreign and domestic issues and has 
offered more specifics on how he would grapple with the federal 
budget deficit 
dukakis the governor of massachusetts also has embraced many 
liberal social ideas including universal health insurance but has 
suggested that taxpayer costs can be minimized by forging 
partnerships with the private sector 
gore has staked out the more conservative stances on military 
and foreign policy issues and has been the most outspoken 
supporter of israel and opponent of a palestinian state he has 
gained expertise on arms control during 12 years in congress where 
he has compiled a liberal voting record on labor environment and 
health issues 
here is a look at where the democrats stand on key issues 
</TEXT>

jackson would make the wealthiest 600000 taxpayers pay at a 
rate of 385 percent instead of the current top of 28 to 33 
percent he also would boost corporate taxes back to 1970s levels 
dukakis says no serious candidate for president can rule out 
the possibility of new taxes but he says the first step is to 
hire more internal revenue service agents and collect every 
dollar we can of that 110 billion thats not being paid today 
gore has favored a top marginal tax rate of 33 percent for those 
making more than 200000 a year if we are driven as a last 
resort to new taxes i will fight to ensure that we turn first to 
those who can afford it says gore who has suggested raising 
nearly 1 billion with a 5 percent tax on luxury items 10 billion 
by keeping corporate taxes at their current level and 5 billion by 
taxing the sale of inherited stocks on the basis of their original 
value 
jackson supports an oil import fee gore has not ruled one out 
dukakis is a vociferous opponent of such a tariff 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 
jackson claims he could reduce the deficit by 100 billion 
annually by 1993 by freezing pentagon spending for five years and 
by his tax increases on the wealthy but he has also proposed major 
increases in social spending 
dukakis would scale back star wars research and save 50 billion 
by scrapping the midgetman missile he says he would trim federal 
programs and squeeze out waste but cautions were not going to 
get major cuts out of the domestic side of the budget its been 
savaged over the past seven years 
gore says he would convene a summit of our nations leaders on 
economics to forge a national consensus on how best to tackle our 
budget deficit he proposed eliminating subsidies for junk mail 
cutting corporate farm subsidies and eliminating the 40 billion 
of unnecessary medical diagnostics that the government pays for 
each year 
</TEXT>

all three candidates oppose the strategic defense initiative 
dukakis and gore would scale back basic research in the field to 
prestar wars levels 
jackson proposes saving 40 billion by not building two new 
aircraft carrier task forces and tens of billions of dollars 
by negotiating further arms reductions with the soviets he opposes 
building the midgetman missile the stealth bomber the trident d5 
missile or any more mx missiles 
dukakis opposes the midgetman he contends that until the united 
states and soviets can agree on reducing conventional forces 
savings on strategic weapons must be invested in strengthening us 
nonnuclear forces 
dukakis opposes the b1 bomber but favors development of the 
stealth bomber 
gore is a stalwart supporter of the singlewarhead midgetman 
missile and helped win congressional approval for it in exchange 
for limiting production of the multiwarhead mx missile to 50 
like his rivals gore opposed military aid to the contras but 
has voted in the past for humanitarian aid for the nicaraguan 
rebels gore fought reagan administration efforts to revive the b1 
bomber then voted to limit production to 100

gore does not support creation of a palestinian state dukakis 
has refused to rule it out jackson supports an independent 
homeland for palestians all three say the arab nations must 
recognize israels right to exist 
jackson who once met with palestinian liberation organization 
leader yasser arafat now says he would not do it again but he 
calls current us policy fatally flawed and favors an 
international conference on the middle east involving all the 
parties concerned including the chosen representatives of the 
palestinian people 
dukakis has said arab leaders refusal to negotiate with israel 
is to blame for the current palestinian strife he says israel 
should not be forced to relinquish all the land won in the 1967 war

protest to the israel government on its handling of the unrest

in china a fundamentalist teaching on the meaning of the cross to

over the world graham said at the start of his hourlong sermon

they think about you and they pray for you he said 
the 69yearold southern baptist minister arrived five days ago 
for his first visit to china at the invitation of the china 
christian council and the chinese peoples association for 
friendship with foreign countries 
he will travel to nanking shanghai and canton before leaving 
for hong kong at the end of the month 
church workers at the chongwenmen church in central beijing said 
grahams appearance was not announced beforehand to the 
congregation and said graham is known to very few chinese 
christians 
but the churchs main and side sanctuaries were full and 
latecomers had to stand at the back in the aisles and in the foyer 
some were chinese who usually worship at other beijing churches 
but many were foreigners including a group of 27 taiwanese 
presbyterians from brazil 
the chinese many of whom nod off during the 
hourandahalflong sermons by chinese pastors listened 
attentively to grahams message

the senate is talking seriously about putting 
a padlock on the revolving door through which government officials 
step into highpaying lobbying jobs one of washingtons bestknown 
fringe benefits 
two top white house aides michael k deaver and lyn nofziger 
walked through that door only to run afoul of current strictures 
against influence peddling deaver was convicted of lying about his 
activities nofziger was convicted of lobbying former colleagues 
too soon after he quit 
countless generals and colonels have retired from the military 
and taken their inside knowledge and pentagon phone books to new 
jobs with defense contractors political appointees and career 
bureaucrats similarly can be regulators one day and employees of 
the regulated the next several key members of congress have quit 
in recent years to join prestigious washington law firms or head 
trade associations thence returning to the capitol hill as 
lobbyists to trade on their friendships 
its endemic to washington says sen howard metzenbaum a 
liberal democrat from ohio who has joined forces with conservative 
republican strom thurmond of south carolina in trying to stem the 
practice 
one day youre a public servant and the next day you turn 
around and youre peddling your influence metzenbaum says 
the senate is scheduled to vote tuesday on the 
metzenbaumthurmond measure intended to strengthen the 1978 ethics 
in government act nofziger on appeal is challenging the 
constitutionality of the current law and presumably any successor 
on ground that it impinges the right of free speech 
the pending legislation is a landmark proposal in one respect 
congress has consistently exempted itself from a variety of laws 
including the 1978 ethics statute but it would be covered by the 
antilobbying features of the new bill 
thats the way it should be metzenbaum said friday as the 
senate began debate on the bill its time we police ourselves 
says sen arlen specter rpa another cosponsor of the bill 
the 1978 law says in principle that a toplevel executive 
branch person cannot lobby in his or her former agency for at least 
a year after leaving the job 
but the law lets the office of government ethics define the 
prohibited territory under its most recent rulings a person who 
worked in one section of the white house is free to immediately 
lobby the other eight defined by oge nofziger has noted 
unhappily that if he had been accorded the benefit of the latest 
interpretation he could not have been charged in the first place 
since he didnt lobby the same white house office from which he 
resigned 
by oges interpretation there are 200 sections of the justice 
department meaning an official who leaves one could lobby the 
other 199 without problem 
the metzenbaumthurmond bill would change all that it would put 
departing members of congress all highranking judicial employees 
and an estimated 45 senior administration officials on the 
sidelines for a year when absolutely no lobbying of any branch of 
the government would be allowed 
political appointees like assistant cabinet secretaries and 
heads of independent agencies would be barred from lobbying the 
executive branch for a year career employees earning more than 
64397 couldnt lobby their former agencies for a year oge would 
no longer be able to divide agencies into sections congressional 
aides earning over 64397 there are 350 to 400 in the senate 
alone would face a similar prohibition 
current law is silent about lobbying on behalf of foreign 
governments the bill would ban this activity for 18 months by 
former highlevel executive and legislative branch employees 
penalties would be increased now the maximum is two years in 
prison and a 10000 fine for a criminal conviction the bill would 
push this to five years and 250000 a convicted defendant could 
also be forced to pay twice what was earned through illegal 
lobbying 
this will make government a place of public service not a 
halfway house for making contacts said metzenbaum while 
influence peddling may have reached new lows its not unique to 
any administration although the sleaze factor has become a 
new household phrase 
sen warren rudman rnh is opposing the bill calling it a 
compilation of slogans misplaced suggestions and muddled thinking 
its possibly unconstitutional and bad public policy 
this bill is so draconian that many distinguished americans 
simply will not come into government said rudman who 
succeeded friday in getting supporters to agree to amendments that 
may make the proposal even tougher to get through congress 
one amendment would make it illegal for attorneys to even 
practice before a federal court for a year after leaving congress 
or a top government job another would prohibit outside jobs by 
members of congress the senate has a rule against this the house 
doesnt 
a third rudman amendment would repeal the law that allows 
members of congress elected before 1980 to keep excess campaign 
funds for personal use so long as they pay income tax on the money

the timing of the irancontra criminal trial 
of oliver l north and john m poindexter could play a major role 
in determining public reaction to a pardon by president reagan 
experts say 
however the experts disagree whether a pretrial or posttrial 
pardon if reagan should decide to take that course would be 
more acceptable to americans 
some of the university professors and senators interviewed by 
the associated press said pardons before trial would be more 
acceptable this way the prosecution would not get a chance to 
bring out potentially damaging evidence 
but others said pardons before trial would bring an immediate 
assumption of guilt and they suggested that reagan await a 
conviction if he wanted to forgive the defendants 
if there is no trial or verdict by next january according to 
this view reagan should leave office without taking action 
the issue is not merely an academic argument because the trial 
date is a hotly contested pretrial matter in the courtroom of us 
district judge gerhard a gesell 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh said last week hell by 
ready for trial in july but the defense team sought a march 1989 
trial date for north a former national security council staffer 
poindexter reagans former national security adviser and two men 
recruited by north retired air force maj gen richard v secord 
and his business partner albert hakim 
the four face charges that they stole government property as 
they conducted secret arms sales to iran and aided the nicaraguan 
contras during congressional bans on such assistance 
the 23count indictment charges the four ran the irancontra 
affair as a broad criminal conspiracy to defraud the government and 
to cover up their actions north secord and hakim are accused of 
personally enriching themselves as a result of the irancontra 
affair 
taking the view that a pretrial pardon would be the right 
course walter dellinger a duke university law professor said 
if the prosecution can prove the heart of this case which is 
more about embezzlement than aiding the contras pardons will cause 
a much greater storm after trial 
dellinger added this may look like a very different case 
after trial than it did after the congressional hearings one the 
public is far less likely to view charitably 
sen charles e grassley riowa a member of senate judiciary 
committee said pardons would be tougher to justify before 
trial 
the defendants would be presumed guilty all the time if 
pardoned before trial grassley suggested if the trial has not 
begun when reagan leaves office in january grassley said the 
defendants would have to rely on the good will of another 
president 
citing former president gerald fords pardon of richard nixon 
grassley said hes not sure reagan wants to make his place in 
history by pardoning people it didnt do jerry ford any good 
the pardon may have cost ford the presidential election of 1976 
and is the most remembered act of his presidency 
reagan has not taken an official position on pardoning any of 
the defendants on april 6 presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater 
said i have raised the issue with the president four or five 
times myself ive heard it raised by others and every time the 
president says the same thing which is im not discussing 
pardons 
sen orrin g hatch rutah said pardons would be easier before 
a trial to spare america this pain of reliving the irancontra 
affair in the courtroom hatch was a member of the senate 
irancontra committee 
william leuchtenburg professor of history at the university of 
north carolina said a pretrial pardon would be more difficult for 
reagan because of the gaffe he made on march 25 when he 
appeared to prejudge the case by predicting an innocent verdict 
reagan said then i still think ollie north is a hero and 
added i just have to believe theyre going to be found innocent 
because i dont think they were guilty of any lawbreaking or any 
crime 
later that day white house chief of staff howard baker said 
reagan was expressing a personal view adding i think the 
president made it abundantly clear that he expects the legal 
process to run its course 
leuchtenburg said the worst scenario for reagan would be if a 
trial was under way at the time hes ready to leave office 
that would create an all but impossible situation for a 
pardon he said that would really produce a cry of outrage it 
would particularly disturb the legal community by taking something 
away from the legal process and undercutting the judge and jury 
james david barber a duke political science professor said 
pardoning in advance of their trial is wrong the evidence is the 
wrongness recognized by the american people in fords pardon of 
nixon there was surprise that the presidents rating plummeted so 
fast after the public rallied around him as the new president 
some people say you go down in history some say you get 
written up in history i would suspect if reagan did it grant 
pardons it would be a mark on the scroll of history but on the 
down side

house investigators sunday recommended 
tightening government ethics laws in the wake of involvement by two 
former administration officials in allowing a nowdefunct 
multimilliondollar health care operation to sidestep medicare 
rules 
rep ted weiss dny said the case involving former 
presidential aide lyn nofziger former medicare administrator c 
mcclain haddow and the floridabased international medical centers 
inc is a classic case of conflict of interest involving greedy 
federal officials whose selfish actions could have caused great 
harm to medicare patients 
a house government operations subcommittee headed by weiss 
alleged that after he left the white house nofziger received at 
least 300000 from the company to try to influence officials of 
the department of health and human services 
the subcommittees investigative report said nofziger lobbied 
haddow to waive for imc a legal requirement that at least half the 
enrollees of a health maintenance organization or hmo which 
offers prepaid health care be private rather than medicare 
patients 
the house panel said haddow who was then acting administrator 
of the health care financing administration overruled his staff 
and waived the 50 percent rule after he left the medicare agency 
the report said haddow received a 40000 consultants fee from 
imc 
the 50 percent regulation is intended to ensure that hmos 
treating medicare patients are competent enough to attract private 
clients imc had been receiving 360 million a year from medicare 
to provide health care for 130000 of its up to 200000 members 
according to the florida insurance department that seized control 
of the company and sold its operations to humana a large 
healthcare firm based in kentucky 
neither nofziger nor haddow has been charged with any crime in 
their dealings with imc both have been sentenced on other charges 
however 
nofziger on april 8 was sentenced to 90 days in prison and fined 
30000 for illegally lobbying highlevel administration officials 
on three other occasions after he resigned his white house job as 
president reagans political director haddow pleaded guilty last 
july to conflict of interest violations involving accepting 33450 
from a private foundation and was sentenced to 90 days in prison 
and fined 15000 
nofziger has challenged the current ethics laws and denied any 
impropriety in his lobbying activities haddow in the past has 
declined to discuss imc 
my greatest concern is that current ethics laws may continue 
to allow the kinds of conflicts found in the report weiss said 
ethics law reform should include provisions to close these 
loopholes 
the report also said juan del real quit his post as general 
counsel at the department of health and human services to become a 
325000ayear executive with imc 
the company was dropped from the medicare program in may 1987 
after its president miguel recarey jr was indicted on labor 
racketeering charges since he fled the country recarey has been 
indicted on additional charges of embezzling more than 350000 
from the medicare program 
the house panel said imc received 119 million in government 
overpayments because of the negligence of officials in haddows 
former agency 
at its peak imc had the highest number of medicare participants 
of any hmo in the country its 130000 patients live in five 
florida counties and had received 977 million from medicare in 
the six years before it was suspended

domestic crude oil production in the 1990s 
should be higher than previously expected and demand for natural 
gas will be markedly higher according to the energy departments 
annual forecast 
the departments energy information administration said oil 
prices will be slower to rise in the decade than it projected in 
last years forecast and natural gas prices will be much lower 
the import share of us petroleum consumption wont be much 
different at the end of the century from what was predicted last 
year eia said 
in their annual forecast released last week the agencys 
forecasters significantly raised prediction for us crude oil 
production in the year 2000 from 54 million barrels a day to 60 
million barrels last years production was about 83 million 
barrels compared with 90 million barrels before the 1986 petroleum 
price collapse 
richard farmer in charge of the petroleum forecast said in an 
interview friday there is no way you can avoid a decline in 
us production by the year 2000 any major discoveries off 
california or in alaska areas where explorers have high hopes 
could not be in significant production before then he said 
we have been significantly influenced here by the work of 
william fisher chairman of the department of geological sciences 
at the university of texas at austin farmer said 
fisher reported last year that drilling efficiencies or finding 
rates barrels of oil per foot of exploratory well drilled have 
been remarkably stable instead of declining as many predicted 
farmer using slightly different calculations than fisher said 
drillers are finding 25 barrels of crude oil per foot drilled and 
have been finding between 25 and 30 barrels for the past 10 years 
in 1986 the most recent year for which full drilling statistics 
are available drilling dropped off drastically but efficiency 
didnt change much and may have blipped upward as the least 
effective drilling rigs were idled farmer said 
the projections say crude oil now about 18 a barrel will 
reach 2037 in 1994 and 3076 in 2000 last years forecast 
predicted that 20 a barrel would be reached in 1992 and the price 
in 2000 would be 3287 
these prices are average cost to us refineries of imported 
supplies in dollars of 1987 buying power 
demand for petroleum products including natural gas liquids 
should reach 183 million barrels a day in 2000 compared with last 
years projection of 174 million barrels demand last year was 
about 165 million barrels per day 
imports which were 35 percent of consumption last year should 
be about 56 percent in 2000 only a slight revision from last 
years prediction of 55 percent 
in a major revision for natural gas consumption of 197 
trillion cubic feet per day was predicted for 2000 when the 
average wellhead price is expected to be 4 per thousand cubic feet 
last years forecast said the nation would use 18 trillion cubic 
feet of gas in 2000 at a price of 550 
consumption last year was about 168 trillion cubic feet and 
the current average wellhead price is about 175 usage has never 
reached the peaks of the early 1970s 23 trillion cubic feet and 
probably wont get that high again in this century 
this years view is based on the flexibility gas producers 
have demonstrated recently in meeting competition both from other 
gas suppliers and from suppliers of other fuels the eia analysts 
wrote increases in consumption after 1995 are likely to be 
especially significant as competitive natural gas prices and the 
increased use of gasburning combined cycle units by electric 
utilities push demand for this fuel upward 
predicted coal use was reduced slightly from 12 billion tons 
in 2000 to 11 billion tons the report noted the entry of new 
producing countries in world trade such as china venezuela and 
colombia which will compete with us exports 
the petroleum demand projection assumes that new cars currently 
averaging 27 miles per gallon will average 34 mpg in the year 
2000 and that people will use cars and trucks about as much as 
they do now economic growth expressed as the average annual 
change in the gross national product was predicted to be 23 
percent per year in the new forecast vs 24 percent last year 
the report also assumes that the overall energy efficiency of 
the economy should improve though more slowly than in the recent 
past the energy used for a dollars production of goods and 
services which fell by 25 percent per year from 1976 through 
1986 will fall at 10 percent per year the report said

transportation secretary jim burnley said 
sunday the department will expand its airplanetoairplane 
inspection to a second texas air corp subsidiary continental 
airlines beginning monday 
the planned inspection comes less than a week after the federal 
aviation administration began checking eastern airlines a major 
carrier in the texas air empire the nations largest airline 
company the faa also slapped eastern with 823000 in fines for 
violating safety regulations 
were going to extend the ramp inspections intensive 
inspection that we began on eastern last wednesday to continental 
as well beginning tomorrow burnley said on nbctvs meet the 
press 
the transportation department head said the inquiry will be 
just like the eastern investigation 
well have people wholl be walking around the planes and 
through them and talking to the maintenance personnel and the folks 
in the cockpit and making sure that anything that can be readily 
identified is correct he said 
in another development burnley said the department found 
almost a million dollars in violations by continental during a 
review of the carriers files at texas air 
the violations including some that continental identified 
itself are being acted on he said 
theyve swept their system and theyve found in varying stages 
weve got almost a million dollars in proposed penalties against 
continental burnley said and in fairness i should add some 
of those at least were areas where continental volunteered that 
they had problems 
the airline has been notified of the penalties according to 
burnley and is considering whether to pay them voluntarily 
frank lorenzo chairman of texas air said the planned 
inspections were not a surprise but promised that continental 
would cooperate with the department as eastern has done 
im not surprised in light of the environment thats going on 
right now lorenzo said on the nbc program i think its 
important to note that most of these incidents that the secretary 
refers to are more than a year old but continental will comply and 
do well under this just like eastern 
burnley reported that the department had inspected about 200 of 
the 267 eastern aircraft since wednesday and grounded 19 of them 
i think its important to note that grounding does not mean 
that the plane is still on the ground he said all it means 
that a problem was identified and a problem was corrected before 
the plane returned to service 
the transportation department head refused to speculate on 
whether the 19 groundings which represent about 10 percent of the 
planes inspected reflect an average or bad record 
we want to go through this for 30 days and see what we find 
and then well talk about patterns ive got to emphasize that 
virtually all the problems identified and while many of them were 
significant problems were easily correctable so the plane was 
returned to service in a couple of hours burnley said 
the department also launched an investigation wednesday into the 
finances and management of the houstonbased texas air burnley 
said the departments concerns were raised by evidence that eastern 
and continental airlines are under substantial increasing 
financial pressure 
texas air corp had record losses of 466 million last year and 
its eastern subsidiary has been plagued with labor turmoil in 
addition to eastern and continental the company also owns rocky 
mountain airways britt airways bar harbor airlines and 
provincetownboston airlines

newspaper industry failing to meet minority goal 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
a new survey shows the newspaper industry is 
falling far short of its goal of making minority employment in the 
newsroom equal to the percentage of minorities in the country by 
the end of the century 
the study by the american society of newspaper editors indicates 
a slow growth in minority newspaper employees in the past decade 
the percentage of blacks hispanics asians and american indians in 
the newsroom is 702 percent this year the survey found up from 
656 percent in 1987 and 395 percent in 1978 the first year the 
survey was done 
but arnold rosenfeld editor of the austin texas 
americanstatesman and chairman of the asnes minorities committee 
said last week such continued improvement is still not enough to 
meet the asne goal 
the minority population in the united states in the year 2000 is 
expected to be at least 25 percent minorities made up about 20 
percent of the population in the 1980 census 
in a report to the asne convention rosenfeld said the survey 
also found that whites still dominate supervisory positions at 
newspapers with 959 percent of supervisors white and 41 percent 
minorities down the ladder 934 percent of copy editors 92 
percent of reporters and 907 percent of photographers are white 
the asne study also showed that the majority of us daily 
newspapers still have no minority professionals on their staffs 
with minority hiring slowest at papers with circulations under 
25000 
obviously rosenfeld said much needs to be done 
katherine fanning editor of the christian science monitor and 
former president of the asne singled out the poor minorityhiring 
record of small newspapers in a speech to the asne convention 
this is deplorable she said and it is a weakness which 
must be corrected if we are to serve this country as we should 
the surveys findings also drew criticism from the president of 
the national association of black journalists a 1000member group 
based in reston va 
its clear to me that whatever they are doing theyre not 
getting the results we so desperately want said dewayne wickham 
president of the black journalists group and a columnist for 
gannett news service 
the media plays a vital role in society we shape what people 
know about our society wickham added and if the media is 
manned by white men then the perceptions the public gets will be 
filtered through those people 
the asne survey is considered the most reliable measure of 
minority employment at daily newspapers this years figures were 
based on responses from 1092 newspapers representing 67 percent 
of the 1630 dailies in the country the responses were projected 
to the industry as a whole the group said it did a followup study 
of nonrespondents two years ago and found that the projections 
were accurate within threetenths of a percentage point 
the asne began surveying minority employment in 1978 that was 
also the year the group adopted the goal of making the percentage 
of minorities in the newsroom equal to the percentage of minorities 
in the nation by the year 2000 
rosenfeld told the convention that the number of minority 
employees is not the only measure of a newspapers commitment to 
minorities 
the industry needs to remind itself that this is an issue that 
goes beyond head count you have to consider your coverage you 
have to find a way of making minorities part of the contentmaking 
decisions he said

the democratic presidential candidates are 
spending as much as 1000 per second to reach new york television 
viewers and hoping their messages arent buried by local coverage 
of gaffes and controversies 
the richest trove of voters is in new york city but thats also 
where the tv prices are the highest the media outlets are the most 
plentiful and rambunctious and the background noise often explodes 
into the foreground 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis the frontrunner is trying 
to communicate competence and experience with his television 
advertisements jesse jackson makes a populist appeal to 
minorities union members and farmers while tennessee sen albert 
gore jr takes tough lines on trade and drugs 
but voters are also learning what mayor ed koch thinks of jews 
who support jackson how gov mario cuomo thinks gore should 
conduct his campaign and why neither has endorsed dukakis they 
are pondering cuomos reservations about jacksons lack of 
government experience charges and countercharges about the use of 
nuclear force and who came late or early to the war against drugs 
consultants and analysts liken the new york media to a jungle 
and the race there to tagteam wrestling 
its loud its raucous its noholdsbarred its new york 
love it or leave it said analyst robert lichter codirector of 
the center for media and public affairs in washington 
lichter said new york may be the only city in the nation that 
still has two tabloid newspapers each competing to have bigger 
headlines that say more outrageous things than the other 
he also said the citys notorious selfcenteredness 
immortalized in a new yorker magazine cover map that showed a huge 
new york adjoining a tiny united states has helped shape the race 
you didnt see iowa politicians dominating the coverage in 
iowa lichter said but in new york its a koch vs cuomo 
contest because new yorkers are most interested in other new 
yorkers 
the tumultuous new york media coverage may actually raise the 
level of voter awareness some consultants said although voters 
may not be seeing and hearing exactly what the candidates want them 
to 
the more people you have talking about politics the greater 
the odds are that the average voter will at least hear something or 
read something thats of use in making a decision said larry 
sabato a political media expert at the university of virginia 
the candidates are paying a lot of money in their attempts to 
break through the cacophony with their own carefully honed themes 
industry sources say it costs from 10000 to upwards of 30000 
to buy 30 seconds of prime time advertising on a local new york 
city television station depending on the popularity of the 
program that compares to an average of 500 maybe 1000 during 
a blockbuster show for 30 seconds in des moines 
gore who hopes to spend 1 million on media borrowed 100000 
last week last week to try to meet that goal jackson budgeted 
500000 300000 in new york city 100000 upstate and 100000 
on spanishlanguage ads 
the dukakis campaign estimated it would spend between 500000 
and 15 million depending on what the others forked out 
the frenzied atmosphere makes it more difficult certainly to 
get through said dukakis spokesman steve akey but we feel our 
message is very strong and clear and punches through the clutter 
straight to the voters 
dukakis was continuing through the weekend with a biographical 
spot an antidrug ad a spot stressing his responsibilities as a 
chief executive and another in which he speaks spanish 
jackson was running five ads among them an iowa farmers 
endorsement an antidrug spot by filmmaker spike lee an ad 
showing him confronting soviet leader mikhail gorbachev and a 
commercial in spanish 
gore the future of his candidacy on the line was making the 
most effort outside new york city he was running four ads 
statewide in addition to a new koch endorsement in the city in 
the ad koch standing on the porch of gracie mansion says gore 
understands the needs of cities and has fought for the homeless and 
against drugs 
and in the critical area of foreign policy where there is no 
margin for error al gore is head and shoulders above the rest 
koch says 
gore brought in veteran media strategist david garth to 
orchestrate his lastditch effort but another veteran tony 
schwartz said gores move came too late to do any good and 
criticized the other candidates for a similar lack of foresight 
one has to come in ahead of time raise proper money and spend 
it wisely they didnt do any of those things none of them and 
their stuff is equally bad said schwartz who has worked for 
lyndon johnson hubert humphrey edward kennedy and jimmy carter 
among others 
schwartz touched a nerve during johnsons 1964 campaign with a 
famous ad against barry goldwater the spot showed a little girl 
frolicking in a field of daisies and ended with a mushroom cloud 
this time around schwartz contended the presidential 
candidates have failed to connect emotionally with voters in their 
living rooms including himself 
i wear a button he said it says dont vote youll 
only encourage them

congress should consider halting the air force 
program to upgrade the problemplagued b1b bomber because the new 
plane will be obsolete a key congressman said in a speech released 
sunday 
we should consider now whether its worth spending any more 
money to make the b1b operable but obsolescent said rep les 
aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services committee 
the air force in a statement disputed aspins contentions and 
noted that he has long opposed the bomber 
aspins comments were contained in a speech released sunday 
which he plans to give monday on the floor of the house it is the 
latest in a series of addresses in which aspin is outlining the 
results of a lengthy investigation by his committee into new atomic 
weapons begun during the reagan presidency 
the b1 was killed by president carter but reagan resurrected 
it six years ago saying the nation needed to buy 100 of the 
swingwing planes to replace the aging b52s as the atomic bombers 
in the nations nuclear arsenal reagan also gave the goahead for 
development of the radarevading stealth bomber 
congress authorized 100 of the b1bs for a total cost of 205 
billion but the air force now says it will cost up to 3 billion 
more to fix electronic countermeasures ecm that will permit 
the b1b to evade soviet air defenses 
it will be at least 1991 before the b1b has the ecm 
capabilities it was supposed to have in 1986 according to aspin 
my concern is that the b1b will never work as advertised 
because of the time its taking to fix the problem time during 
which soviet air defenses are improving aspin said 
the bombers electronic countermeasures will be fixed at 
great cost only to meet more effective defenses or at best it 
will be rendered redundant by the b2 stealth either way we 
will have spent billions for something we didnt need 
in a response gen lawrence d welch air force chief of staff 
said aspins opposition to the b1b predates the first assembly 
of the first aircraft and should be considered in that context 
he said air force pilots have repeatedly praised the plane and 
he said it is a major addition to the nations nuclear arsenal 
like the b52 said welch the b1b should contribute to 
deterrence for 30 years or more 
welch admitted that we are behind the original schedule for 
developing the ecm but he added that ecm is by its nature a 
constant contest as we improve penetration capability and the 
soviets improve air defenses

a murder trial that had spectators lining 
up an hour early to get seats ended with a recommended death 
sentence for a man charged with killing seven relatives but 
residents still dont understand why the crimes were committed 
im happy its all over so we can start forgetting said 
frank dugan an elderly neighbor of some of the victims 
i think we can go on with our lives now said darlene 
beisiegel after watching jurors find james e schnick guilty of 
firstdegree murder in connection with a shooting spree that killed 
mrs beisiegels oldest daughter her four grandsons and two others 
the jurors also recommended the judge sentence schnick to death 
no sentencing date was set 
schnick a dairy farmer was tried for the deaths of his wife 
julie and two nephews kirk buckner 14 and michael buckner 2 
also killed were schnicks brotherinlaw steve buckner 
buckners wife and mrs beisiegels daughter jeannette and the 
buckners two other sons dennis 8 and timmy 6 buckner and mrs 
schnick were brother and sister 
the prosecutor reserved those four cases for possible later 
trial had he not gained convictions in this trial 
the victims died in a shooting spree sept 25 at two dairy farms 
near elkland a community of about 200 people 10 miles southeast of 
marshfield 
dugan said he could not bring himself to go to the trial but he 
stayed near his radio waiting to hear the verdict handed down 
thursday and sentence recommended friday 
i leave the house every day and see it buckner house right 
there its on my mind every day because im right in the middle of 
it dugan said friday 
the jurors took 2 hours to decide on a death sentence for 
schnick the only alternative to life in prison without possibility 
of parole in a case of firstdegree murder 
i dont want him to be put to death i just want him on death 
row where he cant get out mrs beisiegel said the ones with 
life sentences can get out on the grounds they can interact with 
each other they have rights and i dont think he deserves rights 
he didnt give them any rights 
initially based on statements given by schnick authorities 
blamed kirk for the shooting spree but schnick confessed oct 5 
mrs beisiegel and her neighbors crowded into the courtroom for 
the weeklong trial to sit for eight or nine hours each day 
julie schnick was a friend of mine said diane davenport 
i just wanted to see it happen theres so much smalltown gossip 
that people wanted to see how much was true 
spectators arrived at least an hour before testimony was to 
begin time enough to be searched by security officers and to be 
sure of getting one of the 100 or so seats on hard benches 
we come early and stay all day said maxine sutton of 
elkland who accompanied mrs beisiegel we take turns going to 
lunch and the restroom so we dont lose our seats 
mrs sutton explained the large turnout 
theyre here for the same reason i am to find out what 
happened and to see justice done she said 
i just wanted to know why he did it mrs beisiegel said 
but she said the trial brought her no closer to understanding 
why schnick described as a dependable neighbor and loving father 
turned on his family 
prosecutors speculated that schnick killed his wife in order to 
collect her life insurance which totaled 100000 county 
prosecutor donald cheever also said mrs schnick was aware that her 
husband had a mistress and may have enlisted the support of her 
brother and his family when she asked schnick for a divorce 
igniting his anger against them all 
the defense countered that schnick told officers buckner had 
molested his sister when the two were young and threatened schnick 
when mrs schnick pressured him to seek psychiatric care attorneys 
hinted that such family tension could have led kirk to commit the 
murders as schnick originally claimed

patriots day which commemorates the start of the 
revolutionary war in these parts has become an occasion of much 
spectacle including the boston marathon and a reenactment of a 
much earlier race paul reveres ride 
the living paul revere greatgreatgreatgrandson of the 
silversmith has a different plan for mondays state holiday 
goof off 
the man wearing tricorn cloak and riding boots and riding the 
horse will be 72yearold harold snow of wellesley a brigadier 
general in the massachusetts national lancers the ceremonial 
militia founded in 1836 has been reenacting the ride paul revere 
took from boston the night of april 18 1775 for decades more or 
less factually 
this year patriots day was stretched to cover the weekend with 
parades dances and restaged battles including the one at 
lexington where the shot heard round the world was fired 
others have retraced the historic 13mile route revere made 
famous 213 years ago two years ago ashrita furman a worldclass 
handclapper and underwater pogostick hopper set a world record 
by somersaulting all the way 
its an occasion the real paul revere prefers to sit out 
number one i dont ride horses he said in his late 50s 
and living in a massachusetts town he prefers to keep secret this 
paul revere does appreciate his heritage however 
he was a featured guest on to tell the truth the 1960s tv 
game show he shared a laugh with miles standish a descendant of 
the mayflower colonist and he has learned how to brush off pesky 
questions about where he keeps his horse 
probably the most fascinating thing is when you meet people 
for the first time and they jump back almost as if people in 
history might not have relatives said revere he is president of 
the paul revere memorial association which owns the 1680 house in 
bostons north end where his ancestor lived 
revere said he planned to goof off on patriots day taking 
a break from his job as marketing chief at revere copper products 
an industrial metals company in new bedford 
he wont even be present for the reenacted ride which isnt 
entirely faithful to historic fact 
the original paul revere set out the night of april 18 to warn 
samuel adams and john hancock in lexington and others in concord 
that british soldiers were assembling on boston common gen thomas 
gage commander in chief of the massachusetts bay colony had 
ordered a detachment of 700 men to go to concord and destroy 
supplies and arrest adams and hancock 
revere left his house at 10 pm he took a boat across the 
charles river to charlestown borrowed a horse and trotted into 
lexington at midnight after alerting adams and hancock he was 
joined by william dawes and dr samuel prescott and all three 
headed for concord 
on the way they were snared by british troops only prescott 
escaped to complete the ride 
the 20th century reenactment goes only as far as lexington 
following the same time schedule except for swapping night time for 
day so the public can watch 
and in this version dawes played by lancer lt douglas 
dougherty leaves from bostons roxbury section with the same 10 
am startoff as revere and the two wind up in lexington for the 
finale 
the real revere just knocked on doors snow will shout the 
british are coming 
and as they race through the suburban countryside snow and 
dougherty will be preceded by police cars and followed by two 
standins on horseback in case of an accident 
this year is snows seventh stint as revere 
it just gives me a good feeling he said the kids get a 
big kick out of it people shake hands with you everybodys 
yelling hi paul hi paul its a lot of thrill

military escalation in the palestinian uprising in his last 
interview published sunday 
answering questions in the kuwaiti newspaper alanbaa khalil 
alwazir was quoted as saying the fourmonthold confrontation in 
the israelioccupied territories was moving into a second stage 
involving increased use of military force 
seven masked commandos burst into the khalils home in suburban 
tunis tunisia early saturday and opened fire with submachine 
guns killing him two bodyguards and a gardener 
alwazir 52 also called abu jihad was the most senior 
palestine liberation organization official assassinated since 
fatah the largest guerrilla group in the plo was founded in 1964 
he was plo chairman yasser arafats closest aide led the groups 
main army and supervised military operations inside the 
israelioccupied gaza strip and west bank 
news reports have linked israel to the killings but the nment 
has refused to comment on them 
in sundays interview alwazir said the next stage of the 
uprising involves commando operations against select israeli 
military targets 
these operations will shore up the morale of our people in the 
occupied territories because such operations will be directed 
against those who act as tools of extremely brutal oppression 
beatings and bonebreakings he said 
alwazirs assassination unleashed a new spate of rioting in the 
occupied territories causing more than a dozen deaths 
in the interview alwazir said new operations would include 
building up the uprisings own military organization and 
distribution of such weapons as molotov bombs flame and lead 
balls and arrows 
he also talked of steppedup use of guerrilla raids outside the 
occupied territories 
israeli experts say alwazir was responsible for a list of 
bloody attacks such as the 1975 takeover of the savoy hotel in tel 
aviv in which 11 hostages were slain and a march 1978 bus hijacking 
in which 33 israelis were killed and 82 wounded 
in the uprising against israeli occupation palestinians so far 
have fought the heavily armed israeli security forces mainly with 
stones plo officials were reported to order them to avoid guns to 
help gain international sympathy 
in his interview alwazir said the palestinian uprising will 
continue until the palestinian flag is hoisted in the heart of 
jerusalem as the capital of the independent palestinian state

expanded this weekend as 13 teenage girls from mississippi arrived 
to sample the culture and delights of the big city 
i didnt think they were going to be so modern said kina 
stone a ninth grader at chicagos whitney young high school we 
thought they were going to have straw hats overalls and wear no 
makeup but they were pretty much like us 
the greenville miss girls met with a group of innercity 
minority girls from the metro achievement program during a weekend 
trip sponsored by greenvillebased daisy m greene national 
association 
the group is a nonprofit organization dedicated to the services 
of minority youth and elderly 
if i could bring one thing from chicago back to mississippi 
it would be the sears tower because its big daisy jackson 17 
said sunday after a look at the worlds tallest building 
miss jackson said she would love to return as long as i know 
i can go back home to greenville im used to a small town and 
slower pace 
the girls talked about shopping and exchanged addresses so they 
could keep the northsouth exchange going after the visit by 
becoming pen pals 
i like corresponding with people in different places said 
narsauinika sprouse a 15yearold from greenville theres a lot 
you can put in a letter you might not want to say in person 
marlene seja 16 of chicago said meeting the mississippians 
and corresponding with them would help her get a feel of life 
outside chicago 
were so much in chicago that we want to know what life is 
like in the outside world she said 
packed into the mississippi girls short visit was a trip to the 
dusable museum of black art a performance by the alvin ailey 
american dance theater and a sightseeing tour of chicago 
i got to see a lot of things about culture that i didnt even 
know about and the alvin ailey dancers were incredible said 
chandrika rankin 16 after attending a saturday night performance 
by the new yorkbased group 
the dusable museum especially impressed visitor lorarine loving 
15 
i like the indepthness of the history there she said 
there is not enough taught in the schools and it was just there 
waiting for you to come and see it 
i learned that a lot of things were invented by the black man 
but because they didnt have the power to get a patent the white 
man had a patent on it 
although some of the girls were excited about the cultural 
exposure several said the airplane flight and a promised trip to a 
shopping mall were the highlights 
to come to chicago of course is new exciting and different 
because our town is so small we dont have museums and cultural 
things said kenya anderson a 15yearold from mississippi 
miss anderson said she most looked forward to meeting people 
going to the museum and going to the mall the ninth grader said 
she especially hoped to pick up some chicago bears tshirts 
kimberly womback 14 said she had been to chicago three times 
previously to visit relatives 
theres a big difference between chicago and greenville 
which has about 39000 residents she said chicago is a big city 
with lots of people to meet and places to go 
mary wiley of chicago chairman of the board of the daisy m 
greene group said she hatched the idea while visiting the 
mississippi city 
i thought the greenville youngsters should be exposed to 
culture outside their own environment and chicago with all the 
performing arts here is an ideal place she said

the legislature convenes for its annual 
session monday facing 900 million in proposed state budget cuts 
from a governor who has been in office barely a month 
gov buddy roemer outlined a barebones 5 billion budget last 
week that calls for a 36hour work week down from a 40hour week 
to accomplish a 10 percent pay cut for most state employees and 
sharp reductions in state aid to local governments 
teachers however would get a 5 percent raise under the plan 
weve had to do 16 years worth of work in five months to clean 
up the biggest fiscal mess in louisiana history the governor 
who has been working with a transition team since shortly after his 
election in november told the joint legislative committee on the 
budget 
according to administration figures the state faces an 
accumulated deficit of 12 billion going back to 1982 when the oil 
boom ended and a 210 million cash shortage for the remainder of 
the fiscal year ending in june 
as promised roemer presented a budget plan based upon current 
revenue projections and minus tax increases 
in order to balance the budget we have had to make some hard 
hard hard decisions roemer said frankly in our state that 
is long overdue 
in order to produce a balanced spending plan based on current 
revenues about 900 million will have to be cut from the 59 
billion budget adopted last year said commissioner of 
administration brian kendrick 
using emergency powers granted during a special lawmaking 
session shortly after roemer took office on march 15 the 
administration has cut spending and seized agency surpluses to 
provide more than 30 million for the general fund scores of 
emergency fee increases for state services also are on tap 
the state is planning to sell up to 250 million in shortterm 
notes to provide enough cash through june 30 and has launched a 
plan to sell longterm bonds to pay off the 12 billion debt 
to provide more cash against a projected cash shortage the 
administration is delaying one state payday until the next fiscal 
year holding off on state contributions to government retirement 
systems and putting off state income tax refunds until august 
during the regular session roemer also plans to present his 
plans to overhaul public education the states system of colleges 
and universities put stringent limitations on campaign 
contributions and beef up environmental protection 
a special legislative session tentatively set for july after 
the regular 85day meeting ends will deal with overhauling the 
states tax structure administration officials said 
lawmakers will not receive a complete budget proposal for at 
least another week 
the new budget will determine priorities for the coming years as 
louisiana faces the prospect of a nogrowth economy kendrick said 
kendrick acknowledged that local governments would be left with 
funding problems if state revenue sharing payments are eliminated 
but said that the state must change its priorities now that oil 
revenues have dried up

fighters and at the same time to all those who were dying of 
starvation from bullets in flames to all victims said 
solidarity spokesman janusz onyszkiewicz reading a letter to the 
crowd from union chairman lech walesa 
authorities had told the citizens committee organizing the 
ceremony that it would be illegal 
but police did not interfere either during the speeches and 
wreathlaying at the monument or as the bannercarrying throng made 
its way to the old deportation site at umschlagplatz about a 
halfmile away 
earlier thousands of people including us labor leader albert 
shanker packed the citys jewish cemetery to honor two jewish 
socialists executed by the soviet union in 1943 
across town in the parliament building the yad vashem institute

its better now than never and so im happy but i am also 
bitter that its taking place only now said erlichs 
daughterinlaw iza erlich of new haven conn who traveled to

edelman 64 had been a leader of the bund partys youth 
movement he led a unit of bund fighters in the uprising in which

against the final nazi onslaught against the ghetto in april 1943 
news of the execution of erlich and alter in the soviet union 
reached the outside world a few months before the uprising 
they had been deported to the soviet union after the red army 
occupied eastern poland in september 1939 a few weeks after the 
nazis had invaded from the west at the time the soviets and nazis 
had entered into their nonaggression pact that led to the division 
of poland between them

council were executed for signing an official protest against the 
soviet occupation 
shanker president of the american federation of teachers said

polish jews were killed and he praised those poles who came to the 
aid of their jewish countrymen

instead of relying on the federal government 
state and local authorities should vigorously pursue money 
laundering cases against drug traffickers who frequently dump their 
illegal profits back into local communities according to a new 
study issued sunday 
only california and georgia have laws specifically barring 
conversion of profits from drugs and other crimes said the report 
but most states do have effective though rarely utilized laws which 
can be used to prosecute money laundering operations 
they include statutes against criminal conspiracy fraud and 
failure to pay state income taxes said the report conducted for 
the national institute of justice by the police executive research 
forum a group of police officials 
the report notes that money generated by narcotics trafficking 
and other underworld activities has been estimated as high as 100 
billion annually 
state and local law enforcement agencies rely on the federal 
government to investigate complex money laundering cases because 
such operations often are international in scope 
but offenders at the lower levels of criminal groups are capable 
of generating enormous sums that require laundering and for the 
same reasons that international traffickers and syndicate 
racketeers need such services concluded the report by the police 
forums associate director clifford karchmer 
money launderers convert cash from illegal activities to a form 
that conceals its origin and true ownership 
karchmer said that illegal money which is generated locally 
tends to remain locally often in a variety of financial 
institutions and legitimate business ventures and as investment 
capital ready for more illegal activities 
because state and local agencies are often closer to street 
and wholesalelevel drug dealing they may be able to amass more 
information on the flow of illegal money than we had earlier 
thought said james stewart director of nij a justice 
department agency

supporters of jesse jackson in illinois 
are warning sen paul simon that he could face a black voter 
backlash two years from now because his decision to suspend his 
white house bid is seen as hurting jackson 
by suspending his democratic campaign rather than quitting 
outright simon still stands to pick up 47 illinois delegates who 
are to be chosen next month by state party leaders 
those delegates would otherwise have gone to jackson now 
jackson supporters are making it clear they dont think simon is 
playing fair and hinting he could face the consequences if he 
seeks senate reelection in 1990 
out is out we want him out said state sen howard brookins 
of chicago jacksons illinois campaign chairman in urging simon 
to quit the presidential race 
brookins joined other black leaders including chicag mayor 
eugene sawyer in urging simon to formally end his campaign 
illinois republicans are already hinting that they see simons 
liberal presidential platform as grist for the senate campaign 
against him 
hes always been very successful in illinois in hiding the 
fact that hes an oldfashioned 1950s liberal said republican 
gov james r thompson 
that may have a more important bearing on the campaign for the 
senatorship in 1990 than the fact that he missed some roll calls 
while he was out running for president thompson said 
some observers say attacks on two fronts from black democrats 
and republicans could hurt simons prospects for senate 
reelection 
it depends on who runs against him how he runs and what he 
does between now and then said pollster richard day it also 
depends on the mood of the state has it become slightly more 
liberal more conservative 
others predict the delegate controversy will be old news by then 
in this business two years is a lifetime added chicago 
political strategist william daley a son of the late mayor richard 
j daley 
illinois democratic chairman vince demuzio a simon supporter 
pointedly compared simons delegation to the favoriteson unit 
taken to the 1984 democratic convention by the late chicago mayor 
harold washington 
demuzio said of the delegate flap itll blow over 
with simon on vacation last week his aides moved to quiet the 
grumbling among illinois black democrats 
the senators press secretary david carle said simons move to 
keep a lock on the 47 delegates was intended to ensure a voice in 
atlanta for his supporters not to derail jacksons candidacy 
in a letter to the chicago defender a blackoriented newspaper 
carle suggested that were simon to formally drop out of the race 
many of his delegates might sign on with massachusetts gov michael 
dukakis thus hurting jackson 
many democrats say simons convincing win over jackson in 
illinois march 15 presidential primary proves hes still popular 
he went a long way in stopping the rumors and the perception 
that he was in trouble daley said 
but jackson supporters point out the primary win was before 
simons controversial move to suspend campaigning and keep his 
delegates they say any perception that simon is linked to a 
stopjackson movement could leave him without the support of many 
of the blacks who helped lift him to victory in 1984 
they are raising this question with us and we will have to 
answer that as we move into elections his reelection brookins 
said i think that in the primary election there will be other 
people running there are many many options 
simons friends say attacks on him might actually strengthen his 
hand in a 1990 senate race 
for many of us paul stands for a particular set of 
principles said state sen dawn clark netsch of chicago a simon 
delegate i think people can be very proud not so much of how 
far he got but that he never wavered on the kind of things he 
stands for

the woonasquatucket moshassuck and 
providence rivers long buried beneath railroad yards a post 
office and the worlds widest bridge are being exhumed in a 40 
million waterfront renewal that planners hope will give the entire 
city a lift 
the reshaping that began last week will propel providence into 
the 21st century by reviving many features of the 19th city 
officials say 
were building on our dreams of the past said mayor joseph 
r paolino jr 
the mayor hopes to erase providences longtime image as a center 
of organized crime and corruption 
raymond ls patriarca the reputed longtime boss of the new 
england mob had his headquarters here until his death in 1984 and 
his son raymond j junior patriarca of suburban lincoln is 
considered by lawmen to control his fathers old organization 
paolinos predecessor vincent a cianci jr was forced from 
office in 1984 amid allegations he assaulted his wifes lover and 
that city employees were stealing municipal asphalt and curbstones 
the cianci administration began planning the redevelopment that 
paolino hopes will eradicate the negative perceptions of his city 
but paolino said his administration has reshaped the project and 
city government substantially 
people who have had indictments or convictions from the 
corruption days of the previous administration have been eliminated 
from city government he said i think ive been able to learn 
from the mistakes of other administrations and to guide us against 
it 
the redevelopment has produced little opposition mostly because 
the area to be developed was largely used only for parking lots 
some critics have accused the city of concentrating on glitzy 
downtown development at the expense of affordable housing in the 
neighborhoods but paolino said development benefits the entire 
metropolis 
to have a rundown shabby downtown is a reflection on the 
rest of the city he said we need each other 
if all goes according to plan the capital center area 
separating downtown and the statehouse long given over to railroad 
yards and parking lots will be bristling with office buildings and 
a 350 million shopping center within five years 
the woonasquatucket will flow through the center of the 
development pausing at a small cove in a park before joining the 
moshassuck to form the providence river in front of a tower that 
will house the headquarters of citizens bank 
the rivers now join underneath the downtown post office which 
is staying where it is while the rivers are moved 500 feet to the 
southeast 
in the early 1800s there was a cove on the woonasquatucket 
right about where the citys plan calls for the new one the cove 
grew smaller and smaller as the city expanded finally vanishing 
underneath the union station rail yards 
at the time they were buried the rivers were not considered 
civic assets said providence college history professor patrick t 
conley 
they were treated as open sewers frankly conley said 
chip young spokesman for the environmental group save the bay 
said the rivers have become somewhat cleaner 
its good to see them doing this young said at 
groundbreaking ceremonies for the river relocation project now 
the challenge will be to keep them clean 
union station a 90yearold landmark that was gutted by fire 
two years ago is getting a new copper roof and should reopen as an 
office complex in about a year developer ron marsella said 
amtrak vacated union station two years ago and moved to a 
facility closer to the statehouse clearing the way for developers 
to remove the old rail yards and open the area to development 
the westminster street pedestrian mall a relic of the 1960s 
when planners thought they could save downtown shopping districts 
by closing a street to traffic will be reopened to cars and trucks 
this fall said thomas v moses director of the city department of 
planning and development 
the downtown pedestrian mall was unable to compete with suburban 
shopping centers 
the neighborhood just west of downtown skyscrapers was 
predominantly residential until the middle of the 19th century but 
conley is skeptical about paolinos dream of reviving it as a place 
for people to live 
city officials concede they will have to do some selling to 
attract people to live in the city center but said they think 
there is an audience willing to listen

i apologize for the injudicious use of the phrase dead wrong 
with regard to the holy fathers stand concerning celibacy for the 
diocesan clergy the rev anthony curran said in a letter printed 
in sundays church bulletins 
i acknowledge that i was in violation of canon law in speaking 
publicly on the matter 
currans criticism of the popes position on celibacy came a 
week after a former corpus christi priest the rev anton mowat 
was indicted on charges of molesting four altar boys at the church 
in suburban atlanta 
curran was summoned to atlanta on tuesday to meet with monsignor 
john mcdonough administrator of the atlanta archdiocese after the

dolphins prefer bach to rock says 
a researcher who found that music made the friendly mammals even 
friendlier 
they seem to have a preference for bach and jean pierre 
rampal on flute theyll jump out of the water for that 
professional diver and photographer dan wagner said 
they also thought physical by olivia newtonjohn was 
pretty neat but when we put on some old chicago and some other 
rock n roll they boogied on out they just split wagner 
said i guess they didnt think it was too cool 
wagner made his discovery recently when he played a concerto by 
johann sebastian bach with his boats hydrophone lowered 30 feet 
into the atlantic ocean about 100 miles north of grand bahama 
island soon nine wild dolphins were circling 
intrigued he then played a tape made from dolphins that live at 
ocean world in fort lauderdale when the tamed dolphins whistled 
and trilled their wild cousins swam to wagner and let him tickle 
and scratch their bellies 
it was like they understood what the other dolphins were 
saying he recalls it gave you goose bumps 
an ocean world crew is now researching if the dolphins were 
responding language on the tapes wagner played for them 
the team has made tapes of tame dolphins as they performed such 
tricks as swimming through hoops they plan to play the tapes and 
then toss objects needed to perform the tricks into the water 
if the wild dolphins perform it could be a sign that they 
understood the tapes and that dolphins have a language a 
controversial notion 
and university of san francisco dolphin researcher diana reiss 
says that even if the wild dolphins should perform on cue it could 
be because of coincidence and not language 
youve got no way of knowing she said

a museum and library filled with old photographs 
and the nowrusted guns of the men who stormed cubas bay of pigs 
was dedicated sunday on the 27th anniversary of the failed invasion 
future generations must know what happened at the bay of pigs 
they must know we fought and many died said juan perez franco 
president of those who served in brigade 2506 
many of the 400 who walked through the hall and central room 
were brigade veterans who pointed to photographs of people they had 
known before their friends died in battle 
we knew we could have lost out lives but we didnt believe we 
would lose the battle said dr carlos garrido who was captured 
and held 22 months after the april 17 1961 landing 
the museum nestled in the heart of the little havana section in 
central miami contains bitter memories for many of the people who 
live nearby it recalls the day when president john f kennedy 
canceled us support of the ciabacked mission and left the exiled 
cuban volunteers stranded on the beach of the cuban bay 
it was a betrayal a fiasco said eduardo lambert 47 a 
paratrooper in the invasion who now is director of the museum 
but those men should not be forgotten they were fighting for 
american principles of democracy and freedom 
the idea for the museum was hatched two years ago by the bay of 
pigs veterans association as a way of gaining recognition for the 
114 men who died in the invasion and the 1189 held in cuban 
prisons for 22 months until the united states bought their freedom 
with 53 million in food and medicine 
to this day the united states government has not recognized 
the bay of pigs veterans as true american veterans lambert said 
maybe people will come in here and see the sacrifices we made 
fighting for the interests of the united states 
about 300 of the volunteers joined the us military forces 
after their release 
a singlestory house is home to the museum and library which is 
funded by the veterans and 150000 in grants from the state and 
dade county 
walls are lined with photographs tracing how most of the 1400 
cuban exiles were quietly recruited from the streets of miami and 
new york city to secret training bases in guatemala other photos 
depict how the prisoners of the battle were paraded and mocked at 
show trials in cuba 
a photocopy of a purported topsecret cia document is also on 
display detailing plans made during the eisenhower administration 
to attack the marshy beach lambert says the document was donated 
to the museum anonymously although the us government steadfastly 
denies the document ever existed 
one section of the museum displays guns and ammunition used to 
battle castros troops for 65 hours until supplies gave out 
hanging high on a wall of the museum is the green flag of 
brigade 2506 the standard for the ransomed bay of pigs veterans 
president kennedy raised the flag in a 1963 orange bowl ceremony 
welcoming the prisoners home promising this flag will be 
returned to this brigade in a free havana 
lambert acknowledges the museum is full of broken promises and 
bad memories but he stresses it was not meant to denigrate the 
united states 
just because we question the thought that went into planning 
the bay of pigs invasion doesnt mean we dont love the united 
states lambert said thats freedom thats exactly what we 
were fighting for

attack april dawn volgino has been named editor of the llano high 
school yearbook plays xylophone in the band and has kept drawing 
hoping one day to become an artist 
april 17 and her parents say their lives turned upside down 
by the incident off mustang island last april 18 are calmer now 
my friends get upset over ittybitty problems they have 
april said nothing upsets me anymore 
april was attacked by a shark in chestdeep water 100 feet from 
the shore 
her father robert attempted to beat the shark away with his 
fists and wrestled with it for about 20 seconds when it pursued as 
they fled 
april lost her right arm about six inches below the shoulder 
but that hasnt slowed her down much 
drawing was no problem april said im even better than i 
was before 
before i wanted to pursue an art career but didnt do a lot 
about it then i almost died i put a lot more into it now 
the voglinos told the corpus christi callertimes that several 
hospitals tried to recruit april as a patient because of the 
attention she received in the press 
april hates being labeled a shark victim 
people ask me if im the one she said i think im going 
to have a tshirt made with the one written across it 
she also doesnt like to talk about the incident 
many people dont believe in that type of coping she said 
but theyre not me and i have to live with it if i change my 
mind in the future then ill deal with it another way 
april and her family often use humor to deal with the pain 
the media account of what dad did made him look like king kong 
or something april said they made it seem very heroic 
on the beach robert collapsed from exhaustion and her mother 
beth administered first aid 
when we got to the shore i told dad i cant breathe 
april said 
her fathers answer after the panicked dash neither can i 
aprils physical progress has been slowed by painful bone spurs

the ranking republican on the senate commerce 
committee said sunday the inclusion of a laborbacked 
plantclosing provision in a new trade bill kills the measure 
president reagan has threatened to veto the trade bill if the 
plant shutdown notification remains intact and white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said friday that reagan would not accept 
any version of the bill that contains provisions that are 
injurious to a dynamic economy 
sen john c danforth rmo in an appearance on cbstvs 
face the nation said the decision by democratic leaders last 
thursday to include the provision marks the end of the trade bill 
i think that the result of last thursday was to kill the bill 
unless there is some other way of dusting it off at some later 
point said danforth a member of the senate commerce science 
and transportation committee but this present bill with plant 
closing i think is dead 
the plantclosing clause would require businesses with at least 
100 employees to give 60 days notice of factory shutdowns and 
layoffs business groups oppose it contending the requirement 
infringes on the prerogatives of company managers 
legislators are attempting to iron out differences between house 
and senate versions of the 1000page trade legislation 
rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of the house ways and 
means committee said he hopes that reagan will reconsider his 
position on the measure and sign the bill 
im sorry to see us come to a failure if we cant get this 
bill passed rostenkowski said on the cbs program im 
optimistic though i think the bill will pass and the president 
will sign it 
the congressman also said he remains hopeful that congress can 
override a reagan veto of the trade bill

israeli soldiers sunday 
turned back a un convoy carrying food and other supplies to this 
west bank camp where refugees under a 32dayold curfew complained 
of severe shortages 
an israeli soldier guarding the jelazoun camp told un 
officials their convoy posed a security threat 
we have orders he told them after making them wait an hour 
and a half you could cause a disturbance maybe come another 
day 
jelazoun home to about 5000 refugees on a hillside 15 miles 
north of jerusalem has been under the longest continuous curfew on 
a camp since the palestinian uprising began in early december un 
officials say the israeli army says it is one of the most violent 
spots in the west bank 
the army uses curfews here and elsewhere in the occupied 
territories held since the 1967 middle east war in an attempt to 
blunt the protests against its military rule during a curfew 
residents are confined to their homes and can circulate only with 
special permission from the army 
inside the camp sunday heaps of refuse were decaying beside 
many homes open sewers along the streets added to the stench 
residents remained mostly inside their shuttered homes but 
occasionally one ventured outside to talk to visitors 
the un officials had arrived there with three trucks filled 
with packages for each of the 900 families in the camp the 
supplies included lentils rice cooking oil sardines corned 
beef powdered milk and 4000 loaves of bread 
the situation is deteriorating every day mogens fokdal a 
un relief official responsible for the camp said sunday 
people have gone without electricity for a month they have no 
oil or fuel to cook they are starting to burn old shoes and 
furniture to make fires 
david james an official with the un relief and works agency 
said he had received assurances from a senior army liaison officer 
that he would be able to make the delivery 
we just want to give people the food they need james said 
he said previous shipments of bread had been allowed into the camp 
a spokesman for the west banks military administration said 
there was no policy of blocking un food deliveries to refugee 
camps 
however they must be cleared with the army in advance said the 
spokesman olivier rafovitch in todays case that was not 
done he said 
life has become terrible this past month said a 30yearold 
refugee who gave his name only as hassan we have no vegetables 
no eggs no meat all we eat is bread and food from supplies we had 
before march 16 
fokdal said un garbage trucks had been denied permission to 
enter the camp and clear away garbage since the curfew was imposed 
march 16 
we suggested to the people that they burn the garbage 
themselves to avoid disease fokdal said but they fear the 
soldiers will see the fires as a demonstration 
an army spokeswoman who declined to give her name under 
military rules said jelazoun was placed under curfew because it 
was an especially problematic and violent camp 
an army officer who also would not give his name said 
residents were being punished for tossing stones and firebombs at 
israeli cars on the road outside the camp 
not a single israeli car could pass here without being 
attacked before the curfew the soldier said is that fair of 
course life here isnt a picnic but these people have to pay for 
their actions 
soldiers posted at the camp entrance moreoever denied 
residents were suffering shortages they said the curfew was lifted 
for two hours each afternoon enabling refugees to buy as much food 
as they wanted

slain plo military commander khalil 
alwazir will be buried in jordan because he wanted to be close to 
his homeland of palestine his wife said sunday 
alwazir also known as abu jihad was assassinated by a 
commando squad saturday in his home outside tunis 
plo spokesman ahmad abderrahman called the killing a serious 
blow to the palestine liberation organization but said no one 
leader embodies all the revolution and all the people 
the body will be taken to jordan on monday after a religious 
ceremony in tunis 
intisar alwazir said she preferred that her husband be buried 
in tunisia but that his last wishes were to be buried in a place 
close to palestine 
alwazir was born in ramla in what is now israel in 1935 he was 
the highest ranking palestinian leader to be killed since fatah 
the mainstream plo group was formed in 1964 
the plo immediately blamed israeli agents for the killing which 
set off the most violent wave of unrest in the israelioccupied 
territories since the uprising began there in december 
abderrahman told reporters that the commando team of six men and 
one woman was divided into two units with one entering by the front 
door of the house and the other through the back 
they killed two bodyguards one on the ground floor and one in 
the basement then climbed the stairs alwazir alerted by the 
noise waited with gun in hand abderrahman said 
the revolver was pulverized by machinegun fire the fingers on 
his hand were torn apart and his body riddled with about 60 
bullets the spokesman said 
tunisian authorities said a gardener initially described as a 
bodyguard also was killed 
there have been no arrests but tunisian police have recovered 
three rented vehicles a car and two minibuses said to have been 
used by the attackers according to a preliminary report of the 
investigation 
jordanian authorities have agreed to allow alwazir to be buried 
on jordanian territory abderrahmans statement said 
king hussein of jordan sent a telegram sunday to plo leader 
yasser arafat expressing his deepest grief over the slaying 
according to the official jordan news agency which made no mention 
of burial plans 
in an interview with the british broadcasting corp radio show 
world this weekend abderrahman said a successor to alwazir 
would be chosen after the funeral 
he rejected allegations that alwazir was likely killed by other 
arabs 
it is one of the israeli lies and the israelis themselves know 
that abderrahman told his interviewer we have only one enemy 
that can make this kind of operation thats the israeli 
government 
asked whether there would be a reprisal for the killing 
abderrahman replied i cannot say that i will say that we will 
continue our resistance in the occupied territories until we 
achieve selfdetermination until we achieve our independent state 
in palestine

a federal judge has ordered a family with 
three aidsexposed sons to try to reach an outofcourt settlement 
with the school board that barred the children from classes the 
school board chairman said 
attorneys for clifford and louise ray and the desoto county 
school board met friday but school board chairman james westberry 
refused to reveal any results of the meeting 
the suit which was filed in june 1987 after the brothers were 
forbidden to attend school in arcadia seeks unspecified 
substantial monetary damages 
the ray boys ricky 11 robert 10 and randy 8 were allowed 
to attend arcadia elementary school only after us district judge 
elizabeth kovachevich ordered the school board on aug 5 1987 to 
accept them in regular classes 
the family was forced to flee their town a week after school 
began when their house was burned by an arsonist and they received 
threatening telephone calls and bomb threats 
the brothers all hemophiliacs are believed to have been 
exposed to acquired immune deficiency syndrome through contaminated 
blood products they take to control their hemophilia 
since their exile the family has resettled here and the 
brothers attend gocio elementary school 
westberry said ms kovachevich ordered attorneys from both sides 
to meet in tampa but the meeting before us magistrate elizabeth 
jenkins was closed to the public 
ms jenkins apparently ordered the attorneys not to discuss what 
happened at the conference 
obviously we were in tampa on friday and we cannot comment at 
all on what transpired there said fort myers attorney patrick 
geraghty who represents national union fire insurance the school 
boards insurance carrier 
the boards insurance policy has a limit of 1 million 
westberry said he didnt think that a settlement of 1 million or 
less would have to be authorized by the school board 
personally i feel like this system had the best interest of 
those children in mind all the time he said i dont feel like 
we really owe them anything 
said ray family attorney bill earl we certainly would like to 
settle the case on a just and reasonable basis it doesnt benefit 
anyone to proceed 
since their house was burned the ray family has received more 
than 100000 in public donations and in january abctv announced 
it would pay the rays 100000 for the rights to film their story

a huge statue of mao tsetung came toppling down 
under cover of darkness sunday at the nations most prestigious 
university in a move to further lessen the influence of chinas 
late leader 
the fourstorytall monument in front of beijing universitys 
main library was one of the largest in the nation all that remains 
of it and a second smaller one just inside the campus west gate 
are the pedestals and some rubble an american student said 
largerthanlife statues of mao bareheaded wearing a long 
windblown overcoat and with hand raised in greeting once were 
fixtures in nearly all institutions and official compounds 
however no new statues have been erected in recent years and 
others have come down as the official chinese attitude toward mao 
one of the founders of the chinese communist party has changed 
from unquestioning allegiance to the position that he was a great 
man but made major mistakes 
late saturday and early sunday workers were seen laboring on 
the larger statue under bright lights it had been covered by 
scaffolding and plastic sheeting for more than a week but students 
said it was being cleaned and repaired 
at about 5 am the mammoth concrete statue was sawed off at 
the feet and came toppling down leaving a large dent on the 
pavement the student said 
mao has come under criticism from the current leadership of deng 
xiaoping for the great leap forward of 1958 the lightningfast 
communization of agriculture that contributed to three years of 
famine 
deng has also blamed mao for the 196676 cultural revolution 
during which leftist radicals purged hundreds of thousands of 
people accused of disloyalty to the man chinese used to call the 
great helmsman 
it was during that decade which ended with maos death that 
the maoist cult of personality reached a fevered peak chinese 
carried around the little red book containing hundreds of 
maos quotations and posters of the leader were everywhere 
reaction to the destruction of the beijing university statues 
was mixed 
a strongly worded poster criticizing their removal reportedly 
was put up briefly sunday morning on a campus bulletin board and 
several chinese students expressed regret over the demolition of 
the figures 
taking it down was unecessary he was an important historical 
figure for good or for bad we can judge for ourselves one 
student said 
however several professors disagreed 
its a symbol of an era and that era is over taking it down 
is only natural said a middleaged professor who helped erect 
the larger statue in 1967 
there was no library then and the statue was an imposing figure 
on an open square in the center of the campus he said 
good exclaimed another professor when he saw the wreckage 
of the bigger statue 
he termed the monument a spiritual weight on the minds of the 
people the professor in his 30s said it was the wish of the 
entire country that mao statues be destroyed he said the reason it 
was done secretly at night was that a crowd of people cheering its 
destruction would have gathered if the statue had been taken down 
during the day 
the professors explained that to people who are old enough to 
remember the cultural revolution the mao statues are painful 
reminders of that chaotic period 
neither the students nor the professors knew why the statues 
were destroyed but some speculated that it may be part of a 
general beautification of the campus in preparation for beijing 
universitys 90th anniversary 
the middleaged professor said workers told him the pedestal in 
front of the library would be turned into a flower stand

iraq said sunday its troops backed by units 
of the elite presidential guard retook part of the southern faw 
peninsula captured by iran in early 1986 
also four injured crewmen from the missile frigate uss samuel 
b roberts which hit a mine in the persian gulf last week were 
flown from bahrain to an american military hospital in west germany 
a correspondent for the iraqi news agency reported seeing the 
bodies of thousands of iranian troops on the battlefield and said 
that large numbers also were captured 
irans islamic republic news agency monitored in cyprus denied 
the iraqi claim saying the attackers were driven back by iranian 
revolutionary guards with hundreds of iraqi casualties 
tehran radio reported heavy fighting in the faw area sunday 
evening and claimed iraqi forces used internationally banned 
chemical weapons against the iranian forces there 
iraq said it fired six missiles into tehran and another into the 
southern city of shiraz bringing the number fired into tehran to 
132 since feb 29 
tehran radio said the latest missile attacks killed nine 
civilians and damaged homes and shops 
the attack sunday marked the first time iraq had taken the 
initiative in the ground war since mid1986 when it overran the 
virtually abandoned iranian town of mehran just inside the iranian 
border 
the iraqi agency issued a military communique saying troops had 
advanced in the faw sector to liberate our soil and trample upon 
anyone who dares to attack great iraq 
pitched battles were under way in the marshy peninsula that 
juts out into the gulf and straddles iraqs only sea entrance the 
agency said 
iraqi forces had taken the saline area irna said in an 
apparent reference to a 25squaremile area about 15 miles from the 
town of faw 
it said coastal areas running parallel to the saline area also 
were completely liberated 
a western military analyst in baghdad said the iraqis had 
retaken a salt quarry and this paved the way for faws recapture 
another western military analyst who like the first spoke on 
condition of anonymity said the iranians once had about 50000 men 
in the peninsula but it was not known how many there were now 
the iraqis have fought a largely defensive war since being 
driven out of iranian territory in 1982 they say they are willing 
to negotiate for peace and have blamed irans intransigeance for 
the wars continuation 
the use of the presidential guards in the attack suggested a 
major offensive since they are rarely deployed in routine combat 
in addition the iraqi agency later also reported that air force 
jet fighters provided support 
the communique said the offensive was in retaliation for recent 
iranian incursions into northern iraq iraq reportedly used 
chemical weapons in those attacks 
the faw peninsula about 50 miles southeast of iraqs major port 
city of basra was lost to the iranian attackers in a major 
offensive in february 1986 
iranian troops carried out a nighttime amphibious landing 
erecting a pontoon bridge they eventually retained about 120 
square miles of the peninsula using their new positions to shell 
iraqs main air base near basra 
iran also reportedly used faw to launch antiship chinesemade 
silkworm missiles at kuwaiti ships and oil facilities 
the iraqi agency said the missile shower was fired into 
tehran early sunday and the rocket attack on shiraz some time 
later iran did not immediately acknowledge the attacks 
the four us navy men were flown out from bahrain in 
midafternoon after the navy honored them as brave men they 
were the most seriously injured of the 10 hurt in the mine blast 
thursday the mine was believed laid by iran 
the captain of the frigate in his first phone call to the 
united states since the ship struck the mine said he was told to 
abandon ship twice 
but cmdr paul x rinn said his crew of heroes saved a ship 
that was hit so hard her stern rose 15 feet in the air and flames 
shot 100 feet through her stacks 
it was close really close rinn said we took a very bad 
hit 
rinns account of the thursday incident was related saturday by 
his wife pamela 
rinn did not say who told him to abandon the ship which pulled 
into the united arab emirates port of dubai on saturday

while firstyear associates at the citys 20 
largest law offices can expect to pull down about 71000 a year 
paychecks for the most senior associates vary by as much as 56 
percent according to a new survey 
the study published in mondays edition of the new york law 
journal found that 17 of the 20 firms pay firstyear associates

however by the seventh year base salaries vary from 
cadwalader wickersham amp tafts 108000 to 169000 at sullivan amp 
cromwell 
george d reycraft a partner at cadwalader told the newspaper 
that associates normally get a bonus at his firm 
you see similar salaries in the early years because the firms 
are all competing for the same scarce resource coming out of the 
top law schools said william c cobb a houstonbased legal 
consultant 
in its survey the publication found average compensation for 
lawyers at the 20 firms are 71700 first year 80000 second

jose tavarez brought the street smarts of new york 
city to a battle sunday with a soviet foe 
the contest between the 15yearold harlem resident and moscow 
teenager andrei krasavin last just 15 minutes krasavin took a 
last look at the chessboard and resigned the victim of an unusual 
program to teach new york students english through the ancient game 
tavarez and his schoolmates however have enjoyed only mixed 
success in their chess matches in the chessworshiping soviet 
union homeland of world champion garri kasparov 
the first day they played they were sort of destroyed said 
william hall their english teacher and chess mentor 
the 11 students from junior high school no 99 in east harlem a 
crime and drugplagued area of manhattan came to the soviet union 
for two weeks to challenge counterparts at their favorite game 
the trip was masterminded by hall who teaches english through 
chess to 40 pupils from puerto rico ecuador el salvador 
nicaragua pakistan hong kong and other countries the students 
belong to his royal knights chess club 
i saw that kids who were having difficulty learning were 
intrigued by chess said 52yearold hall who has been teaching 
for 23 years the motivation was so great that they improved 
their english faster 
do they have an eggheadnerd image hall asked the answer 
is no with a capital n they play baseball soccer street 
hockey and their drive to excel in chess carries over 
the new yorkers clad in sneakers and blue jackets with their 
clubs name met their soviet opponents sunday at pioneer palace a 
childrens recreation center in moscows lenin hills in a 
thirdfloor classroom used to teach the game to budding 
grandmasters the americans sat down at brown wooden tables inlaid 
with chessboards to test themselves against some of the soviet 
capitals best young players 
previous showings by the royal knights who arrived in moscow 
april 10 and had played at the spartak and central soviet chess 
clubs ranged from disastrous to encouraging 
the russians know clever moves that we dont and that gives 
them control of the center of the board said tony pagan 15 
whose parents are from ecuador 
tavarez a club member of puerto rican origin who has played 
chess for only seven months was one of the winners sunday he 
wants to take on the best hall said on the way over here his 
question was does soviet leader mikhail gorbachev play chess 
however avram a pismenny trainer for the pioneers chess club 
said the americans had studied the game less than his players 
the tour began to take shape last year when the royal knights 
placed 17th in a national scholastic tournament two club members 
playing at the manhattan chess club met the womens champion maya 
chiburdanidze of the soviet union who suggested they visit her 
country 
it took 11 months of planning and fund raising as well as 
20000 in corporate sponsorship to make the idea a reality 
the group was scheduled to leave moscow on monday for eshera a 
resort on the black sea they will spend three days there travel 
to leningrad to visit that northern russian city and play more 
chess then return to new york on april 24

on a chair

the high school sophomore and cohost of homework hotline said 
later 
the live phonein television show is about as far from wheel 
of fortune as paducah is from hollywood but its been a success 
at showcasing bright students and tutoring those with schoolwork 
troubles 
organizers from the public school system a local vocational 
center and the chamber of commerce scheduled an encore show 
monday night on the cable channel where the hourlong homework 
hotline appeared five times this year as a pilot program 
bob a ruoff principal of the paducah area vocation education 
center says the show will probably be renewed for a second season 
the television equipment is donated and volunteers include 
teachers students and technical personnel to operate the equipment 
whats the cost blood sweat and tears said ruoff one 
of the things we believed in is that in the short term at least 
if you need something bad enough you can find it in the budget 
the show is broadcast mondays at 7 pm and had 90 callers its 
first night two students answer the telephones and four others 
armed with encyclopedias and other reference works take turns 
answering the questions sometimes using a blackboard 
more than half the questions are in math callers have also 
dialed the hotline asking how to diagram sentences for english 
class and for the name of the 16th us president abraham lincoln 
questions that stump the panel and its teacheradvisers are 
studied during the week and answered on the next show 
the easiest for hal a skateboard rider who wants to be an 
engineer or computer scientist are in math 
we had somebody ask for help with synthetic division he 
said it was something like x to the third power plus 3x 
squared plus 4x plus 2 divided by x minus 5 
these are awesome kids ruoff said its just so neat to 
be around them you can just feel the horsepower between their 
ears

geneva of a unmediated soviet troop withdrawal accord 
the guerrillas who were not party to the geneva agreement have 
said they will not be bound by any accord in which they did not 
participate they have vowed to continue the fight until the 
communist regime in kabul is toppled

john demjanjuk who has spent the past 11 years 
fighting charges he was the notorious nazi death camp guard ivan 
the terrible faces a verdict monday in his 14monthlong court 
battle in israel 
the threejudge panels 450page judgment is based on more than 
15000 pages of emotionally charged testimony from holocaust 
survivors documents experts and the suspect himself 
holocaust mastermind adolf eichmann the only other nazi war 
criminal to be tried in israel was convicted and hanged in 1962 
unlike eichmann demjanjuk has insisted he is an innocent victim of 
mistaken identity 
the retired autoworker from cleveland ohio is charged with 
being a brutally sadistic guard who operated gas chambers that 
killed 850000 jews at the treblinka death camp in nazioccupied 
poland in 1942 and 1943 ivan allegedly tortured prisoners on 
their way to their deaths 
many observers argue the case against demjanjuk has not been 
proven beyond a shadow of a doubt despite the tearful insistence 
of five death camp survivors who claim to recognize the defendant 
as ivan more than 40 years after the holocaust 
but few israelis doubt the judges will hand in a guilty verdict 
for them the only question is whether the ukrainianborn 
demjanjuk 68 will be spared the death penalty 
after the emotional accounts of the survivors people expect a 
guilty verdict said gabriel bron a reporter for the yediot 
ahronot newspaper who covered the trial 
many want vengeance and a death sentence but there is a 
minority voice calling for life imprisonment 
if demjanjuk is found guilty monday he will be sentenced at a 
later separate hearing 
about 250000 spectators attended the trials 106 sessions 
which the government held in a converted movie theater at a cost of 
650000 
despite holes in the prosecution case demjanjuk was plagued 
throughout the trial by a stumbling defense team which seemed to 
move two steps backward for every step forward 
demjanjuks relatives raised more than 650000 for the defense 
but their lawyers often appeared unprepared failed to come up with 
a coherent account of his whereabouts during world war ii and 
antagonized judges by engaging in behavior bordering on the absurd 
two defense witnesses walked off the stand in the middle of 
crossexamination one claiming the defense had threatened a law 
suit if he continued to testify 
other defense experts were discredited including one who 
retracted her testimony and another who tried to commit suicide 
after her credentials were questioned 
even demjanjuk grew frustrated firing mark oconnor of buffalo 
ny his attorney of seven years midway through the proceedings 
but demjanjuks supporters contend the defendants biggest 
problem was being tried before jewish judges of the same generation 
as the nazi victims testifying against him 
one judge polishborn zvi tal lost family in the holocaust 
much of the trial focused on a lengthy often repetitive debate 
over the authenticity of a key piece of prosecution evidence 
demjanjuks alleged nazi identity card 
about 500 exhibits including a paper clip were submitted to 
bolster the testimony of six prosecution experts who said the card 
was authentic six defense witnesses maintained the document was 
fake 
demjanjuk contends the document was fabricated by the soviet 
union to punish him for serving in an anticommunist unit formed by 
the nazis at the end of world war ii 
although interest waned and frustration mounted in israel as 
demjanjuks trial dragged on for months some israelis say the fact 
that it took place at all has healed some wounds 
the trial has served as a kind of catharsis for many holocaust 
victims said clevelandborn toby greenwald whose fatherinlaw 
menachem lost his entire family in nazi death camps 
he always refused to talk about his experiences but there was 
something about the trial that just opened up some kind of deep 
well she said he began to release all those pentup 
feelings 
but the prospect of a verdict has brought mixed emotions to 
dozens of nazi victims who attended the trial over the year 
if the judges dont find him guilty i think ill kill 
myself said holocaust survivor mordechai fuchs 63 as he 
tearfully fingered a worn photograph of his parents three brothers 
and a sister killed at treblinka 
even if demjanjuk wins an acquittal monday he will not walk 
away from the converted movie theater in jerusalem a free man 
stripped of his us citizenship before extradition to israel in 
february 1986 demjanjuk is stateless 
lawyers say that if he is acquitted they expect the united 
states to consider reactivating plans to deport demjanjuk to the 
soviet union such a move had been a possibility before 1983 when 
israel requested his extradition 
this is a man without a nation he has no papers when the 
trial ends our problems dont end theyre only beginning said 
demjanjuks soninlaw ed nishnic

amid complaints that the people deserve a 
park more than the dogs canines have won free running time in 
laurel canyon park atop the santa monica mountains 
at the urgings of such luminaries as artist david hockney and 
former vice president walter mondale the city council decreed 
friday that animals will be permitted to run free in the park 
during designated hours 
the battle has been brewing since dozens of adamant dog owners 
including hockney allowed their dogs to run loose in the affluent 
neighborhoods park in defiance of the citys leash law 
stars fought on both sides 
in a letter to the council psycho star anthony perkins 
complained that trips to the park were a nightmare 
my wife and my two schoolage sons no longer even want to go 
there at all at the risk of being run down by the dogs perkins 
wrote if anything there should be a fenced dog playground in a 
peoples park not the other way around 
hockney who featured the mountains mulholland drive in one of 
his paintings responded to complaints about dog droppings some 
of us think the world is a little too hygienic anyway 
mondale took sides at the request of his daughter eleanor who 
until moving to chicago liked to let her rottweiler teddy roam 
the park

drobac administrator of southeastern assistance dogs one of 
several programs of the speech hearing and learning center inc of 
greenville sc a dog that just wants to sit under the kitchen

including the phone a smoke alarm a doorbell a knock on the door 
or a baby crying 
she said the dogs are trained to go to their owners upon hearing 
a sound and then to the source of that sound except in the case of 
a smoke alarm when the dogs will dig at the ground

a roman catholic church leader 
on sunday urged president jose napoleon duarte to be more flexible 
in his demands so that peace talks can resume with leftwing rebels 
archbishop arturo rivera damas told reporters duarte was too 
firm in his demands that the guerrillas lay down their weapons and 
participate in political activities before the stalled negotiations 
can continue 
i see that this is a position in which he should also take 
into account the greater aspirations of the people if he really 
takes into account popular sentiments he should modify it rivera 
damas said 
he spoke to reporters briefly after saying mass at the 
metropolitan cathedral 
the farabundo marti national liberation front a coalition of 
five guerrilla groups is demanding a share of power immediately 
front leaders have said such a coalition government should rewrite 
the constitution and organize elections while the rebel combatants 
would be integrated into the armed forces 
duarte a christian democrat said earlier this month he would 
not budge in his demands 
i cannot allow them the guerrillas to get away with a 
formula in which they acquire power through force of arms he 
said during the inauguration of a new government hospital in a the 
western part of the country 
government and rebel representatives held three meetings between 
oct 15 1984 and oct 5 1987 all ended in deadlock rivera 
damas had acted as mediator in the negotiations 
the rebels broke off the last round ot talks in protest against 
the assassination of a prominent human rights activist 
peace negotiations are called for under a regional plan that 
duarte and the four other central american presidents signed last 
august in guatemala 
the plan calls for ceasefires in the conflicts in the central 
american countries an end to outside military aid to insurgents 
and reforms to bring about greater democracy 
human rights groups say more than 65000 people have been slain 
in political violence in the salvadoran civil war that began in 
1979 with most of the victims civilians

the freedom of a former marlow police chief 
accused of killing his wifes first husband could hinge on whether 
a statement made by the chiefs father just before his death will 
be admitted as evidence in court 
robert chambers 36 was charged with seconddegree murder 
friday and spent the weekend in the cheshire county jail in 
westmoreland after failing to make 200000 bail if convicted he 
could be sentenced to life in prison 
he was charged one month after authorities dug up the remains of 
russell bean whose body was secretly buried in the chiefs yard 10 
years ago 
john b garvey a concord lawyer and former professor at 
franklin pierce law school specializing in evidence said the case 
may rise or fall on many of the judges rulings on admissibility 
of evidence 
attorney general stephen merrill said he expected chambers 
defense to challenge the use of the fathers statement but he said 
the prosecution had enough evidence to win a conviction even 
without the statement 
beans remains were found buried 25 feet deep in chambers yard 
on march 14 an autopsy showed he appeared to have been beaten with 
a blunt instrument on the head and chest 
police acted after chambers sister melissa gave them a tip on 
march 10 the day after the death of her father 61yearold 
clifton chambers melissa chambers said in affidavits that her 
father told her he had helped his son bury the body after robert 
admitted accidentally killing bean in a fight she said her father 
told her to tell police the story upon his death 
clifton chambers granddaughter lorrie wheeler gave police a 
similar affidavit 
public defender mark sisti representing chambers said he would 
disagree strenuously with the use of the fathers statements as 
hearsay evidence 
in homicide cases new hampshire courts allow hearsay evidence 
to be admitted when it involves deathbed confessions 
but sisti said the fathers statement would not qualify because 
it did not concern a person the father thought was causing his own 
death also the lawyer said the fathers words werent a dying 
statement because he spoke to his daughter and granddaughter days 
before he suffered a cerebral hemorrhage and died 
the state rules provide other exceptions for using hearsay 
evidence but the defense could challenge it on the grounds that 
the fathers reliability as a witness cannot be tested and that 
chambers cannot be granted his sixth amendment right to confront 
his accuser 
merrill said he anticipates the state supreme court will settle 
the admissibility of the fathers statement 
i feel very doubtful that russell bean would ever have been 
found without the fathers statement merrill said but he said 
investigators after talking to 15 or 20 people have enough 
evidence to convict chambers even without the declaration he did 
not elaborate 
bean 25 when he was last seen in 1978 was a good friend of 
chambers 
chambers and his wife deborah swapped partners with bean and 
his wife sylvia according to affadivits by chambers 
brotherinlaw louis lacourse and melissa chambers 
sylvia divorced bean after he disappeared and chambers divorced 
deborah and then sylvia and chambers married they separated after 
beans remains were found sylvia has denied any wifeswapping 
chambers has resigned as marlows parttime chief and took a 
leave of absence as parttime chief of nearby gilsum

former georgia democratic party chairman bert

about 40 percent of the vote in this weeks new york democratic 
primary 
but lance contends that for jackson new york is not a 
mustwin contest 
jesses in a position where obviously he does not have to win 
but massachusetts gov michael dukakis does he said 
lance who was federal budget director in the carter 
administration and has served as an unofficial adviser to the 
jackson campaign said jackson could benefit from a close 
secondplace finish in the tuesday primary 
lance told the rome newstribune last week he thinks jackson 
will improve on his 25 percent showing in new york in 1984 
depending on how dukakis and sen albert gore jr of tennessee 
split the remaining votes lance said 40 percent could be enough 
to win 
if dukakis posted a strong victory in new york that would 
result in great pressure by those who dont want to see jackson 
continue to do well to try to say its all over lance said 
lance warned against premature statements that dukakis has the 
democratic nomination wrapped up 
whether thats accurate you still have to wait and see he 
said you cant deny the people the right to make their choice 
and that means youve got to go through that whole process 
because pennsylvania ohio indiana california new jersey all are

the top us trade envoy 
sunday called for a framework agreement by december to end the 
global farm subsidy war but the european common markets farm 
commissioner failed to budge on the issue 
following weekend talks with his counterparts from the european 
community japan and canada us trade representative clayton 
yeutter said there was no justification for industrialized 
countries to continue subsidizing exports of farm products or other 
goods 
but yeutter also said at a news conference following the 
ministerial retreat on quadra island near vancouver that the 
meeting had seen little progress in resolving the issue 
the retreat was one of two weekend quadrilateral trade meetings 
held each year the next is scheduled for gull lake minn on june 
2224 
realistically yeutter said the reagan administration would 
like an outline agreement by december on eliminating farm subsidies 
within the 95nation general agreement on tariffs on trade 
the gatt agreement is being renegotiated in a round of talks 
launched in september 1986 in punta del este uruguay a crucial 
midterm meeting of all members is scheduled in montreal next 
december 
the united states has proposed phasing out of farm subsidies 
that create export surpluses by the year 2000 
yeutter acknowledged that the 12nation european community 
whose subsidyheavy budget is dominated by its farm program 
considered the target unrealistic and said he was willing to look 
at a longer time frame 
but lets not conclude that its impossible to rid the world 
of these onerous practices he said 
european community trade commissioner willy de clercq said the 
eec already had adopted a policy of curbing farm production but he 
described the us proposal as unreasonable and accused the united 
states of preaching free trade while practicing intervention 
both of us spend about 30 billion a year to support 
farming de clercq told reporters there are about 25 to 3 
million farmers in the united states and 12 million in the european 
community its not difficult to draw the conclusion which farmers 
are more supported 
he cited a recent increase in the us export enhancement 
program under which nearly 12 million tons of cutrate wheat was 
sold to the soviet union in the past year 
de clercq said the eec was willing to negotiate on farm 
subsidies but only as part of a balanced global package 
covering areas such as investment services and improved access for 
products from tropical third world countries 
canadian trade minister john crosbie said he hoped for an 
agreement by december to at least freeze farm subsidies at current 
levels 
canada and the cairns group of grain exporters that include 
australia say they have been victimized by the subsidy war because 
their treasuries cannot compete with the us and eec giants 
the issue will be in the spotlight throughout the year 
including next months organization for economic cooperation and 
development meeting in paris the sevennation world economic 
summit in toronto in june and the next scheduled trade 
quadrilateral in june 
both de clercq and hajime tamure the japanese trade minister 
said they welcomed the uscanada free trade agreement negotiated 
last year but yet to be ratified as a symbol of more open world 
trading 
but de clercq said eec officials still are studying the pact to 
ensure that it falls under gatt rules

israeli sources said sunday that israeli agents 
had assassinated plo official khalil alwazir the no 2 man in the 
organization who headed the uprising in the occupied territories 
prime minister yitzhak shamir declined comment 
the sources said the operation was carried out jointly by the 
mossad intelligence service the israeli navy and an elite commando 
unit they spoke on condition of anonymity 
they said it had been postponed several times before saturday 
alwazir who was in charge of the plos military operations 
against israel was shot to death saturday at his home in the tunis 
suburb of la marsa by an eightmember squad 
palestine liberation organization officials blamed israel 
saying the killing was designed to demoralize palestinians and end 
plodirected protests in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
im not ready to relate to these matters shamir told the 
associated press at his office in jerusalem when asked about 
reports israel was behind the operation 
nbc news said sunday night it had been told that shamir was so 
happy at the success of the operation he sent a message 
congratulating the commandos while they were still sailing home 
it did not say who provided that information but said shamir 
spent a tense friday night waiting for the news and was overjoyed 
there were no israeli casualities the report said shamir told the 
military chief of staff the assassination showed israel could 
strike far and fast 
the israeli news media no mention of such a shamir message and 
the prime minister could not be reached late sunday for comment on 
the nbc report 
foreign minister shimon peres coleader of the coalition 
government said in an interview on israel radio that he hoped 
alwazirs assassination would not affect peace efforts 
apparently referring to alwazir he added we have to uproot 
violence as a factor that delays a political development 
people who use violence will in the end see the limits of violence 
it leads nowhere 
the issue came up only briefly in israels regular cabinet 
meeting sunday israel radio said that when shamir was asked what 
happened he said he had heard the details on the radio 
nbc television said shamir peres and defense minister yitzhak 
rabin approved the assassination after fatah guerrillas hijacked a 
bus and killed three israelis in southern israels negev desert 
last month 
former intelligence officials and israeli newspapers openly 
compared the assassination to israels april 1973 raid on plo 
offices in beirut in which three top plo officials were killed 
they also noted israel not rival plo factions or arab regimes 
had the ability to mount such a sophisticated operation 1500 miles 
from its shores 
rafael eytan who resigned as head of a defense ministry 
intelligence unit after the jonathan pollard spy scandal in 1985 
said there is no doubt there is a parallel between the attacks 
the 1973 slaying was aimed at ali hassan salameh known as abu 
hassan the plos security and intelligence chief who later died in 
a car bomb attack instead alwazirs predecessor kamel adwan 
fatah spokesman kamal nasser and mohammed abu najjar a key figure 
in the black september terror group were killed 
in the 1973 attack the navy put a commando team ashore rented 
cars were used to get to and from the target documents were seized 
and a women participated in the raid 
in saturdays attack rented cars were used documents taken and 
a woman was among the hit team 
israeli experts say alwazir was responsible for a list of 
bloody attacks such as the 1975 takeover of the savoy hotel in tel 
aviv in which 11 hostages were slain and a march 1978 bus hijacking 
in which 33 israelis were killed and 82 wounded 
three israelis involved in the 1973 raid now hold senior 
security positions the raids leader was maj gen amnon shahak 
now head of military intelligence it was planned by gen ehud 
barak the current deputy chief of staff and one of the commandos 
was col yigal pressler now shamirs adviser on terrorism 
in an interview conducted before the tunis attack and published 
this week by the army weekly bamahane shahak said israel had a 
policy of striking at palestinian guerrilla leaders 
in my opinion whoever leads acts of terror is a proper target 
for liquidation whoever uses terrorism against us should be a 
target shahak was quoted as saying 
asked if such an operation could be mounted now he said i 
have no doubt that today its possible to do it only better 
similar remarks came from pressler who told the daily davar 
newspaper april 12 that we have to initiate deadly attacks 
against the terrorist leaders 
the daily yediot ahronot said israel had several motives to kill 
alwazir these included showing the palestinians that israel could 
strike a deadly blow from a great distance and demonstrate to the 
arab world that israels military capabilities had not weakened

john demjanjuk who has spent the past 11 years 
fighting charges he was the notorious nazi death camp guard ivan 
the terrible faces a verdict monday in his 14monthlong court 
battle in israel 
the threejudge panels 450page judgment is based on more than 
15000 pages of emotionally charged testimony from holocaust 
survivors documents experts and the suspect himself 
holocaust mastermind adolf eichmann the only other nazi war 
criminal to be tried in israel was convicted and hanged in 1962 
unlike eichmann demjanjuk has insisted he is an innocent victim of 
mistaken identity 
the retired autoworker from cleveland ohio is charged with 
being a brutally sadistic guard who operated gas chambers that 
killed 850000 jews at the treblinka death camp in nazioccupied 
poland in 1942 and 1943 ivan allegedly tortured prisoners on 
their way to their deaths 
during the trial witnesses told the court that ivan the 
terrible would stand near the entrance of the gas chambers and 
strike the doomed prisoners with a metal bar or bayonet 
many observers argue the case against demjanjuk has not been 
proven beyond a shadow of a doubt despite the tearful insistence 
of five death camp survivors who claim to recognize the defendant 
as ivan more than 40 years after the holocaust 
but few israelis doubt the judges will hand in a guilty verdict 
for them the only question is whether the ukrainianborn 
demjanjuk 68 will be spared the death penalty 
after the emotional accounts of the survivors people expect a 
guilty verdict said gabriel bron a reporter for the yediot 
ahronot newspaper who covered the trial 
many want vengeance and a death sentence but there is a 
minority voice calling for life imprisonment 
if demjanjuk is found guilty monday he will be sentenced at a 
later separate hearing 
about 250000 spectators attended the trials 106 sessions 
which the government held in a converted movie theater at a cost of 
650000 
despite holes in the prosecution case demjanjuk was plagued 
throughout the trial by a stumbling defense team which seemed to 
move two steps backward for every step forward 
demjanjuks relatives raised more than 650000 for the defense 
but their lawyers often appeared unprepared failed to come up with 
a coherent account of his whereabouts during world war ii and 
antagonized judges by engaging in behavior bordering on the absurd 
two defense witnesses walked off the stand in the middle of 
crossexamination one claiming the defense had threatened a law 
suit if he continued to testify 
other defense experts were discredited including one who 
retracted her testimony and another who tried to commit suicide 
after her credentials were questioned 
even demjanjuk grew frustrated firing mark oconnor of buffalo 
ny his attorney of seven years midway through the proceedings 
but demjanjuks supporters contend the defendants biggest 
problem was being tried before jewish judges of the same generation 
as the nazi victims testifying against him 
one judge polishborn zvi tal lost family in the holocaust 
much of the trial focused on a lengthy often repetitive debate 
over the authenticity of a key piece of prosecution evidence 
demjanjuks alleged nazi identity card 
about 500 exhibits including a paper clip were submitted to 
bolster the testimony of six prosecution experts who said the card 
was authentic six defense witnesses maintained the document was 
fake 
demjanjuk contends the document was fabricated by the soviet 
union to punish him for serving in an anticommunist unit formed by 
the nazis at the end of world war ii 
although interest waned and frustration mounted in israel as 
demjanjuks trial dragged on for months some israelis say the fact 
that it took place at all has healed some wounds 
the trial has served as a kind of catharsis for many holocaust 
victims said clevelandborn toby greenwald whose fatherinlaw 
menachem lost his entire family in nazi death camps 
he always refused to talk about his experiences but there was 
something about the trial that just opened up some kind of deep 
well she said he began to release all those pentup 
feelings 
but the prospect of a verdict has brought mixed emotions to 
dozens of nazi victims who attended the trial over the year 
if the judges dont find him guilty i think ill kill 
myself said holocaust survivor mordechai fuchs 63 as he 
tearfully fingered a worn photograph of his parents three brothers 
and a sister killed at treblinka 
even if demjanjuk wins an acquittal monday he will not walk 
away from the converted movie theater in jerusalem a free man 
stripped of his us citizenship before extradition to israel in 
february 1986 demjanjuk is stateless 
lawyers say that if he is acquitted they expect the united 
states to consider reactivating plans to deport demjanjuk to the 
soviet union such a move had been a possibility before 1983 when 
israel requested his extradition 
this is a man without a nation he has no papers when the 
trial ends our problems dont end theyre only beginning said 
demjanjuks soninlaw ed nishnic

a fire that threatened an entire downtown 
block of old victorian buildings badly damaged two buildings 
occupied by squatters and killed one woman officials said sunday 
the fire of undetermined cause also badly damaged a 
threestory house that had been converted into an apartment 
building total damages were estimated at 400000 assistant fire 
chief don matthews said 
the blaze began about 1030 pm saturday about a block from the 
citys new hyatt regency hotel and was so intense that half the 
citys firefighting force was called out matthews said it took 90 
minutes to bring the fire under control 
the main problem was it was a congested block of 100yearold 
buildings and it would have gone through them in a few minutes 
said matthews 
one of the squatter buildings belonged to oakland tribune 
society columnist robin orr and had been the center of controversy 
for months 
homeless people had occupied the building to seek shelter from 
the winter police removed them once matthews said but squatters 
broke back in a short while later 
the coroners office said sunday it was trying to unravel 
conflicting stories about the identity of the dead woman found 
in one of the squatter buildings one man was reported missing in 
the fire but matthews said no additional bodies had been found by 
midday sunday

the boyfriend of one of four brutally 
slain teenagers blames authorities for not arresting the murder 
suspect after the man allegedly threatened him with a knife and 
smashed his pickup truck 
ricky moore who had been dating 17yearold shannon mann for 
about six weeks said saturday that if police and prosecutors had 
acted more quickly the bloodbath in which shannon and three 
siblings died might have been avoided 
moore said he filed charges against shannons jealous 
exboyfriend after an incident on march 28 spoke with police 
repeatedly and gave detectives statements 
i thought when someone attempted to kill someone they picked 
him up and off to jail he went the truck driver said saturday 
leo narvaiz 20 was arrested after fridays killings and is 
being held on four capital murder charges and another charge in 
lieu of a 405 million bond 
authorities found cuts on narvaizs arms and stabs to the thigh 
but the suspects father leopoldo narvaiz sr said one of his 
sons friends told him the wounds were received in a fight with 
another man at the manns home the evening of the slayings 
moore told the san antonio light that shannon had been trying to 
get narvaiz to leave her alone for more than a year without 
success the mann family moved just 2 weeks ago to get away from 
narvaizs constant harassment and alleged breakins moore said 
moore 24 said narvaiz went on a jealous rampage on march 28 
breaking out the windows and bashing the fenders of moores 
4monthold pickup causing about 2000 in damage 
he said narvaiz later repeatedly threatened to kill him with a 
fishcleaning knife moore said he averted an attack by hitting 
narvaiz on the side of the neck with a baseball bat and knocking 
him down 
the suspects father said his son told him he smashed the truck 
windows because moore tried to run over him the dallas times 
herald reported 
when police arrived at the mann familys home after that 
incident moore said he thought they were going to take narvaiz to 
jail 
shannon and her 19yearold sister jennifer also went to police 
headquarters tuesday to give statements on the incident moore 
said they were killed friday along with their 15yearold sister 
martha and 11yearold brother ernest jr 
moore who visited with the teenagers parents friday said he 
is outraged at what he considers footdragging by police and 
prosecutors 
the elder narvaiz claims his son is innocent and was in love 
with one of the victims he is not the type of boy who would do a 
foolish thing like that he said adding that his family has been 
harrassed by threatening and obscene phone calls 
law enforcement officials responded saturday that even if they 
had speeded up development of the cases against narvaiz the 
criminal justice system is so clogged it probably would have taken 
even more time to secure his arrest 
after the march 28 incident police opened two separate 
investigations one for a misdemeanor terroristic threat handled by 
the homicide division and one for thirddegree felony criminal 
mischief handled by the burglary detail 
homicide sgt mike akeroyd said saturday the investigation into 
the terroristic threat was completed and walked over to the 
district attorneys office april 5 but no action was taken 
district attorney fred rodriguez said he was told friday that 
his office had accepted the misdemeanor case and he asked why an 
arrest warrant had not been issued 
what i was told was no warrant was issued because the 
misdemeanor courts do not issue arrest warrants in class b 
misdemeanor cases because of the flood of cases they handle and the 
overcrowded jail situation rodriguez said the court would 
have issued a summons for narvaiz to appear in court 
assistant district attorney ed coffey who screens criminal 
cases submitted for prosecution said his office had not yet issued 
a summons in that case 
on the felony criminal mischief case coffey said it at one 
point was rejected by the district attorneys office because it did 
not have moores statement as the victim attached 
we were forced to send the case back to the police coffey 
said we then accepted the case the day before the murders 
after police returned the case with the missing statement attached

a passenger aboard a hijacked kuwait 
airways jumbo jet said sunday about 35 hostages on the plane faced 
certain death if kuwait refused to release 17 convicted terrorists 
all the passengers are in good health i hope the kuwait 
government will act quickly to liberate the 17 young prisoners 
otherwise we all face a black end said the man he identified 
himself as suleiman farhan doukhi 
doukhi who spoke arabic in a firm voice also sent greetings 
to the kuwait people to my mother and father and to all those who 
miss me 
the message appeared to be a recording 
on friday the hijackers brought two other passengers to the 
aircrafts radio to make similar statements to the control tower 
and one on thursday 
shortly bt sunday several algerian police cars traveled to and 
from the plane it could not be determined who was in the cars the 
kuwaiti delegation remained in an airport lounge well after 
midnight 
it was the latest the delegation had stayed at the airport since 
negotiations began leading to speculation the hijackers might make 
a gesture connected with the moslems observance of ramadan the 
monthlong period of fasting ramadan begins monday 
since the bangkoktokuwait flight was hijacked april 5 the 
hijackers have demanded the release of the 17 extremists jailed 
for bombing the us and french embassies in kuwait in december 
1983 
kuwait has rejected the demand 
the plane carrying 112 passengers first landed in iran where 
57 hostages were released and additional hijackers reportedly 
boarded the plane the jet then went to larnaca cyprus where the 
gunmen killed two passengers and released 13 
on wednesday it arrived in algiers and on friday the hijackers 
released an ailing hostage 
algerian officials said sunday that palestine liberation 
organization leader yasser arafat was expected in algiers but 
declined to say when he would arrive or whether he would play a 
role in the negotiations 
on the morning of the 13th day of the crisis algerian 
authorities abruptly expelled hundreds of print and television 
reporters from the section of the vip lounge where they had been 
staying for nearly a week 
reporters moved into tents erected by algerian security men on 
the lawn near the lounge 
at about the same time algerian policemen armed with pistols 
took up position on the roof of the terminal building facing the 
plane it was not clear why they had been dispatched 
one official who refused to be identified by name said the 
lounge was needed for arab ambassadors expected to come to the 
airport for a possible expansion of the negotiations 
the official declined to provide any details 
the shiite moslem gunmen have threatened to fly the jet out of 
algeria to settle our score with kuwait somewhere else early 
sunday they said they would extend their departure time 
warning to pursue negotiations there has been no indication of 
where they might go 
the estimated five to eight hijackers asked for and received 
about 6600 gallons of fuel to maintain conditions inside the 
plane but did not set a deadline or directly repeat their previous 
threats to kill the hostages and blow up the plane the hijackers 
also asked for and were given newspapers 
on saturday sheik jaber alahmed alsabah kuwaits ruler 
telephoned president chadli bendjedid of algeria to ask that the 
plane not be allowed to leave 
in a brief statement in arabic to the control tower the 
hijackers said at the request of our brothers the algerians we 
announce that we have agreed to extend the departure time warning 
to give an opportunity for the efforts by the algerians 
algerian negotiators boarded the blue and white boeing 747 twice 
during the day first at 1110 am 610 am and again at 445 
pm 1145 am

hedi khediri pursued negotiations with a highlevel kuwaiti

a trapeze artist fell to her death sunday 
hitting the floor of a circus tent headfirst before about 900 
horrified spectators police said 
belinda amandis 31 of sarasota was performing alone without a 
net about 17 feet above center ring of circus usa when she missed a 
maneuver said police and circus owner david mobbs 
while swinging back and forth balancing on her back she 
attempted to drop upside down and catch the bar with her knees 
mobbs said performing without using her hands she missed the bar 
and fell 
she fell forward and she was trying to right herself up and 
by doing that she fell right on the side of her face she wasnt 
that high up she just hit the wrong way said tom koenig 40 of 
hialeah who was at the show with his two children 
his wife annie koenig said at the second she fell 
everybody was silent everybody thought it was part of the act 
then we realized what had happened 
spectator carol johnson of coral gables said i saw it when it 
happened i just turned my head and said oh my god she fell 
the crew wanted to go on with the show in her memory mobbs 
said but the performance was immediately ended because police 
evacuated the audience ms amandis was the first act after an 
intermission 
mobbs described the solo trapeze act as perhaps the hardest in 
the circus because there is no one else to rely on 
she was one of the best in the business she preferred not to 
work with a net she felt it limited her he said 
ringmaster roy houston said i watched the whole thing ive 
seen a lot of them in this business its part of the risk that you 
take 
ms amandis a native of denmark had performed with several 
circuses and was respected as one of the worlds best trapeze 
artist mobbs said 
belinda amandis was the performers stage name police sgt 
jorge hierro said and she also was known as belinda nielsen 
visingard 
the miamibased circus had erected its big top across from the 
miami springs river city festival mobbs said he assembles the 
circus two or three times a year for shows in the area

toilet of a state psychiatric hospital after the babys mother a 
patient gave birth unattended authorities say 
the cook county medical examiners office local and state 
police are investigating the incident to determine whether the 
child was stillborn or died after birth 
mental health groups meanwhile questioned how a woman could 
give birth unnoticed in a crowded hospital ward

minutes before the babys body was found last tuesday night and 
found no indication that she was in labor said david devane a

a communal bathroom devane said saturday 
no charges have been filed against the mother patricia ales 
34 who was pregnant when admitted to the hospital in october 
authorities say hospital officials declined to discuss ms ales 
mental condition 
i find it incredible that this could happen and nobody knew 
she was was in labor said jan holcomb former president of the

does it take the death of a newborn baby to recognize that our 
underfunded and understaffed state mental health facilities can 
pose a threat to the health and safety of our most vulnerable 
citizens she asked 
devane said state laws require the department to serve patients 
in the least restrictive environment possible there was no

the name of a senator shot to death in northern 
italy was included on an assassination list found in hideouts of 
the red brigades terrorist organization an official was quoted as 
saying sunday 
sen roberto ruffilli was killed saturday at his apartment in 
the town of forli he had been shot twice in the back of the neck 
an autopsy showed 
ruffilli 51 a christian democrat was a close friend and 
adviser of premier ciriaco de mita and had been developing a plan 
to improve italys slowmoving bureacracy 
rosario priore an investigating magistrate told rai state 
television that ruffillis name appeared on a list of possible 
targets found in red brigades hideouts in past months 
an anonymous caller to the bologna office of the rome newspaper 
la republica on saturday asserted responsibility for the killing on 
behalf of the red brigades 
a spokesman for the interior ministry quoted the caller as 
saying we have killed sen ruffilli attacking at the heart of 
the state red brigades for the formation of the fighting communist 
party 
the fighting communist party is a faction of the red brigades 
de mita presided at an emergency meeting sunday that included 
the interior minister and police officials but few developments in 
the case were reported 
at de mitas urging ruffilli had been developing the christian 
democrats plan to reform italys cumbersome bureaucracy and 
lawmaking process 
priore said one of the fighting communist partys goals 
according to seized documents was to thwart the process to reform 
italys institutions one of their biggest fears was new 
legislation that would make the state more efficient priore said 
ruffillis killing came exactly 40 years after a national 
election that ended the communists participation in government 
a vatican official said pope john paul ii telephoned de mita to 
express his sorrow about ruffillis death saying the italian 
nation is threatened but we hope and pray 
meanwhile an antiterrorist investigator speaking on condition 
of anonymity raised the possibility that the killing was linked to 
the car bombing thursday outside a naples uso club in which an 
american navy servicewoman and four italians were killed 
the investigator said the killing of ruffilli might have been 
timed to divert attention of security forces looking for junzo 
okudaira a japanese red army terrorist suspected in the naples 
bombing 
the investigator noted that terrorists of the japanese red army 
and the italian red brigades have trained together in lebanon and 
have links to middle east terrorists

it may sound like a childhood nightmare 
come true people buying specially wrapped gift boxes of onions 
but this is the age of the designer onion and industry 
officials say the lower rio grande valleys grapefruitsize variety 
known as the texas 1015 supersweet has onion enthusiasts crying for 
more 
at least eight packers are shipping gift boxes from the valley 
at prices amounting to a dollar or more per onion 
theyll put them in there with some of this eastertype grass 
and ship them ups united parcel service said dr leonard pike 
a texas aampm university horticultural scientist who developed the 
1015 
since 1974 valley growers have helped fund 1 million in 
research grants for the continuing project that pike leads in the 
quest for a sweeter milder onion 
he released his round yellow texas grano 1015 named for the 
optimum planting date of oct 15 in 1983 providing increasing 
competition for sweet onions such as the sweet vidalia from 
georgia hawaiis maui maui and californias imperial valley 
grano in the 1015s name means it is a round variety as 
opposed to flatter granex onions 
its helped us because its got a lot more people eating 
onions that didnt eat them before dale deberry owner of 
progreso produce co said of the trend you can see that by the 
number of tourists who come by here asking for 1015s 
the sweet spring onions are available only for a sixweek period 
beginning in midapril deberrys company and others have started 
labeling the 1015s with individual stickers to help consumers who 
ask for them by name 
right now theres a national obsession for sweet onions and i 
know that sounds strange said paula fouchek executive director 
of the harlingenbased texas fresh promotional board which is 
waging an aggressive national marketing campaign for the states 
designer onions 
theres a lot of people who are really fanatical about them 
she said 
about 80 percent of texas onion crop is the sweet spring 
variety said erv sandlin a promotional marketing coordinator with 
the texas department of agriculture 
texas onion growers got 778 million for their crop last year 
making it the top moneymaker among fresh vegetables said doug 
bierstedt with the texas agricultural statistics service 
statewide onion acreage this year is nearly 19000 acres of 
which 14000 is for the spring crop bierstedt said about 3500 
texas acres are planted in the 1015 
texas niche in the national market is that its south texas 
spring crop hits the market early growers say until the spring 
onions hit the market consumers are eating the more pungent winter 
storage variety grown in many states 
we come off at a time of a year when the old onions are about 
gone and spring begins said othal brand sr whose mcallenbased 
griffin amp brand inc is the largest onion producer in texas 
on an early spring afternoon brand who is mayor of mcallen 
tromped through a muddy field to show off some of his earliest crop 
isnt that beautiful brand asked after pulling two of the 
bulbs up the only thing prettier than that is money in the 
bank 
other texas onions usually begin hitting the market before the 
1015s are ready the drawback from the spring crop grown in the 
short days of winter is that they do not last long in storage 
growers say 
pike said he is working on ways to store the spring onions 
longer he also is researching the source of the 1015s mildness 
which he said stems mainly from a low level of pyruvic acid which 
reacts with sulfur compounds to produce some of the unsavory 
qualities in a more typical onion 
very rarely will you get one 1015 that will bring tears to 
your eyes pike said 
the 1015 also causes fewer stomach and breath problems said 
pike who thinks that is why many people who do not eat onions will 
eat the mild ones of the spring season 
most of the 1015s weigh more than a pound and some have been 
reported at three pounds according to pike

malcolm bricklin whose failed 1970s sports car 
venture preceded his introduction of the cutpriced yugo to 
america is being bought out of his auto importing business the 
president of bricklins global motors inc has disclosed 
global motors is the parent of yugo america inc which 
introduced the 3900 yugoslavianbuilt auto to the united states 
in august 1985 and of proton america inc which plans to import a 
malaysianbuilt car by years end 
an investormanagement group headed by mabon nugent and co a 
new york investment banker agreed three weeks ago to give global 
motors a cash infusion in exchange for global stock and debt said 
william prior globals president 
the deal was to be announced publicly on monday and explanatory 
letters were mailed to yugo dealers late last week prior said in 
an interview the deal was expected to close within a week he said 
bricklin through prior declined comment 
he just has other interests that he intends to pursue outside 
the automobile business prior said friday of bricklin adding he 
didnt believe bricklin was being squeezed out 
prior said the investor group will inject more than 40 million 
into the company global will pay about 20 million for bricklin 
industries 60 percent to 70 percent stake in the business and will 
inject at least that amount into the business itself 
bricklin also will sell the company his personal global stake 
bricklin who will remain a paid consultant to global motors 
introduced his gullwinged acrylicandfiberglass bodied sv1 
sports car in 1974 but production never neared his 12000ayear 
goal and the company died in 1976 
the little yugo marketed as basic cheap transportation and 
aimed at buyers who otherwise might buy used cars sold so fast 
after its us introduction that dealers never had enough to fill 
orders 
but it soon came to be known as a shoddily built poorly 
designed vehicle in the february 1986 consumer reports the 
consumers union commented it is hard to recommend the yugo at 
any price the yugo scores below every other car weve tested in 
recent years 
two years later consumers unions opinion hadnt improved 
despite thousands of changes made to the car and a price increase 
to 4199 
the yugo is the cheapest car on the market unfortunately 
its also one of the worst cars cu has ever tested the money 
saved in buying a yugo may well be spent in maintaining it 
bricklin who at age 29 had introduced the subaru to the united 
states in 1968 said in early 1985 that by yugos second year in 
the united states he expected sales of 150000 by its third year 
he planned to sell 250000 
but the yugos reputation was so poor and its competition in the 
new lowend market so tough that less than 50000 were sold in 
1987 its second full year of sales firstquarter sales in 1988 
fell 36 percent from a year earlier 
instead the south koreanmade hyundai excel the first of 
several yugo competitors who crowded into the cheapcar market set 
a firstyear import sales record of 150000 units in 1986 
in january yugo america mounted an aggressive campaign 
including a 48 million advertising budget and the introduction of 
the yugo gvx with a stronger engine and suspension and more frills 
it also provided a oneyear complete warranty that prior 
estimated will cost yugo america 19 million annually during the 
first year yugo america pays for all maintenance and parts 
routine or not 
in june prior said yugo america plans to introduce a yugo 
convertible complete with a heated glass rear window and other 
amenities in the 8000 range he hopes that as the cheapest 
convertible in america it will sell the way its older brother once 
did

division had sued arthur andersen to recover some of the 275 
million in tax money used to protect depositors after home state

because it was auditor of home state which had overinvested funds 
in esm government securities inc of ft lauderdale fla which 
later collapsd 
andersens audits did not find anything wrong with home states 
finances or investments 
andersen maintained it had no way of knowing esm was a

a new survey shows the newspaper industry is 
falling far short of its goal of making minority employment in the 
newsroom equal to the percentage of minorities in the country by 
the end of the century 
the study by the american society of newspaper editors indicates 
a slow growth in minority newspaper employees in the past decade 
the percentage of blacks hispanics asians and american indians in 
the newsroom is 702 percent this year the survey found up from 
656 percent in 1987 and 395 percent in 1978 the first year the 
survey was done 
but arnold rosenfeld editor of the austin texas 
americanstatesman and chairman of the asnes minorities committee 
said last week such continued improvement is still not enough to 
meet the asne goal 
the minority population in the united states in the year 2000 is 
expected to be at least 25 percent minorities made up about 20 
percent of the population in the 1980 census 
in a report to the asne convention rosenfeld said the survey 
also found that whites still dominate supervisory positions at 
newspapers with 959 percent of supervisors white and 41 percent 
minorities down the ladder 934 percent of copy editors 92 
percent of reporters and 907 percent of photographers are white 
the asne study also showed that the majority of us daily 
newspapers still have no minority professionals on their staffs 
with minority hiring slowest at papers with circulations under 
25000 
obviously rosenfeld said much needs to be done 
katherine fanning editor of the christian science monitor and 
former president of the asne singled out the poor minorityhiring 
record of small newspapers in a speech to the asne convention 
this is deplorable she said and it is a weakness which 
must be corrected if we are to serve this country as we should 
the surveys findings also drew criticism from the president of 
the national association of black journalists a 1000member group 
based in reston va 
its clear to me that whatever they are doing theyre not 
getting the results we so desperately want said dewayne wickham 
president of the black journalists group and a columnist for 
gannett news service 
the media plays a vital role in society we shape what people 
know about our society wickham added and if the media is 
manned by white men then the perceptions the public gets will be 
filtered through those people 
the asne survey is considered the most reliable measure of 
minority employment at daily newspapers this years figures were 
based on responses from 1092 newspapers representing 67 percent 
of the 1630 dailies in the country the responses were projected 
to the industry as a whole the group said it did a followup study 
of nonrespondents two years ago and found that the projections 
were accurate within threetenths of a percentage point 
the asne began surveying minority employment in 1978 that was 
also the year the group adopted the goal of making the percentage

chrysler corp and the united auto workers union 
on monday open early national contract negotiations aimed at 
healing their recentlybruised relationship and adopting 
innovations to make chrysler more competitive 
negotiators led by chrysler vice president anthony st john and 
uaw vice president marc stepp are attempting to reach a pact to 
cover 59500 active and 8000 laidoff chrysler workers whose labor 
contract expires sept 14 
the uaw is seeking a twoyear duration for the new contract so 
it will expire with the gm and ford pacts in 1990 
the two sides will work within a pattern contract established 
last fall with ford motor co and general motors corp the 
groundbreaking agreements forbid plant closings not announced 
before labor contract talks begin and prevents layoffs except 
during production slowdowns caused by poor sales 
they also feature sixmonth joint managementlabor studies at 
each plant to find ways to improve productivity and efficiency 
including adoption of socalled team concept worker organization 
harley shaiken a labor and technology expert at the university 
of california at san diego said chrysler is counting on such 
studies to pave the way for companywide adoption of the socalled 
modern operating agreements already in effect at six plants 
at plants with moas management and labor share all decisions 
and design the jobs so they can be performed by a team of workers 
each team member learns all tasks involved in the teams assignment 
workers can increase their wages by learning additional jobs 
while the crosstraining cuts down absenteeism costs because fewer 
standby workers are needed teams also inspect their own work 
reducing the need for inspectors and for workers who repair the 
mistakes of others 
some workers and local union leaders steadfastly have resisted 
adopting moas most of the six local unions that adopted them were 
threatened with a plant closing and in some cases promised a new 
plant and more work 
some have resisted successfully in belvidere ill local union 
leaders refused to accept an moa despite chryslers threat to close 
the plant agreeing only to give more flexibility in use of 
workers chrysler in turn put its new dodge dynasty and chrysler 
fifth avenue frontwheeldrive luxury cars in the plant 
what chrysler wants to create is an atmosphere where the moas 
will be more readily accepted and you can do that at the national 
table shaiken said in an interview sunday 
but he said its going to be difficult in the wake of the 
attempted acustar sale and the kenosha closing chryslers key 
challenge will be trying to get the national contract out of the 
way so it can concentrate on the local agreements 
chryslers attempt to sell its acustar inc parts subsidiary 
sparked a bitter companywide union backlash that forced it to 
back down in early march and led to the decision to begin early 
contract talks 
workers relationship with the company also suffered from the 
automakers decision to close an assembly plant in kenosha wis 
by years end idling 5500 workers instead of keeping them working 
at least five more years as originally planned 
the two sides will be working without a strike deadline but hope 
to conclude in june
