the soviets have pulled back from a recent 
threat to stop destroying a missile covered by last years treaty 
covering mediumrange nuclear missiles the washington post 
reported in its thursday editions 
the missile is the ss23 one of the weapons that will be taken 
apart under the intermediaterange nuclear forces pact that went 
into effect last year 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze had told journalists 
in bonn recently that soviet destruction of the ss23s might be 
halted if nato deployed a similar type of missile 
the ss23 has a range of slightly more than 300 miles the 
minimum distance set by the inf treaty the united states and its 
western allies are considering deployment of a new lance missile 
with a range just under the limit set by the treaty 
the soviets have gone ahead and moved almost two dozen ss23s 
from a storage site to an elimination site the post reported 
quoting unnamed us and soviet sources 
all the ss23s must be destroyed by dec 31 but ample time 
remains to meet the deadline the officials said while the soviets 
havent yet destroyed any of the 239 ss23s deployed before the 
pact took effect they have destroyed training missiles and 
launchers the post said

navy investigators have found evidence to 
support the possibility that murder or suicide was involved in the 
explosion that killed 47 sailors aboard the battleship uss iowa 
nbc news reported wednesday 
nbc quoted unidentified navy sources as disclosing some 
disturbing facts about a surviving sailor who stands to collect 
100000 from the insurance policy of a gunners mate killed in the 
explosion april 19 
investigators found gunpower and blasting caps in a search of 
the belongings of gunners mate 3rd class kendall truitt 21 two 
years ago after he was arrested for stealing a car nbc said in a 
search of his home after the explosion investigators found one of 
the burlap patches that gunners insert between bags of powder to 
clean the barrels of the battleships huge guns during firing the 
network said 
truitt was quoted in published reports last week as saying the 
navy created homicide or suicide scenarios involving him and 
clayton m hartwig 25 to make them scapegoats for an explosion 
investigators cannot otherwise explain 
truitt has denied any blame for the explosion and has said that 
in response to investigators questions he denied a homosexual 
relationship with hartwig 
nbc said that because the navy has failed to find an accidental 
cause for the explosion it believes it may have been caused 
deliberately through placement of a detonating device in one of the 
burlap patches which normally would have been handled by hartwig 
however his sister kathleen kubicina said wednesday night 
that reports that hartwig helped load the fatal shell were 
inaccurate 
my brother wasnt on the duty roster that day mrs kubicina 
said in a telephone interview with the associated press in 
cleveland he was in the turret but he was not on duty that day 
she said she has talked to a naval investigative service 
investigator looking into the accident 
hartwigs family told nbc that he was depressed when his 
friendship with truitt broke down last year the family also said 
that at age 17 hartwig threatened suicide when another 
relationship ended nbc said 
nbc said other sources which it did not identify have learned 
that before the iowa went on maneuvers off puerto rico hartwig 
wrote several letters that could be construed as farewell messages 
mrs kubicina said her brother was not a homosexual 
he was a loner mrs kubicina said in an interview with the 
associated press he did a lot of reading 
he wanted to be in the navy she said my dad was a 
gunners mate on destroyer in world war ii 
mrs kubicina said earlier wednesday that she is contesting the 
fairness of truitt collecting 100000 from her brothers insurance 
policy 
a naval investigative service agent told mrs kubicina that 
hartwigs insurance policy which listed truitt as its beneficiary 
would not be paid until the navy completes its investigation of the 
explosion 
she said nis agents have visited her and her family four times 
since the explosion to question them about hartwig and his 
relationship with truitt 
earl hartwig said his son and truitt took out 50000 policies 
from the navy credit union just before their battleship left 
norfolk for the persian gulf in 1987 the policies carried double 
indemnities for accidental death making truitts payout 100000 
truitt had dropped hartwig however as the beneficiary on his 
policy said earl hartwig 
mrs kubicina said a close friendship between the two men waned 
because truitt was married last year and his wife did not care for 
hartwig she said hartwig intended to change his beneficiary too 
im sure he had all intentions of changing it im sure of 
it she said he had made comments to myself and my parents 
the hartwigs will receive a 50000 payout on a separate 
government life insurance policy 
atlantic fleet headquarters in norfolk va referred questions 
about the case to the navy office of information in washington lt 
bruce cole of the information office said the investigation of the 
blast was continuing and nothing is categorically rejected 
the atlantic fleet would not provide information on how to 
contact truitt who has denied any wrongdoing in connection with 
the explosion 
in my opinion they have no idea whats going on what caused 
it truitt told the newport news daily press and the timesherald 
in a story published sunday i think theyre trying to find an 
easy way out 
truitt said he is used to being a scapegoat and that he and 
hartwig often had been harrassed by fellow sailors because 
neither one of us drinks they razz you if youre not out there 
with them getting trashed 
mrs kubicina said she did not intend to raise the possibility 
that the explosion was caused deliberately 
i dont wany anyone to think including ken that i think he 
was a murderer she said by phone from her home i dont think 
so truthfully honestly i dont know the man

kazuo okuyama began his career with typical 
japanese movie fare gangster and cute animal movies 
now the ambitious young producer hopes to inspire jaded japanese 
with the tragedy of an idealistic rebellion in 1936 which tried to 
install a military government under the late emperor hirohito 
okayamas problem in making the film due for release june 17 
has been that the attempted coup by 22 fervent young rightwing 
military officers was quashed under orders of hirohito himself who 
was then revered as a living god 
the emperor isnt portrayed in the film but his order against 
the young rebels whom okuyama describes as martyrs is depicted as 
a misjudgment that ultimately led japan into world war ii the 
producer said 
reflections on the emperors judgment and the question of his 
responsibility for the war are acutely sensitive here although 
discussion of hirohitos historical role has become freer since his 
death jan 7 at age 87 
historians generally agree hirohito was a figurehead wielding 
little real power his most famous decision was japans world war 
ii surrender in 1945 when the government was deadlocked over the 
issue 
but hirohito also ordered the 1936 leaders of the coup back to 
their barracks after two days of assassinations and political 
turmoil in the 226 incident so called because it was launched 
on feb 26 
several coup leaders committed suicide and others were 
imprisoned on july 12 1936 two civilians and 13 of the rebel 
officers were executed by firing squad 
okuyamas movie 226 tells the story of the young officers 
who led about 1500 soldiers and nine civilians in a bloody attempt 
to overthrow the government and install a military regime under 
hirohito 
the rebels claimed they sought to restore integrity to a nation 
they believed was corrupted by a political elite living in luxury 
while millions suffered depressionera deprivation many of the 
rebels historians say were sons of poor farm families who had 
suffered hunger and seen their sisters sold into prostitution 
but in the repressive atmosphere after the failed coup an 
opposing faction in the military used the incident to build its own 
power eventually establishing a militaristic regime that led japan 
into world war ii 
there was an energy and an intensity alive then that has been 
forgotten in todays japan the 35yearold producer said 
one main reason i wanted to produce this film is because we 
live in a similar era when young women prostitute themselves and 
revelations of political corruption surface every day said 
okuyama the only difference is that then we were poor and now 
were rich 
the film is coming out amid outrage over a scandal in which 14 
prominent bureaucrats and businessmen have been arrested on 
suspicion of bribery and other illegalities and more than 150 
people embarrassed by disclosures that they accepted unlisted 
shares at discount prices from an employment information firm 
i wanted to sound an alarm to use the tragedy and drama of 
the 226 incident to tell people what they dont want to hear about 
political corruption and decay okuyama said 
influential people are gathering dirty money like the martyrs 
of 226 people should care 
the film depicts the deaths of the coup leaders as a tragic loss 
of courageous young men who died still true to their ideals 
even though the emperor doesnt understand that we were right 
history will answer for us says one coup leader before putting a 
bullet in his head 
okuyama said in an interview that he knew a decade ago that 
there was material to make a good movie but it just wasnt 
possible because of a lack of funds and sensitivities about the 
emperor 
the screenwriter didnt want to get involved he said but 
finally agreed on the condition we play down politics and aim the 
movie more toward young people 
corporate backers also feared a backlash from rightwing groups 
that vociferously protest anything they interpret as disrespectful 
toward the imperial family 
when we get to the last print just before distribution we 
plan to show the film to some of the major rightwing groups to try 
to gain their understanding okuyama said 
but he still expects some trouble actually im very worried 
just now very afraid but even if theres controversy i think i 
can explain what were trying to do 
the film ends on a note the rightists should appreciate a clash 
of gongs and tenno heika banzai or long live the emperor

the temple of the siwan oracle where 
the superstitious young conqueror alexander the great was told he 
was a god sits in ruin on its hillside perch 
shali a majestic 13thcentury fortress that protected siwans 
from medieval bedouin marauders is a sandcastle of rubble 
stripped of its glory by neglect and the oasis infrequent but 
devastating desert rains 
the village silversmith is gone along with most of the 
elaborate jewelry he crafted gigantic bangles that jingled from 
the oasis richly costumed women 
berber and sudanese heritage have blended into siwan life along 
with other tongues and cultures carried over saharan sands to form 
its roots and distinct language 
so much made siwa only 85 miles from libya unique in egypt 
and much of that is gone 
but much is left 
as it has for a thousand years life in siwa begins before dawn 
with the muezzim calling moslems to prayer from minarets of mosques 
scattered through the oasis date palms and olive groves 
then a donkey serenade begins hundreds bray echoing through 
the palms followed by a chorus of roosters 
earlymorning markets open to the cloppetyclop of donkeys 
pulling kerussahs family carts driven by caftanwearing men or 
boys wives and mothers covered headtotoe in flowing blue 
embroidered shawls called milayah sit behind with smaller children 
covered kerussahs provide the local taxi service sharing bumpy 
roadways with military trucks and with increasing frequency 
tourist buses from cairo 
camels never made it big in siwa donkeys are cheaper 
until the early 1980s virtually all sounds and sights in siwa 
would have been familiar to siwans centuries earlier but four 
years ago a highway became the oasis umbilical cord to egypt and 
the arabic language 
the threehour 190mile drive from mersa matrouh on the western 
egyptian coast covers generally the same desert route over which 
2000 years ago people from around the mediterranean alexander 
among them trekked for more than a week seeking the wisdom of the 
famed desert oracle 
more recently buyers for chic boutiques in cairo and europe 
have traveled it taking with them the best jewelry and handicrafts 
siwans have been put on parade for an evergrowing number of 
often scantily dressed visitors 
television invaded siwa in 1986 and more than 1000 sets were 
sold the first week like their fellow egyptians siwans go to bed 
chatting about the latest plot twists of falcon crest or knots 
landing 
young siwans now heading in increasing numbers for higher 
education in cairo and alexandria have far fewer traditions to 
remember but many more influences to contemplate 
but for siwas 10000 inhabitants the infusion and confusion 
hasnt been all bad 
a yearold us aid project gives them clean water for the first 
time extracted from salty subterranean pools the desalinated 
water costs 5 piasters just over 2 cents a jerrycan which even 
the poor can afford instead of 75 piasters 30 cents when water 
was trucked from outside 
electricity supplies remain uncertain and sporadic but 
czechoslavakian generators are being installed that promise a 
constant power supply 
one aid project is working to save siwas soul 
more than a year ago marc perron then canadas ambassador to 
egypt asked siwan officials what his country could do for their 
changing oasis help us save our heritage they said 
everybody talked for years about how to save siwa that its 
cultural heritage must be saved but nobody did anything about 
it said heba elkholy fund coordinator at the canadian embassy 
in cairo 
the canadian project aimed to build a traditional siwan house in 
the old way using mudbrick and palm trunks and to teach young 
women old skills 
now nearing completion the twostory house going up in the 
village garden will become a museum dedicated to siwan culture and 
a reservoir for handicrafts 
six miles away in a poor desert village khadiga ismail sami 
has spent the last year teaching five cheerful girls aged 11 to 
15 to embroider bridal scarves in the siwan way siwan girls who 
marry about age 14 must have an extensive bridal trousseau 
including seven elaborate wedding dresses 
mrs sami is among nine women team leaders each passing along 
her sewing or basketmaking artistry to five girls 
the canadian project has supplied each of mrs samis 
apprentices material for bridal scarves which can take several 
months to complete 
once finished she has the option of keeping them or selling 
them back to the project for 5 egyptian pounds about 2 each 
a bride has to have these scarves for her wedding mrs sami 
said if she has to buy them readymade she will have to pay 75 
pounds 30 for one scarf 
miss elkholy the canadian coordinator said she considers 
both efforts a first step in saving siwas unique traditions 
young girls today prefer watching television to making 
handicrafts she said but once we begin selling the products 
and the women can see the results i believe the traditions wont 
die

the odds of two unrelated women sharing 
the same birthdate and similar names are high enough 
but they are partners to another quirk they share social 
security numbers 
elizabeth carroll and betty gibson learned three weeks ago that 
the social security administration made a freakish mistake years 
ago and assigned them the same number 
ms carroll whose maiden name was elizabeth ann smith was the 
first to learn about the mixup when she was considering buying a 
house a mortgage companys printout of her credit history also 
contained ms gibsons who was born betty ann smith 
ms carroll took the question to the social security 
administration which told her it stemmed from a clerical error in 
the early 1970s 
ms carroll called ms gibson to explain 
i was dumbfounded said ms gibson i couldnt understand 
how two people could have the same social security number ive had 
this one since it was issued to me when i was a little girl 
social security officials declined to discuss the specifics of 
this case but did say such mistakes are rare 
frank battistelli a spokesman at the agencys baltimore 
headquarters said he had heard of only one similar case 
the other instance involved twins by no stretch of the 
imagination is this a commonplace occurrence he said 
darryl mull of the social security office in atlanta said the 
chances of two people receiving the same number are 
infinitesimal but it does happen some times 
but thats of no comfort to the ms carroll and ms gibson 
the thing that aggravates me is that i have to take time out 
of my work schedule to solve their problem their error ms 
carroll said i dont think thats fair its an error that 
should never have occurred 
what happened is still unclear and the stories the women tell 
differ with each other and the account provided by the social 
security administration 
what is clear is that both women were born with similar names 
and two years apart ms carroll on dec 12 1937 in louisville 
and ms gibson on dec 12 1939 in rural alabama 
ms gibson who moved to kentucky at age 15 said she applied 
for a number while seeking a job as a waitress at a greyhound bus 
station in elizabethtown in 1954 or 1955 ms carroll said she 
applied for a number about the same time in louisville 
the only time ms gibson said she applied for a new card was 
when she got married in 1957 she says she never applied for 
another new card in the early 1970s when social security officials 
claim the error occurred 
ms carroll said she applied for a new card each time she got 
married in 1962 and 1984 
ms carroll said social security officials told her that because 
she had the number first she could keep her number and that ms 
gibson would have to apply for a new one

the sun so elusive in a british spring has been 
positively beaming down on the london area for so many rainless 
days that people are in danger of forgetting where they put their 
umbrellas 
much of the country is sharing the sunshine bonanza so far it 
is the warmest may since 1964 
london was the countrys sweltriest spot tuesday the 84degree 
high made it the capitals hottest day in may since official 
recordtaking began in 1948 
temperatures of 82 degrees made the south coast towns of 
bournemouth and southampton hotter at the weekend than athens or 
tangier 
it hasnt rained in london since a light shower fell may 13 and 
the london weather center records 032 inches of rain so far 
against an average may rainfall of 202 inches 
raincoats hang at the back of the closet wellington boots are 
buried by accumulating debris in the car trunk and eager barbecuers 
have bought out the lawn furniture stocks in some stores and garden 
centers 
opportunities like this do not arise very often for a nation of 
picnickers a good drenching is part of everybodys outdoor dining 
experience and the ability to hold on to your plate your glass 
and your humor while sprinting for shelter is a basic of british 
sangfroid 
bookmaker william hill says it faces a 170000 payout if 
temperatures exceed the 966degree mark reached in 1976 and has 
shortened its odds from 33to1 to 16to1 
it would lose an additional 85000 if the centurys record high 
of 98 degrees set in 1911 is exceeded and has dropped odds 
against this happening to 501 a spokesman said 
of course there is still a week left for a deluge but nothing 
can take away the 224 hours of sunshine so far average may 
sunshine is 198 hours for the entire month the weather center said 
londoners are taking all this in their stride 
what is left of british reserve seems to have been shelved for 
the time being as people of all ages walk around the capital with 
large portions of their anatomy exposed to the sun 
barefoot barelegged and occasionally barechested they go to 
the parks and the zoo eating ice creams and pushing toddlers in 
strollers 
the people of the northern calder valley in west yorkshire have 
not had the same good fortune on friday a twohour rainstorm 
caused flash floods and two towns had to be evacuated 
a bolt of lightning struck 26yearold philip blake as he walked 
over a hill in north wales on tuesday but his life apparently was 
saved by a crucifix he wore around his neck he suffered damaged 
ear drums and burns 
the burning cross has left a perfect mark at the top of his 
chest said a spokeswoman for gwynedd hospital in bangor 
speaking anonymously 
the automobile association said near monsoon rainstorms 
tuesday made driving treacherous and caused dozens of road 
accidents across englands west midlands 
but for most of the nation television weather forecasters are 
running out of novel ways to express the good news and some have 
begun to point out that a cold front edging south from scotland 
might get to northern england by friday

critics called him a pharoah and said he would 
resurrect the machine politics of his late father but one month 
after his inauguration even some detractors praise mayor richard 
m daley for his political shrewdness 
since taking the oath of office on his 47th birthday april 24 
daley has ordered a televisionworthy cleanup of city hall which 
he likened to a pig pen and called for appointment of an 
ethics watchdog with subpoena power to root out corruption among 
all city employees even aldermen 
he also cut more than 40 million from planned city spending 
and broke with tradition by ordering parked cars some driven by 
city honchos towed from illegal spaces surrounding city hall even 
his press secretary found her car missing 
and saying he didnt want to be the only survivor of a nuclear 
attack he pledged to sell a new 50000 bulletproof mayoral 
limousine ordered before he took office 
visible reforms make good ink said don rose a political 
activist and longtime daley critic who worked for alderman timothy 
evans daleys independent challenger in the april 4 election 
those are public relations nice attentiongetting moves 
rose said calling some of the actions selfserving i think i 
have to say whatever the motives hes gotten off on the right 
foot 
but rose added we havent seen any of the real actions of 
government yet and im still very very wary of what his policies 
are going to be 
daley faces reelection in the spring of 1991 leading some 
detractors to call the mayors actions mere campaign tactics but 
marj halperin a spokeswoman for the mayor defends his moves 
i keep wondering when people will finally understand that this 
is real she said tuesday these arent things you do just for 
show these are things you do to manage the city responsibly and 
effectively 
daley son of the late boss of chicago richard j daley 
defeated evans who is black and democratturnedrepublican edward 
vrdolyak april 4 for the right to finish out the last two years of 
the second term of the late mayor harold washington who died in 
office in 1987 
washington was the citys first black mayor and the city 
council elected eugene sawyer a black south side alderman to be 
interim mayor following washingtons death daley defeated sawyer 
in the democratic primary in february 
evans who called daley a pharoah at the beginning of the 
campaign has criticized the mayors performance as lackluster 
daley made a campaign promise that he would always look to 
collecting revenue already owed to the city before he would raise 
taxes evans said yet the first thing he did was to raise 
water and sewer taxes 
the increase was drafted under sawyer but passed under daley 
we did reduce it from the previous administration halperin 
said 
tom roesser president of the city club of chicago and a 
political analyst close to the gop said daley is doing what most 
politicians do while facing the next election 
i see nothing nefarious or hollow or not serious at all he 
said im amazed frankly at how much reform he has brought 
david orr a white alderman who supported evans said he has 
been pleased with daleys reforms and a push for city efficiency 
theres still a part of me thats surprised at his political 
astuteness in the last few weeks orr said i think it sets a 
critical tone

the possibility of a wave of homeless 
headed for its celebritysoaked shores has malibu in a dither over 
the notion honorary mayor martin sheen may have invited a tent city 
encampment 
sheen declared the beach town where sylvester stallone and 
barbra streisand live a nuclearfree homeless sanctuary 
a nationally syndicated radio talk show host responded by 
calling for a march on malibu on saturday for which he says he 
has 15 buses available as far away as texas by tuesday at least 
one bus load of homeless people was organized in santa barbara 
and that was enough to have the beach community fretting 
if god had intended them to live in malibu hed have made 
them television producers mused los angeles times columnist al 
martinez 
the declaration sparking the turmoil read i hereby declare 
malibu a nuclear free zone a sanctuary for aliens and the homeless 
and a protected environment for all life wild and tame 
the attention sheen has attracted to the beach town of 19000 
has put pressure on the chamber of commerce which appointed him 
honorary mayor earlier this month to promote a shop malibu 
campaign 
the community is pretty upset said mary lou blackwood the 
chambers executive vice president who says she has handled 
hundreds of telephone calls 
malibu is a town with no coin laundry no car wash no mortuary 
and no car lot it has trendy restaurants and three supermarkets 
where its not unusual to see sam elliot amy irving whoopi 
goldberg george c scott or dick van dyke 
few heads turn when stallone roars by on his motorcycle malibu 
is a place where eddie van halen and sammy hagar can jam at the 
trancas nightclub without screaming throngs 
homes start at 500000 and go up to 20 million which is the 
price tag on miss streisands compound despite its 
celebrityenclave stereotype most residents are working stiffs 
with an average annual income of 60000 
sheen neighbor johnny carson joked on the tonight show that 
residents were offering to pay for valet parking for the homeless 
and provide free sunblock the honorary mayor responded to 
criticism by declaring malibu a freespeech zone 
carson said the following night mayor sheen just declared 
michael landons hair a national forest but many local 
malibuites arent amused 
the malibu inn and restaurants dump martin sheen marquee 
changed tuesday to johnny for mayor seemed to express 
prevailing opinion we should disassociate ourselves with him 
there is no community that welcomes the homeless said manager 
tony casson 
friends of sheen who has been heavily involved in antinuclear 
weapons protests and the farm workers grape boycott pledged to 
provide food and clothing if homeless people show up 
were not going to ask them to leave we feel those people 
have suffered enough and they are being used said neighbor maria 
olk supporter judith israel said homeless people arent meat 
new yorkbased conservative radio talk show host rush limbaugh 
who has been needling sheen and the hollywood left coast for 
years said his offer of oneway bus tickets to malibu was a fair 
comment on sheens declaration 
i like to illustrate absurdity with the absurd limbaugh 
said tuesday it is my intention to discredit sheen the march is 
purely to embarrass sheen and not malibu 
limbaugh who embraces programs making the homeless selfreliant 
rather than giving them handouts said he telephoned the chamber to 
ask where to take his homeless bus and a spokeswoman said 
theres no place for them here then hung up 
see theres no sanctuary we are going to show them they 
dont want you said limbaugh conceding his reservations about 
bringing homeless to malibu i dont want to be thought of as a 
cheap theatrical stunt guy 
sheen who has been in canada directing gary busey and son 
charlie sheen in the movie count a lonely cadence said in his 
latest missive from vancouver i regret that my concern for the 
poor and the environment was so dishonestly misinterpreted and 
misused to perpetrate a cruel hoax on 4 million americans who are 
already broken beyond any measure of understanding

president raul alfonsin said 
tuesday he wont leave office early because presidentelect carlos 
menem will not agree on policies to stabilize the economy during a 
transfer of power 
we will get to the 10th of december with the extraordinary 
effort of the argentine people alfonsin said in a 14minute 
speech broadcast nationwide 
his sixyear term expires dec 10 alfonsins radical civic 
union and menems peronist party had been holding talks on the 
possibility of an early transition because of the economic crisis 
after alfonsins speech his cabinet members submitted their 
resignations press secretary jose ignacio lopez said alfonsin will 
decide wednesday whether to accept them 
menem told the independent news agency diarios y noticias 
tuesday night that his party did not break off the transition 
negotiations that were initiated by alfonsin last weekend we 
simply were not in agreement with the economic proposals of the 
ruling party he said 
as i said before i want the president to depart with every 
honor without resigning as befits a man who has struggled for 
democracy 
about 3000 people gathered outside congress tuesday night for 
what they called a hunger march the demonstration was 
organized by the united left alliance to protest inflation and 
increased utility rates approved last week by the government 
there will be no pact or social peace arranged from above 
because now begins the struggle and mobilization of those from 
below patricio echegaray secretarygeneral of the communist 
party told the crowd 
alfonsin said his radical civic union will unveil its own 
economic program by sunday it will be as hard as you can 
imagine he said and suitable for an economy of war a 
government in crisis 
the mood in buenos aires was somber as teachers and other public 
employees planned strikes for higher wages stores in the capital 
marked up prices and some supermarkets rationed purchases 
menem 58 defeated presidential nominee eduardo angeloz of the 
radical civic union in national elections on may 14 the peronists 
won virtual control of both houses of congress 
instead of giving the economy a boost of confidence the 
election was followed by a plunge in value of the austral against

nearly twothirds of americans are too fat 
and more than a third are at least 10 percent over the recommended 
weights for their height body build and sex a nationwide health 
survey shows 
the study done for prevention magazine determined that 64 
percent of adults age 25 and over could stand to lose at least a 
few pounds 
but fewer than half of those people were trying to shed the 
extra pounds when polled in november the study by louis harris and 
associates says 
the percentage of overweight americans is the highest since the 
magazine began keeping track in 1983 and is up from 59 percent in 
1987 and 1986 62 percent in 1985 56 percent in 1984 and 58 
percent in the first year of the survey 
more than a third of americans are at least 10 percent over the 
weight recommended for their height body build and sex by the 
metropolitan life insurance tables used by many doctors the survey 
found 
only about onefifth weigh about what they should and they are 
more likely to be people in the east and west suburban 
residents people in their 30s and 40s college graduates the 
magazine said 
slightly more women than men are the proper weight 22 percent 
compared with 20 percent and gender aside only 29 percent of 
people making more than 50000 a year are appropriately trim the 
survey said 
weight control becomes more problematic when those who are 
overweight do not feel overweight the magazine said 
one in five surveyed fell into that category and only 48 
percent of those who needed to shed pounds were actively fighting 
the battle of the bulge according to the survey 
despite the weight problem the survey found some good news 
about americans health including more people who quit smoking and 
cut down on highcholesterol foods and more women who examined 
their breasts monthly for signs of cancer 
overall it found that people 65 and older are more likely to 
take preventive health measures than those under 35 
among the findings 
48 percent said they try to avoid highcholesterol foods up 6 
percentage points from 1987 however fewer people are trying to 
get enough vitamins and minerals to avoid eating too much salt and 
sugar and to eat fish twice a week the survey said 
36 percent said they exercise strenuously sustaining an 
accelerated heart and pulse rate for at least 20 minutes at least 
three days a week that proportion has remained stable over the 
past five years 
63 percent reported that they feel under great stress at least 
once a week up from 55 percent in 1983 stress is reported more 
frequently by those in the lowest and highest income brackets the 
survey found 
americans are continuing to kick the cigarette habit with the 
percentage of smokers declining to 26 percent down from 30 percent 
in 1983 
the rate of heavy drinkers 11 percent has changed little 
since 1983 but the proportion of adults who say they never consume 
alcohol rose 5 points over the period to 39 percent 
one out of 10 people under age 30 said they used drugs in 1988 
compared with two out of 10 in 1984 
the proportion of women who said they examine their breasts at 
least once a month for signs of cancer rose to 51 percent up from 
37 percent five years earlier 
the telephone survey of 1250 randomly selected adults was 
conducted last nov 923 results had a margin of error of plus or 
minus 3 percentage points

a university and two giant companies that are 
leaders in technology research have joined forces to try to beat 
japan in development of commercial uses for superconductors 
the announcement by the american telephone amp telegraph corp 
international business machines and the massachusetts institute of 
technology on tuesday said the consortiums goal is develop 
applications for the new technology 
superconductors are ceramic materials cooled to beyond minus 200 
degrees fahrenheit at which point they can let electricity pass 
through them without resistance 
in theory superconductors could let energy be stored and sent 
without any loss of strength and more cheaply than is now possible 
potential uses include faster computers and more powerful batteries 
and motors 
both the united states and japan are researching 
superconductors but the us has the edge 
the goal of the consortium is to make sure american firms 
rather than those from japan have the advantage in commercial 
application of the research 
this will be a consortium of open communication among the 
researchers involved the three organizations said in a joint 
statement the combining of their scientific knowledge and their 
knowledge of applications will benefit the nation 
the new organization will be called the consortium for 
superconducting electronics researchers will remain at their 
present locations but will share information 
in january the white house science council said such an 
organization was needed if the united states wanted to avoid what 
occurred in laser and videotape technology 
both were created in the united states but were commercially 
exploited by japan 
the consortium announced that research efforts will be 
concentrated in four areas including signal distribution 
hightemperature materials and technology advanced devices and 
integrated circuits and junctions 
the consortium will focus on applying superconductor technology 
to highspeed microelectronic devices for use in computers 
telecommunications and military systems the new york times 
reported today 
it is a model of how universities government labs and 
industry have to cooperate in the future to address a number of 
issues mit provost john deutch told the times 
ralph e gomory ibm senior vice president for science and 
technology told the times that the consortium would seek 4 
million to 6 million in financing from a defense department 
research agency most of which would go to mit 
robert c dynes director of chemical physics research at atampt 
bell laboratories told the times that consortium organizers 
thought having big organizations involved would give the group 
weight to attract other members 
i dont regard this as the big guys banding together and 
wiping out the little guys as much as giving the little guys an 
ability to get in the same building as us he said

the government says 53 million workers would 
be better protected from exposure to aids hepatitis and other 
viruses under new regulations requiring all blood and bodily fluids 
to be handled as if they were known to be infected 
the regulations proposed tuesday by the labor department were 
applauded by two unions that represent healthcare employees and 
other workers who would be affected although one of the unions 
suggested some minor changes 
we sincerely hope that the department lives up to its 
commitment to finalize the standard at the very latest by the end 
of the year said john j sweeney president of the service 
employees international union 
in addition to 47 million healthcare workers the government 
said the regulations would protect 600000 people working in law 
enforcement fire and rescue squads corrections facilities 
research laboratories blood banks and the funeral industry 
the regulations would require employers to study any procedures 
which could expose workers to blood or other potentially infectious 
materials identify workers who perform such tasks and take 
appropriate steps to reduce the risk of exposure including a 
written infection control plan and use of protective clothing 
the departments occupational safety and health administration 
estimated that the regulations would prevent about 10000 
infections and 200 deaths a year among healthcare workers they 
would replace general osha safety requirements for handling and 
disposal of potentially contaminated items with measures designed 
to deal specifically with aids hepatitis and other diseases 
carried by blood and bodily fluids 
preliminary osha estimates put the average annual cost of 
complying with the regulations at 1373 apiece for the 
approximately 600000 workplaces affected ranging from 32875 for 
a hospital to 141 for funeral service establishments 
a hospital industry group the american hospital association 
said its staff was reviewing the proposal and had no immediate 
comment 
if unchanged after a period of public comment the regulations 
would require 
that all blood and certain bodily fluids be handled as if they 
were infected with the aidsproducing human immunodeficiency virus 
or hiv the hepatitis b virus and other bloodborne viruses 
a number of controls for disposal of potentially infectious 
materials including leakproof punctureresistant and clearly 
labeled containers for the disposal of needles and other 
potentially infectious materials 
clear labeling and signs in areas where potentially infectious 
materials are handled or stored 
employers to offer free hepatitis b vaccines to workers who on 
average are exposed to potentially infectious fluids once or more a 
month that represents a shift from the reagan administration 
which during early consideration of the regulations opposed forcing 
employers to pay for the costly vaccine 
employers to provide and employees subjected to possible 
exposure to infectious materials to wear protective clothing 
one of labors complaints was language allowing that provision 
to be ignored if donning protective clothing would interfere with 
the proper delivery of health care of public safety situations 
jordan barab occupational safety and health director for the 
american federation of state county and municipal employees said 
labor supported allowing workers to decide to proceed without 
protective clothing in lifethreatening situations but barab said 
the language in the proposed regulations was too vague and did not 
specify whether such a decision should rest with an employee or 
employer 
labors second concern was that the regulations did not contain 
language often found in new osha regulations requiring employers 
to make engineering improvements to reduce potential hazards such 
improvements which often include development of new machines and 
techniques of handling potentially hazardous marterials are 
considered more foolproof than requiring protective clothing 
a draft of the regulations released in january required improved 
engineering controls where possible 
the proposal has been seriously weakened said afscme 
president gerald mcentee 
osha estimated workplace exposure results in 6000 to 7400 
hepatitis b infections each year in the united states causing up 
to 400 hospitalizations and between 130 and 165 deaths the agency 
said it did not have such estimates for hiv exposure but said 
fewer workers were exposed to the aidsproducing virus than were 
exposed to hepatitis

sirhan sirhan serving life in prison for 
assassinating sen robert f kennedy was denied parole for the 
10th time tuesday despite saying he felt very remorseful about 
the slaying 
the state board of prison terms made its decision after 
deliberating for nearly an hour saying sirhan was unsuitable for 
parole and calling kennedys 1968 murder one of the most shocking 
crimes in us history 
you still constitute a danger to society david brown 
chairman of the threemember panel told sirhan who will be 
eligible for parole again in a year 
in denying sirhans release the board cited his unstable social 
history and selective memory of the june 5 1968 slaying and 
events leading to it the board also told sirhan they wanted him to 
complete a more extensive psychiatric evaluation 
sirhan 45 showed no visible reaction to the decision but 
expressed his frustration at a news conference after the hearing 
oftentimes i feel like a dog at the dog races when the race 
is on hes always chasing the rabbit whatever i do is not 
enough said sirhan who called the panels reasons for denying 
parole specious at best 
during the fourhour hearing at the state correctional training 
facility in this small community about 180 miles south of san 
francisco sirhan told the prison board he was sorry for kennedys 
death 
the senator from new york was shot with a 22caliber pistol as 
he walked through the kitchen of the ambassador hotel in los 
angeles shortly after winning the california democratic 
presidential primary 
i feel very sad very sorry very remorseful that a human 
life was taken sirhan dressed in prisonissue blue denim shirt 
and jeans told the board after 21 years i have become 
quite convinced that my act was very wrong morally and humanly 
toward robert kennedy and especially toward his family and his 
loved ones and his suporters 
i realize the mistake of it and i wish from the bottom of my 
heart that this crime this horrible event never occurred 
i feel 21 years of this type of prison has been plenty of 
punishment he said i wish i could reverse it and undo it but 
i cant 
sirhan a jerusalemborn christian arab was sentenced to death 
for kennedys murder but was spared the san quentin gas chamber 
after californias death penalty law was overturned in 1972 by the 
state supreme court 
his sentence was changed to life in prison with possibility of 
parole and sirhan faced his first parole hearing in 1975 
he is imprisoned at the state correctional training facility 
sirhan last came before the board two years ago at the time 
the panel recommended he undergo extensive psychiatric evaluation 
pursue vocational training attend alcoholics anonymous sessions 
remain free of disciplinary problems earn an associates degree 
and provide documentation of job offers 
the american system of justice is going to let me go home in a 
coffin an angry sirhan said then 
on tuesday sirhan and his attorney luke mckissack asked that 
the hearing be postponed so sirhan could complete the psychiatric 
evaluation which began in march 
mckissack who engaged in frequent shouting matches with board 
members argued they should disqualify themselves as prejudiced 
against sirhan because they had taken part in a previous hearing 
the board however denied his requests to postpone the hearing 
and disqualify themselves 
sirhan who cried out i did it for my country seconds after 
the shooting told television interviewer david frost in february 
that he acted not out of personal malice towards the man but out 
of concern for other people 
he compared his act to a jew killing adolf hitler 
sirhan apparently was angered after kennedy a staunch supporter 
of israel repeated his proposal that 50 phantom jets be shipped to 
the jewish state 
during the interview sirhan repeatedly apologized for the 
killing

washington cathedral the great church for 
national purposes that pierre lenfant dreamed of as part of his 
plan for the nations capital is at last nearing completion 
signaling the beginning of the final phase of construction a 
flatbed truck pulled up in front of the 14th century gothicstyle 
structure tuesday with one last load of indiana limestone 
the first load was delivered in 1910 
the ceremonial placing of the final stone is scheduled for sept 
29 1990 83 years to the day from the laying of the cornerstone 
in 1907 
but most of the heavy work will have been completed by this 
fall said dick feller canon clerk of the works or head of 
construction for the cathedral 
this is a great day said the rt rev john t walker 
episcopal bishop of washington 
its been a labor of love said peter cleland master mason 
who has worked on the project since 1953 
lenfant the man commissioned by george washington to lay out 
the capital on the potomac included the church in his plans but 
no steps were taken to build it until a group of citizens took up 
the project in the 1890s 
work has continued with few interruptions since 1907 
construction was halted during world war i and world war ii and 
because of a shortage of funds in the 1970s 
but 83 years is by no means a long time for building such an 
edifice said the rev leonard freeman communications director at 
the cathedral 
this is about middle range for building a cathedral freeman 
said a shorty might take 50 or 60 years some of them go 150 
years or more without having been finished 
a modern building you put up a steel frame and put things 
around it but thats not the way this was built he said this 
was built physically in the same manner that they were built in the 
middle ages 
that is he said stone on stone 
anthony j segreti president of segreti tepper architects the 
washington firm overseeing the job said theres quite a 
difference working on this project and on a specification office 
building downtown this type of construction you dont see in this 
day and age 
the first section bethlehem chapel was completed in 1912 the 
central tower was finished in 1964 and the nave was ready for the 
nations bicentennial in 1976 
the cathedral was the setting for the funeral of president 
eisenhower in 1969 and a national memorial service for president 
truman in 1972 it is the final resting place of woodrow wilson 
martin luther king jr preached his last sunday sermon there three 
days before he was murdered 
each year about 350000 people visit the unfinished house of 
worship the sixth largest cathedral in the world it is a tenth of 
a mile long and 289 feet wide at its widest point 
the stones from bybee stone co of bloomington ind which has 
supplied the cathedral for about 10 years weigh from 150 to 450 
pounds there were other suppliers before bybee but all the 
limestone has come from indiana

but some new york city residents believe 23 days between pickups is 
a bit much 
mortgage payments parking ticket fines and a whole stack of 
mothers day cards on tuesday came tumbling from an overstuffed 
mailbox that apparently hadnt been emptied for more than three 
weeks said rep gary ackerman dny 
the congressmans staff looked into the problem after 
constituents complained they were receiving past due notices for 
things they knew they had paid 
ackerman said all but one of the post cards his staff members 
mailed from mailboxes in the queens neighborhood to his washington 
office arrived enabling them to pinpoint the forgotten mailbox 
four hundred pieces of mail were retrieved from the box 
including some stamped with the date by a postage meter 
there was a whole stack of mothers day cards he said i 
guess some mothers are wondering why they were forgotten 
the congressman said he asked the local postmaster to write a 
letter that people who might have incurred late payment penalties 
could send to their creditors 
they were also considering marking the mail as delayed 
although ackerman said they dont have a stamp that says 
oops we forgot your mailbox existed

surprise disclosures that ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini has undergone surgery come at a time of intense 
struggle within irans fragile leadership structure over who will 
succeed him 
the public admission that the 89yearold imam as he is known 
was even ill marked a major departure for iranians who for the 
last three years have only glimpsed the islamic republics supreme 
leader on television 
the reports by the state television and radio networks that 
khomeini was in exceptional condition for his age despite the 
surgery on tuesday to stop intestinal bleeding appeared aimed at 
reassuring iranians the revolutionary patriarch was still at the 
helm 
i would like to inform listeners and viewers that his eminence 
is perhaps one of historys exceptions in his physical 
structure and state of health the chief surgeon dr hassan 
arefi declared 
that may have comforted khomeinis followers but it was also a 
reminder of khomeinis mortality and emphasized that the question 
of who will rule iran in the postkhomeini era is wide open 
on march 28 khomeini dumped his designated successor ayatollah 
husseinali montazeri in one of irans biggest political upheavals 
since the 1979 islamic revolution ended 2400 years of monarchy 
political and religious leaders are grappling with changing the 
revolutionary constitution to eliminate what khomeini calls flaws 
and imperfections and settle the leadership question 
the recommendations of the 20man constitutional committee that 
khomeini appointed will go before voters in a referendum in 
midaugust the same time iranians vote for a new president 
since iran abruptly accepted a ceasefire in the 8year war with 
iraq last summer it has been gripped by political uncertainty 
antiwestern revolutionary radicals led by prime minister 
hussein musavi and interior minister ali akbar mohtashemi who 
favor tight control of the economy are locked in a power struggle 
with those seeking more free enterprise and links with the west 
in march montazeri was forced to resign after criticizing 
khomeinis policies and questioning what the revolution had 
achieved in its first decade 
montazeris resignation followed khomeinis sharp swing back to 
fundamentalist radicalism in february khomeini ordered moslems to 
seek out and kill british author salman rushdie for his novel 
the satanic verses charging it blasphemes islam 
the death call brought widespead western condemnation of iran 
smothering moves toward liberalization and efforts by parliament 
speaker hashemi rafsanjani and others to end irans selfimposed 
isolation 
the radical resurgence intensified a wave of executions of 
political dissidents and purges 
the power struggle is likely to intensify 
montazeris resignation raises the question of how far 
ayatollah khomeini is prepared to go in his current drive to root 
out revisionism commented charles snow an analyst with the 
middle east economic survey weekly 
it may be that the ayatollah is feeling his mortality and is 
trying like chairman mao in china to ensure the future of his 
revolution after his death by turning the radicals loose while he 
is still alive snow said 
the uncertainty is compounded by khomeinis tactic of constantly 
switching support for one faction or another so none becomes too 
powerful 
against this backdrop the deliberations of the constitutional 
committee will have a farreaching impact on irans future 
rafsanjani the only declared presidential candidate so far 
wants to widen the powers of the office and scrap the premiership 
to eliminate the competing power centers that have paralyzed 
decisions on the economy and social reform 
the hardliners favor a presidency which is largely ceremonial 
with power centralized in the prime minister 
the debate is heating up although the tehran times daily noted 
monday that rafsanjanis campaign seems to be getting the nod 
from the majority of the committee 
all indications are that in the absence of any leader with 
khomeinis spiritual authority as viceregent of the prophet 
mohammed there will be a tilt toward installing a collective 
leadership after he dies 
rafsanjani as well as khomeinis son ahmad whose political 
ambitions are starting to show will likely be on that leadership 
council 
if despite the radicals strength rafsanjani can change the 
constitution his way and win the presidency he would be expected 
to make profound changes in irans power structure 
current president ali khamenei whose second fouryear term 
expires in september has asserted that concentrating power in the 
presidency will not lead to a dictatorship and noted you cant 
run a country if there is too much dispersion of power

nuclear power plants arent designed for 
lowpower operation and could be strained by running at lower 
levels a panel of scientists warns 
the nuclear regulatory commission said tuesday its staff will 
review concerns by nrcs advisory committee on reactor safeguards 
about lowpower operation the panel counsels the nrc on potential 
industry hazards 
as a safety precaution nuclear power plants normally operate at 
low power or 5 percent of generating capacity before they are 
permitted to increase operation and begin generating electricity 
in a may 11 letter to nrc chairman lando zech the panel said it 
has no evidence that extended lowpower operation is unsafe 
but it said it knows of instances in which operation at low 
flow has produced excessive wear in check valves and in which 
operation at low power has produced excessive vibration in a 
feedwater pump not designed for extended operation at low flow 
our principal concern stems from the memory that the operators 
of the chernobyl plant unit 4 were unaware of the dangers of 
operation at low power whereas a careful analysis would have 
convinced them that this was undesirable the panel said 
the soviet union plant at chernobyl was operating at low power 
when an april 1986 accident killed at least 31 people and released 
a radioactive cloud that spread over a wide area 
eleven american nuclear power plants now have construction 
permits among the closest to receiving lowpower licenses are 
limerick in pennsylvania comanche peak in texas watts bar in 
tennessee and seabrook in new hampshire 
lowpower testing can take several months but its not a 
standard time period its a casebycase thing said nrc 
spokesman john kopeck 
a utility official recently said he was uneasy about 
operating at 5 percent power although he did not believe there 
was anything unsafe about it the committee said in its report 
the panel did not disclose the name of the official or of plants 
where problems occurred 
robert pollard a nuclear safety engineer for the union of 
concerned scientists said in an interview tuesday that he was 
familiar with the lowpower problem the ucs is a private 
nonprofit group which has been critical of some nuclear power 
plants 
ive certainly heard of some of the types of problems the 
letter mentions particularly when you take the large centrifugal 
pumps cooled by water flowing through them pollard said 
when there is a slower flow through the system the pumps and 
some other parts dont get cooled as well he said 
but pollard said he was miffed at the reference to chernobyl 
because the reactor was unstable at low power to the point that i 
dont know of a similar parallel in the united states

federal investigators blame aloha airlines for 
an accident that ripped open an airliner fuselage 24000 feet over 
hawaii but they say lax inspection of aging 737s was an 
industrywide deficiency 
the national transportation safety board ending a 13month 
investigation tuesday blamed the accident on failure of 
islandhopping alohas maintenance program to detect broken bonds 
and fatigue damage in the boeing 737s outer skin 
the board voted 41 to lay primary blame on the airline and said 
federal aviation administration failures contributed to the april 
28 1988 accident that hurled the planes chief flight attendant 
out of the airliner to her death with one engine out and its 
passenger section exposed to the sky the plane landed on the 
island of maui with 89 passengers and five other crew members 
the independent safety board said the faa failed to issue 
sufficient orders to correct problems with the aging 737 fleet and 
didnt adequately monitor alohas maintenance program before the 
incident 
alohas president a maurice myers took exception to the 
boards conclusion saying multiple cracking found around rivets in 
the fuselage skin was undetectable prior to the accident he said 
the airline had followed all boeing and faa safety orders 
myers said the accident was alohas first in four decades and 
the airline has voluntarily scrapped three old 737s and decreased 
the average age of its fleet from 15 years to 10 the average age 
of us airliners approaches 13 years 
the board said alohas maintenance program failed to detect 
disbonding and fatigue in fuselage skin joints including numerous 
cracks around rivets that hold fuselage pieces together 
the 19yearold airliner had been flying between 12 and 18 
flights a day in hawaiis warm humid climate investigators said 
but the board noted that similar fatigue problems were found as 
early as 1974 in other 737s resulting in service orders from 
boeing and faa directives 
the board indicated that many airlines were not making required 
inspections 
reports of fleetwide cracks received by the faa after the 
aloha airlines accident indicate that a similar lack of critical 
attention to lap joint inspection and fatigue cracks detection was 
an industrywide deficiency it said 
the faa cited the aloha accident last week when it issued broad 
orders for mandatory replacements on aging boeing 727s 737s and 
747s previously the faa generally required replacements only if 
regular inspections detected excessive wear 
safety board member jim burnett called for an examination into 
new faa orders that are based on proposals from an aviation 
industry task force 
i have sensed generally that the faa is moving in a competent 
manner in tying to deal with the aging aircraft problem burnett 
said but im always suspicious of faa orders that are drafted 
by the industry and we need to take a good careful look at them 
board member joseph nall dissented from the boards vote on a 
probable cause for the accident he proposed wording that would 
not have laid primary blame on the airline saying the fact that 
cracks went undetected was a system problem involving the 
industry the government and the carrier 
the board rejected a conclusion proposed by its staff that would 
have sharply criticized the cockpit crew of aloha flight 243 for 
procedures used in landing the heavily damaged plane staff 
investigators said the speed of the landing threatened to split 
apart the plane 
board members said they would include cautions about such 
landing conditions in the full report to be released in several 
weeks but wanted to include balancing comment about the heroics of 
the pilots and flight attendants 
the ntsb has no authority to impose penalties and can only make 
recommendations to government agencies transportation companies 
and others

when a farmer cuts down his wood lot and uses 
the money for a trip to florida he knows hes used up an asset 
when indonesia cuts down its tropical timber and consumes the 
proceeds that counts as national income 
our current measures of economic success are misleading 
robert repetto director of research for the world resources 
institute said tuesday 
a country could exhaust its mineral resources cut down its 
forests erode its soils pollute its aquifers and hunt its 
wildlife and fisheries to extinction but measured income would not 
be affected said repetto 
no business would last very long selling off its assets to 
meet the current payroll he pointed out but many countries 
are doing just that behind a screen of misleading statistics 
the institute is a private study group funded by foundations 
the united nations government agencies corporations and 
individuals 
repetto and four coauthors have written wasting assets 
natural resources in the national income accounts which 
concentrates on indonesia repetto is now working on figures for 
costa rica and china 
officially indonesias production grew by 7 percent a year 
between 1970 and 1984 repetto says that when loss of forests soil 
and oil is taken into account that figure falls to 4 percent 
according to the world bank indonesias population is growing at a 
rate of more than 2 percent a year so the average citizen would 
see little improvement in living standards 
conditions have grown worse since 1984 with the drop in the 
price of oil indonesias major export the bank calculates that in 
1987 the average indonesian earned 450 down from 500 the year 
before 
repetto wants to make it clear that he is not just quarrelling 
with other statisticians the failure to take account of 
disappearing resources also distorts calculations about the growth 
of assets on which governments lay their plans for the future he 
said 
its a kind of deficit financing too important to be left to 
statisticians he added in an interview this is like the 
lawyer in the depression who told his wife at dinner that hed had 
a pretty good day no clients but he managed to sell his desk 
repetto said he had presented his work to the united nations 
which is revising its method of calculating a countrys growth the 
un method is the standard method in use he reported that un 
officials were sympathetic but do not have the money to make as 
complete a revision as hes seeking 
repetto suggested that the cost would not be high pointing out 
that he did the present study in six months with the help of four 
graduate students the calculations need not be made for all 
countries only those where natural resources are a major part of 
total resources he said 
that would have been true of the united states in 1850 he 
explained now our big resource is a skilled and educated 
population we maintain our forest and soil so taking depletion of 
natural resources into account would not change our figures that 
much or the figures of other highly developed countries

the picturesque southern maine resort town of 
kennebunkport reverberated with eerie squeals squawks and beeps 
last weekend 
it wasnt the sound of waterfowl or other wildlife it was part 
of a paging system used by the white house to alert reporters on 
the bush watch of impending presidential activities 
an army of nearly 500 reporters both american and french 
overtook bushs vacation home for his meeting with french president 
francois mitterrand 
now that the weather has turned warmer bush is expected to 
return quite frequently to his family house on a point jutting into 
the atlantic ocean 
during his most recent visit the us press corps set up work 
quarters at a lithuanian franciscan monastery in town and rented 
electronic pagers from the white house 
with a single phone call white house official bruce zanca could 
activate all the voicealert pagers at once to let news people who 
had strayed from the monastery know an event was about to take 
place 
then they would all converge at the monastery at once and that 
always meant a chaotic arrival scene since few journalists hung 
around the monastery when nothing was going on 
every time bush would leave his compound to jog to play golf 
to go to a restaurant there would be an announcement over the 
paging system 
since reporters almost outnumbered locals in town each time the 
pagers went off simultaneously there was an enormous cacophony 
throughout town entire restaurants would erupt in the strange 
noise tourists would pause on the sidewalk and gawk hotel lobbies 
would buzz with the crackling announcements 
one time the pagers even went off dozens of them at once in 
the middle of a press briefing at the monastery by press secretary 
marlin fitzwater who first looked perplexed then bemused

bush compound where a parking lot used to be and there is a police 
checkpoint on the road overlooking bushs house 
traffic is directed to stop at a partial barricade so an officer 
can tell motorists to go ahead the road is only closed at night 
and when bush is leaving the compound 
bush was born in massachusetts grew up in connecticut and 
usually claims texas as his home state

bush has been heeding his selfimposed rule against answering 
reporters questions at picturetaking sessions but with some 
flexibility 
bush meeting with the president of iceland vigdis 
finnbogadottir in the oval office earlier this week ignored 
reporters first two questions a radio reporter tried a final 
shot any word from chancellor kohl yet 
at the time there was considerable interest in whether the west 
german leader had contacted bush to discuss the latest in a round 
of proposed compromises to ease a uswest german split on the 
future role of shortrange nuclear weapons in western europe 
bush never taking his eyes off the icelandic president said 
this is a photo opportunity therefore i dont tell them yes 
ive heard from chancellor kohl because otherwise it would ruin 
the discipline

the bush administration will try to jump start 
last years failed campaign by the reagan administration to expand 
commercial bank powers a senior treasury official says 
robert r glauber treasury undersecretary for finance told a 
financial services lobby group tuesday that the bush 
administration like the reagan administration before it believes 
banks can compete against their foreign competitors only by 
offering currently forbidden services such as securities 
underwriting 
glaubers speech to the financial services council was the first 
substantive statement on the subject by a senior bush 
administration official and in later remarks to reporters glauber 
said he hoped the restructuring could be addressed next year once 
bushs plan to rescue the savings and loan industry is passed 
glauber the top administration policymaker for banking and 
financial issues noted that banks in france west germany and 
great britain are permitted to underwrite buy and sell securities 
offer insurance develop real estate and invest in industrial 
companies 
partly as a result of that foreign banks have outgrown us 
institutions he said noting that in 1970 seven us banks ranked 
among the worlds largest that share slipped to three in 1980 and 
none currently he said 
permitting a broad array of financial services and 
products can only help us firms stem the loss of customers to 
less regulated foreign firms he said 
however us banks have been barred from securities 
underwriting since 1933 when congress passed the glasssteagall 
act separating commercial and investment banking 
opponents of repealing glasssteagall argue that investment 
banking is too risky for institutions with federally insured 
deposits but glauber said securities underwriting is no more 
risky and probably less risky than commercial lending 
he did not specify exactly how the administration would extend 
new powers to banks but he spoke favorably of a bill passed by the 
senate last year similar legislation foundered in the house 
caught in a jurisdictional dispute between two committee chairmen 
the senate bill versions of which have been reintroduced this 
year in both chambers of congress permitted bank holding 
companies through subsidiaries and with certain safeguards to 
underwrite corporate bonds and most other securities except 
corporate stock 
in remarks to reporters following his speech glauber said he 
believed congress would pause this year after passing bushs 
savings and loan plan and then tackle proposals for restructuring 
of the financial system next year 
the legislations prospects could be hurt because some members 
of congress are blaming illadvised deregulation for the sampl 
industrys problems 
but glauber said it is clear that the model of the 
thrift industry in the early 1980s with its lack of private 
upfront capital and illsupervised reform is not the model to be 
followed as we move forward

rain has helped take the edge off persistent 
drought conditions in the central and southern great plains and has 
slowed field work in the eastern corn belt and the delta region 
say government crop watchers 
but despite the rain the outlook for winter wheat in much of 
the plains continues to be poor harvest is under way in several 
states including texas and oklahoma 
on capitol hill lawmakers are putting together a 1989 version 
of last years huge 39 billion drought aid package although no 
firm cost estimate has been tied to the current package it would 
contain many of the financial aid features of last years measure 
the latest report by the joint agricultural weather facility 
said corn planting nationally was 84 percent complete by the end of 
the may 1521 survey week lagging the normal pace by only two 
percentage points however in the wetter areas of the eastern corn 
belt planting of the new crop lagged far behind 
planting was complete in texas and nearly complete in georgia 
illinois iowa kansas missouri and nebraska the report said 
but in ohio where 85 percent of the corn acreage is usually 
planted by now only 24 percent was seeded the report said in 
pennsylvania 19 percent of the corn was planted by may 21 
compared with 62 percent in normal years 
the weather facility operated by the agriculture and commerce 
departments said the 1989 soybean crop was about 39 percent 
planted only two percentage points behind normal however 
plantings lagged sharply in some areas including ohio where only 
6 percent of the estimated soybean acreage had been planted 
compared with a normal 56 percent 
cotton plantings at 60 percent were nine points behind the 
usual rate although planting was complete in california it lagged 
in the delta and southeast 
a related report by the usdas 1989 drought task force headed by 
undersecretary richard crowder said that timely rains in the corn 
belt are promoting rapid germination and establishment of this 
years crop 
but the report added that the impact of recent rain in winter 
wheat areas will depend in part on future weather 
if another weather front brings more rain as predicted 
moderate improvement in crop conditions could occur the task 
force said 
the national weather service calls for moderate to heavy rain 
in the great plains and corn belt in the next 5 to 10 days it 
added the outlook through midjune still calls for cool wet 
weather in the south and east and warm dry weather from the 
eastern dakotas into the central corn belt 
a new 30 and 90day weather outlook is scheduled to be issued 
by the weather service next week 
meanwhile leaders of the house agriculture committee agreed 
tuesday to push through a broad package of assistance this week for 
farmers suffering crop losses from continuing drought 
the committee under the agreement worked out by democrats and 
republicans will act on the legislation at a session thursday the 
relief package will be brought before the house at an undetermined 
date after lawmakers return from a memorial day recess 
i think the chances that a bill will be passed and signed into 
law by the president have dramatically improved rep pat 
roberts rkan said after the meeting of committee leaders 
including the panels chairman rep kika de la garza dtexas 
the aid package will mirror relief programs enacted by congress 
last year to aid producers in the midwest and northern great plains 
in general federal payments would be made to farmers who suffer 
losses of more than 35 percent on their crops 
the relief would be available for all crops not just specific 
hardhit ones like wheat because of damages from drought 
freezing temperatures hail excessive moisture and other problems 
according to scott swenson a spokesman for rep dan glickman 
dkan chairman of the agriculture subcomittee on wheat soybeans 
and feed grains 
lawmakers are considering the new drought package because the 
agriculture department has said the 1989 winter wheat crop doesnt 
qualify for any of the 39 billion in assistance approved in 1988 
a group of senators last week introduced drought relief 
legislation to extend last years assistance programs to the winter 
wheat crop similar proposals had been offered in the house 
but roberts said house committee leaders decided to go with a 
generic bill as a way of broadening support as well as ensuring 
that adequate aid is available to springplanted crops if the 
drought worsens or spreads to other regions 
according to usdas current estimate the 1989 winter wheat 
harvest may hit an 11year low of 143 billion bushels including a 
drop of more than onethird in kansas traditionally the nations 
leading producer 
under last years relief program farmers received federal 
payments covering 65 percent of income lost from the crop damages 
exceeding 35 percent and 90 percent of income lost from damages to 
that portion of the crop exceeding 75 percent losses 
swenson said a similar formula is planned in the house bill 
although that could be changed later 
roberts said recent crop estimates by usda made it clear that 
the costs of any drought relief program shouldnt pose a budget 
problem the federal wheat subsidy program is expected to cost much 
less this year because of higher market prices stemming from the 
drought

a human guinea pig says she made friends 
with mice and learned some english during her 130 days in an 
underground cave to help researchers study the effects of isolation 
stefania follini of ancona italy smiled and waved at reporters 
and wellwishers as she emerged tuesday afternoon from lost cave 
ending an experiment that began on jan 13 
would she do it again 
sure said the 27yearold interior decorator who 
volunteered for the experiment 
miss follini who lost 17 pounds during her solitude and now 
weighs 90 pounds appeared healthy and happy as she answered 
questions from reporters 
although she had no contact with humans except through 
computers miss follini said she didnt feel lonely during the 
experiment and adopted two cave mice as pets she named them 
giuseppe and nicoleta 
there was some difficulty in communicating with the mice 
she said through an interpreter but i was always right 
the experiment was designed to resemble interplanetary travel 
the university of ancona in italy the national aeronautics and 
space administration and several us universities took part in the 
experiment 
miss follinis only contact with the outside world was through 
computer terminals linked between her 10footsquare 
plasticenclosed underground habitat and the researchers house 
trailer above the cave 
she had no clocks her menstrual cycle stopped and she lost 
track of how many days had passed when she was told monday the 
experiment was almost over she thought she had been in the cave 
about 80 days she tended to sleep about 10 hours and stay awake 20 
to 25 hours 
three video cameras and microphones monitored miss follini 
constantly only the bathroom was out of sight of cameras she said 
she didnt mind the lack of privacy 
i rarely thought about it she said sometimes i felt it 
was a strong presence but generally i was not bothered by that 
when miss follini climbed out of the cave into the midday sun 
she appeared disoriented for a few seconds but she quickly donned 
sunglasses handed to her then grinned and waved at the 60 
onlookers 
at the news conference she said she thinks her isolation will 
make her more thoughtful outgoing and decisive and she said her 
outlook has improved 
i consider myself more important she said i love myself 
more and consequently i can love people and the world more 
scientists plan to examine her intensively during the next few 
months to find out if her isolation affected her mentally and 
physically 
for example project coordinator maurizio montalbini who spent 
210 days in a cave two years ago believes the isolation will help 
miss follinis concentration a nasaaffiliated research team at 
the university of texas medical school in houston plans to test 
that monday by monitoring miss follinis brain waves while she 
solves computergenerated problems 
other scientists will be drawing blood and checking her immune 
system bones muscles and coordination some believe her immune 
system was suppressed her bones lost calcium and her muscles 
weakened 
but montalbini said he thinks miss follini might surprise 
researchers he said she kept her strength and flexibility by doing 
calisthenics and judo and maintained her poise by keeping busy by 
reading and decorating her living area 
the researchers chose lost cave because it maintains a constant 
climate of 74 degrees and 99 percent humidity and is relatively 
close to houston home to nasa and many researchers 
before the experiment began miss follini said she was taking 
english textbooks with her and would answer questions in english 
she did understand simple questions and was able to answer in short 
english phrases but she didnt master the language in 130 days 
when she was down there she had english and spanish books to 
learn said translator rita fraschini but the english one was 
difficult and boring so she switched to the spanish one which was 
funny

the companies that make motor vehicle 
antipollution equipment predict they can meet the tough emissions 
standards proposed in a clean air bill favored by environmentalists 
but denounced as too extreme by the auto industry 
strongly disagreeing with auto industry witnesses the 
manufacturers of emission controls association told a house panel 
tuesday that its companies could produce pollution control 
equipment that would meet the proposed standards for 100000 miles 
of driving each vehicle 
bruce bertlesen executive director of the group said the 
association based its assessment on continuing progress in 
developing better antipollution equipment more advanced engine 
controls and continued reduction of lead contamination in unleaded 
fuel 
the most serious challenge to meeting these more stringent 
emission standards is maintaining emission control performance 
during the useful life of the vehicle under real world 
conditions the association said we believe the engineering 
challenges can be resolved 
at a hearing of the house energy and commerce health 
subcommittee the association strongly endorsed emission testing 
programs to ensure that owners keep their vehicles properly tuned 
bertlesen testified at the first hearing on legislation by rep 
henry a waxman dcalif subcommittee chairman to reduce air 
pollution at a time that virtually every us city has failed to 
meet federal air quality standards while reducing pollution from 
motor vehicles is a major part of the bill it also attempts to cut 
emissions from industrial sources and consumer products 
but the debate over auto truck and bus emissions standards is 
likely to determine whether congress as happened last year lets 
a clean air bill die in a legislative stalemate 
the motor vehicle manufacturers association of the united 
states representing the big three us automakers told 
waxmans panel the best way to reduce pollution from motor vehicles 
is by waiting for the normal phaseout of older cars still on the 
road 
thomas h hanna president and chief executive officer of the 
association said less than half the vehicles now in use were built 
under the latest emissions standards he blamed the older vehicles 
for nearly 90 percent of the hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide 
emissions and more than 7 percent of the nitrogen oxides major 
pollutants from motor vehicles 
he predicted that a further tightening of emission requirements 
would have a minimal air quality benefit compared to vehicle 
fleet turnover 
gregory dana vice president of the automobile importers of 
america inc representing major manufacturers of foreign cars 
called waxmans bill extreme and unreasonable and said the 
legislation presents a challenge that is simply unattainable 
waxmans bill would toughen tailpipe emission standards for 
hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides set new requirements to reduce 
hydrocarbon pollution from the evaporation of gasoline at the pump 
and on the road and require that emission controls last the full 
useful life of an automobile 
the tailpipe standards would kick in for passenger cars 
beginning in the 1992 model year and become even tougher in the 
2000 model year 
an alternative bill sponsored by nine house members as a 
compromise between the auto industry and the environmentalists 
would toughen current standards but not nearly as much as the 
waxman bill the nine lawmakers would use the best available 
technology in requiring new emissions requirements starting in 
1993 while the waxman measure aims to force automakers to develop 
new antipollution technology 
backing waxmans position were environmental groups including 
the sierra club and the natural resources defense council and 
public officials representing state and county governments 
including vermont gov madeleine m kunin representing the national 
governors association 
mobile sources account for half or more of the air 
pollutants that threaten public health in our cities and we simply 
must demand more of the motor vehicle manufacturers she said 
we need automobiles that drive us where we want to go without 
driving us to environmental destruction she said

more than 300 federal prisoners at a 
privately operated detention center refused to return to their 
cells to protest living conditions and food quality authorities 
said 
law enforcement officers from 12 federal state and local 
agencies were dispatched to the eden detention center in central 
texas to quell the disturbance officials said 
the inmates were upset with prison conditions and food and 
refused to return to their dormitories concho county sheriff bill 
fiveash said he said a few mattresses were burned but the protest 
was generally nonviolent 
the disturbance was reported shortly after 5 pm and appeared 
to involve most of the 330 inmates by 1130 pm fewer than 100 
inmates remained in the yard 
we will not take any steps we will let them sit in the yard 
and wait jim eyskens a federal bureau of prisons officer based 
in san antonio said of those inmates im certain this will be 
resolved without force 
roy burnes the owner of the detention center denied that 
inmates burned mattresses nothing was burned burnes told the 
associated press he then said he didnt have time to talk and hung 
up 
some civilian employees who had locked themselves inside were 
escorted out 
a prison official who refused to identify herself said no one 
was in immediate danger 
a fire in december caused more than 1 million in damage to the 
prison the detention center closed for 35 days afterward until a 
new 60000squarefoot addition could be built 
before the fire the prison held 200 prisoners the addition was 
designed to hold 365 inmates but the number of inmates was not 
immediately known 
most of the prisoners the government has contracted with the 
facility to hold are illegal aliens who are serving sentences of 18 
months or fewer for federal crimes said greg bogdan a spokesman 
for the federal bureau of prisons in washington 
the 203 prisoners at the detention center at the time of the 
fire had to be transferred to other centers in texas the section 
destroyed by fire is being renovated and when it is completed the 
prison will hold 500 
in july 1987 prisoners at the facility signed a letter 
complaining of violations of civil rights bureau of prison 
standards and sanitation prisoners said in the letter that they 
were offered real meat only once a week they later complained of a 
lack of recreation facilities 
a federal prison inspector recommended improvements in prison 
employee training 
burnes later in 1987 said he planned to change the prison 
population makeup from illegal aliens to whitecollar shortterm 
federal prisoners

efforts to halt the rising number of 
adolescent pregnancies in southern states should be aimed at boys 
as well as young girls said a plan released today 
every three minutes a girl aged 1017 gives birth in the 
united states said the study that stark fact spells tragedy 
for mother father and child and it costs our communities 
enormously in both human and economic terms 
southern communities are most affected because as a region 
we have the highest rates of adolescent pregnancy and 
childbearing it said prevention is our best hope of ending 
this epidemic and helping our children grow up before they have 
children of their own 
the plan was compiled by the southern regional project on infant 
mortality in cooperation with the southern governors association 
and the southern legislative conference 
the 17 southern states in the study had a higher rate of 
adolescent pregnancy than the rest of the country the report 
noted in 1985 47 percent of the nations 178000 births to girls 
under age 17 occurred in 17 southern states even though only 37 
percent of girls under 17 live in the south among girls under 17 
with second or higher order births that year 49 percent were in 
the south 
in the southern states the public costs of teenage 
childbearing in the form of food welfare and medical assistance 
totaled 358 billion in fiscal 1987 the report said 
when our children have children we all lose said 
mississippi gov ray mabus cochairman of the group that produced 
the report adolescent parents and their babies face hardships 
they are not prepared for risks of poor health incomplete 
educations poverty and welfare dependency 
the rest of us lose them their talents abilities and 
leadership and we pay a lot more to treat the problem than we 
would to prevent it he said 
males should be included in all pregnancy prevention programs 
because focusing solely on females ignores half the problem 
the report said 
it recommended promotion of education and life skills at the 
earliest possible age through state and federal spending on early 
childhood education programs and the expansion of head start 
it also called for encouraging children to complete high school 
including taking family life courses designed by parents and 
local school boards 
in addition the report called for better job prospects and more 
community involvement for adolescents improved health care for 
young people and help for parents 
as the primary shapers of their children parents mold the 
value system of their children and this value system frames the way 
in which these children view early sexual involvement and early 
parenthood the report said 
the 17 states are mississippi louisiana arkansas georgia 
alabama south carolina florida texas delaware tennessee 
maryland north carolina virginia kentucky oklahoma missouri 
and west virginia

the energy department misled congress last 
year about key aspects of its plan for building new military 
reactors in south carolina and idaho the general accounting office 
said in a report prepared for publication today 
the gao the investigative arm of congress was scheduled to 
detail its charges at a hearing of the house armed services nuclear 
facilities subcommittee which is examining the bush 
administrations plans for modernizing the nuclear weapons complex 
the administration is pushing for financing to start development 
of one new reactor at the savannah river site near aiken sc 
and another at the idaho national engineering laboratory near 
idaho falls 
the reactors estimated to cost a total of about 75 billion 
would produce tritium a radioactive gas needed in the production 
of nuclear warheads 
the governments only existing tritiumproducing reactors also 
situated at savannah river have been shut down since last spring 
for safety reasons they are scheduled to resume operation next 
year but their reliability is in doubt 
the gao in a condensed preliminary draft of its study on the 
reactor plan said congress was misinformed by the energy 
department on how long it would take to get the new idaho and 
savannah river reactors running according to a congressional 
source who saw the draft the source asked not to be identified 
the draft report said the department needs to reconsider its 
decision announced last summer to put the new reactors in idaho 
and south carolina it also said the projects cost accounting was 
not clear 
one alternative to these sites is the hanford nuclear 
reservation near richland wash where the washington public power 
supply systems no 1 plant could be converted to tritium 
production the gao estimated this would cost about twothirds as 
much as building new reactors from scratch elsewhere and 
production could be started much earlier 
the energy department has said a hightemperature gascooled 
reactor at idaho could be put into operation in about 10 years but 
the gao said it would take 13 years the source said the 
technology for this type of reactor is not yet fully developed 
the new savannah river facility would be a heavy water reactor 
a technology already in use the gao said it would take about 12 
years to get this plant running while the department has estimated 
10 years 
the hanford reactor which was built for commercial use but 
abandoned because of a regional power surplus could be converted 
to military use within about seven years the report said 
energy secretary james d watkins said last month that while it 
is economically and technically feasible to convert the hanford 
plant to tritium production that approach is a political 
nightmare that he did not want to pursue 
watkins said one of the main sticking points with converting the 
hanford plant is whether it would violate the letter or spirit of 
the nuclear nonproliferation agreement he said the state 
department had reviewed that question and concluded that strictly 
speaking conversion would not violate the treaty 
the question is who wants to get into the game of deciding 
whether or not you should go forward and propose essentially a 
commercial reactor generating nuclear material watkins said 
two prominent scientists in testimony before the nuclear 
facilities panel tuesday said it would be wasteful and premature 
for the administration to move ahead now with construction of new 
military reactors regardless of their location 
carson mark a former designer of atomic weapons and george 
rathjens a former chief scientist in the defense advanced research 
projects agency said the united states has more than enough 
tritium to sustain its nuclear arsenal for several years

a convicted murderer was executed by 
injection early wednesday for the 1981 slaying of a woman who was 
abducted and raped after her car broke down on a freeway 
stephen mccoy whose final appeal was rejected by the us 
supreme court late tuesday was executed at 1225 am at the state 
department of corrections walls unit here 
he gave no final statement he coughed five times after the 
injection was made about 1215 am and groaned twice 
his brotherinlaw two friends and his attorney karen zellars 
were among the witnesses 
the nations highest court denied him a stay by a 54 vote 
without comment 
the 40yearold houston electrician was the 31st texas convict 
and the 110th in the nation executed since the 1976 us supreme 
court ruling allowing states to resume capital punishment 
mccoy was convicted in the slaying of cynthia johnson 18 who 
was abducted as she was returning home from a new years eve party 
on jan 1 1981 
according to trial testimony mccoy and two other men abducted 
the woman mccoy raped her then held her legs down while james 
paster and gary leblanc strangled her with an electrical cord 
paster then drove a nail up the womans nose to make certain she 
was dead said the man who prosecuted the case 
the death penalty was made for people like stephen albert 
mccoy to protect society from people like him and from people like 
james paster said prosecutor george lambright it was the 
coldbloodedness of the acts 
mccoy insisted he was in another room when the woman was slain 
i knew what was going on he said in a death row interview 
i just couldnt do anything about it 
paster awaiting death for another slaying received a life 
sentence for the johnson killing last month he was caught with 
another death row inmate in an unsuccessful escape attempt 
leblanc who testified for the state received a 35year prison 
sentence 
mccoy was in prison serving five years for burglary when he was 
charged with the johnson slaying mccoy paster and leblanc also 
were linked to a 1980 murderforhire in houston and the rape and 
stabbing of a woman 
attorneys for mccoy raised nine issues in their appeal 
including objections to jury selection mccoys competence to stand 
trial and ineffective legal assistance there also was no evidence 
presented at his trial to show mccoy was a continued threat to 
society according to zellars 
state attorneys called the appeal arguments frivolous

the popularity of unregulated shooting sports 
like target practice in open fields isnt a good reason to permit 
people to buy semiautomatic assaultstyle weapons a law 
enforcement official contends 
in order to save lives if we must sacrifice someones minor 
recreational endeavor in order to do that i think thats a 
sacrifice we can make in this country said baltimore county 
police chief neil j behan the president of police executive 
research forum 
i think lives are far more important behan said tuesday as 
he helped launch a new ad campaign sponsored by handgun control 
inc calling for a ban on semiautomatic assaultstyle firearms 
the bush administration imposed a temporary ban on imports of 
such weapons in march and president bush last week called for a 
permanent ban on imports that arent intended for sporting use he 
also called for a ban on ammunition magazines with more than 15 
rounds 
the actions surprised the national rifle association since 
bush a lifetime nra member said earlier this year he opposed 
limits on the weapons his wife barbara said they should be banned 
the federal bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms is studying 
whether the weapons are used for sports a study that focuses on 
regulations on hunting and target competitions 
david conover an nra lobbyist contended that plinking or 
target practice in open fields is a legitimate sport even if 
those who engage in it dont participate in formal competitions 
a public outcry for limits on the weapons erupted after a man 
armed with a semiautomatic version of an ak47 opened fire in 
january on a schoolyard in stockton calif killing five children 
the guns have also been widely used in drugrelated shootings 
behan said the proliferation of semiautomatic assaultstyle 
weapons like the proliferation of handguns its now becoming a 
national disgrace 
crimes involving assaultstyle weapons have risen 78 percent in 
the past two years he said 
the carnage is increasing he said as he called for a ban on 
domestically produced versions of the weapons as well as imported 
ones saying that twothirds of the assaultstyle firearms in the 
united states are made in this country 
the atlanta constitution reported sunday that an assaultstyle 
gun is 20 times more likely to be used in crime than a conventional 
firearm while only 1 million of the 200 million privately owned 
guns in the country are assaultstyle weapons they were used in 
one of every 10 crimes that resulted in a firearms trace last year 
the paper reported 
behan urged support for a bill sponsored by sen howard 
metzenbaum dohio that would place some of the same restrictions

pressure is building on health and human 
services secretary louis sullivan to abandon his support for an 
oklahoma state official whom conservative prolife advocates 
oppose for a top job in the department 
but sullivan continues to support robert fulton to head the 
family services administration at hhs which manages the 
governments major welfare programs a spokesman for the secretary 
said 
sen orrin hatch rutah suggested tuesday that the secretary 
stop pushing the white house to nominate fulton who is under fire 
for his handling of the deaths of two dozen babies with the 
crippling deformity spina bifida the incidents occurred at an 
oklahoma state hospital while he headed the states human services 
department 
hatch said that while he is still looking into the allegations 
against fulton i think theres lots of indication he might want 
to put this in abeyance and back off 
i think its going to be a cause celebre if he sullivan 
continues with it hatch said im not sure he needs to get in 
the middle of a great big fight over it right now 
sullivan has run afoul of righttolife advocates before with 
comments that appeared to support abortion rights to mollify his 
critics he agreed to recommend for nomination to several top jobs 
at the agency people acceptable to prolife groups 
the welfare job was not among the jobs mentioned at the time and 
its duties do not have much to do with abortion however a group 
of conservative republican senators say fultons actions in the 
spina bifida matter show him to be too insensitive to the 
righttolife views 
fulton who is now oklahoma secretary of social services is 
criticized for failing to act promptly to end the oklahoma state 
hospital policy of withholding lifesaving care from spina bifida 
babies 
fulton says that shortly after he became director of the state 
human services department he learned of the policy and put into 
effect regulations and policies designed to assure such denial of 
treatment would not recurr 
but critics say the protections he instituted were required by 
federal law and they note that the doctors involved were never 
sanctioned 
fulton and sullivan met with half a dozen senators on capitol 
hill earlier this month to try to allay their concerns however 
following the meeting sen gordon humphrey rnh and five other 
senators signed a letter to president bush expressing their 
continued opposition to fulton 
hatch was not among them but he said the spina bifida 
allegations disturb me and need further review as do new 
concerns that are being raised 
among the new charges is one that fulton lobbied against 
requirements in a bill in congress last year that required welfare 
recipients to work for their benefits that requirement is part of 
the new welfare reform law hhs must put into effect 
fulton said the provision he lobbied for on behalf of his boss 
oklahoma gov henry bellmon is similar to the provision that 
appeared in the final version of the bill and is now law ive 
been a supporter of workfare for a long long time he said 
hatch also said he is looking into a lawsuit filed against 
fulton for a policy he established as human services director that 
allegedly discriminated against women the case was referred by the 
state supreme court to the state merit protection commission where 
it is pending

nucleartipped antibodies that seek and 
destroy cancer inside the body show promise of giving doctors a new 
way to attack tumors researchers say 
the goal is to blitz cancer cells with huge doses of killer 
radiation doctors launch the attack with protein probes that hunt 
down the cancer deep within the body 
in initial experimental use researchers found that the strategy 
wiped out all detectable cancer in people who were not helped by 
ordinary treatment however far more study will be necessary 
before researchers know for sure whether this approach will cure 
cancer 
the findings were presented tuesday by dr oliver w press of 
the university of washington to the annual meeting of the american 
society of clinical oncology 
press is one of several researchers around the country who are 
working with radioactive antibodies to combat cancer however he 
said his group is using the highest doses of radiation yet tried 
were trying to blast them out of the water he said 
antibodies are natural hunters produced by the body to find 
germs cancer and other dangerous invaders scientists can now 
produce large quantities of antibodies that look for cancer and 
they have fitted them with powerful warheads of radioactive iodine 
with this strategy doctors believe they can deliver far higher 
doses of radiation than would otherwise be possible and still spare 
healthy tissue from harm 
press and colleagues have given the treatment to seven people 
with the blood cancer lymphoma all had failed an average of four 
kinds of chemotherapy the treatment wiped out all visible signs of 
the cancer in five of them 
the percentage of patients responding is much greater than we 
would expect from conventional chemotherapy said dr bruce 
cheson of the national cancer institute 
in other research presented at the meeting 
dr donald s kaufman of massachusetts general hospital 
reported preliminary evidence that a combination of three drugs 
followed by radiation can eliminate bladder cancer if this 
approach works out it would provide an alternative to surgical 
removal of the bladder which is now standard treatment 
many doctors are reluctant to give chemotherapy to women with 
early breast cancer because most can be cured by surgery alone 
dr alexander paterson of cross cancer institute in edmonton 
alberta has found that those who relapse often carry multiple 
copies of an abnormal gene known as an oncogene inside their 
tumors checking for this gene may help doctors target chemotherapy 
to those who are most likely to benefit 
dr gastan rivera of st jude childrens research hospital in 
memphis tenn said a review shows that about twothirds of all 
youngsters with acute lymphocytic leukemia the most common 
childhood cancer can now be cured he attributed the improved 
outlook for this disease which was once almost uniformly fatal to 
continued improvement in chemotherapy 
dr james d levine of new england deaconess hospital in boston 
said a new treatment can overcome low levels of white blood cells 
which are a common side effect of treatment with the drug azt in 
aids patients the therapy called granulocytemacrophage colony 
stimulating factor prompts the body to produce more blood cells 
dr gregory wolf of the university of michigan said a 
combination of chemotherapy and radiation shows promise of allowing 
doctors to avoid removing the voicebox in victims of advanced 
throat cancer people who received the new treatment appear to have 
as good a chance of survival as do surgery patients and most 
retain their ability to speak 
dr harinder garewal of the veterans administration medical 
center in tucson said initial studies suggest that a nutrient 
called beta carotene can reverse precancerous growths in the mouth 
this condition known as oral leukoplakia is common in smokers 
many vegetables are high in beta carotene which the body converts 
to vitamin a

prominent scientists are blasting as wasteful 
and premature a bush administration plan to expand production of a 
key material for nuclear warheads 
carson mark a former designer of atomic weapons and george 
rathjens a former chief scientist in the defense advanced research 
projects agency told congress on tuesday that the united states 
has more than enough tritium to sustain its nuclear arsenal for 
several years 
tritium is a radioactive gas used to boost the explosive power 
of nuclear warheads 
the two scientists were testifying before a special house panel 
investigating the nations tritium needs and the administrations 
plans for modernizing its weapons facilities 
senior officials from the pentagon and the state department also 
testified publicly and intelligence agency officials later 
appeared before the panel in a closed session 
the only three us reactors capable of producing tritium 
located at the savannah river site in south carolina have been 
shut down for safety reasons since last spring the administration 
has cited an urgent need to get them running by early next year 
president bush also has endorsed a plan developed by the reagan 
administration to build by 1998 two new tritiumproducing reactors 
one at savannah river and the other in idaho at a cost of 
approximately 75 billion 
both rathjens and mark said its not necessary to rush a restart 
of the savannah river reactors which have been plagued by 
structural and operator problems in recent years the pair also 
advised postponing the decision on whether to spend the huge sums 
needed to build the two newgeneration reactors 
until well into the next century i dont believe we need to 
worry about production of tritium rathjens said were not 
balancing on a knifes edge 
rathjens suggested the administration propose to the soviet 
union a mutual moratorium on tritium production as a means of 
advancing arms control to forge ahead with construction of two new 
tritiumproducing reactors would send the wrong signal to the 
soviets and us allies about american interest in disarmament he 
said 
a new construction plan might lead the soviets to think we are 
contemplating at least a doubling of our weapons stockpile or 
planning to produce a large number of neutron weapons which 
require more tritium per weapon rathjens said 
he and mark support house and senate bills introduced last week 
that call on the administration to negotiate a ussoviet ban on 
the production of plutonium also needed to make nuclear warheads 
the administration opposes the bills 
we need to have those savannah river reactors restarted as 
soon as we can robert barker the defense secretarys top 
adviser on atomic energy told the panel he submitted a written 
statement dated april 26 that said we are near the point where 
this tritium will be exhausted unless production is resumed 
us supplies of both weaponsgrade plutonium and tritium are 
classified

dollarbuying trend tuesday in new york where comments by federal 
reserve board governor robert heller ignited the currencys 
uptrend the us currency ended trading at 14233 yen in new york 
heller speaking at the national economists club said 
inflation is not dead you dont want to declare victory too 
early 
the fed should proceed in a prudednt fashion to continue to 
observe inflation trends before making a monetary policy shift he 
said 
minori takeuchi a dealer with chemical bank in tokyo said the 
bank of japan intervened in the market selling the dollar 
intermittently in the morning session but the amount it sold was 
unknown the central bank does not comment on its monetary 
activities 
the dollars surge never stops unless the united states shows 
us its monetary policy because the markets demand for the dollar 
is still so strong she said 
on the stock exchange trading was thin mainly due to the yens 
weakness against the dollar and uncertainties over the possible 
discount rate hike said a dealer with nomura securities japans 
largest brokerage 
the majority of market players think a 05 percent hike would 
not be effective to stabilize the markets he said speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
market sources have expected the central bank to raise its 
official discount rate by at least 05 percent from its current 25 
percent neither the bank nor the finance ministry has officially 
commented on a rate hike 
the dollars recent surge and speculation for a substantial 
discount rate increase have already discouraged investors 
stockbuying interest the dealer added

west germans today celebrate 40 years 
of a statehood that has brought them peace and prosperity but many 
feel a nagging guilt over the fate of their brothers in the east 
the german question reunification with east germany 
still haunts west germany despite its postwar emergence as a 
financially strong and influential independent power 
new generations on either side of the concrete and barbedwire 
border have diluted the fervor for reunification and added to the 
traditional questions of whether and when the 
consideration at what price 
the appeal for a single germany has gained momentum from the 
recent eastwest warming trend 
many west germans have relatives in the other germany and about 
one in five have visited the communist eastern state over the past 
decade according to the institute for opinion research in 
allensbach 
but you get an entirely different picture when the german 
question asks not just whether reunification is desirable but 
whether one is willing to see west germany leave the nato alliance 
to achieve it said the institutes gerhard herdegen in an 
interview 
yet in a january survey 51 percent of the west germans polled 
said they would be willing to trade nato membership for 
reunification 
the appeal of neutrality and better relations with eastern 
europe has also been reflected in bonns recent dispute with the 
nato alliance over the future of its shortrange nuclear missiles 
and it may gain momentum next month if soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev indicates during a planned visit a willingness to 
consider eventual reunification as has been predicted by some 
officials 
we are certainly not expecting him to signal readiness for 
reunification but he could indicate in some way that the subject 
is open for further discussion said peter hausmann spokesman 
for the christian social union of bavaria which is aligned with 
chancellor helmut kohls governing christian democrats 
others have dismissed the rekindling of reunification talk to 
the recent troubles between bonn and the nato alliance 
after seemingly being filed to the archives the subject of 
german reunification rises again whenever germanamerican relations 
are not doing so well whenever bonn does not do what washington 
believes is right the centrist westdeutsche allgemeine newspaper 
of essen commented last week 
it too suggested gorbachev may signal some willingness to 
accept a reunited germany banking on a neutral state posing less 
of a threat to moscow than as a member of the nato alliance 
kohl who faces a tough reelection campaign next year has been 
waxing optimistic on the reunification question 
not all of our dreams have been fulfilled kohl noted in a 
statement on the eve of the 40th anniversary we remain under the 
order of our basic law to make complete the unity and freedom of 
germany in recent years the hope has grown that this goal can be 
achieved 
the federal governments program for observing the anniversary 
notes the division remains a bitter reality for germans 
but if west germans have made a few tentative steps forward with 
the political question of reunification the advance has brought 
them a closer look at the costs 
among the improvements noted in relations between the two 
germanys has been a major increase in the number of east germans 
allowed to emigrate to the west which has strained the budgets and 
patience of communities hosting the settlers 
while west germans remain committed in principle to 
reunification it would require an expensive overhaul of the aging 
and outdated industries of the east and subsidies to boost living 
standards perhaps at the expense of their own

governing party chief lee huan was named 
taiwans new premier today succeeding yu kuohua who has been 
criticized as taking an overly cautious approach to economic and 
political reform 
a statement from the party said lees appointment was 
unanimously approved by the 31 members of the policymaking central 
standing committee at a regular weekly meeting chaired by president 
lee tenghui who had nominated lee huan 
yu 75 will continue to serve as premier until later this month 
when the lawmaking legislative yuan which is controlled by the 
nationalists will formally approve lee huans appointment 
lee huan the partys 72yearold secretary general will name a 
new cabinet but observers expect him to retain most of the present 
members because he helped groom them 
yu has been criticized for his conservative policies at a time 
when the nationalists are pushing a more flexible foreign policy to 
regain international recognization for taiwan younger members of 
the party also consider him a liability in a parliamentary election 
in december 
lee huan was educated at columbia university and tankok 
university in south korea and is considered among the most liberal 
senior nationalist officials 
he was a close aide to the late president chiang chingkuo 
whose father chiang kaishek led the defeated nationalists to 
taiwan in 1949 when they lost a civil war to the communists on the 
chinese mainland 
lee has been nationalist secretary general since 1987 and helped 
chiang chingkuo end 38 years of martial law two years ago 
a major newspaper the united daily news said in an editorial 
that lees appointment would usher in a new era of political 
developments in taiwan that would give higher priority to 
political modernization than economic development 
analysts believe this could help lee 66 who became president 
last year when chiang chingkuo died and has pursued a more 
pragmatic foreign policy including the first visit by taiwan 
officials to china since the nationalists were overthrown 40 years 
ago 
hu fu a political scientist at the nationalist taiwan 
university questionedd whether lee huan would push through any 
drastic reforms 
lee huan is not so rigid as yu but he is not a reformer hu 
said liberalization will move forward steadily but gradually 
the party statement did not say who would succeed lee but 
newspapers have said james soong 47 the partys deputy secretary 
general is a leading candidate

former philippine president ferdinand marcos 
condition is not improving and his doctors say its a miracle hes 
still alive 
hes the sickest ive ever seen him dr steven berman an 
infectious disease specialist told a news conference tuesday 
doctors said marcos is dependent on lifesupport equipment and 
the prospects for his survival are slim marcos is unable to 
breathe on his own and is undergoing constant kidney dialysis they 
said 
he would die if he was off the ventilator he would die if he 
wasnt going to get dialysis he would probably die if his cardiac 
medicines were removed berman said this is a multifactoral 
problem 
the 71yearold marcos who has been hospitalized at st francis 
medical center since jan 15 is suffering from massive bacterial 
infection kidney failure cardiac failure pulmonary failure and 
pneumonia the doctors said 
its a miracle hes survived so far said dr calvin wong 
marcos cardiologist 
marcos condition has been unstable and very critical since he 
suffered kidney failure and underwent a surgical procedure thursday 
to prepare his veins for extended kidney dialysis 
dr roland ng a kidney specialist said a kidney transplanted 
into marcos in 1984 stopped functioning because of the infection 
marcos has been on a respirator for three months 
transplant surgeon dr livingston wong would not specify how 
long marcos might live but said it probably would not be long 
i think if you asked any one of us wed all say he has a low 
probability of longterm survival livingston wong said 
marcos fever was 101 degrees tuesday but had climbed as high 
as 104 degrees during the past few days berman said 
although the prognosis for marcos remained poor the doctors 
would not rule out the possibility of recovery 
the former leaders illness has prevented him from traveling to 
new york city to face racketeering charges alleging he plundered 
his homeland of more than 100 million and used the money to buy 
real estate and art in the united states 
his wife imelda who also is charged last week appealed to 
philippine president corazon aquino to allow her husband to die in 
his homeland the request was denied 
the marcoses have lived in hawaii since february 1986 when they 
were ousted in a civilianmilitary revolt that brought mrs aquino 
to power

a man was executed by injection early 
today for helping to rape and strangle a woman who was abducted as 
she awaited help in her disabled car following a new years eve 
party in 1981 
stephen mccoy gave no final tatement although he smiled briefly 
to four friends he had invited as witnesses he coughed and his 
chest heaved five times as the drugs began to take effect then 
uttered two low and long groans before he stopped breathing at 
1225 am 
the 40yearold houston electrician was the 31st texas convict 
and the 110th in the nation executed since the 1976 us supreme 
court ruling allowing states to resume capital punishment 
mccoy lost a final appeal late tuesday when the court voted 54 
against a stay the action which came without comment was unusual 
since the appeal was mccoys first to reach the high court it has 
been routine for initial appeals to merit at least one reprieve 
the significance of this is the courts very clearly are 
indicating impatience with dilatory tactics within the process and 
they intend to expedite the process said state attorney general 
jim mattox 
mccoy was convicted in the murder of cynthia johnson the 
18yearold conroe woman was abducted by mccoy and two other men 
from her car which had broke down on a houston freeway as she was 
returning home from a new years eve party 
according to trial testimony mccoy raped the woman and then 
held her legs down while james paster and gary leblanc strangled 
her with an electrical cord testimony also showed paster hammered 
a nail up the womans nostril to make certain she was dead 
miss johnson would have turned 27 on monday 
paster awaiting death for another slaying received a life 
sentence for the johnson murder last month he was caught with 
another deathrow inmate in an unsuccessful escape attempt 
leblanc who testified for the state received a 35year term 
the death penalty was made for people like stephen albert 
mccoy to protect society from people like him and from people like 
james paster said george lambright who prosecuted the case 
there was no remorse no drugs no alcohol no real 
explanation for the violence except they were just mean mattox 
said 
mccoy had insisted he was in another room when the woman was 
slain 
i knew what was going on he said in an interview last week 
i just couldnt do anything about it 
im right with the man upstairs i know this he knows im 
innocent its not that that bothers me about dying its to die 
for something i didnt do and to look like a sicko doing it 
sometimes you make the wrong decisions thats just the way it 
goes im happy with myself happy with the lord im at peace with 
myself i know i didnt do it

about 500 youths hurled gasoline 
bombs at police in a racially mixed district of the central england 
town of wolverhampton following a drug raid in a tavern police 
said 
the rioters tuesday night also threw up a makeshift barricade 
across a street looted at least one store and set a local council 
office on fire said deputy chief constable paul leopold of the 
west midlands police 
in 1985 predominantly black and racially mixed areas of british 
towns and cities including wolverhampton were swept by a wave of 
protests of police harassment in the worst incident a policeman 
was hacked to death in the tottenham district of north london 
social workers said the underlying cause of those riots included 
high unemployment among young people especially young blacks and 
poor housing in innercity areas 
leopold told a news conference that the trouble began in tuesday 
night when police raiding the pub made 20 arrests 12 for drug 
offenses and seized marijuana and crack cocaine 
he said 250 officers members of the police drug squad and a 
police support unit were attacked by the mob 
the officers dispersed the mob in about two hours he said 
the conduct of these youths reacting to legitimate police 
action in making a serious drugs raid is totally reprehensible and 
inexcusable leopold said 
in february 1987 13 people were arrested shops were looted and 
windows smashed in rioting in the area following the death of a 
local black man 
the black man had collapsed after a struggle with two policemen 
who were called to a shop when a clerk became suspicious that the 
credit card the man was carrying might have been stolen 
an inquest returned a verdict of accidental death 
last year parcel bombs were mailed to two senior police 
officers and to a former police official police said the bombs 
were believed to be the work of a group calling itself the black 
liberation front

the state needs tougher laws to keep repeat 
offenders in custody said gov booth gardner after a man with a 
long history of assaults on children was accused of raping and 
mutiliating a 7yearold boy 
the arrest of earl kenneth shriner 39 has frustrated police 
prosecutors mental health professionals and relatives who had 
tried to keep him in mental hospitals or jails 
shriner was charged with attempted murder rape and assault 
after the boy was found in a wooded area naked and bloody with his 
penis cut off 
the boy was in satisfactory condition tuesday at mary bridge 
childrens health center 
shriners 38yearold brother john said hes my brother and 
i love him but god hes driven the whole family nuts for 20 
years 
if guilty he should be put somewhere where hes safe and 
where people are safe from him said his mother delores 
hes crying out for help she said he says he didnt do 
this but he has two personalities a loving son and then the man 
who may have done this 
gardner on tuesday called for a change in the law so individuals 
with a known risk for committing such crimes could be subject to 
involuntary treatment and civil commitment under some code or 
statute 
state sen phil talmadge said tuesday he would ask corrections 
and mental health officials why shriner was free 
i want to see their explanation talmadge said this guy 
by all accounts had no business being out on the street 
shriner pleaded innocent monday in superior court two days 
after the attack bail was set at 1 million and trial for july 17 
reports on shriner through 1977 show authorities considered him 
mentally retarded in 1987 psychologists and psychiatrists at 
western state hospital concluded he had a learning disability and 
five disorders including pedophilia and an antisocial personality 
his troubles with the law began in 1965 when he was declared a 
defective delinquent after choking a 7yearold girl the term 
now abandoned referred to juveniles prone to violence because of 
mental or emotional problems 
in november 1966 he was sent a school for the developmentally 
disabled after he led authorities to the body of a 15yearold 
classmate but he was considered too dangerous for the school and 
was committed to western state psychiatric hospital from 1968 to 
1973 
in 1976 he was acquitted in two assault cases but the next 
year he pleaded guilty to assaulting two 16yearold female 
hitchhikers the judge ordered him committed to the sexual 
psychopath program at eastern state hospital but he was rejected 
there and spent his entire 10year sentence at the washington 
corrections center 
subsequent efforts to return him to western state were rejected 
by a judge although late in his prison term shriner was found with 
lists of items he would need to maim or kill youngsters officials 
said 
we did everything legally possible to keep him in custody 
said kathryn s bail chairwoman of the indeterminate sentencing 
review board 
in november 1987 shriner pleaded guilty to assault in the 
stabbing of a 16yearold boy and served 66 days of a 90day 
sentence 
a subsequent evaluation at western state found shriner 
dangerous especially to youngsters but there was no sexual aspect 
to the case said frank mendizabal of the state department of 
social and health services 
last october shriner was sentenced to 67 days in jail after 
pleading guilty to attempted unlawful imprisonment in an attack on 
a 10yearold boy who was tied to a post and beaten 
i dont think there was anything more we could have done to 
keep him out of reach any longer than we did prosecutor jon 
ladenburg said

students and workers demanding democratic reform 
are taking to the streets throughout china from dusty lanzhou in 
the west to harbin in the distant northeast 
while the world focuses its attention on the student uprising in 
beijing the upheaval is rapidly spreading in areas of the country 
beyond the international eye and not normally associated with 
political activism 
sources contacted at several provincial capitals say workers are 
supporting the student demonstrations and sitins they say the 
rallies demand premier li pengs resignation for declaring martial 
law in beijing 
in chinas largest city shanghai up to 500000 people have 
paralyzed traffic in marches to the waterfront business district 
and the peoples square 
about 100000 marched tuesday night in the southern city of 
canton a business center normally known for its lack of interest 
in political matters 
in canton and the inland city of changsha people set off 
firecrackers and cheered when they learned of a hong kong radio 
broadcast that claimed li had been forced out the report not be 
immediately confirmed 
john lowry a teacher from cincinnati said 100000 people were 
on the streets in changsha tuesday night he said sitins have been 
going on continually in front of the railroad station and the party 
and government headquarters 
residents are bringing the students hot food and medicine he 
said by telephone support from the workers is really quite 
amazing 
among the many people marching in support of the students was a 
group of 20 blind people lowry said 
in the yellow river city of lanzhou people placed wreaths on a 
central square for a woman student who reportedly died during a 
hunger strike an american source said students were going to 
factories to talk to workers about their cause and workers were 
leaving their jobs to meet them 
all major universities in chinas northeastern cities of harbin 
shenyang changchun and dalian have been shut down by strikes said 
a western source in the area 
theres an atmosphere of tension which we didnt have a week 
ago the source said on condition of anonymity everyone is 
sitting very very tight waiting to hear what will happen in 
beijing 
class boycotts also continued in nanjing and at least 20000 
people have been on that citys streets every night since martial 
law was declared in beijing on may 20 an american there said 
she said that since the government began jamming 
chineselanguage broadcasts of the voice of america on sunday 
students frequently try to glean information from foreigners about 
activities in beijing 
in shenyang handouts of the latest voa reports are pasted on 
walls and students in changsha said voa and the british 
broadcasting corp are the only reliable sources of news 
sources said students have streamed back and forth to beijing to 
keep their colleagues in the provinces abreast of what students in 
the capital are doing 
in shenyang however authorities have stopped selling train 
tickets to beijing to halt the flow of student supporters 
demonstrations have also been reported in xian shenzhen 
suzhou tianjin hefei guiyang urumqi hainan hangzhou hohhot 
and dozens of other cities in ningbo students broke into the city 
government compound and in wuhan students last week stopped all 
traffic on a bridge crossing the yangtze river 
official newspapers in beijing say little about disturbances 
outside beijing shanghai and a few other cities but it appears 
certain that few places have escaped the studentled upheaval

in which rock star joan jett claimed playboy magazine hurt her 
reputation by mistakenly identifying her as a woman posing 
seductively in a bathtub 
state judge eugene nardelli threw out the lawsuit after jett 
twice failed to appear for courtordered depositions with playboy 
lawyers the new york post reported today 
the photograph appeared in playboys may 1982 issue after jett 
filed the lawsuit the magazine printed a correction and the retna 
photo agency which supplied the picture destroyed it 
jetts attorney steven kramer said the photograph caused jett 
to be shamed held up to public disgrace in the community in 
which she lives and injured her reputation 
but nancy wolff representing retna said the lawsuit was 
frivolous 
the purpose seems to be to obtain continuing publicity for the 
rock star joan jett while forcing the defendants to run up 
unwarranted legal bills wolff said 
the photograph actually was of a member of jetts former band 
the runaways she was in a tub wearing fishnet stockings and a 
fringed vest with strategically positioned bubbles the post said

limousine but then most customers arent the president of iceland 
sampling her countrys largest export 
president vigdis finnbogadottir proclaimed the meal of cod 
fillets delicious before launching into a defense of the north 
atlantic countrys environmental concerns 
the international whaling commission imposed a fouryear ban on 
whaling in 1986 but iceland has continued killing whales in what 
it deems a research project 
finnbogadottir said tuesday her country plans to complete 
scientific research on the whales this year and send it to the 
commission for evaluation 
do you think the icelanders are so silly that they would be 
killing the last whale on earth she said we are a small 
nation but we most certainly are not less intelligent than other 
people in the world 
our interest is to keep the balance in the sea to keep the 
quality around us we live in an unpolluted area and i hope we can 
in the future set an example in this field 
finnbogadottir was a guest of jerrico inc the parent company 
of long john silvers which is celebrating its 20th anniversary 
the company is one of the worlds largest buyers of north atlantic 
fish 
we are selling you very clean fish that comes from unpolluted 
waters in iceland she told reporters after lunch we cultivate

called police to report that john limoli had threatened him 
mike mills 24 who lives with ramsdell said the guy was 
just flipping out one second he was talking about the jews getting 
killed in world war ii one second he was asking if wayne was a 
democrat or a republican and then he kept going on about the bible

no injuries were reported among police and officers did not return 
the fire a police spokesman said 
members of our swat team tried talking to john but got no 
response police spokesman lt al jezior said but we saw a 
person we perceived to be john throwing makeshift firebombs out of 
several windows and also inside the house

bottles said police sgt roger dennerll he had approximately 
six of them that he threw out the windows of the house

off windows back into the house

the brother of reputed mob boss john gotti was 
convicted of managing a multimilliondollar heroin ring ending a 
sixyear legal battle that included two mistrials 
the jury returned its verdict against gene gotti on tuesday 
night seven days after deliberations began and about three hours 
after a federal judge dismissed a holdout juror who said he feared 
for his familys safety 
gotti and codefendant john carneglia showed no emotion as the 
jury pronounced them guilty of racketeering possession with intent 
to distribute heroin and conspiracy with intent to distribute 
heroin 
carneglia also was convicted of an interstate travel violation 
both men face up to 50 years in prison 
jurors were polled and then asked by us district judge john 
bartels whether anything the dismissed juror told them affected 
their verdict or whether the dismissal itself affected their 
decision all answered no 
bartels allowed the two to remain free on 1 million bonds 
pending a full bail hearing june 20 no sentencing date was set 
assistant us attorney robert larusso said he was happy with 
the verdict 
the evidence was clear he said it was a matter of 
putting the pieces together 
ronald fischetti gottis attorney said he was confident the 
verdict would be reversed on appeal 
the verdicts came three hours after bartels dismissed the juror 
the juror referred to only as juror no 9 told the judge he was 
scared by a visit last week from two men who asked if he was on the 
gotti jury 
the juror said there were no explicit or implied threats from 
the men bartels dismissed the juror and told the remaining 11 to 
resume deliberations 
when they came back 15 minutes later with a verdict the judge 
sent them back saying i dont think that you have had enough 
time to deliberate without juror no 9 i ask you to lay aside what 
you might have heard from juror no 9 
the jury earlier had sent a note to the judge saying all but 
juror no 9 had reached informal agreement on a verdict 
juror no 9 was an alternate until just before deliberations 
started replacing one who was dismissed last wednesday after it 
was revealed that he lived in the same neighborhood as an fbi agent 
assigned to the case 
at the first trial prosecutors alleged jury tampering by some 
of the defendants prompting an unusual proceeding involving nine 
federal judges and ultimately a mistrial in january 1988 
the second trial was declared a mistrial in july after a juror 
was dismissed when cocaine was found in clothing brought to him 
during deliberations and the 11 remaining jurors announced they 
were hopelessly deadlocked 
the third trial was reassigned to bartels who at 91 is one of 
the oldest federal judges 
the defense requested a mistrial this time after it was revealed 
that one of the jurors was the cousin of a federal prosecutor who 
worked at the courthouse a second request involved accusations in 
the news media that bartels had fallen asleep during the 
prosecutors opening statements 
bartels rejected all mistrial motions 
the case stems from a 1983 indictment 
john gotti is reputedly the boss of the gambino organization 
the nations most powerful mafia family

sen robert f kennedys assassin sirhan 
b sirhan has an unpredictable capacity for violence and remains a 
threat to society a state prison board ruled in denying him parole 
for the 10th time 
sirhan 45 who is serving a life sentence for the 1968 shooting 
of the democratic presidential candidate is not eligible for 
parole again until next year 
board chairman david brown on tuesday called the shooting one 
of the most shocking criminal assassinations in the history of the 
united states 
it was an attack not merely on an individuals life but on the 
political life of the country he said 
in his arguments to the panel sirhan apologized for the 
slaying said he was no longer a threat to society and that he 
hasnt given up hope for freedom 
i feel very sad very sorry very remorseful that a human 
life was taken the jordanianborn sirhan said after 21 years 
i have become quite convinced that my act was very wrong 
morally and humanly toward robert kennedy and especially toward 
his family and his loved ones and his supporters 
i realize the mistake of it and i wish from the bottom of my 
heart that this crime this horrible event never occurred 
he said 
after the board turned him down sirhan accused it of prejudice 
saying the three panelists used specious arguments 
the board told sirhan it wanted him to complete a psychiatric 
evaluation program he began in march 
the board also rejected claims by sirhan and his attorney luke 
mckissack that it was not impartial because its members had been 
involved in a previous hearing at which they deliberated only three 
minutes this time the panel deliberated nearly an hour 
sirhan argued that he has done everything officials have asked 
of him has been a model prisoner but is serving more time than 
most prisoners with firstdegree murder convictions 
sirhans older brother adel watched the hearing along with 
reporters via closed circuit television at the state correctional 
training facility in this small community 180 miles south of san 
francisco 
we were hoping for more lenient consideration this time he 
said glumly hopefully next time will be better 
kennedy a us senator from new york was shot with a 
22caliber pistol as he walked through the kitchen of the 
ambassador hotel in los angeles after winning the california 
presidential primary 
sirhan a christian arab was sentenced to death for kennedys 
murder but was spared from gas chamber after californias death 
penalty law was overturned in 1972 
his sentence was changed to life in prison with possibility of 
parole and sirhan faced his first parole hearing in 1975 
for the past six years sirhan has been in a maximumsecurity 
section at the soledad prison his release has been blocked 
repeatedly by parole panels that have cited reasons ranging from 
the effect the crime had on the us political system to sirhans 
potential for future violence 
sirhan last came before the board two years ago at that time 
the panel recommended that he undergo extensive psychiatric 
evaluation pursue vocational training attend alcoholics anonymous 
sessions remain free of disciplinary problems earn an associates 
degree and provide documentation of job offers 
sirhan told the panel he was not a man of violence he blamed 
the shooting on a volatile mixture of politics youth and alcohol 
a lot of people dont realize robert kennedy was my hero 
sirhan said he said he turned against kennedy because of his 
support of the sale of 50 fighter jets to israel then drank too 
much got a gun and shot him 
sirhan said he doesnt hate any politicians now and isnt a 
threat to supporters of israel he said he understands jews better 
now because like the victims of adolf hitler ive been exposed 
to gas chambers

eastern airlines has graduated its first class of 
new pilots since the carriers crippling strike began march 4 
attorneys for easterns pilots union however told us 
bankruptcy court in new york city that the pilot training raised 
serious safety issues 
our pilot training is going very smoothly company spokesman 
robin matell said in miami this is a very heavily experienced 
group 
two new pilots are already flying and about 20 more completed 
training this week matell said eastern said 452 new pilots have 
begun training during the past two months joining nearly 250 
eastern pilots who are crossing picket lines 
also tuesday eastern gave american west airlines until 5 pm 
today to line up financing for its proposed 415 million purchase 
of easterns lucrative bostonnew yorkwashington shuttle 
under a rebuilding plan submitted to federal bankruptcy court 
eastern says it needs about 1700 pilots to return to about 
twothirds of its prestrike operations eastern has been flying 
about 10 percent of its prestrike schedule of nearly 1100 daily 
flights that used 3600 pilots 
eastern which filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and 
reorganization on march 9 says it can rebuild a smaller 
profitable carrier without its unions and after selling 18 
billion in assets 
eastern unions want the parent texas air corp to sell the 
airline attorneys for the pilots union which has joined the 
flight attendants in honoring the striking machinists union picket 
lines filed a detailed attack tuesday on easterns rebuilding plan 
the airline cant possibly train enough new pilots to meet its 
rebuilding goals the union said 
the training of these new pilots also raises certain serious 
safety issues regarding the lack of experience among the pilot 
crew the union said 
union spokesman hank weber said the eastern training has been 
marred by a high dropout and failure rate that training has taken 
longer than usual that eastern is using instructors from sister 
airline continental and that training has been chaotic 
matell said the failure and dropout rate has been running at 
normal levels 
the first group of graduates averages 5782 hours of flying 
experience compared with the prestrike average of 4000 hours for 
recruits matell said the average age of the recruits is 383 
years with most coming from corporate duty or commuter airlines 
during a brief hearing tuesday in bankruptcy court eastern said 
it would consider american west airlines offer for the shuttle 
withdrawn if it could not meet todays deadline eastern already 
has agreed to a 365 million offer for the shuttle from developer 
donald trump 
if america west arranges the financing judge burton r lifland 
must determine whether it is satisfactory before both offers for 
the shuttle are considered further lifland must approve any sale 
of eastern assets

a georgia congressman is to receive an honorary 
degree from an alabama college that he says turned him away 31 
years ago because of his race 
rep john lewis dga is a native of troy ala and in 1958 
he applied to what was then troy state college in a statement from 
his washington dc office lewis said tuesday that his 
application to the college was denied because he is black 
troy state university plans to present lewis with an honorary 
doctorate of law degree at its commencement june 2 
i have received several degrees in the past few years but 
this degree is very special because it comes from the university in 
my hometown and the school i always wanted to attend said lewis 
who also has honorary degrees from princeton and other colleges 
bill buchannon public relations director for troy state said 
in a telephone interview tuesday night that university officials 
did not know about the schools rejection of lewis when it voted in 
march to give him an honorary doctorate of laws 
theyre awarding it to him for being a pike county ala 
native from a basically outlying area of this town who obviously 
has made good in his state and on the national level buchannon 
said for that reason our board thought he was deserving 
the boards resolution commending lewis lists some of the 
congressmans accomplishments including his role in civilrights 
organizations and his former position on the atlanta city council 
it also outlines his education which includes a bachelors degree 
from fisk university where lewis went after being turned down in 
troy 
he said it was the schools refusal to accept him that led him 
to montgomery ala and to the civilrights movement 
after troy state rejected him lewis wrote dr martin luther 
king jr in montgomery requesting help in getting into troy state 
king replied with a bus ticket to montgomery and an invitation to 
come to talk about filing a lawsuit against the school 
soon after his talk with king lewis joined others pushing for 
civil rights lewis decided not to sue troy state and later went to 
school in nashville tenn where he led sitins and demonstrations 
calling for an end to racial discrimination 
this honorary degree represents many of the advancements we 
have made in the areas of education and civil rights in the past 30 
years lewis said 
buchannon said he realizes the degree illustrates how far the 
university and society have come in civil rights but he emphasized 
that the school chose to honor lewis for his exemplar life

premenstrual syndrome may contribute to 
violence in womens prisons and helping inmates cope with 
depression anxiety and other symptoms may prevent trouble a 
psychologist said 
prisons need to recognize if women suffer from pms and train 
people to teach about it said kate harri a minneapolis 
psychologist who specializes in pms and has consulted with 
prisoners 
for unknown reasons women who live together often begin to 
menstruate at the same time each month she told participants 
tuesday at the third national workshop on female offenders 
do you remember going to college living in a dorm cycling 
with your roommate think about women in a prison she said 
those women in a prison are going to cycle together 
there are times when they have behavior disturbances if you 
have more than one woman who is premenstrual at one time who has 
pms then of course youre going to have behavior disturbances 
pms is a hormonal condition in which a variety of symptoms 
regularly occur in the same phase of the menstrual cycle usually 
the week before menstruation begins and disappear usually within 
a few days 
it can lead to mood swings and in rare cases acts of violence 
harri said 
helping inmates deal with the disorder will speed 
rehabilitation she said 
pms is not a cause of criminal behavior but it can be a 
contributing factor to it she said some women become very 
aggressive and out of control 
about 32800 women were housed in state and federal prisons as 
of december 1988 said helen g corrothers commissioner of the 
us sentencing commission 
millicent a pulkownik a corrections officer at the state 
correctional institute at waynesburg pa is one of about 500 
people attending the fourday conference she said she has noticed 
many of the 200 women at the prison menstruate at about the same 
time 
you can just tell when everybody is going into cycle she 
said theres a shortness of temper a lower tolerance for 
people

president and chief executive officer of the greater houston 
convention amp visitors bureau

last month that he didnt want black and hispanic council members 
reviewing his annual budget because they would not understand it

changes to help minorities

officials did not return calls for comment on vaughns resignation 
the naacp convention in 1991 is expected to attract 10000 
people and generate 68 million for the local economy the bureau 
said delegates are expected to occupy 3000 hotel rooms during the

a frenchman accused of committing crimes against 
humanity as head of a pronazi militia during world war ii was 
arrested today in southern france police said 
paul touvier 74 was captured at a priory near nice 
the french news agency agence francepresse said he was arrested 
at st francis priory which is run by followers of monsignor 
marcel lefevbre a fundamentalist priest lefevbre was 
excommunicated from the roman catholic church last year after a 
long battle with the vatican over church doctrine 
there had been persistent reports extremeright roman catholics 
were protecting touvier 
in nice police said touvier was being questioned but they 
refused to provide further information 
we see this with great satisfaction beate klarsfeld 
frances bestknown nazi hunter said of the arrest its a great 
bravo for french justice 
in 1945 and 1947 touvier was sentenced to death in absentia on 
convictions of collaborating with the nazis and executing and 
torturing members of the resistance 
touvier was the lyon head of the milice which worked closely 
with the gestapo during the nazi occupation at the time the 
gestapo was headed in lyon by klaus barbie who in 1987 was 
sentenced to life in prison for crimes against humanity 
touvier was not caught and the sentences against him could not 
be carried out because of a 20year statute of limitations 
president georges pompidou quietly pardoned touvier in 1971 
restoring his rights as a citizen 
touvier went into hiding two years later when new charges were 
raised charges of crimes against humanity were filed against him 
in 1981 and an international arrest warrant issued 
the new warrant lists six charges including the slaying of 
victor basch the 81yearold president of frances league for 
human rights who had taken refuge in the lyon area 
investigators determined that when basch and his wife were 
arrested by touviers milice in january 1944 they were judged 
too old to be deported and they were killed on the spot 
magazines and newspapers have published extensive accounts of 
touviers protection by the catholic hierarchy until 1967 
the address on his official identity card was the archbishops 
headquarters in lyon and church officials reportedly lobbied for 
the 1971 pardon 
since touviers return to hiding there have been reports that 
he came under the protection of fundamentalist catholics with 
extremeright political views 
historian henri amouroux a specialist on frances wartime 
collaboration said touviers trial would bring out the role the 
church played in the protection he was accorded 
in an odd twist a death notice for touvier was published in a 
grenoble newspaper in 1984 giving thanks in the name of his family 
for expressions of sympathy it was never explained and there were 
frequent reports afterward that touvier was seen in monasteries in 
france italy or switzerland 
touviers brother andre 61 said in an interview that he was 
surprised by news of the arrest because he had been 99 percent 
convinced his brother had died 
in a certain sense his arrest is a good thing the inquiry 
will show even if he is not lily white that people have 
exaggerated and made a mythic figure out of him andre touvier 
said

germanys electrotechnic export and import corporation and several 
other east german companys he said

the stars of the bolshoi ballet say the show must 
go on even if they have to pirouette in handmedowns after their 
luggage got lost 
ten crates of costumes and props that were supposed to arrive 
ahead of the 30 bolshoi dancers who are opening in chicago on 
thursday disappeared in new york during transit and the company is 
having to make do with borrowed goods 
a highlevel diplomatic search continues for the baggage sent 
nine days ahead of time on aeroflot the soviet unions staterun 
airline 
we know the flight took off from moscow and we know it landed 
in the united states said susan arons a spokeswoman for 
classical artists international which is sponsoring the stars of 
the bolshoi ballet tour 
but we have no idea where the crates are she said 
a second shipment of ballet essentials has been sent from the 
soviet union and is expected to arrive friday night or saturday 
ms arons said 
in the meantime the dancers will borrow from the ballet 
chicago the ruth page foundation and the milwaukee ballet which 
is sending its entire production of giselle to chicago by bus 
its like if the white sox went out onto the field in cubs 
brewer and indians uniforms ms arons said tuesday 
the borrowed costumes have meant extra rehearsals for fittings 
and practicing of precision moves 
the greatest problem is the toe shoes said prima ballerina 
natalya bessmertnova speaking through an interpreter we are 
used to our shoes and they are special shoes russian toe shoes 
are different every dancer has a master who makes the shoes by 
hand to fit perfectly to the foot 
maybe some of us will have to dance in the costumes first and 
then we will all have to switch but well make the best of it 
ms bessmertnova said we have already cried now we have to 
laugh 
the dancers are scheduled to give four performances at chicagos 
civic opera house besides giselle the program includes 
excerpts from other classical pieces such as swan lake and 
sleeping beauty

president richard von weizsaecker 
today extolled the virtues of his nation on its 40th birthday 
praising the spirit that has made west germany a world economic 
power but warning against selfsatisfaction 
at a celebration to observe west germanys founding weizsaecker 
said germans through their suffering and successes of the postwar 
period had earned the right to enjoy prosperity 
he declared his nations allegience to the west twice praising 
the united states for its help in rebuilding the west german state 
from the ashes of the third reich 
his clear embrace of the nato alliance appeared to be a signal 
to the increasingly leftleaning populace that notions of a neutral 
german state are illadvised and could jeopardize peace and 
stability built over the past four decades 
west germany is embroiled in a dispute with the united states 
and britain over the fate of shortrange nuclear missiles and the 
argument has strained relations among the traditionally close 
allies 
under the conditions of the cold war it was easy to be 
united weizsaecker told his audience at bonns beethoven hall 
it becomes more uncomfortable when the world no longer gives 
clear information on who is for us and who is against us 
weizsaecker praised soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev for the 
breathtaking process of change he has introduced in his 
country but he tempered the accolades with a warning that no one 
is sure of the kremlin leaders future 
he paid tribute to west german economic prowess but said west 
germans have much work ahead of them 
the economy is blooming science has won back its prominence 
and education has become an example for the world said the 
69yearold president reelected tuesday to a second fiveyear 
term 
yet we have no ground for selfsatisfaction weizsaecker 
said we have not become angels under the basic law 
the basic law adopted may 23 1949 serves as the 
constitutional foundation of west germany and has won praise for 
guiding the defeated nation from ruin to international respect 
west germany is the worlds largest exporter and enjoys one of 
the highest standards of living and a strong social security net 
but weizsaecker suggested west germanys way of life is 
threatened by resistance to social change 
in particular he decried the lot of german women who bear the 
brunt of a system that has been slow to develop day care or 
flexible work scheduling despite the fact that about twothirds of 
the nations women work outside the home 
as never before must the family make way for the work market 
instead of the other way around this is regretted by all and the 
women bear the lions share of the burden the president said

foreign diplomats said they also heard reports of clashes 
between ethnic turks and security forces in dulovo and kaolinovo 
in northeastern bulgaria 
an emigre source in vienna austria said fatalities occurred in 
those regions when police and troops opened fire on protesters 
authorities moved in tanks and helicopters after the clashes in 
razgrad a diplomat said communications to the city were cut 
extremistminded individuals some under the influence of 
alcohol committed a gross violation of peace and tried to draw 
groups of the population into acts of lawless violence bta said 
it said that despite numerous appeals to abide by the law a 
group led by extremist elements attacked and illtreated civil 
servants police officers included in todor ikonomovo about 
190 miles east of sofia the capital 
an attempt to break into the village peoples council and 
seize the arms kept there resulted in a confrontation according 
to the report 
it said security forces fired warning shots and the casualties 
occurred when bullets bounced off the pavement and hit protesters 
a man died during riots in the town of kaolinovo and a post 
mortem found that heart failure was the cause of death the news 
agency reported 
an emigre source said the clash in kaolinovo was prompted by a 
petition that four ethnic turks sent to parliament last month 
urging that the minoritys ethnic rights be restored the source 
said the four were arrested may 1 and punished with labor on state 
farms 
bulgarian authorities do not recognize the existence of a 
turkish minority in the country 
bta blamed the disturbances on inaccurate information provided 
by some local authorities on recently liberalized travel laws 
which allegedly created misunderstandings among certain strata of 
the population 
the new measures passed by the federal parliament this month 
make it easier for the countrys 89 million citizens to get a 
passport and journey abroad they also apparently make it easier 
for bulgarian citizens to emigrate 
the official report did not exactly how the alleged 
misunderstandings of the travel laws gave rise to the unrest 
 
emigre sources in vienna said a protest hunger strike among the 
ethnic turks which started may 6 had spread to several parts of 
bulgaria and involved up to 300 people at a time 
groups of people were reported taking turns in the fast for a 
few days to publicize the plight of the turkish minority prior to a 
human rights conference starting in paris may 30 
turkey ruled bulgaria for 500 years before 1863 and there is a 
long history of conflict periodic unrest has been reported since 
1984 in ethnic turkish areas reports of growing protest have 
circulated among diplomats in sofia for at least a month

with gov george deukmejians signing 
of two bills today california becomes the first state to ban 
militarystyle assault weapons 
the legislation the republican governor planned to sign would 
ban the manufacture and sale of more than 50 semiautomatic rifles 
pistols and shotguns on jan 1 
attempts to restrict such weapons had been blocked repeatedly by 
the gun lobby led by the national rifle association until a 
shooting rampage at a stockton school four months ago left five 
children and the gunman dead 
the slayings by a deranged drifter carrying a semiautomatic 
ak47 rifle rallied the public support needed to push the measure 
through 
under the legislation people who owned the listed weapons 
before june 1 may keep them by obtaining permits otherwise the 
guns can be possessed only with a specialneeds permit such as 
those obtained by movie studios for machine guns 
possession would be a misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in 
jail and a 1000 fine or a felony carrying up to three years in 
prison the bills would also increase the penalties for crimes in 
which assault weapons are used 
the bills would allow the attorney general to go into court to 
add similar guns to the list

the 1865 explosion of the paddlewheeler 
sultana was a disaster to rival the sinking of the titanic 
the dead many of them emaciated from confederate prison camps 
totaled more than 1500 but newspapers of the day gave scant 
notice the horror was lost in the greater gore of civil war and 
presidential assassination 
until now there had been no marker here for the union soldiers 
who perished in the muddy mississippi but on sunday a sixfoot 
granite marker is being unveiled in memphis elmwood cemetery as a 
reminder that the sultana went down in flames just seven miles 
north of the citys downtown riverfront 
built for 300 passengers and a crew of 76 the steamship was 
carrying more than 2300 people plus 100 horses and mules when 
three of its four boilers exploded at 2 am on april 27 1865 
jerry potter a memphis lawyer who has researched the disaster 
for a dozen years and is writing a book on it said union officers 
may have overloaded the paddlewheeler to inflate troop transport 
payments 
there were two other steamboats that were trying to get a 
portion of the men the only explanation i have been able to 
uncover for why the sultana got them all is bribery potter said 
potter and hugh berryman a forensic pathologist at the 
university of tennessee in memphis estimated the death toll at 
1547 44 more than the number of people lost when the ocean liner 
titanic hit an iceberg and sank in the north atlantic in 1912 
other counts of the sultana victims have put the total between 
1400 and 1450 but berryman said those estimates failed to 
include one of three trainloads of soldiers who boarded at 
vicksburg miss 
the monument financed by three memphis residents will be the 
second of two major markers to the disaster 
the other in knoxville was put up in 1916 by sultana survivors 
who raised money for the monument 
researching the disaster has been difficult because newspapers 
of the day were still primarily concerned with the assassination of 
abraham lincoln two weeks earlier and with the end of the war 
it was just lost to history because of the other events that 
were going on at the time berryman said 
the mississippi has shifted its course since the sultana went 
down and the steamboats remains rest now under a soybean field 
about a mile east of the river in arkansas potter said 
excavating the boat could cost hundreds of thousands of dollars 
and would produce little of commercial value since the wreck was 
salvaged two months after it burned he said 
berryman who wrote a paper on the sultana last year for the 
journal of forensic sciences said survivors told of watching 
dozens of victims drown en masse hands clasped together as they 
grappled for survival 
many of these victims had been through some of the roughest 
battles in the war and those experiences paled in comparison to 
what they went through that night he said 
most of the victims had recently been freed from prison camps in 
alabama and were headed north to be released from the army many 
were crowded onto two decks directly over the paddlewheelers four 
18foot boilers one of which had developed a leak that was hastily 
repaired 
when one of the boilers blew setting off two others the upper 
decks collapsed forming a funnel that dumped dozens of victims into 
the fire berryman said 
the 263foot boat made of wood and covered with flammable 
paint was equipped with 76 life jackets many of the survivors 
also escaped by clinging to debris one survivor floated to shore 
on a dead mule 
the army investigated the disaster and a captain in charge of 
loading the troops at vicksburg was found guilty of mishandling his 
duties his conviction was overturned on appeal however and he 
was honorably discharged

libya threatened to walk out of an 
arab league summit today if any moves were made toward concessions 
to israel but the lebanese crisis proved the most divisive issue 
for arab leaders 
syrian leader hafez assad rather than libyan leader moammar 
gadhafi threatened to delay the closure of the extraordinary 
summit which was convened tuesday mainly to welcome egypt back 
into arab ranks after a 10year ostracism assad today continued to 
press his support for lebanons moslem leader acting prime 
minister salim hoss while syrias strongest challenger in the arab 
world iraq and its president saddam hussein outspokenly backed 
lebanons christian maronite gen michel aoun 
while the conflict is undecided the summit remains closed to 
the rival lebanese delegations for the first time in arab league 
history 
the leaders met behind closed doors tuesday and today but failed 
to resolve the issue the summit was scheduled to close later 
today but moroccan officials speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the dispute might force a delay until thursday 
king hassan ii of morocco invited some of the quarreling leaders 
to a private meeting in his palace late tuesday several had not 
met for years and hassan persuaded some of them to shake hands 
conference sources said those shaking hands included gadhafi and 
palestine liberation organization chief yasser arafat assad and 
saddam hussein and everyone with egyptian leader hosni mubarak 
the sources said 
mubarak moved quickly to reassert egypts traditional domination 
of the arab world when he reoccupied egypts seat in the league for 
the first time since 1979 that was the year cairo was suspended 
for signing its peace treaty with israel 
lebanon has become a grave problem the leader of the arab 
worlds most populous state said at the opening session it 
exhausts us and is exhausting our consciences we must work 
together to overcome this crisis before the fire overcomes us all 
gadhafi sat silently during mubaraks 20minute address taking 
notes 
moroccos national news agency map and egypts middle east news 
agency reported gadhafi and mubarak met privately tuesday night 
with presidents hafez assad of syria and chadli bendjedid of 
algeria in what map described as a warm session of reconciliation 
the egyptian agency quoted its information minister safwat 
sherif as saying the leaders openly discussed differences of 
opinion and a spirit of understanding prevailed 
libya news agency jana has warned gadhafi would walk out if any 
attempt were made to surrender to israel by compromising on the 
arab demand for palestinian statehood 
no such surrender has been discussed 
in his speech tuesday mubarak asked the league to back the 
efforts of its sixnation committee on lebanon to restore lebanese 
national unity and end the civil war that is in its 15th year 
in particular mubarak said the committee should seek 
withdrawal of all foreign forces from lebanon meaning both 
syrians and israelis and help the country live peacefully under 
its constitutional authority 
mubarak gave egypts full backing to the palestinian uprising in 
the israelioccupied territories and backed the right of the 
palestinian people to choose whatever road they find suitable for 
the achievement of their aspirations 
he also spoke of the great financial burden of the uprising 
on the palestinian people echoing the plo complaint that arab 
states have not lived up to their promise of financial aid 
plo spokesmen said only saudi arabia and libya have paid 
anything

solidarity leader lech walesa today 
accused communist authorities of breaking a promise made in 
historic accords by refusing to legalize the countrys independent 
student union 
angry students meanwhile called off a sitin at warsaw 
university they had called to protest the rejection 
they said the government refusal was a futile attempt to divide 
students from solidarity just before june 4 parliamentary 
elections and they promised to redouble campaign efforts for the 
independent unions parliament slate 
just hours after a warsaw court refused tuesday to register the 
independent students association the government struck a further 
blow by banning a scheduled broadcast of solidaritys election show 
from state television 
registration of the student union known as nzs and opposition 
access to television were both agreed to by communist authorities 
in the broad roundtable agreements reached april 5 with the 
solidarityled opposition 
the rejection of the registration of nzs breaks the 
roundtable decisions walesa said in a statement released by the 
solidarity citizens committee 
the court said it rejected the student groups registration 
application because nzs did not renounce the right to stage student 
strikes 
the government press office said it had no immediate response to 
walesas charge and referred inquiries to state television and to a 
court spokesman spokesmen at both institutions said no one was 
available to comment 
walesas statement included no reference to the cancellation of 
the tv show but he promised that his free trade union movement 
would pursue the issue of nzs with authorities 
solidarity will not abandon the matter of nzs registration 
walesa said solidarity will give nzs access to its offices and 
to other means until it is registered 
solidarityendorsed senators and deputies to parliament also 
will raise the matter after they are elected walesa pledged 
announcement of the television ban on the solidarity program 
came just as the show was to go on the air tuesday night 
an announcer read an official communique that said authorities 
had blocked the show because the contents aim against the 
roundtable agreements 
the main thrust of the agreements was that solidarity would be 
reinstated after a sevenyear ban if the opposition agreed to take 
part in polands first democratic elections since world war ii 
tuesdays 45minute broadcast would have been the third such 
solidarityproduced tv show 
todays editions of the opposition daily newspaper gazeta 
wyborcza said the program was to have included a discussion on the 
law led by opposition journalist wanda falkowska as well as 
interviews with solidarity candidates for the twochamber 
legislature 
the government communique said that state tv management which 
is headed by former government spokesman jerzy urban had decided 
to refer the program to an arbitration committee that includes 
solidarity activists 
the committee cochaired by solidarity leader lech walesa and 
interior minister gen czeslaw kiszczak was set up to handle 
disputes that arise in the implementation of the accords 
the opposition presents many programs on radio and television 
containing aggressive and bitter remarks the communique said 
there are however limits which may not be crossed as they would 
erase the constructive achievements attained at the roundtable 
 
at the roundtable the opposition agreed to take part in 
nonconfrontational elections to the current unicameral 
parliament or sejm and a newly created senate that is to be the 
first freely elected legislative chamber in the east bloc 
only 35 percent of the sejm is open to opposition candidates 
the remaining 65 percent is reserved for the ruling communists and 
their allies 
the banning of the program was the lead item in todays editions 
of gazeta wyborcza while official newspapers did report on it 
a solidarityproduced radio broadcast was shortened may 17 
because a censor barred a segment of it and gazeta wyborcza which 
has just begun publishing has come under sharp attack in the 
communist party daily trybuna ludu

reformers said today they are hopeful the new 
parliament will be truly independent because the communist party 
called a kremlin meeting of its deputies and did not issue orders 
on what policies to pursue 
the congress of peoples deputies which opens thursday is the 
countrys first legislature chosen in contested elections in seven 
decades 
the decision of the communist party the only political power 
in the 70 years not to dictate policy at a tuesday gathering 
offered hope for democratic decisionmaking moscow deputy yuri 
andreyev said 
this is very important andreyev said there are no 
decisions required of all the deputies 
about 80 percent of the congress deputies are members of the 
communist party but party leaders cannot count on automatic 
support among moscow radicals or from the baltic republics which 
want freedom from kremlin control 
andreyev said the spirited discussion tuesday indicated the 
congress itself will be open and active 
we were surprised that so many deputies from russia were so 
free in expressing their opinions said marju lauristen a deputy 
from the baltic republic of estonia 
party ideology chief vadim medvedev added to hopes saying on 
national television late tuesday i dont think we should limit 
any discussions we just have to live through them 
today hundreds of legislators met in strategy sessions to 
hastily garner support for proposals to solve the political and 
economic problems facing the soviet union for the first time they 
must please the voters who chose 1750 of the congress 2250 
deputies the remainder were appointed by official organizations 
the formal duties of the congress are to meet annually choose a 
president and 542member supreme soviet legislature and approve 
the presidents recommendations for premier head of the supreme 
court and national prosecutor 
but cooperatives want to repeal a decree that kicked them out of 
profitable businesses armenians want a solution to ethnic problems 
and baltic leaders want economic independence 
a group of moscow reformers including figures as diverse as 
human rights activist andrei d sakharov and populist party 
official boris n yeltsin will propose congress consider economic 
and political reform and sakharov has gone as far as saying it 
ought to replace the smaller supreme soviet as the legislative body 
a poll reported in todays moscow news said 89 percent of 1100 
city dwellers nationwide believed the congress should discuss the 
economic social and political situation in the country 
the people expect very much unfortunately said yuri 
shcherbak a kiev deputy known for his writings on the chernobyl 
nuclear power plant disaster the people expect us to be able to 
solve everything immediately 
the communist party newspaper pravda today quoted a resident of 
southcentral kemerovo as saying he hoped to make our life our 
country such that you can once again say without blushingi am a 
citizen of the soviet union 
the partys central committee on monday proposed gorbachev for 
president and little opposition is expected however a battle may 
develop because reformers want gorbachev to make a report on the 
state of the soviet union before they vote for president 
the official schedule gives the congress just two morning 
sessions before the supreme soviet convenes on saturday the party 
has planned for election of the president and supreme soviet as the 
first order of business followed by discussions 
but the progressives are demanding discussions first and then 
elections we have to pick the supreme soviet deputies after we 
have seen in the discussions who is who said andreyev 
otherwise he said the congress will be no better than the old 
rubberstamp legislature where officials blathered while deputies 
wandered off to the caviarandsturgeon buffet and unanimously 
approved legislation studied for all of 20 minutes 
few negative votes were cast in the previous 1500member 
surpeme soviet that the new body is replacing reformers speaking 
to tv interviewers late tuesday said the party should not be 
afraid of dissent 
if there is democracy then these factions are inescapable 
historian roy medvedev said 
medvedev a specialist on the repression of the stalin era 
could not be published for years but he has gained acceptance in 
the freer atmosphere of gorbachevs reforms and won a parliamentary 
seat from moscow 
writer daniel granin another reformer added the customary 
unity of opinion is extraordinarily dangerous we have lost a lot 
because of it

on a wall of his cluttered office hangs the 
faded letter that claude denson pepper wrote before leaving for 
work one july morning in 1978 to his wife of 43 years as she lay 
dying of cancer 
dearest mildred it said you have not awakened i 
pray for the early time when we can go together as we have done for 
so long i love you with all my heart 
claude pepper 88 never old enough nor lonely enough to quit 
has waited for more than a decade for that time though it may 
finally be at hand as he lies seriously ill at walter reed army 
hospital the love letters are flooding in from a nation 
perk up says one card scrawled by a shaky hand you work 
so hard youre probably just exhausted 
many of the wellwishers are americans 65 and older george 
bush who will join their ranks next month recently paid a bedside 
visit to senior america the withered dogfaced congressman from 
florida is a peerless hero an everalert guardian of the fastest 
growing and in his view the most commonly mistreated segment of 
the population 
the oldest member of congress and chairman of the house rules 
committee pepper is known both as mr social security and mr 
medicaid for his efforts to establish and strengthen both 
programs and thanks to him federal law now bans employers from 
forcing workers to retire before age 70 
his own advice to the older set was to keep on doing what 
youre doing but maybe at a slower pace 
i was playing golf one day he said a few years back when 
i noticed my partners clubs were lighter than mine i found i 
could handle them easier so i changed to less weighty clubs 
so thats what you do in life he said when you come to a 
time when theres a need for any sort of change simply lighten 
your clubs and go right ahead 
despite heart surgery in 1976 despite relying on a pacemaker 
since 1982 despite dismal hearing and vision he wears a hearing 
aid in each ear and thick hornrimmed trifocals over his bluegray 
eyes he hasnt lightened that much of his load though 
emotionally numbed for more than a year by the death of his wife 
pepper charged back in the 1980s keeping long office hours and 
gallivanting around the country to push his own social legislation 
in the face of ronald reagans budget cuts 
ive got a lot to do he said except for my terrible 
burden of loneliness i enjoy life it has always been good to me 
his legislative achievements spanning full careers in both the 
senate and house are legend reaching far beyond his concern for 
the elderly he fought for the first minimum wage 25 cents an 
hour in 1938 his first bill that same year extended federal 
assistance to handicapped children he was among the first members 
of congress to support equal rights and equal pay for women 
born in 1900 in rural alabama pepper remains a preeminent 
eyewitness to americas turbulent journey through the 20th century 
he was 5 years old in 1905 when he first saw an automobile he 
witnessed the celestial passing of halleys comet in 1910 and 
again in 1986 he met orville wright and greeted the apollo 11 
crew on their return to earth 
he stared adolf hitler down in a nuremberg beer hall sized up 
joseph stalin at the kremlin and earned winston churchills 
undying affection for casting the only vote in the senate for the 
lendlease act the first time around 
it has long annoyed pepper that some of the younger generation 
presume to think that he champions the elderly because he is old 
himself he was 28 years old and a member of the florida 
legislature when he introduced a bill waiving fishing license fees 
for senior citizens he was in his 30s when he took up franklin 
delano roosevelts crusade for social security i was a new 
dealer he has said before there was a new deal 
one of his first bills in 1937 created the national cancer 
institute the first of several government centers to explore cures 
for diseases that especially afflict the elderly 
he was 36 when he was elected to the senate where he remained 
for 14 years until his defeat in 1950 by fellow democrat george 
smathers in an extremely bitter election after an interim and 
lucrative 12year period in private law practice pepper has now 
spent 26 years in the house 
a homely man 5foot7 with a bulbous red nose and the mournful 
face of a bassett hound pepper has lived on his dreams as a farm 
boy in dudleyville ala he carved claude pepper us senator 
into a tree trunk when he was 10 years old 
while at the university of alabama and harvard law school in the 
1920s he waited on tables in cafeterias and emptied coal ashes in 
a power plant to earn his tuition but he still managed to graduate 
with top honors 
he taught law at the university of arkansas before moving to 
perry fla to practice he first race for the senate ended in a 
narrow defeat but he was elected without opposition two years 
later in 1936 to this day his staff and friends call him 
senator 
when world war ii broke out pepper convinced that hitler had 
to be stopped pushed for the draft and massive military assistance 
to britain isolationist fever still gripped most of the nation 
and womens groups assailed him as a warmonger and hanged him in 
effigy 
after the war he got heat from conservatives including joseph 
kennedy father of john f kennedy for having visited stalin 
others were angry over his antisegregation views including his 
efforts to repeal the poll tax in florida 
according to robert sherrill author of gothic politics in the 
deep south the campaign smathers waged to defeat pepper in 1950 
was the most elaborate crusade of political annihilation ever 
conducted in southern politics 
smathers supporters attacked pepper on the racial issue and 
legend has it that smathers would tell his lesseducated audiences 
do you know that claude pepper is known all over washington as a 
shameless extrovert not only that but this man is reliably 
reported to practice nepotism with his sisterinlaw and he has a 
sister who was once a thespian in wicked new york worst of all it 
is an established fact that mr pepper before his marriage 
habitually practiced celibacy 
smathers denies ever making that speech pepper says it was 
reported at the time in the vilification contest i was like a 
hummingbird fallen into a nest of screech owls said pepper 
when pepper returned to washington 12 years later as a freshman 
congressman joe kennedys son was president of the united states 
a lot more charming than the father said pepper now joe 
kennedys grandson joseph ii is a house colleague he called the 
hospital the other day to say he was pushing peppers home care 
bill 
claude pepper remains it seems a man for his own generation 
and several others as well

a member of the state board that refused 
to consider a pardon for an armed robber who built a family and 
career during 10 years on the run says the woman can still hope for 
parole 
kay smiths attorney had argued that her release would send a 
message of hope to people to trying to rehabilitate themselves 
but board vice chairman thomas neal said tuesday he felt the 
state already provided mechanisms of hope and the hope we 
provide in this state is for parole 
the department of probation parole and pardon services rejected 
mrs smiths request for a pardon investigation by a 52 vote but 
moved up her parole date from april 1990 to dec 15 because of the 
work the 37yearold woman has done in prison 
if the investigation had been approved the board would then 
have considered actually granting a pardon 
mrs smith who did not attend the hearing had hoped to become 
the first inmate other than a terminally ill one to be pardoned 
since at least the 1940s when the state constitution was amended 
the governor has no power to grant pardons 
in 1975 mrs smith then known as pamela rodgers was convicted 
in south carolina on five counts of armed robbery and sentenced to 
12 years in prison she walked away from a work release program 
three years later and hitchhiked to maryland 
over the next 10 years she earned her high school diploma 
overcame drug and alcohol abuse married ray smith raised a foster 
child and two sons and became a successful real estate agent 
but mrs smiths role as what others describe as a model citizen 
ended last year when she was arrested as a fugitive her previous 
husband convicted of murder in idaho had tipped officials to her 
whereabouts 
mrs smith was returned to south carolina to finish her term and 
serve an additional year for escape last fall she was transferred 
to the womens correctional institution in jessup md so she 
could be closer to home 
her husband who drove all night from his severn md home to 
attend the hearing said afterward its going to be rougher now 
than it was 
overcome with emotion he was unable to speak further

the struggle for china heated up today with 
official reports of widespread military support for premier li 
peng whose attempt to crush the prodemocracy movement has led to 
mass demonstrations demanding his ouster 
but li faced new opposition within the policymaking politburo 
standing committee and from chinas bestknown author who joined 
the multitudes opposing the conservative premier 
foreign minister qian qichen said a politburo meeting would be 
called thursday or friday 
also today china informed western television stations it was 
cutting off satellite transmissions as of midnight ending their 
ability to broadcast from china 
li declared martial law in beijing on saturday ordering troops 
to restore order in the city where more than 1 million people have 
rallied in support of a student campaign for a freer china and an 
end to official corruption 
the student protests have galvanized the nation inspiring the 
largest spontaneous movement in communist chinas 40 years 
soldiers were deployed on beijings outskirts today but did not 
move on tens of thousands of student protesters now on their 12th 
day of a sitin at central tiananmen square 
over the weekend throngs of city residents erected street 
barricades to prevent an army advance stalling convoys hundreds 
of thousands of protesters also took to the streets in dozens of 
other cities all reportedly called for lis ouster 
subway and bus service resumed in beijing and traffic appeared 
near normal today 
although the armys inability to enforce martial law has called 
into doubt its willingness to follow lis orders the official 
xinhua news agency said six of seven military regions supported the 
decision to call troops to beijing only the beijing military 
command was not mentioned 
liberation army daily the military newspaper today published a 
letter from army headquarters urging soldiers sent to enforce 
martial law to fully understand the nature of this struggle 
the letter said the turmoil created by an extremely small 
number of people still has not been quelled if their scheme 
succeeds then the 10 years of hard struggle for reform and the 
work of establishing of modernizing socialism will be destroyed in 
a moment 
on monday however more than 100 senior army officers signed a 
letter seeking an end to martial law suggesting a deep split in 
the military 
two government sources said today that hu qili one of five 
members in the policymaking politburo standing committee had 
thrown his support to the relatively liberal communist party chief 
zhao ziyang who is battling li 
hu is in charge of the staterun press on tuesday some 
official reports criticized lis attempts to carry out martial law 
reports circulated that zhao who had urged conciliation with 
the students had offered to resign rather than order troops into 
beijing 
in the first indication of zhaos status in days the foreign 
minister told diplomats tuesday that zhao had returned to work 
early today xinhua mentioned zhao for the first time since 
before the martial law order and referred to him as party general 
secretary 
wan li president of the national peoples congress cut short a 
us visit tuesday after meeting with president bush us 
officials said wan who has praised the students for their 
patriotic fervor was expected to call an emergency meeting of the 
legislature and press for lis ouster 
in shanghai author ba jin the chairman of the chinese writers 
association was one of 500 intellectuals and highranking party 
members to sign a letter blasting the speech li made friday that 
signaled the start of a crackdown 
the letter also told the party to end press censorship and bring 
its struggle into the open 
for 40 years now the party has made a series of major mistakes 
because life inside the party is not normal the letter said 
we must open the party to the supervision of the people 
the student movement started april 15 following the death of 
ousted communist party chief hu yaobang a favorite with 
intellectuals 
students initially called for a freer society and press and an 
end to official corruption but after martial law was ordered they 
demanded that senior leaders resign 
the struggle centers around lis conservative faction which 
opposes political reform and a liberal group which has pushed some 
democratic reforms of chinas political system 
they might allow him li to go as a sacrifice said one 
source he has handled the martial law situation very badly 
deng xiaoping the 84yearold senior leader apparently backed 
lis effort to suppress the student movement but now his position 
is unknown 
another member of the conservative group is li ximing the party 
boss for beijing

firefighters from as far away as california today 
battled a swift wildfire that has scorched more than 75000 acres 
in the everglades 
smoke from the fire centered in everglades national park about 
30 miles from downtown miami caused a haze over much of the miami 
area 
i believe the fire is moving at 1 mph which doesnt sound 
very fast but for a fire it is said duty officer catherine 
migliano of the state division of forestry 
more than 250 people including hotshot teams of seasoned 
firefighers from california have joined the battle officials said 
a slight shift in wind lessened the danger to a miccosukee 
indian village of about 500 people in the park said park 
information officer pat tolle 
the distance to the village is still some 10 to 12 miles from 
the fire line itself she said 
tolle said lightning started the fire may 16 
the area burning right now in the center of the park hasnt 
burned at all in 30 years so it has a very heavy fuel load and a 
rapid rate of spread she said

nato secretarygeneral manfred woerner said today 
a possible compromise is emerging in the alliances dispute over 
shortrange nuclear missiles in europe 
woerner said in a british broadcasting corp radio interview 
that he thought there was a greater than 50 percent chance of a 
compromise being worked out before next weeks nato summit 
the 16member nato summit marking the 40th anniversary of the 
founding of the alliance opens in brussels on monday 
the dispute involves west germanys call for early negotiations 
with the soviet union to reduce shortrange nuclear missiles which 
have a range of less than 300 miles 
the united states and britain oppose such talks on the grounds 
they could lead to pressure to eliminate shortrange nuclear 
missiles they say the west needs nuclear arms in europe to offset 
a big east bloc advantage in conventional forces 
president bush said in an interview tuesday with londons 
guardian and three other west european newspapers that he felt the 
dispute might not be resolved before the summit 
woerner interviewed from brussels was asked in the bbc 
interview about a proposal reportedly backed by the united states 
to link talks on shortrange missiles to progress in talks on 
conventional force reductions 
asked if he thought that was likely to emerge as a possible 
compromise woerner said yes that is really one of the crucial 
questions which link do you establish between the conventional 
arms control talks and the start of the negotiations on shortrange 
nuclear weapons 
you can imagine several solutions you just spelled out one of 
the possible solutions they are still working on that 
the bbc said this possible solution followed recent contacts 
between washington and bonn but it said there was already 
opposition to it in west germany with some people fearing that the 
conventional arms talks now being held in vienna could drag on for 
years 
woerner said he doubted this and maintained that the two sides 
in the dispute were not so far apart 
he said nato could not afford a split at a historic moment when 
so many changes are taking place in eastern europe

raising excise taxes to reduce the federal 
deficit would impose an unfair burden on rural americans who 
already pay onethird more of their earnings for such taxes than do 
city dwellers two economists said today 
economists james long and robert ekelund of auburn university in 
alabama said they found that rural households at every income level 
up to 40000 spend a bigger share of their earnings on excise 
taxes on motor fuel tobacco and utilities 
this differential tends to be greatest at lowincome levels 
long said at a news conference sponsored by the american 
agriculture movement which sponsored the study 
if this congress starts looking at an increase in excise taxes 
as a way to balance the budget we want to say no way said 
david senter national director of the 35state farm group 
several members of congress have suggested raising federal taxes 
on gasoline alcoholic beverages and cigarattes as ways of cutting 
the budget deficit rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of the 
house ways and means committee advocates a sharp increase in the 
gasoline tax but only if president bush agrees to go along 
there are mounting indications that congress will approve no 
general tax increase this year but lawmakers of both parties 
already are talking of the need for higher taxes a year from now 
long and ekelund concluded that the excise burden on rural 
families is 49 percent higher on gasoline 41 percent higher on 
tobacco products and 21 percent higher on utilities fuels and 
public services 
rural americans pay 7 percent less of their income on alcoholic 
beverages than do others but that difference would likely be 
reversed when weighted for beer consumption they wrote 
using the governments consumer expenditure survey for 1984 as a 
basis the economists found for example that a rural family with 
income between 10000 and 20000 paid 402 in federal excises 
while the urban family paid 335 at 20000 to 30000 income 
rural families outspent urban families 461 to 429 rural families 
between 30000 and 40000 were taxed for 523 compared with 486 
for urban families 
the study assumes families living outside an area with 2500 
population or more are rural that covers about 40 million 
americans

congress is slowly being drawn into a custody 
battle so bitter that a prominent plastic surgeon has been in jail 
for almost two years on contempt charges after refusing to turn 
over her child for a courtordered visit with dad 
every time i read about this case i see everyone wash his 
hands of it rep frank wolf rva said tuesday in urging 
passage of legislation that would free dr elizabeth morgan from 
her district of columbia jail cell 
if we dont act now who will this has been stalemated for 21 
months wolf told a house subcommittee with jurisdiction over the 
nations capital 
today in the latest round of legal arguments in the 3yearold 
case a city appeals court was urged to overturn a lowercourt 
judges ruling that has kept the physician incarcerated since 
august 1987 
dr morgan is confined unconstitutionally because her 
incarceration will not serve a coercive function morgans 
attorney stephen sachs told a threejudge district of columbia 
court of appeals panel there is no substantive likelihood that 
she will relent and reveal her daughters location not today 
not tomorrow not ever 
morgan accuses her former husband oral surgeon eric foretich 
of sexually abusing their 6yearold daughter hilary morgan was 
jailed on contempt charges for refusing to disclose where she hid 
the girl rather than allow her near her father 
foretich vigorously denies ever molesting his daughter 
in an attempt to break the legal deadlock he offered during an 
interview outside the committee hearing room tuesday to submit to 
interviews with social workers and psychiatrists who would 
determine whether he was fit to be with hilary 
congressional involvement and foretichs renewed effort at 
compromise are only the latest twists in the protracted dispute 
over the child 
normally the 11member house district of columbia committee 
concerns itself with the citys schools budget and police 
department much like a city council in many american cities 
but in this case wolf is trying to propel the panel and the 
entire congress into what amounts to a private quarrel between 
parents 
wolfs bill seeks to limit imprisonment for civil contempt 
charges to 18 months after that the district would be required to 
either file criminal contempt charges against a person in morgans 
position thus guaranteeing a trial or dismiss the case 
the bill would be made retroactive for 18 months so as to apply 
to morgan 
similar laws limiting civil contempt jailings are in effect in 
wisconsin and california 
in this case coercion has clearly proven to be ineffective 
rep stan parris rva said at the hearing at what point do we 
realize that this lady is really serious about this dc 
superior court judge herbert dixon has said hes continuing to 
imprison the woman in an effort to coerce her into revealing her 
daughters whereabouts 
the city council has no authority over the citys court system 
however council member james nathanson told the house panel he 
opposed setting a time limit for contempt jailings 
if you put a cap on the courts authority some people will 
decide theyre willing to pay that price nathanson said i 
think that a court would be rendered less effective 
nathanson suggested instead establishing a threejudge panel to 
review all civil contempt cases extending past 12 months under 
nathansons plan the panel which would include the judge who 
initially jailed the person would have to unanimously favor 
continued incarceration to keep the person in prison 
foretich blasted wolfs bill saying it offered no guarantees 
that hilary would be produced even if morgan were freed 
hilary is the one we should be concerned with foretich 
said i have great concerns about her safety

here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers 
throughout the nation 
may 19 
medford ore mail tribune on personal savings 
benjamin franklin tapped the mood of the nation many years ago 
when he coined the phrase a penny saved is a penny earned 
in those days americans worked hard saved their money for 
rainy days and invested carefully in their futures 
today franklin might use a more pessimistic phrase to sum up 
the nations mood something like never put off until tomorrow 
something you can buy today 
the personal us savings rate for the past four years has run 
under 5 percent annually by comparison the annual rate for japan 
is 168 percent and west germanys rate is 123 percent 
americans in the 1980s have indeed been living beyond their 
means both as individuals and as a nation 
economists look for the freespending baby boom generation 
born immediately after world war ii to become increasingly thrifty 
in the years ahead thats because the early boomers are entering 
their 40s now and starting to think about growing older and about 
retirement which should mean they will soon be saving more of what 
they make than is currently the case

the record hackensack nj on bushs anticrime proposal 
president bush said his administration is considering whether to 
make permanent the temporary ban he announced on imported assault 
weaons 
more significantly he rejected advice from his drug czar 
william bennett to also ban similar weapons that are domestically 
produced and account for about 75 percent of the 
semiautomatic assault rifles available in the united states 
many sportsmen are perfectly capable of enjoying a day in 
the woods without a weapon equipped with a 20round clip a flash 
suppressor allowing them to shoot unseen at night a pistol grip 
allowing a gunman to spray bullets from the hip and other features 
associated with semiautomatics 
bush could have barred such features which are necessary only 
for soldiers without in any way restricting the legitimate 
semiautomatic weapons that have been used by generations of 
sportsmen 
bush could also have proposed a uniform national waiting period 
on firearms purchases to allow the buyers background to be 
checked for criminal violations that would have been leadership 
instead bush compromised he offered a little to those pressing 
for stricter controls on assault weapons and a lot to the powerful 
lobbyist of the nra national rifle association

the commerical dispatch columbus miss on panama 
despite its reputation as a toothless talking shop the 
organization of american states has started a process that with 
luck should lead to the departure of panamas drugtrafficking 
dictator manuel antonio noriega 
at its first emergency session since 1982 the 32member 
hemispheric body condemned noriega by name for grave abuses and 
called for a transfer of power in keeping with the will of the 
panamanian people 
with its strong tradition of nonintervention that was as 
close as the oas could come to demanding that noriega step down 
optimists will note that the last time the oas voted that a 
dictator had to go in june 1979 anastasio somoza was out of 
nicaragua within months but noriega may be a harder case 
by the time the oas acted somoza faced a civil war he had lost 
outside sources of arms while the rebels were getting weapons from 
venezuela and panama among others 
by contrast no armed opposition exists in panama noriega is so 
brutally ruthless that even peaceful protest can be lethal a case 
in point is his unleashing of thugs wielding iron bars to savagely 
beat the winning candidates of the may 7 presidential election

baraboo wis newsrepublic on panama 
the time has long since passed for america to apply pressure on 
her allies to support us efforts to have the democratic elections 
in panama recognized by the panamanian military 
with more than half the worlds oil flowing through the panama 
canal all countries should be taking an active role in supporting 
the true winners of the election 
former president reagans botched attempts to have gen manuel 
noriega removed from power prove that pressure from the us alone 
is not enough to produce the desired results 
intervention in the internal politics of another nation is 
generally not a policy to be encouraged 
however considering the strongarm tactics of the noriega 
forces and the importance of the canal to the western hemisphere 
some sort of intervention must be considered 
if noriega refuses to recognize the true winners of the may 7 
election despite international pressure then it is time for the 
us to seriously consider not honoring the contract it signed 
under the carter administration to return the canal to panamanian 
ownership

the flint mich journal on the demonstrations for democracy 
at a time of unprecedented voter apathy in the united states 
the astonishing events unfolding in the streets of china the 
soviet union and elsewhere around the globe serve to remind us of 
just how precious our democracy is 
it is ironic as president bush said sunday that while an 
ideological earthquake is shaking asunder the very foundation of 
communist societies the west is being tested by complacency 
with depressing regularity in this country too many public 
offices go uncontested too many citizens are ignorant of issues 
too few voters show up at the polls too few know their 
representatives in contrast in the soviet union today tens of 
thousands of citizens are demanding a truly democratic legislature 
and while many in this country ignore news reports because the 
news is depressing and while some try to discredit the media 
informationhungry citizens in china and other less fortunate 
countries are demanding a free press 
communist students and workers young and old are risking their 
lives for the tremendous freedoms so many of us have come to take 
for granted 
they are demanding democracy they are telling the world it is a 
principle a system a philosophy worth fighting for worth dying 
for it is something that americans and other western nations have 
known and appreciated for 200 years 
but who would have guessed a decade ago that democracy would 
start spreading like wildfire to the communist strongholds of china 
and the soviet union 
if the seemingly unstoppable trend continues as it appears it 
will the implications for a startlingly different and better 
world are tremendous 
we would do well to remember that a strong vibrant democracy 
the kind of democracy that enhances human dignity cannot coexist 
for very long with apathy complacency or carelessness 
as the brave chinese students are reminding us democracy 
requires courage a wellinformed citizenry and the participation 
of a determined freedomloving people

walla walla wash unionbulletin on prison censorship 
prison officials must have the authority to keep order in penal 
institutions 
but the us supreme court went too far last week when it 
overturned a federal appeals court ruling that limited authority of 
prison officials to censor reading material of inmates the court 
by a 63 vote ruled that wardens can ban any publication at 
federal prisons they believe is detrimental to the security good 
order or discipline of the institution or might facilitate 
criminal activity 
the justices said the officials do not have the burden of 
proving any of the publications threaten security order or 
rehabilitation in prison this it seems is the point at which the 
court went too far 
the courts ruling means that a warden could stop the flow of 
all reading materials to inmates at a prison without a reason it 
seems that inmates should be encouraged to read to better 
themselves while serving their sentences 
giving such ultimate authority to prison officials is inviting 
an abuse of power prison officials if they can offer legitimate 
reasons for banning material should have the privilege 
is it too much to ask that sound reasons for censorship be 
offered what are prison officials afraid of

daily news los angeles on the catastrophic illness plan for 
the elderly 
woe to the elected representative who listens to the pros but 
not the people thats what quite a few members of congress 
apparently did last year when they passed a law setting up a new 
plan for insuring the elderly against catastrophic illness 
now across the country thousands of aarp american 
association of retired persons members are fighting mad at their 
national leadership for supporting a requirement in the 1988 law 
that all medicare part a recipients those covered for inpatient 
hospital care and other services purchase catastrophiccare 
coverage from the government 
glossed over during last years healthinsurance debate was that 
virtually all federal retirees and most privatesector retirees 
already have some form of private catastrophic coverage 
now aarp members are particularly upset at being forced to pay 
a wealthbased tax surcharge of up to 800 next year for the 
longterm coverage on top of premiums of 38280 a year 
many members argue the legislation is also faulty because it 
does not provide coverage for critical needs such as nursing home 
stays a benefit that many elderly people and their families 
need most 
it was a classic case of lawmakers lazily accepting the sales 
pitches of sixfigure washington lobbyists and highprofile 
spokesmen as gospel 
perhaps if congress and others had done a little more of the 
oldfashioned kind of research listening to their constituents 
it wouldnt be looking to revise or repeal the catastrophic care 
law just a few months after it took effect

the news and courier charleston sc on oas and noriega 
rarely has the organization of american states been able to 
muster the votes or summon the courage to condemn a latin american 
dictator 
usually it weasels out of taking a stand by arguing that it 
must not interfere in the affairs of member nations it is almost 
unprecedented for a dictator to be condemned by name 
the value of the oas resolution is the message that it sends to 
panama it is a convincing counter to gen manuel antonia 
noriegas claim that all the charges made against him are part of 
us plot to oust him and annul the panama canal treaties 
although gen noriega will insist that the oas resolution was 
dictated by washington officers of the panamanian defense forces 
who perhaps alone hold the key to his ouster will have their 
loyalty better said the depth of their complicity in corruption 
put to the test 
the next step is the visit of an oas delegation formed by the 
foreign ministers of ecuador guatemala and trinidad and tobago 
which has been charged with working out an agreement through 
democratic mechanisms to bring about a transfer of power in the 
shortest possible time the delegation must report back by june 
5 then the oas must bite the nail 
if gen noriega thumbs his nose at the 19 latin american 
nations as he has at the united states then the oas must act we 
will see then whether this much despised organization has the 
courage as well as the votes to rid panama of a despicable dictator 
and an evil man

watertown sd public opinion on adding reagans likeness on 
rushmore every now and then somebody comes along with a screwball 
idea that is so preposterous so outrageous that it takes on a 
life of its own 
such a situation we suspect is what is developing around an 
idea submitted for your consideration by one r emmett tyrrell jr 
tyrrells idea is to add a likeness of ronald reagan on mount 
rushmore 
tyrrell is editorinchief of american spectator magazine a 
monthly conservative review 
now there may be some merit to tyrrells desire to honor reagan 
in some grand way 
but we see one tiny little problem with his proposal what 
happens if liberals come back to power what happens if the 
country in the grips of a liberal revival wants to honor some 
recently retired chief executive by sandblasting reagans face off 
the mountain and replacing it with a liberal 
we have a better idea why not pick an existing national 
treasure that doesnt have a face of its own why not make a 
giant bust of reagan and hoist it atop the washington monument 
and besides if the liberals come back to power it wouldnt 
cost much money or take much time to replace the reagan likeness 
with another

a federal judge today declared 
unconstitutional the district of columbias curfew law for 
juveniles designed to reduce drugrelated violence in the nations 
capital 
us district judge charles richey said the law subjects the 
districts juveniles to virtual house arrest each night and is 
a bull in a china shop of constitutional values 
he said the law fails to differentiate among those juveniles 
likely to embroil themselves in mischief or among those activities 
most likely to produce harm 
just as mere punishment will never cure the drug addict so 
mere martial tactics will never wean the district from its 
addiction to violence and illegal trafficking in drugs richey 
declared in a 35page opinion 
the curfew statute would make it illegal for people below age 18 
to be on streets in the city from 11 pm to 6 am with 
exceptions for teenagers returning home from work and those 
traveling with parents there would be exceptions for youths 
returning home from school and churchsanctioned functions 
richey said the law would unconstitutionally burden the 
first and fifth amendment due process rights of thousands of 
innocent juveniles 
however laudable the objectives which motivated its adoption 
the act is invalid on its face and may not be enforced he said

a candidate in the presidential 
election said he told of massive fraud by both pro and 
antigovernment parties today during a meeting with a delegation 
from the organization of american states 
the panamanian government presented its case against the united 
states during a meeting tuesday with the oas delegation sent in 
the wake of the nullified election 
the panamanian government took the opportunity to present a 
series of documents and actions that contributed to invalidate the 
elections of 1989 presidential spokesman jose hernandez said 
an oas source who refused to be named said the meeting was 
difficult but he did not go into detail 
sources said the delegation was attempting to arrange a meeting 
with gen manuel antonio noriega the defense forces chief and de 
facto ruler of panama 
members of the oas delegation said they had come to facilitate a 
search for solutions to panamas political troubles 
opposition presidential candidate guillermo endara and his two 
vice presidential candidates were scheduled to meet with the oas 
delegation they contend they won the may 7 vote by about 3to1 
over noriegas handpicked candidate 
the government however nullified the vote and blamed 
opposition fraud and us interference in the election 
the oas group met this morning with hildebrando nicosia the 
authentic panamanian partys presidential candidate he received 
only a small percentage of the vote 
nicosia said he described massive fraud committed by both 
sides he added people are tired of instransigence on both 
sides the solution is for negotiations without prior conditions 
the oas approved a resolution last week criticizing noriega and 
calling for a transfer of power in the shortest possible time 
it sent a delegation consisting of the foreign ministers of 
ecuador guatemala and trinidad and tobago as well as oas 
secretarygeneral joao baena soares 
acting president manuel solis palmas government said it hoped 
the mission would establish the truth of the crisis as a conflict 
between panama and the united states and it cited us sanctions 
as proof of malice 
the government has proclaimed it will accept no interference in 
internal panamanian affairs and said some aspects of the oas 
resolution violate the oas charter 
panama expounded its points of view about the events that 
began 24 months ago said hernandez in a statement after solis 
palma and members of his cabinet met with the oas delegation 
the first street demonstrations against noriegas rule began in 
june of 1987 since then noriega has been indicted on us drug 
charges charges he says are part of a us plot to renege on its 
commitment to give up the panama canal at the end of 1999 
members of the oas delegation made no comment on the meeting 
except for ecuadorean foreign minister diego cordovez who said 
only we have formed no impression 
at the airport after arriving tuesday cordovez had said the 
idea was to assist panamanians in finding their own solutions and 
to convey latin american concern about the situation 
meanwhile us troops staged an amphibious landing exercise and 
us officials said armed convoys of troops were being dispatched 
over panamanian roads with instructions not to stop 
several times in the past panamanian police have stopped us 
convoys which they have no right to do us officials said

chinas student uprising has brought to the 
surface a longconcealed but intense rivalry for power between zhao 
ziyang general secretary of the communist party and premier li 
peng 
in simple terms zhao is the advocate of rapid economic reforms 
a liberal whose sympathies lie with the prodemocracy students li 
is the economic conservative who prefers the status quo to risky 
changes and who ordered martial law rather than give in to student 
demands 
but in chinese politics such categorizing can be dangerous and 
factional rivalries often cross ideological lines 
all meetings of the 17member politburo the communist partys 
top decisionmaking body and its core group the fiveman standing 
committee are conducted in secret and it is impossible to 
determine how the sides are dividing up in the current showdown 
here however are a few of the main players 
deng xiaoping deng 84 has given up his politburo post and 
now heads only the central military commission but he remains the 
most powerful man in china deng has won international respect for 
achieving spectacular economic progress in china with his 
marketoriented reforms but politically he is an oldtime 
revolutionary with little tolerance for dissent 
deng is believed to be behind lis decision to crack down on the 
students and appears to have come out strongly against zhao his 
longtime protege it wouldnt be the first time deng turned on the 
man in line to succeed him two years ago deng forced the 
resignation of party chief hu yaobang another relative liberal 
for failing to subdue student demonstrations it was hus death 
that sparked the current unrest 
yang shangkun chinas head of state or president is an 
octogenarian military man who has been put in the reformist camp 
because of his close association to deng however it was yang who 
announced that troops would be brought into beijing and he appears 
to be firmly behind li 
wan li the head of the national peoples congress is another 
solid proponent of reform but he has long come out secondbest to 
fellow reformer zhao and wont necessarily throw his full weight 
behind zhao wan may be waiting to move into the void if both zhao 
and li fall 
hu qili hu a member of the standing committee in charge of 
party propaganda also is regarded as having reformist sentiments 
but he has a reputation of drifting with the political wind and 
could throw his support to either side 
yao yilin a standing committee member vice premier and 
economic expert yao is in the conservative camp 
qiao shi if the standing committee splits between the two 
progressives zhao and hu and the two conservatives li and yao qiao 
could be the swing vote qiao who has a history of work in 
security matters has rarely made his political views known 
another uncertainty is how much influence senior leaders outside 
the politburo will have in deciding chinas political future 
although many aging ideological hardliners have relinquished 
their official posts some continue to have considerable power 
because of the personal loyalties they command among them are chen 
yun and bo yibo chairman and vice chairman of the central advisory 
commission a halfway station for elderly leaders on their way to 
retirement 
if they demand a voice in resolving the political fight zhao 
could be in trouble

syria sent warplanes over christianheld 
mountains on a reconnaissance mission wednesday and its gunners 
shelled ports north of beirut to keep christian military forces 
from bringing in supplies 
the 11weekold artillery war between christian army units and 
an alliance of syrians and druse militiamen has killed at least 359 
people wounded nearly 1400 and become a leading agenda item at 
the arab league summit in morocco 
a police spokesman said two mig17 jet fighters flew at medium 
altitude over the mountainous southern flank of the 310square mile 
christian enclave then headed east toward the syriancontrolled 
bekaa valley 
they didnt attack and the army didnt open fire at them 
said the spokesman who cannot be identified under standing rules 
it was the third such flight in a week he said with the 
apparent purpose of photographing positions of gen michel aouns 
christian forces around souk elgharb a resort town southeast of 
beirut 
earlier in the day aouns men exchanged machine gun fire with 
the syrians and druse in the area souk elgharb commands a network 
of roads leading to the christian enclave and the generals 
headquarters in the presidential palace at baabda 
syrians fired 130mm shells from moslem west beirut spradically 
throughout the day that landed between the christian ports of 
jounieh and byblos without causing casualties the police spokesman 
said 
he described the military activity as part of the daily 
routine that has been dominating the confrontation since may 11 
when the arab league called a truce in an attempt to end the 
battles 
if the summit comes up with resolutions accepted by the 
general and the syrians then the ceasefire will be consolidated 
and we will have a lasting truce the spokesman said if the 
summits resolution on lebanon is rejected by either side then 
well have another round of violence 
the truce was declared by an arab league committee that has been 
trying to end the current fighting and find a solution to lebanons 
14yearold civil war 
lebanons seat at the summit is vacant because other arab 
nations have not recognized either of the rival governments that 
resulted from a political crisis last september aouns and a 
moslem cabinet led by premier salim hoss 
aoun has said his goal is to drive the syrians from lebanon and 
he wants the summit to adopt a supporting resolution 
syria has 40000 soldiers in lebanon under an arab league 
peacekeeping mandate issued in 1976 and has become the main power 
broker during the long civil war 
the latest fighting began march 8 two days after blockading 
illegal ports operated by moslem militias which deprive the 
government of about 100 million in duties every year 
walid jumblatts druse militiamen started shooting in response 
and syrian forces soon joined them

on one wall a large israeli star of david emblem had been 
painted with a swastika inside 
four arabs were freed after questioning and the rest taken away 
in a bus none showed signs of beatings and soldiers said they did 
not use night sticks because the detainees did not resist arrest

three hours with about 300 palestinians after soldiers raided his

nearly one american household in three has 
money left after paying taxes and normal household expenditures 
the census bureau reported wednesday 
this discretionary income was reported for 289 percent of 
all households as of march 1987 the agency said thats slightly 
better than the 283 percent of households reporting discretionary 
income four years earlier 
and those households with discretionary income also had more 
money left in 1987 than in 1983 with the spending money rising 
from 11032 to 12332 over that period 
the report a marketers guide to discretionary income was 
prepared by the census bureau and the conference board a 
nonprofit business information service in new york 
the report is compiled primarily for sales and marketing 
officials interested in how consumers spend money 
the increase in the number of households with discretionary 
income and the level of that income means that the amount 
americans had in hand for spending beyond basic needs rose from 
262 billion in 1983 to 319 billion in 1987 according to the 
report 
this change reflects the improved economic conditions the 
report said noting that an economic recession was under way in the 
early years of the 1980s 
in addition the report said the increasing number of working 
wives added to the discretionary income available for many 
households 
education makes a significant difference the report said with 
596 percent of families headed by someone with at least five years 
of college having excess income 
by comparison 245 percent of households headed by a high 
school graduate had discretionary income and the rate was only 
113 percent for those headed by someone who had not finished high 
school 
by age households headed by someone 55 to 59 were most likely 
to have discretionary funds at 35 percent close were those aged 
35 to 39 at 33 percent the least likely to have extra money were 
households headed by someone aged 15 to 24 at 187 percent 
likelihood of having discretionary income varied slightly by 
household size ranging from 309 percent of twoperson households 
to 264 percent of those with six or more people 
as might be expected the higher the household income the more 
likely there was to be some leftover money 
among households with incomes under 15000 only 07 percent 
had any discretionary income the share with excess money climbed 
to 215 percent in the 25000 to 29999 income bracket 
households with incomes of 75000 and more all reported having 
discretionary income 
the report was based on the current population survey which 
covers about 60000 households across the country aftertax income 
was calculated and then compared to a series of household budgets 
for various family sizes that had been calculated by the labor 
department that comparison was used to determine the share of 
households with money left after covering their basic needs

arcs on a manicured lawn jay is one of 7862 soldiers buried 
there near the spot where he fell on may 28 1944 
they represent about 35 percent of those killed in sicily and 
the advance on rome said joseph bevilacqua a retired soldier 
and vietnam veteran who became the cemeterys superintendent two 
months ago 
the bodies ofmost of those killed in the invasion at anzio and 
nettuno were returned to the united states at the request of next 
of kin the names of 3094 others still missing or buried at sea 
are carved in the white carrara marble walls of a memorial at the 
end of a long grassy mall 
bush will lay a wreath but officials say his brief memorial day 
weekend remarks will focus on nato not the war 
still bevilacqua says the visit is an honor a way to 
acknowledge so many like jay whose sacrifice is remembered usually 
only by friends or family 
some families paid a higher price there are 21 pairs of 
brothers buried at nettuno most of them side by side two cpl 
preston kaspervick and 2nd lt william kaspervick of quincy ill 
died 10 days apart in january 1944 
bush is coming to italy on his way to the nato summit in 
brussels which marks the alliances 40th anniversary during his 
european swing he also will meet with pope john paul ii and 
political leaders in belgium britain west germany and italy 
his most public appearance in italy will be the stop at the 
77acre military cemetery near where allied troops waded ashore at 
2 am on jan 22 1944 
allied commanders hoped the bold stroke would relieve the fierce 
stalemate at cassino to the south and hasten the fall of rome 45 
miles to the north 
the battlehardened british 1st and american 3rd the first 
divisions ashore expected heavy resistance but were almost 
unopposed the astonished allies had caught the germans by surprise 
it was so easy american troops are standing with their 
mouths open and shaking their heads in utter amazement 
associated press correspondent don whitehead wrote at the time 
but while the allies secured the beachhead crack german 
divisions fortified the heights beyond the shore the bold stroke 
was lost in a nightmare of rain wind mud blood and high 
explosive there were 3000 american casualties in january 
a german counterattack pushed the allies toward the sea then it 
became a static war three months of withering artillery barrages 
in the soldiers black humor it was simply called the sitzkrieg 
the breakout finally came in may on june 4 after 123 days of 
fighting the allies entered rome 
the cemetery lies along the 3rd divisions path up from the 
beach bevilacqua said it opened as a temporary cemetery two days 
after the landings 
there were germans and britons as well as americans buried 
here at first he said it was in the middle of the fighting 
today the only reminder of the fighting is rows of latin crosses 
and stars of david pink longstem chrysantemums lie near some 
headstones 
they are left by italians said bevilacqua sometimes they 
just like the name or maybe remember a name many of them were 
befriended by americans who landed here 
many buried in nettuno died heroically two men sgt sylvester 
antolak of st clairsville ohio and 1st lt robert t waugh of 
ashton ri received the congressional medal of honor the 
nations highest award for gallantry 
others died anonymously there are 490 unknowns buried in 488 
graves scattered throughout the cemetery one is next to jay

forcing a son to call his mother and visit her is 
no business of the courts a judge ruled 
the ruling tuesday grew out of a dispute between richard 
rosenbaum and his mother jean a retired teacher the son who is 
in his early 40s filed a lawsuit seeking an injunction to stop her 
from calling him and his wife 
judge thomas j obrien issued the injunction in 1985 but 
ordered the son to telephone his mother at least once every three 
months and meet with her once a year 
the judge later dropped those requirements but did order the 
son to keep his mother informed of where he lives mrs rosenbaum 
appealed the ruling 
state appeals court justice anthony scariano sided with the son 
this is a sad and unfortunate situation he said however 
it takes more than a mere secular tribunal to command filial 
devotion

the tractortrailer belches black smoke 
as it rumbles up a mountainous pass leaving behind a gritty 
landscape obscured by gray haze the los angeles basin at high noon 
theres a good one says california highway patrol officer 
greg dettinger and the smog patrol is off and chasing yet another 
18wheeled contributor to southern californias choking smog 
in southern california the chp smokeys are living up to 
their nickname by pulling over the puffing tailpipes as well as the 
speeders 
we pull people over on the freeway and other people will go by 
and blow their horns and give the thumbs up said sgt george 
johnson who is in charge of the patrols 
as dettinger was writing a citation trucker thomas schwartz 
conceded something has to be done theres no doubt about it 
southern californias skies are the most polluted in the nation 
a result of surrounding mountains that trap the filth along with 
stagnant weather and industries that operate in the area 
the agency responsible for reducing the pollution the south 
coast air quality management district took part of its cleanup 
effort last yearto the streets by dispatching highway patrol 
officers to stop polluting vehicles and issue orders to clean up or 
pay up 
drivers can join the crackdown by calling a hotline to report 
the license numbers of smoking vehicles the culprits are sent 
stern letters and must provide proof the problem is fixed 
the air quality district has found people are eager to help 
clean up the air by reporting others more than 7200 people phoned 
the smog hotline to report smoking cars in march said spokesman 
bill kelly 
the districts territory extends over 13600 square miles from 
the pacific ocean to palm springs 110 miles east of los angeles 
then north to the ventura county line and south to where orange 
county meets san diego county 
an estimated 11 million people live in the district which 
encompasses los angeles orange and riverside counties and 
nondesert areas of the vast san bernardino county in los angeles 
county alone there are 54 million licensed drivers 
all that exhaust contributed to ozone levels that exceeded 
federal health standards 176 days in 1988 
southern californias air is so fouled that in march the agency 
proposed a drastic change in driving habits under the plan 40 
percent of noncommerical and 70 percent of vehicles would be 
required by 1998 to run on methanol fuel cells or electricity 
rather than on gasoline 
unlike the highlevel ozone layer which filters the suns 
harmful ultraviolet radiation lowlevel ozone is dangerous 
the paleblue gas formed by a chemical reaction involving 
nitrogen dioxide and hydrocarbons is one of the principal 
components of smog 
vehicle exhaust is believed to cause up to 8 percent of lung 
cancer in nonsmoking urban residents research has shown ozone 
aggravates respiratory ailments in children the elderly and people 
suffering from heart and lung diseases it eats away at tires and 
nylon damages crops and has damaged the lungs of animals used in 
experiments 
since july when the program became full time eight officers 
driving cars marked with the wingeddove logo of the air quality 
district have written more than 8000 citations to smoking 
vehicles mostly diesel trucks 
jim crape a state engineer who works in chino carries a tape 
recorder to take down license numbers of polluting vehicles 
i turned in about 120 already he said we cant let it 
keep going because what is it going to be like when the population 
doubles triples what are we going to wear gas masks

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev has 
agreed to impose ceilings on soviet forces stationed in east 
european countries us officials said today 
in a parallel move the officials said gorbachev suggested that 
no country including the soviet union and the united states be 
allowed to have more than 35 percent to 40 percent of the combined 
manpower totals of nato and the warsaw pact 
this would have the effect of diluting the forces of the soviet 
union in eastern europe and overall as well 
the proposals were the latest in a series of arms control 
initiatives by gorbachev and president bush welcomed them today 
the soviets are now being forthcoming and we hope to achieve 
the reductions that we seek bush said in a commencement speech 
at the us coast guard academy in new london conn 
but he added these reductions alone even if implemented are 
not enough to eliminate the superiority the soviet union enjoys 
now in europe 
the twin moves by gorbachev were in response to longstanding 
us demands for reducing a large warsaw pact edge over the north 
atlantic treaty organization in nonnuclear strength for instance 
soviet tanks now account for nearly 70 percent of all nato and 
warsaw pact armor 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater sought to play down the 
importance of the latest soviet proposal saying it was a response 
to a plan proposed last march 9 by the united states and its nato 
allies 
but fitzwater said the soviets have provided details in a 
meaningful way at the negotiating table it is a serious proposal 
and we look forward to the negotiations 
and margaret tutwiler the state department spokeswoman said 
we view this as a serious and substantial proposal that is being 
received as such 
gorbachevs overture came less than a week before nato holds a 
summit meeting in brussels attended by bush and the leaders of the 
15 other western governments 
the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
soviets had also offered to reduce warsaw pact tank and armored 
personnel carriers to just above nato levels 
specifically the soviets said they would reduce their tank 
total by 17580 and personnel carriers by about 27000 the 
officials said 
the soviet position was outlined by soviet negotiators in a 
closed meeting tuesday in vienna with us and nato officials it 
was an elaboration of the cuts gorbachev and soviet foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze had told secretary of state james 
a baker iii about two weeks ago in moscow 
in exchange for nato reductions the soviets offered to cut 
warsaw pact tanks by 40000 combat aircraft by 42000 and 
artillery pieces by 47000 nato has somewhat different totals in 
each category 
gorbachev also proposed a reduction of 1 million troops in both 
alliances and a 55 percent cutback in natos combat aircraft 
by 1997 there would be equal levels of 135 million troops in 
nato and the warsaw pact 1500 strike aircraft 20000 tanks 
1700 helicopters 24000 artillery pieces and 28000 combat 
vehicles 
the two alliances opened negotiations in vienna in february with 
the aim of reducing nonnuclear forces across the vast expanse of 
europe from the atlantic ocean in the west to the ural mountains 
in the soviet union 
besides seeking overall warsaw pact reductions the united 
states and its allies for years have tried to persuade the soviets 
to impose limits both on the forces they keep in czechoslovakia 
east germany poland and hungary and ceilings on each of the 
allies troops these include bulgaria and romania which are also 
members of the warsaw pact

forced to step down for firing his gun inside city limits 
he spot hudson said he was called last week to get a 
groundhog out of a garage the resident in trapping the animal 
had injured it so hudson shot it and gave it to the town of dunbar 
for its wild animal dinner 
i was an officer of the law i had a right to hudson said 
mayor richie robb didnt think so and asked hudson to step down 
after nine years as dog catcher 
it is illegal for citizens to do that i think it was the 
improper thing to do even if he was an officer of the law robb 
said 
hudson usually set aside wild animals for dunbar mayor frank 
leone who holds a free critter dinner each february for senior 
citizens 
if you get young groundhog its excellent eating leone

here is a transcript of president 
bushs commencement address wednesday at the coast guard academy 
i want to congratulate each member of this years class on 
receiving your commission into such a proud service 
you mention the coast guard and most people think about lives 
saved at sea daring rescue operations 
but those daily acts of heroism are just one part of the vital 
work that this coast guard performs 
right now in prince william sound the coast guard continues to 
work around the clock in a major environmental cleanup 
and let me at this point on behalf of a grateful nation 
commend admiral yost through his personal commitment his 
involvement and the leadership that he has shown 
he has served his country in the finest tradition of the united 
states coast guard 
and those of us who care about the environment and that is 250 
million americans at a minimum hes showing us the way and your 
service backing him up in every way 
and i am very proud of what paul yost has done applause 
right now off the florida coast coast guard patrols are 
chasing down drug smugglers helping to keep the drugs off the 
streets 
and that may be all in a days work for the coast guard but it 
is absolutely vital to our national health our wellbeing and our 
security 
im sure on that long first day of swab summer that you never 
thought four years could pass so quickly 
but they have and youve worked hard 
billet night has come and gone and youre ready semper 
paratus in the words of your motto ready to enter the coast 
guards service to enter the world 
and the truth is thats what commencement is all about 
the world is yours 
and todays ceremony is really part of the change of command 
from one generation to the next 
today our world your world is changing east and west 
and today i want to speak to you about the world we want to see 
and what we can do to bring that new world into clear focus 
we live in a time when we are witnessing the end of an idea the 
final chapter of the communist experiment 
communism is now recognized even by many within the communist 
world itself as a failed system one that promised economic 
prosperity but failed to deliver the goods a system that built a 
wall between the people and their political aspirations 
but the eclipse of communism is only onehalf of the story of 
our time 
the other is the ascendancy of the democratic idea 
never before has the idea of freedom so captured the 
imaginations of men and women the world over 
and never before has the hope of freedom beckoned so many trade 
unionists in warsaw the people of panama rulers consulting the 
ruled in the soviet union 
and even as we speak today the world is transfixed by the 
dramatic events in tiananmen square 
everywhere those voices are speaking the language of democracy 
and freedom and we hear them and the world hears them 
and america will do all it can to encourage them

the president of iran led one of many 
prayer sessions held around the country wednesday to give thanks 
for the successful surgery on ayatollah ruhollah khomeini tehran 
radio reported 
president ali khamenei and others said the operation to stop 
bleeding in the iranian leaders digestive tract was a complete 
success and the 89yearold revolutionary patriarch is in good 
condition a day after the operation 
god willing we will see the imam for long years healthier 
and stronger at the helm of the islamic republic parliament 
speaker hashemi rafsanjani said after visiting khomeini 
doctors who performed the operation said khomeinis heart 
kidneys respiration blood pressure and pulse all were normal 
said tehran radio monitored in nicosia 
rafsanjani was received by khomeini along with close friends and 
relatives in his hospital room wednesday morning the radio said 
he was in bed and the doctors were around him his health was 
very good rafsanjani was quoted as saying he was very 
cheerful i asked him if he had any pain and he replied that we 
has very little and that he is comfortable he is feeling very 
well 
his previously unreported illness highlighted the question of 
who will govern iran after he dies 
khomeini ousted his designated successor ayatollah hussein ali 
montazeri on march 28 for criticizing his policies and appointed a 
20man committee of leading political clerical and legal figures 
to settle the leadership question 
iran has been in political turmoil since last augusts 
ceasefire in the eightyear gulf war with factions battling 
openly for supremacy in a postkhomeini era 
indications are that with no single figure combining khomeinis 
spiritual and political authority iran will have a collective 
leadership after he dies 
rafsanjani and khomeinis son ahmad are prime candidates 
other possibilities include ayatollah ali meshkini radical 
chairman of the 83member assembly of experts which normally rules 
on constitutional matters ahmad jannati a leading member of the 
13man council of guardians that rules on the islamic correctness 
of legislation and chief justice ayatollah musavi ardebili

many scientists at a workshop set up to 
investigate cold fusion say they will keep looking for evidence of 
the process but nearly all of them say they have seen no sign yet 
it exists 
the workshop on the claims of university of utah chemist stanley 
pons and his british colleague martin fleischmann has brought 
together an estimated 500 physicists and chemists with a wide 
variety of theories 
pons and fleischmann startled the scientific world with the 
announcement two months ago that they had achieved cold fusion in a 
simple experiment using a palladium electrode and water made with 
deuterium a heavy isotope of hydrogen 
the conventional belief was that fusion as an energy source 
could be attained only at high temperatures and by applying high 
power 
the announcement has been the subjects of several conferences 
around the country including the threeday workshop here the 
workshop sponsored by los alamos national laboratory concludes 
thursday 
there seems to be an intense scientific interest in the 
possibility that a nuclear reaction takes place in a sofar 
unanticipated site said norman hackerman retired professor of 
chemistry at rice and texas universities 
pons and fleischmann ignored the opportunity to attend the 
workshop and defend their claims they also canceled a meeting with 
utah officials who want to give them 5 million for their research 
the observations at the conference included many like those of 
physicist nathan lewis of the california institute of technology 
he flatly rejected the ponsfleischmann assertions 
hopeful commentary came from texas aampm university chemist john 
appleby he suggested that fusion has sometimes occurred in his 
teams experiment 
appleby declined to say in an interview that fusion occurred in 
the ponsfleischmann experiments if it is fusion he said it is 
not occurring in the usual way 
fusion is a process in which light atoms combine to form heavier 
elements releasing energy 
applebys encouraging findings included the discovery of large 
amounts of tritium in the heavy water solution along with a small 
number of neutrons tritium can be a product of fusion 
he also described different heat measurements using different 
solutions such as a lithiumbased bath and a sodium solution that 
shut down all reactions 
we dont know whats going on but it is not chemistry 
appleby said theres a lot of confusion rather than fusion 
going on 
petar tomas a physicist with the ruder boskovic institute in 
yugoslavia said he found the utah claims difficult to believe 
but he proclaimed much of the theoretical physics presented at the 
workshop positive and headed in the right direction

president bush today welcomed new arms 
reduction proposals by soviet president mikhail s gorbachev but 
said they were not enough to redress the edge warsaw pact 
forces maintain over nato in europe 
he also challenged gorbachev to disclose accurate figures on 
soviet military spending open the ledger bush said in a 
commencement address to the coast guard academy 
speaking only a day after the soviet leader offered to impose 
new limits on troops stationed in eastern europe and on soviet 
forces overall bush said the soviets are now being forthcoming 
and we hope to achieve the reductions that we seek 
however he said these reductions alone even if implemented 
are not enough to eliminate the superiority the soviet union enjoys 
now 
bush declared communism a failed system and said the west 
was entering a new era based on economic and political success 
there is an opportunity before us to shape a new world bush 
said 
he took note of the prodemocracy demonstrators who have 
occupied beijings tiananmen square for more than 10 days and said 
the united states will do all it can to encourage those who 
are speaking the language of democracy and freedom 
he wished gorbachev success in attempting to restructure the 
soviet economy and said lasting peace was now more likely than ever 
before 
but bush said it still was necessary to maintain a strong 
nuclear deterrence with a new us longrange mobile missile and 
making other oceanspanning landbased missiles transportable 
we live in a time when we are witnessing the end of an idea 
the final chapter of the communist experiment bush said he 
called communism a failed system one that promised economic 
prosperity but failed to deliver the goods a system that built a 
wall between the people and their political aspirations 
he urged further reductions by the sovietled alliance and 
reiterated his call for territorial overflights on both sides 
bush also played on the theme of open markets in his speech and 
said if we succeed the next decade and the century beyond will 
be an era of unparalleled growth 
bush said success also required an end to conflict and turmoil 
he said the united states and its allies were pursuing a strategy 
of strength economically diplomatically and militarily 
in the soviet union the president said a dramatic process is 
unfolding 
make no mistake our policy is to seize every and i mean 
every opportunity to build a better and more stabile relationship 
with the soviet union 
he said we want to see perestroika economic restructuring 
succeed as well as the policy of openness known as glasnost 
white house aides said bush rejected a prepared text and added 
new sections hours before he was to speak 
a nato session bush is attending in brussels next monday and 
tuesday with the leaders of 15 other western governments is likely 
to be dominated by how to respond to a series of arms control 
initiatives by gorbachev 
in washington us officials said gorbachev had made proposals 
to impose ceilings on soviet forces stationed in eastern europe as 
well as outlining possible reductions in soviet conventional arms 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the latest gorbachev 
proposal represented the first time the soviets had agreed to an 
overall ceiling on conventional forces 
we find this very promising fitzwater said these are 
major major concessions that put them more in line with the nato 
proposal 
national security adviser brent scowcroft said gorbachev had 
given secretary of state james a baker iii a general description 
of the soviet proposal during bakers visit to moscow earlier this 
month but that they were vague now theyve put more meat on it 
scowcroft who accompanied bush to the coast guard academy told 
reporters the soviet proposal looks like a serious proposal and 
we will treat it as a serious proposal we will look at it 
meanwhile bush said in an interview with european journalists 
released today that new soviet proposals for reducing conventional 
forces would be helpful but it would be reckless for nato to lay 
down our weapons and turn them into plowshares 
bush also expressed interest in a possible visit to 
communistruled east germany asked what it would take to get him 
to make such a trip the president said first an invitation 
addressing the coast guard graduates bush said that never 
before has the idea of freedom so captured the imaginations of men 
and women the world over and never before has the hope of freedom 
beckoned so many 
trade unioninsts in warsaw the people of panama rulers 
consulting the ruled in the soviet union and even as we speak 
today the world is transfixed by the dramatic events in tiananmen 
square 
everywhere those voices are speaking the language of democracy 
and freedom and we hear them and the world hears them and 
america will do all it can to encourage them 
in the interview with european journalists he said that the 
massive protests in china and political reform movements in other 
parts of the world show the democratic way is on the march and it 
is not going to be stopped 
still the president cautioned im old enough to remember 
hungary in 1956 and i dont want to be a catalyst for encouraging a 
course of action that would inevitably lead to violence and 
bloodshed 
he said gorbachevs recent offers in reality were no more than 
responses to nato proposals and then its reported as though this 
is an enormous step forwardso we need a little light in all of 
this 
and while giving the soviet leader points for public relations 
bush declared you do not make foreign policy based on the 
personality or charm of an individual in another country you do it 
on facts 
bush indicated in the interview with reporters from news 
organizations from britain west germany italy and belgium that a 
compromise with west germany on shortrange missiles might not be 
possible before the 16nation nato summit that begins on monday 
i have felt that we can resolve this issue before we get to 
brussels im not sure now but well keep working the problem 
bush said 
despite a transatlantic flurry of proposals and counterproposals 
over the past few days there is no agreement on proposed 
superpower talks to reduce shortrange missiles in europe 
west german chancellor helmut kohl has called for such talks 
bush opposes them at least while sovietbloc nations retain an 
advantage in tanks and troops 
bush spoke to reporters from italys il messaggero britains 
the guardian belgiums de standaard and west germanys frankfurter 
allgemeine zeitung

the thousands of youths camped in tiananmen 
square are only the most visible portion of an increasingly 
radicalized student population that is organizing for a longterm 
political struggle 
they plan to keep working for reforms such as a free press and 
an end to widespread official corruption regardless of whether 
communist party reformers win a power struggle with conservatives 
if we get our immediate goals including a dialogue with the 
government we will calm down a bit and be able to study but our 
movement wont be over said chen zhangbao an activist at 
beijing normal university 
on his and other beijing campuses students who did not join or 
who left the 12dayold tiananmen sitin were collecting supplies 
for the students in the square printing leaflets and speading word 
on the streets of their reform movement 
some read announcements and speeches into loudspeaker networks 
that now extend offcampus others kept an eye on the movements of 
troops who were ordered saturday to impose martial law in the city 
center but were blocked on the outskirts by crowds of students and 
supporters 
some students worked shifts on traffic control units around the 
square some made posters 
what the students werent doing was going to class 
were still studying on our own but were pretty busy 
working for the movement said chen a chinese literature major 
who admits he hasnt cracked a book in a while 
chen works in his campus propaganda department of what 
students have come to call simply the movement short for 
the patriotic student democracy movement 
each campus also has a secretariat logistics department and 
reception department for greeting outoftown students coming to 
beijing to join the movement 
one big project has been organizing four teams of about 500 
students each from beijing normal university to take turns sitting 
in the square for 12hour shifts chen said other schools have 
organized similar teams 
we have to ensure that the students get some rest he said 
the government could delay for several weeks in responding to 
student terms for leaving the square the resignation of premier li 
peng an end to martial law and a dialogue with the government on 
reform 
the hall in chens dormitory is piled with food and clothing 
donated by local residents for the protesters in the square the 
sitin began may 13 with a hunger strike by about 2000 students 
grew to include about 70000 students and thousands more 
supporters then shrank over the weekend after the hunger strike 
ended 
the students plan to continue the sitin to dramatize their 
demands but say it is not their only focus 
thousands have volunteered to go to factories and residential 
areas to hand out leaflets and lead political discussions 
we want to reach as broad an audience as possible said 
zhang xiaojun a 25yearold math student who sat at a picnic table 
with a map of the city in front of him signing up students 
beijing university students also have organized propaganda 
teams said activist ma xieli 
when the student movement began april 15 with the death of a 
leading reformer former communist party chief hu yaobang only a 
few student leaders were able to articulate the reasons for their 
dissatisfaction with the government 
but the shared experiences of the past six weeks including 
dramatic confrontations with police and exhiliarating marches 
joined by hundreds of thousands of local residents have 
politicized the student population many say they wont return to 
the relatively drab routine of a chinese college student which 
allows little opportunity for individual initiative 
when we leave the square that doesnt mean we will have 
finished the struggle ma said even if the students succeed in 
forcing a change of government our chief goal isnt for this or 
that person to resign but to speed up the progress of democracy 
regardless of what faction takes power it will seek to 
destroy our movement said chen the party and government have 
to think of their own interests 
democracy and freedom and science cannot be accomplished in 
one or two years he said we can only struggle stage by stage 
i am willing to keep working and i hope the next generation of 
students will too

so today i want to speak about our security strategy for the 
1990s one that advances american ideals and upholds american aims 
amidst the many challenges well face there will be risks 
but let me assure you well find more than our share of 
opportunities 
we and our allies are strong stronger really than at any 
point in postwar period and more capable than ever of supporting 
the cause of freedom 
theres an opportunity before us to shape a new world 
what is it that we want to see 
it is a growing community of democracies anchoring international 
peace and stability and a dynamic free market system generating 
prosperity and progress on a global scale 
the economic foundation of this new era is the proven success of 
the free market and nurturing that foundation are the values 
rooted in freedom and democracy 
our country america was founded on these values and they gave 
us the confidence that flows from strength 
so lets be clear about one thing 
america looks forward to the challenge of an emerging global 
market but these values are not ours alone 
they are now shared by our friends and allies around the globe 
the economic rise of europe and the nations of the pacific rim 
is the growing success of our postwar policy 
this time is a time of tremendous opportunity and destiny is in 
our own hands 
to reach the world we want to see weve got to work and work 
hard 
theres a lot of work ahead of us 
we must resolve international trade problems that threaten to 
pit friends and allies against one another 
we must combat misguided notions of economic nationalism that 
will tell us to close off our economies to foreign competition just 
when the global marketplace has become a fact of life 
we must open the door to the nations of eastern europe and other 
socialist countries that embrace free market reforms 
and finally for developing nations heavily burdened with debt 
we must provide assistance and encourage the market reforms that 
will set those nations on a path towards growth 
if we succeed the next decade and the century beyond will be an 
era of unparalleled growth an era which sees the flourishing of 
freedom peace and prosperity around the world 
but this new era cannot unfold in a climate where conflict and 
turmoil exist and therefore our goals must also include security 
and stability 
security for fully security and stability 
security this text is going crazy on this machine here 
laughter 
security for ourselves and our allies and our friends stability 
in the international arena and in the end to regional conflicts 
such goals are constant but the strategy we employ to reach 
them can and must change as the world changes 
today the need for a dynamic and adaptable strategy is 
imperative 
we must be strong economically diplomatically and as you know 
militarily to take advantage of the opportunities open to us in a 
world of rapid change 
and nowhere will the ultimate consequences of change have more 
significance for world security than within the soviet union itself 
what were seeing now in the soviet union is indeed dramatic 
the process is still ongoing unfinished 
but make no mistake our policy is to seize every and i mean 
every opportunity to build a better more stable relationship 
with the soviet union just as it is our policy to defend american 
interests in light of the enduring reality of soviet military power 
we want to see perestroika succeed and we want to see the 
policies of glasnost and perestroika so far a revolution imposed 
from top down institutionalized within the soviet union

the cold war is over but global security now is 
threatened by the buildup of ballistic missiles in developing 
countries a research institute said wednesday in an annual report 
the international institute for strategic studies also raised 
doubts about whether soviet president mikhail s gorbachev will 
succeed with his reforms or even survive 
while skepticism about gorbachevs sincerity was subsiding 
among western leaders questions about his ability to succeed and 
even to stay in power abound said the report 
open opposition and challenges have been replaced with 
grumbling beneath the surface it said this does not 
necessarily make gorbachevs situation any less dangerous 
institute director francois heisbourg told a news conference 
that 1988 was the year in which the cold war ended 
we move from a highly polarized and very threatening world 
into one which will be much less stable much more messy albeit 
with a much more relaxed eastwest relationship heisbourg said 
on the proliferation of missiles including those capable of 
carrying nuclear warheads the survey said that within the last two 
years new ballistic missile programs have been revealed throughout 
the third world posing global risks 
in all more than 20 developing countries have ballistic 
missiles programs said the survey 
argentina brazil india iran iraq and israel have several 
missile development programs while north korea south korea libya 
and taiwan each have highly secret missile programs the survey 
said 
it also listed afghanistan algeria cuba egypt indonesia 
kuwait pakistan saudi arabia syria north yemen and south yemen 
among 21 developing countries known to have acquired ballistic 
missiles 
while no developing country except china appears capable of 
producing an intercontinental weapon before the end of the century 
spacelaunch vehicles under development in brazil india israel 
and argentina could form the basis for longrange missiles in the 
future the survey said 
arsenals of other developing countries varied from the 
sovietmade 44mile range frog7 held by algeria and kuwait to 
sophisticated weapons with ranges of more than 1242 miles acquired 
by saudi arabia from china last year and being developed 
domestically by india the survey said 
indias agni missile will reportedly be capable of having a 
range of 1550 miles the survey said missiles of such range are 
difficult to justify unless they carry nuclear weapons it added 
the most common ballistic missile in the third world was the 
soviet scudb with a 175mile range it said these missiles were 
used in afghanistan and during the iraniraq war 
the survey said the usled missile technology control regime 
signed by seven western nations in 1987 appeared merely to have 
slowed some missile programs but not halted the proliferation 
countries like brazil and india have had to postpone launch 
schedules and redouble their domestic research effort said the 
survey 
other countries such as argentina and egypt have moved to 
take advantage of unlicensed blackmarket technology israels 
domestic research and development is so far advanced that it is in 
effect immune

and we want to see perestroika extended as well 
we want to see a soviet union that restructures its relationship 
toward the rest of the world a soviet union that is a force for 
constructive solutions to the worlds problems 
the grand strategy of the west during the postwar period has 
been based on the concept of containment checking the soviet 
unions expansionist aims in the hope that the soviet system itself 
would one day be forced to confront its internal contradictions 
the ferment in the soviet union today affirms the wisdom of this 
strategy 
and now we have a precious opportunity to move beyond 
containment 
you are graduating into an exciting world where the opportunity 
for peace world peace lasting peace has never been better 
our goal integrating the soviet union into the community of 
nations is every bit as ambitious as containment was at its time 
and it holds tremendous promise for international stability 
coping with a changing soviet union will be a challenge of the 
highest order but the security challenges we face today do not 
come from the east alone 
the emergence of regional powers is rapidly changing the 
strategic landscape 
in the middle east in south asia in our own hemisphere a 
growing number of nations are acquiring advanced and highly 
destructive capabilties in some cases weapons of mass destruction 
and the means to deliver them 
and it is an unfortunate fact that the world faces increasing 
threats from armed insurgencies terrorists and as you in the 
coast guard are well aware narcotics traffickers and in some 
regions an unholy alliance of all three 
our task is clear we must curb the proliferation of advanced 
weaponry 
we must check the aggressive ambitions of renegade regimes 
and we must enhance the ability of our friends to defend 
themselves 
we have not yet mastered the complex challenge 
we and our allies must construct a common strategy for stability 
in the developing world 
how we and our allies deal with these diverse challenges depends 
on how well we understand the key elements of defense strategy 
so let me just mention today two points in particular 
first the need for an effective deterrent one that 
demonstrates to our allies and adversaries alike american 
strength american resolve 
and second the need to maintain an approach to arms reduction 
that promotes stability at the lowest feasible level of armaments 
deterrence is central to our defense strategy 
the key to keeping the peace is convincing our adversaries that 
the cost of aggression against us or our allies is simply 
unacceptable 
in todays world nuclear forces are essential to deterrence 
our challenge is to protect those deterrent systems from attack 
and thats why well move peacekeeper icbms out of fixed and 
vulnerable silos making them mobile and thus harder to target 
looking to the longer term we will also develop and deploy a 
new highly mobile singlewarhead missile the midgetman 
with only minutes of warning these new missiles can relocate 
out of harms way 
any attack against systems like this will fail 
and were also researching and were committed to deploy when 
ready a more comprehensive defensive system known as sdi 
our premise is straightforward defense against incoming 
missiles endangers no person endangers no country 
were also working to reduce the threat we face both nuclear 
and conventional

a federal judge on wednesday told 
lawyers squabbling over a planned marijuana rally in north adams to 
agree on a site suitable for the crowd expected or risk a court 
order 
i hate to issue an order requiring the town to use one of 
those fields chief us district judge frank freedman told 
attorneys for the city of north adams and for the rally organizers 
the north adams parks and recreation commission denied a permit 
to a marijuana law reform group that wanted to stage a may 28 rally 
in north adams the group advocates decriminalizing marijuana 
the commission argued that city parks could not accommodate the 
3000 people that the massachusetts cannabis reform coalition said 
it expected for the rally 
its not who they are commission chairman donald esposito 
said the only thing im interested in is protecting the citys 
fields 
richard evans an attorney representing the coalition filed a 
complaint may 15 alleging that the groups constitutional rights to 
free speech and assembly were being violated 
the plaintiffs are residents of north adams who wish simply to 
exercise their rights to a meeting on a serious topic of interest 
both nationally and locally evans said 
he called the crowd estimate of 2000 to 3000 people a little 
optimistic and said plaintiffs would be willing to accept a limit 
of 1000 people at the rally

a man told police he killed a fellow 
veteran who tried to prevent him from committing suicide 
i wish it had been me instead of him said richard papineau 
40 who was arraigned as a fugitive tuesday he is charged in new 
hampshire with murdering frank thibeault who was shot to death in 
the woods in winchester nh 
papineau was arrested monday at northampton state hospital a 
psychiatric facility where he had been held to determine whether he 
could stand trial on unrelated charges of assaulting his former 
wife and girlfriend 
a former marine who received the bronze star in vietnam he told 
police the unionnews in springfield and the recorder in 
greenfield that he killed thibeault 
he identified the victim as a patient at the veterans 
administration hospital in northampton and said the killing 
occurred after the two drove to new hampshire on april 24 the 
newspapers said 
i still wish it had been me instead of him just like i wish 
it had been me instead of the guys in vietnam he said ive 
been living with them for 22 years now there is one more name on 
that list and i will live with them until i check out 
papineau said he was distraught over a restraining order that 
kept him away from the apartment shared by his girlfriend and his 
former wife he said he stopped by the side of the road and after 
walking into the woods put a gun to his head 
i had the barrel in my face i was sitting on a rock 
papineau said thibeault came up behind me and said im not 
going to let you do this and grabbed me i kind of freaked the 
gun went off and he went down 
the next thing i knew the gun was empty and i was just 
standing there he said 
papineau who was discharged from the marines in 1968 for 
acute anxiety neurosis has been in and out of mental hospitals 
since torching a buddhist shrine in the berkshire hills six years 
ago while on a weekend pass from a va hospital 
he and two other men said they set the fire to draw attention to

the largest and longest study yet on the 
antiaging effects of retina confirms that the acne cream does 
smooth wrinkles but reducing doses apparently reduces its 
effectiveness researchers say 
there is no question that the more you use the more you 
improve said university of arizona researcher clayton owens 
in those people who used the strongest doses what we saw was a 
decrease in fine wrinkling in roughness and in uneven coloring 
the university of michigan found a year ago that retina a 
synthetic form of vitamin a known as tretinoin long used to treat 
acne dramatically reduced the ravages of aging and sun damage in 
a shortterm study of about 30 people 
since then nationwide studies have been under way on how well 
it works and whether it is safe the federal government has yet to 
approve it for this use but its available by prescription from 
physicians 
last year the us food and drug administration issued a strong 
statement condemning indiscriminate use of retina to treat 
wrinkles 
fda commissioner frank e young has said there is no conclusive 
evidence the drug reduces wrinkles longterm animal studies and 
wellcontrolled clinical trials involving larger numbers of 
patients in various age groups are needed to assess the risks and 
benefits he said 
the michigan study used a high dose of the drug and patients 
suffered significant known side effects of retina peeling 
burning redness and overall irritation of the skin 
a sixmonth study of more than 300 patients last year at the 
university of arizona duke university new york university and the 
university of minnesota used lower and varying doses of the drug to 
learn whether side effects could be eased while still getting the 
positive antiaging effects owens said analysis of the six months 
of retina use still is under way he said 
divided into four groups the 300plus patients used daily doses 
of retina ranging from the highest tretinoin concentration of 005 
percent to a moderate dose of 001 percent to a weak dose of 
0001 percent to a zerodose placebo group the michigan study 
used concentrations twice as high at 010 strength 
nearly 90 percent of patients using the 005 dose showed at 
least some improvement with half showing moderate to strong 
improvement said owens those using lower doses showed some 
effects of the retina but the results were much weaker and 
questionable he said 
the patients in the study were from 50 to 70 years old and were 
chosen because they showed moderate not severe signs of 
sundamaged skin mostly fine but also some coarse wrinkling also 
blotchy coloring and rough texture 
all of these factors were visibly and statistically rated as 
were the side effects in addition the length and depth of 
wrinkles were measured in plastic impressions and skin biopsies 
are still being analyzed microscopically 
patients used the retina daily along with sunscreens and 
moisturizers 
the biggest improvement was in the skin pigment in evening 
out the skins color and getting rid of blotches and brown spots 
said owens the next biggest improvment was in fine wrinkling 
the crosshatches below the eye and in the crowsfeet area after 
that we saw improvement in texture in smoothing out rough skin 
there was also some improvement in deeper coarser wrinkles in 
some patients but since that problem was not prevalent in most of 
the patients it was difficult to measure that impact 
scientifically he said 
owens also said the side effects of retina were less than 
expected 
most people had mild to moderate side effects mostly peeling 
and some redness by and large the side effects were tolerated 
well usually the effects would last a few days then go away 
then come back for a few days after a few months the skin seems 
to get used to the drug only three or four people had constant 
irritation but nobody had any serious problems 
so what is the best dosage of retina to halt the ravages of 
time 
i know this will sound like a copout owens answered but 
that is something that has to be determined between the patient and 
the doctor people react differently to the stuff the doctor has 
to assess your skin type he will know when the irritation is too 
much and if you are using enough to get good results that is why 
retina will remain a prescription drug for some time

students voted wednesday to end a 
university sitin against government refusal to legalize their 
independent union and said they would concentrate on electing the 
solidarity parliament slate june 4 
they said a warsaw courts rejection tuesday of the application 
to register the independent students association known as nzs was 
a futile attempt to divide students from solidarity just the before 
the elections 
solidarity leader lech walesa said polands communist 
authorities broke a pledge by not making nzs legal the court 
ruling was pronounced the same day an episode of solidaritys 
weekly television program was canceled 
the rejection of the registration of nzs breaks the round 
table decisions he said in a statement released by the 
solidarity citizens committee it causes justified anxiety of nzs 
activists 
walesas independent union and nzs were recognized after their 
formation in 1980 but outlawed in 1982 under martial law 
the round table accords the government and opposition signed 
april 5 provided for them to be made legal again but a question 
arose about the nzs charter the agreements also promised 
solidarity access to television 
at a news conference wednesday solidarity spokesmen said their 
surveys indicate the unions candidates will do well 
according to our preliminary studies concerning warsaw our 
candidates have sufficient advantage to win the elections said 
jan litynski of warsaw the nervousness of the propaganda 
apparatus stems from this 
he said the solidarity candidate in central warsaw had a 71 
edge on jerzy urban the former government spokesman running as an 
independent 
a freely elected senate is being added to the unicameral 
parliament called the sejm and 35 percent of the sejm seats are 
being contested the other 65 percent are reserved for the 
communists and their allies 
janusz onyszkiewicz national solidarity spokesman counseled 
moderation and reason before the elections 
the students strong reaction is psychologically 
understandable he said we think students will find effective 
means of action that will assure legalization of nzs and also take 
into account the general political consequences of their actions 
about 300 students took part in a noon rally at warsaw 
university and said they would end the sitin thursday 
they began the protest tuesday and were joined by students in 
other cities whether those sitins also would end was not clear 
warm applause greeted walesas statement when it was read at the 
campus rally 
walesa was in gdansk where he is an electrician at the lenin 
shipyard and led the strike in which solidarity was born during a 
campaign rally at the shipyard which the government has ordered 
closed he and solidarity candidates said the union was committed 
to saving it 
one of the chants workers directed at the government was 
lenin is yours but the shipyard is ours it is scheduled to 
close at the end of 1990 
slawek gorecki an nzs spokesman said the court decision was a 
government attempt to divide students from solidarity but they 
would continue to support the solidarity election campaign 
this provocation has failed and has even consolidated nzs 
and solidarity he said though there were differences between 
us this will help clear them up 
many students believe solidarity did not press hard enough for 
the legalization of their union 
zbigniew bujak solidarity leader for the warsaw region told 
the students the court decision was done to divide us before 
the election to cause trouble just when we have the chance for 
the biggest victory in postwar poland 
the government press office said it had no immediate response to 
charges that the april agreements had been violated and referred 
inquiries to state television authorities and the court spokesmen 
at both institutions said no one was available to comment 
just before the solidarity program was scheduled to be broadcast 
tuesday an announcer read a statemtnt saying authorities had 
canceled it because the contents aim against the roundtable 
agreements 
the 45minute broadcast was to have been the third weekly 
program produced by solidarity it consisted of a discussion of 
human rights by solidarity candidates for parliament who are 
lawyers 
onyszkiewicz the national solidarity spokesman said the 
government apparently objected to references in the discussion to 
abuses by riot police and other security forces 
he suggested solidarity shows be submitted to regular censors 
who have rules about what should be cut rather than being canceled 
entirely if the authorities are displeased

the inf treaty demonstrates that willingness 
in addition in the past decade nato has unilaterally removed 
2400 shorterrange theater warheads 
but theater nuclear forces contribute to stability no less than 
strategic forces 
and thus it would be irresponsible to depend solely on strategic 
nuclear forces to defer conflict in europe 
the conventional balance in europe is just as important and is 
linked to the nuclear balance for more than 40 years 
and look at your history books to see how pronounced this 
accomplishment is 
for more than 40 years the warsaw pacts massive advantage in 
conventional forces has cast a shadow over europe 
the unilateral reductions president gorbachev has promised give 
us hope that we can now redress that imbalance 
we welcome those steps because if implemented they will help 
reduce the threat of surprise attack 
and they confirm what weve said all along that soviet 
military power far exceeds the levels needed to defend the 
legitimate security interests of the ussr 
and we must keep in mind that these reductions alone even if 
implemented are not enough to eliminate the significant numerical 
superiority that the soviet union enjoys right now 
through negotiation we can now transform the military landscape 
of europe 
the issues are complex 
stakes are very high 
but the soviets are now being forthcoming and we hope to achieve 
the reductions that we seek 
let me emphasize our aim is nothing less than removing war as 
an option in europe 
the ussr has said that it is willing to abandon its ageold 
reliance on offensive strategy 
its time to begin 
this should mean a smaller force one less reliant on tanks and 
artillery and personnel carriers that provide the soviets 
offensive striking power 
a restructured warsaw pact one that mirrors the defensive 
posture of nato would make europe and the world more secure 
peace can also be enhanced by movement towards more openness in 
military activities 
and two weeks ago i proposed an openskies initiative to extend 
the concept of openness 
that plan for territorial overflights would increase our mutual 
security against sudden and threatening military activities 
in the same spirit let us extend this openness to military 
expenditures as well 
i call on the soviets to do as we have always done 
lets open the ledgers publish an accurate defense budget 
but as we move forward we must be realistic 
transformations of this magnitude will not happen overnight 
if we are to reach our goals a great deal is required of us 
our allies and of the soviet union but we can succeed 
i began today by speaking about the triumph of a particular 
peculiar very special american ideal freedom 
and i know there are those who may think there is something 
presumptuous about that claim those who will think its boastful 
but it is not for one simple reason 
democracy isnt our creation 
it is our inheritance and we cant take credit for democracy 
but we can take that precious gift of freedom preserve it and pass 
it on as my generation does to you and you too will do one day 
and perhaps provided we seize the opportunities open to us we 
can help others attain the freedom that we cherish 
as i said on the capitol steps on the day i took this office 
president of the united states there is but one just use of 
power and it is to serve people 
as your commander in chief let me call on this coast guard 
class to reaffirm with me that american power will continue in its 
service to the enduring ideals of democracy and freedom 
congratulations to each and every one of you thank you and god 
bless the united states of america 
thank you all very much

lawmakers resumed their battle today over 
whether the government should spend an additional 822 million this 
year to combat drug traffickers and provide 12 billion for 
veterans programs 
on a 219201 vote majority democrats in the house overcame a 
procedural effort by republicans to block consideration of the 
spending bill and the chamber began considering the spending 
proposal 
the house debated the issues nearly a month after a 47 billion 
domestic spending bill that contained money for antidrug and 
veterans program failed to clear the chamber s 
considered it too costly 
now the house will have another crack at the proposals which 
have been altebecause lawmakerred slightly in form but have retained their 
propensity for attracting controversy 
a spat between the house and senate over the veterans spending 
appeared likely to drag on house members from both parties and 
spokesmen for veterans groups said tuesday they oppose a senate

the top army command published a letter wednesday 
strongly supporting conservative premier li peng who is locked in 
a bitter battle for power with rival factions opposing his 
crackdown on student protesters 
foreign minister qian qichen told diplomats a meeting of the 
ruling communist partys policymaking politburo would be called 
thursday or friday perhaps signaling the behindthescenes power 
struggle between li and communist party chief zhao ziyang was 
coming to a head 
wan li head of chinas parliament cut short a visit to the 
united states and flew home wednesday for what he said were 
health reasons but us officials thought he was hurrying back 
to demand lis ouster 
chinas political crisis was touched off by student protests for 
a freer society and cleaner government that began in midapril 
tens of thousands of students remained in a tent city at tiananmen 
square the symbolic center of power in china for a 12th day 
wednesday to press the demands 
protest marches continued throughout the nation with 
demonstrations reported wednesday in shanghai and changsha the 
capital of hunan province 
li declared martial law in beijing on saturday to restore order 
to the city where more than 1 million residents have demonstrated 
in support of the students 
the crackdown apparently made with the approval of senior 
leader deng xiaoping triggered widespread calls for lis ouster 
troops deployed on the outskirts of beijing since friday were 
prevented from moving on the square by throngs of people who 
surrounded the convoys and built street barricades the crowds 
pleaded with the soldiers not to attack and they retreated into 
barracks leading to speculation that li could not control the 
military 
however the army headquarters of general staff and general 
political department published a letter wednesday in the military 
newspaper strongly supporting lis hardline position against the 
students 
the letter was dated monday the same day more than 100 senior 
army officers called for an end to martial law and it indicated an 
apparent split in the military 
in this serious political struggle that affects the future 
fate of the nation the troops will face every kind of 
difficulty and test in their task of ending the disturbance and 
restoring normal order the letter said 
it urged the troops to study a tough speech li made friday and 
an april 26 peoples daily editorial criticizing the students in 
order to fully understand the nature of this struggle and the 
mission of enforcing martial law 
a extreme minority of people are fanning the flames creating 
turmoil with the goal of negating the leadership of the chinese 
communist party and the socialist system it said in the face 
of this great struggle between truth and falsehood we must 
maintain a clear mind 
widespread military support of the crackdown was reported by the 
official xinhua news agency it said six of seven army commands 
the air force and navy approved only the beijing command was not 
mentioned 
the official china news service reported 26 of 31 provinces 
announced support for the governments decision to maintain social 
order in beijing by calling in troops 
the 32 millionmember peoples liberation army is likely to be 
crucial in resolving the ongoing political standoff the 
grassrootsstyle military played a key role in the revolution led 
by mao tsetung that created communist china and it also was used 
in previous power struggles most recently in the 196676 cultural 
revolution 
contradictory rumors continued to swirl about the fate of 
chinas top leaders zhao was reported to receive backing from hu 
qili a member of the fiveperson politburo standing committee in 
charge of propaganda and ba jin the countrys most famous living 
writer 
adding an ominous note was chinas decision to cut off for a 
second time satellite transmissions by western tv networks 
western broadcasters were told their ability to transmit from 
china ended as of midnight wednesday 11 am edt wednesday an 
earlier ban on transmitting videotape was lifted the day before 
president bush called on beijing to stop jamming voice of 
america radio and refrain from violence against protesters bush 
who met tuesday with wan also expressed his commitment to strong 
uschina relations and the two discussed the recent sovietsino 
summit the white house said 
although tiananmen remained the focus of the protest many of 
the students from beijing university who began the sitin at the 
square may 13 have returned to school to do organizational work 
a large proportion of the students now in tiananmen have arrived 
from out of town to be at the center of the historic prodemocracy 
movement 
i have come to beijing to take part in a great revolution 
said ji xiujie a 20yearold university junior from sichuan 
province 
the fifth day of martial law passed with life returning to 
normal in the capital fewer barricades were up to snarl traffic 
after most troops withdrew from street deployment monday night 
xinhua reported 172 of 174 beijing bus routes were in operation 
by wednesday morning subway service also resumed main shopping 
streets were crowded and markets were wellstocked with food and

the house ethics committee today took a 
fresh look at charges against house speaker jim wright but the 
panels chairman said he didnt know whether any minds were changed 
by arguments advanced a day earlier by wrights lawyer 
the committee held a morning session lasting two hours and 
agreed to meet again later in the day although there was no word 
on when a vote would be taken on whether to proceed with the two 
main allegations against the embattled speaker 
wright insisted he wasnt thinking of relinquishing his office 
even temporarily no matter what the committee decided 
but the speaker met with his lawyeradviser clark clifford and 
ethics committee attorneys met with another member of wrights 
legal team fueling speculation that a deal was being discussed 
that could involve a change at the very top of the house leadership 
wright personally proclaimed his innocence tuesday night at the 
same time he spoke about the possibility of losing his job 
telling reporters that if he became politically crippled he 
wouldnt want to be speaker 
some of wrights fellow democrats have said that the speaker 
should give up his leadership post if he unable to clear his name 
swiftly on charges he engaged in financial dealings that violated 
house rules 
rep julian dixon dcalif the ethics committee chairman told 
reporters this morning as the closeddoor meeting began that 
members would take a fresh look at the charges it brought 
against the speaker in the wake of arguments presented at the 
hearing tuesday 
i dont know if any minds were changed yesterday dixon 
said he also declined to predict when the committee might rule on 
wrights motion to dismiss charges against him 
the two most serious groups of allegations contend that the 
texas democrat used bulk sales of his book repeatedly to evade 
rules limiting outside income and that he improperly took gifts 
from a developer friend who had a direct interest in legislation 
wright has discussed the possibility of resigning before he 
raised the issue tuesday night but his latest comments came with 
his situation at an especially critical point 
pressure is mounting on his democratic colleagues who are torn 
between loyalty to the speaker and concern that his political 
troubles may be unresolvable 
the political pressure is so intense that until this matter is 
resolved the house of representatives is paralyzed said rep 
bill richardson dnm 
the ethics panel in its rare televised session tuesday heard 
arguments from lawyers representing the speaker and from the team 
of investigators whose report led to 69 allegations that wright 
violated house rules 
the speakers lawyer stephen susman argued that the committee 
was stretching house rules in charging the speaker special outside 
counsel richard j phelan countered that ethics should not be 
judged on narrow legalisms 
susman said today on abcs good morning america he believes 
wright can prevail if he gets his day in court if he can get on 
the witness stand and put mrs wright on the witness stand to 
testify what she did to earn her keep 
whether hes politically a dead man or not i dont know 
susman said but added that he sensed a feeling in congress and 
the american public that wait a second were going a little too 
fast here maybe we shouldnt be putting jim wright on this 
railroad 
normally dismissal motions such as wrights are a routine part 
of a case however house democrats have grown increasingly 
uncomfortable with the speakers situation and some have suggested 
that he must turn things around now or he should step down 
he needs a victory thats clear only by succeeding on one of 
the charges can house members and the public take another look at 
the entire case said rep robert torricelli dnj a member of 
wrights defense team 
lawmakers will be reading the committees decision like tea 
leaves to determine the speakers future 
susman said he might consider a 66 tie within the committee on 
one of the charges as a victory that would not dismiss a charge 
but it could mean there is no majority within the committee for 
moving it to the next step in its process a triallike 
disciplinary hearing where wright himself might testify 
if the committee held that hearing it would then make a report 
to the full house possibly recommending punishment 
rep jim slattery of kansas a possible gubernatorial candidate 
who has come under attack from republicans who portray him as a 
wright ally issued a statement tuesday seeking to distance himself 
from the troubled speaker 
if the speaker is not exonerated by the ethics panel and if 
the ethics committee concludes that speaker wright has violated 
house rules then i think he should resign 
during tuesdays hearing members of the committee discussed the 
political angst thats come from their work 
rep charles pashayan of california a republican member said 
he was disheartened that some lawmakers were prejudging the 
case 
it is the duty of jim wright as a member of congress to 
come before this committee and present himself he said 
promising to take a fresh look before rendering a verdict 
the speaker did not attend the arguments but his wife betty did 
wright spoke to reporters briefly as he left the capitol and 
said he was optimistic 
i think we clearly had the better side of the legal 
argument he said accusing phelan of distorting facts 
asked whether he believed he could survive as speaker he said 
that remains to be seen if i cant be not just a respectable 
speaker but an effective speaker then i wouldnt want to be 
speaker 
i want to be an effective person in america and ive had that 
privilege most of all i want to protect my good name and that of 
my wife and my colleagues he said referring to phelans 
contention that one of the gifts to wright was a nowork job for 
his wife 
torricelli closed out the speakers arguments before the 
committee tuesday saying the ethics panel has succeeded even if 
wright is not found guilty 
if our work is to convince the american people of its 
integrity and its honesty we will not serve that purpose by taking 
the life of one man his career his place in history and throwing 
it overboard as just so much excess baggage he said youve 
done your duty youve made the powerful accountable

a dispatcher jotted down the wrong 
telephone number when a terrified woman called 911 to report a 
breakin prompting police to send a patrol car to the wrong town 
while the woman was being raped authorities said 
police also revealed tuesday that the woman spent several 
chilling minutes on the phone with emergency dispatchers while the 
rapist listened and brandished a knife 
the woman had called to report a prowler early sunday morning 
but the intruder burst into her home in midcall she then 
pretended to be talking to her mother while trying to convey 
information to the dispatcher 
when the dispatcher asked for a phone number the victim 
rattled it off saying something like oh you know my number 
mother its midvale police capt dan pearson said 
however the dispatcher copied down the number incorrectly and 
when she read it back to the victim for confirmation the victim 
affirmed it was correct 
moments later the victim hung up 
the incorrect phone number corresponded to an address in sandy 
about two miles northwest of midvale and two police officers were 
dispatched when they found nothing amiss at the sandy address 
they reported the call to be unfounded and no further action was 
taken 
an hour and a half later the rapist left the victim and she 
phoned again for police assistance police found her home the 
second time 
the victim was able to get a vehicle license number and a 
33yearold man was arrested sunday and booked into the salt lake 
county jail 
dale floyd garrett of kearns was charged tuesday with aggravated 
rape aggravated burglary and aggravated kidnapping bail was set 
at 50000 
the incident occurred during the transition to an enhanced 911 
system in the salt lake city area sandy and midvale are salt lake 
suburbs 
under the new system pearson said the possibility of similar 
mistakes occurring will be virtually eliminated because a callers 
telephone number and address will automatically appear on a 
dispatchers computer screen 
under the old system calls have been lost and numbers garbeled 
time and time again pearson said thats why we pushed for 
the new system

the energy department gave congress improper 
and unrealistic estimates of the cost of building new military 
reactors in south carolina and idaho federal auditors told a house 
panel wednesday 
officials of the general accounting office also said the 
department had understated the time it would take to complete the 
reactors which the bush administration says can be in operation 
within 10 years for 68 billion 
in testimony before a special panel of the house armed services 
committee j dexter peach the gaos assistant comptroller 
general raised doubts about other key aspects of the 
administrations plan which was announced last august the 
administration is seeking 300 million in next years budget for 
design work 
the reactors would produce tritium a radioactive gas used to 
make nuclear warheads 
one reactor is to be built at the departments savannah river 
site near aiken sc and the other would be new at the idaho 
national engineering laboratory near idaho falls the department 
wants them in production by 1998 as replacements for three 
35yearold savannah river reactors which have been shut down for 
repairs 
peach said recent breakdowns at the existing savannah river 
reactors which are the nations only source of tritium make the 
need for new reactors more acute but he raised doubts about 
the new technology to be used at the new plants 
there is some high risk associated with getting the technology 
to work he said 
peach also questioned the energy departments cost calculations 
for the 18 different options it considered he said the department 
had taken cost estimates for fullsized reactors and scaled them 
down for use in figuring the cost of smaller reactors 
in our judgment does scaling assumptions were not realistic 
and resulted in improper and unrealistic cost estimates for the 
various options peach said 
peachs public remarks were less harsh than the language used in 
private reports to the panels members and its staff according to 
sources who asked not to be identified 
these sources said panel members were told in private briefings 
by gao officials who are working on the agencys review of the new 
reactor program that the energy department had misinformed the 
congress and was guilty of manipulation of figures used in 
calculating the construction cost and timetable 
the gao review is not yet complete and no official report has 
been published 
when asked about the accusations made by other gao officials 
peach did not disavow the charges but said his main concern was 
that the energy department had not yet provided congress with 
enough information to make a decision on the plans merits 
a department official acknowledged to the panel that it could 
take 1 years longer than the 10year estimate offered to congress 
for getting the new reactors running 
the gao says it would take at least 12 years to get a 
heavywater reactor into production at savannah river and 16 years 
to begin tritium output at a modular hightemperature gascooled 
reactor proposed for the idaho site it disputed the departments 
68 billion cost estimate for the two reactors but gave no 
estimate of its own 
the agency said a shorter and less costly alternative would be 
to convert the partially completed wnp1 commercial nuclear plant at 
the hanford reservation near richland wash to tritium 
production this could be done in seven years for 22 billion 
ronald w cochran acting director of the departments new 
reactor program said he could give no firm cost estimates for the 
proposed reactors until design work is finished next year 
cochran also said energy secretary james d watkins was leaving 
open the possibility of converting the wnp1 reactor to tritium 
production but is concerned about public and congressional 
opposition

the people arent the same 
the beijing international school attended by most children from 
the englishspeaking foreign community in beijing announced it

private nursing home insurance is so poorly 
regulated by states that federal rules may be necessary to protect 
americas elderly from ripoffs the general accounting office said 
wednesday 
in a report prepared at the direction of 88yearold rep claude 
pepper the gao said many states allow insurers to sell policies 
with less protection than recommended by model plans developed by 
the national organization of state insurance commissioners 
while such provisions can result in lower policy premiums 
the report said they can adversely affect policy holders by 
decreasing the likelihood that needed services will be covered and 
increasing the risk of policy terminations for reasons other than 
nonpayment of premiums 
pepper chairman of the health and longterm care subcommittee 
of the house select committee on aging is hospitalized in serious 
condition at walter reed army medical center which he entered more 
than six weeks ago for treatment of an undisclosed stomach illness 
the 88yearold florida democrat issued through aides his own 
report in conjunction with the gao report 
the gao report underscores my subcommittees findings that 
longterm care insurance is simply not a good buy and adequate 
consumer protections are not in place at the state or federal 
level said peppers statement as currently designed nursing 
home policies offer seniors a false sense of security 
pepper said private longterm care insurance can help fill gaps 
in a yettobe developed medicarelike federal nursing home 
program but should be banned from sale as primary coverage for 
longterm care 
in the absence of such a ban only those private longterm 
care insurance policies certified as meeting federal minimum 
standards should be allowed to be sold his statement said 
rep pete stark dcalif chairman of the ways and means health 
subcommittee has introduced a bill to establish such minimum 
federal standards the measure patterned on model legislation 
recommended by the national association of insurance commissioners 
also would provide criminal sanctions against fraudulent sales 
practices 
the gao report said only onehalf of states have adopted 
legislation to regulate longterm care insurance and even those 
vary in the degree to which they meet naics recommended minimum 
standards 
to help assure that new policies provide at least a minimum 
level of consumer protection the congress may want to consider the 
desirability of enacting federal legislation the gao said 
an estimated 1 million longterm policies are in effect now 
compared to about 125000 only two years ago 
longterm care expenditures mostly for nursing home stays are 
expected to exceed 46 billion this year with individuals paying

gov george deukmejian signed 
legislation today restricting the sale and possession of assault 
weapons in california a firstinthenation law stemming from a 
schoolyard massacre 
the two bills signed by the republican governor virtually ban 
the sale of more than 50 specified semiautomatic assault rifles 
pistols and shotguns after jan 1 and sharply restrict their 
possession 
deukmejian said at the signing ceremony that law enforcement 
officers need all the help we can give 
one gunowners group immediately attacked the governors action 
vowing to mount a recall drive against him and assemblyman mike 
roos author of one of the bills hundreds and thousands of gun 
owners throughout this state have called or written to george 
deukmejian their message has been ignored said larry kempton of 
victorville president of the california gun rights committee 
attempts to restrict such weapons had been blocked repeatedly by 
the gun lobby led by the national rifle association until a 
shooting rampage at a stockton school four months ago left five 
children and the gunman dead 
the slayings by a deranged drifter carrying a semiautomatic 
ak47 rifle rallied the public support needed to push the measure 
through 
under the legislation people who owned the listed weapons 
before june 1 may keep them by obtaining permits otherwise the 
guns can be possessed only with a specialneeds permit such as 
those obtained by movie studios for machine guns 
possession would be a misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in 
jail and a 1000 fine or a felony carrying up to three years in 
prison the bills would also increase the penalties for crimes in 
which assault weapons are used 
the bills would allow the attorney general to go into court to 
add similar guns to the list

the west german president called 
wednesday for unity within the nato alliance and warned politicians 
against letting the pursuit of votes sway policy 
in an address marking the nations 40th anniversary president 
richard von weizsaecker criticized a majority mandate style of 
leadership in a reference apparently aimed at chancellor helmut 
kohl 
kohl is at the center of a dispute with nato over the fate of 
shortrange nuclear weapons based on west german soil bonn has 
insisted on immediate superpower talks to remove the shortrange 
missiles in defiance of the alliances plan to upgrade the rockets 
kohls position was seen to follow a general drift to the left 
among west germans who believe recent improvements in eastwest 
relations warrant some relaxation of military policies it was seen 
as an attempt to reverse a major slide in popularity for kohls 
conservative christian democratic union 
it is not highhandedness that is the greater danger but 
rather an attempt in pursuit of votes to simultaneously fulfill 
too many wishes weizsaecker told politicians diplomats and 
celebrities attending the festivities 
he called for unity within the north atlantic treaty 
organization the alliance begins a meeting monday and the 
shortrange missile crisis will be high on the agenda 
under the conditions of the cold war it was easy to be 
united weizsaecker said of the alliance it becomes more 
uncomfortable when the world no longer gives clear information on 
who is for us and who is against us 
weizsaecker praised soviet reforms and called for new thinking 
in the west as well he warned however that despite the warming 
trend in eastwest relations it would be unthinkable to stray from 
the alliance 
we in west germany are irrevocably embedded in the european 
community and the atlantic alliance weizsaecker said a 
superpower we are not but neither are we the plaything of 
another 
parliament president rita suessmuth who also addressed the 
gathering in the flowerdecked beethoven hall said the continuing 
division of germany marred the celebrations 
in spite of the gratitude we feel today we cannot be 
satisfied with the situation of a nation divided by walls and 
barbed wire mrs suessmuth said on tuesday the 69yearold 
weizsaecker was reelected to a second fiveyear term in his 
acceptance speech he praised west german economic prowess but said 
much work lies ahead 
we have no ground for selfsatisfaction weizsaecker said 
we have not become angels under the basic law 
the basic law adopted may 23 1949 is the constitutional 
foundation of west germany and has won praise for guiding the 
defeated nation from ruin to international respect 
west germany is the worlds largest exporter and enjoys one of 
the highest standards of living but weizsaecker suggested the 
nations way of life is threatened by resistance to social change

american pharmaceutical laboratories are 
chalking up strong gains in use of biotechnology to develop new 
drugs and appear to be maintaining their lead over the japanese 
industry and government officials said wednesday 
major targets of the effort aided by sophisticated genetic 
engineering techniques include cancer and aids 
five years ago there were predictions that japan would 
overtake us in biotechnology by the end of the decade said 
gerald j mossinghoff president of the pharmaceutical 
manufacturers association that has not happened there is 
enormous vitality in todays biotechnology research and development 
in the united states he added 
mossinghoff said 70 genetically engineered drugs and vaccines 
are currently in human clinical tests in this country while 10 
others on which clinical testing has been completed are at the food 
and drug administration for review before they can be marketed 
he also said that of 182 biotechnology health care patents 
issued in the united states last year 155 had american owners 
far ahead of japan with 15 patents and western europe with nine 
mossinghoff was joined at a news conference by henry i miller 
a special assistant to fda commissioner frank e young 
miller said a survey recently conducted by the fda of japanese 
pharmaceutical research and development reveals that despite a 
high level of activity in japanese industry the us does indeed 
appear to be ahead of its japanese counterparts in new 
biotechnology pharmaceuticals 
japanese production of new drugs with biotechnology techniques 
is robust but the us holds roughly a two to one lead in both 
numbers of companies involved and numbers of products the fda 
official said 
genetic engineering involves manipulating the genes that 
determine the fundamental physical characteristics of an organism 
a survey released by the industry association found that cancer 
is still the main focus of pharmaceutical biotechnology research 
more than half 45 of the products involved in clinical tests or 
undergoing fda review are targeted at cancer or cancerrelated 
conditions 
it also reported that 14 genetically engineered products 
almost twice as many as were listed in the associations first such 
survey last july are being tested for aids or aidsrelated 
illnesses 
mossinghoff said the association was concerned about efforts by 
states to get involved in duplicative and unnecessary 
regulation of biotechnology despite the existence of a 
comprehensive regulatory scheme at the federal level 
he said that in 1988 10 state legislative measures were 
introduced and three passed in hawaii maine and wisconsin 
currently mossinghoff said a biotechnologyrelated bill is 
awaiting the governors action in wisconsin while additional 
measures are pending before legislators in wisconsin new jersey 
new york oregon texas and washington state

a federal judge on wednesday barred the 
district of columbia from enforcing a juvenilecurfew law aimed at 
curbing drugrelated violence in the nations capital 
us district judge charles richey said the law which would keep 
people below age 18 off the streets from 11 pm to 6 am violates 
the constitutional rights of thousands of the citys juveniles the 
curfew would begin at midnight on friday and saturday 
the temporary curfew emergency act of 1989 subjects the 
districts juveniles to virtual house arrest each night and is 
a bull in a china shop of constitutional values said richey 
however laudable the objectives which motivated its adoption 
the act is invalid on its face and may not be enforced he said 
in a 35page opinion he said the law would unconstitutionally 
burden the first amendment and fifth amendment due process rights 
of thousands of innocent juveniles 
we cannot throw the baby out with the bathwater in our efforts 
to deal with the problems that beset us he added 
the curfew statute was signed april 14 by mayor marion barry it 
contains exemptions from the curfew for teenagers returning home 
from work and those traveling with parents there also would be 
exceptions for youths returning home from school and 
churchsanctioned functions 
the act even with its exemptions prohibits every innocent 
juvenile in the district of columbia from moving about the city as 
he or she pleases at night said the judge every juvenile in 
the district of columbia would be arrested if he or she sought to 
wander the monuments at night or if he or she sought to gaze at 
the stars from a public park 
the local chapter of the american civil liberties union obtained 
a temporary restraining order april 20 against the law and the 
district government agreed to an extension until the court reached 
a final decision 
the law was more of a response to political pressure than it 
was a realistic approach to the problems arthur spitzer legal 
director of the local aclu chapter said after the court decision 
the aclu was representing a group of minors who would have been 
affected by the curfew several parents of minors and individuals 
affiliated with religious organizations 
barry wasnt immediately available for comment on the ruling 
the curfew would have been in effect for 90 days and the mayor 
if satisfied with it could have asked the city council that it be

with songs like smoke is no joke and a skit 
that turned the big bad wolf into a wheezing wimp the first group 
of firstgraders graduated with honors wednesday from a national 
antismoking program 
sevenyearold elizabeth gomes wearing a mortar board made of 
red construction paper and a proud grin promised she would never 
be a smoker 
if i smoke ill get sick she said noting that her father 
smokes and she is trying to get him to stop 
the smokefree class of 2000 program started last fall in 
28000 schools with the aim of ensuring the 800000 firstgraders 
are nonsmokers through their high school graduations it is 
sponsored by the american cancer society the american heart 
association and the american lung association 
the goal is to reach children before cigarette advertising does 
most smokers first try cigarettes between the ages of 12 and 14 
according to the national institute on drug abuse 
by the sixth grade 7 percent of boys and girls call themselves 
regular smokers said martha wood of the state department of public 
health 
nearly 20 percent of american teenagers smoke cigarettes 
according to nida about half of the high school seniors who smoke 
say they want to quit but followup studies show 73 percent are 
still daily smokers eight years later 
as the age where kids begin to smoke gets lower and lower we 
want to begin the education process earlier said judy gelman 
spokewoman for the american lung association of massachusetts 
on wednesday the 70 firstgraders at the joseph p tynan school 
seemed to have heard the nonmoking message 
they staged a skit about a dozen little pigs and a wolf whos a 
heavy smoker the wolf threatens to huff and puff and blow their 
house down but coughs and wheezes instead 
whos afraid of the wolf that smokes not me the children 
sang 
before an audience of parents teachers and kindergartners who 
will participate in the program next fall the children also 
performed a song called smoke is no joke 
among the lyrics smoking is dumb real cool cats dont try 
it smoking wont do a thing for you real cool cats pass by it 
each child was given a handshake and an honorary degree from 
state rep lucile hicks who sponsored a successful bill that 
banned smoking on the floor of the massachusetts house of 
representatives 
the tynan school was chosen for the model program because it is 
ethnically mixed and has one of the largest firstgrade classes in 
boston but the smoking issue has a special significance in its 
south boston neighborhood 
in surveys that have been done there was a significantly 
higher rate of heavy smoking and smoking in general in south 
boston said terry lehman executive director of the lung 
association in massachusetts 
the teaching materials which are being distributed free to 
participating schools tell firstgraders that smoke is air 
pollution they also teach that other peoples smoke makes eyes 
water and hair and clothing smell bad 
the antismoking program is a fiveday program of 20minute 
lessons designed to be part of an overall health curriculum 
the walt disney co has agreed to produce the educational 
materials for next year as the inaugural program and the kids move 
on to second grade gelman said 
we hope through publicity that all schools will adopt it 
gelman said of the program which reached about half of the 
firstgrade classrooms in the country during its first year

the bush administration said wednesday chinas 
renewed restriction of news broadcasts transmitted by satellite 
is regrettable and called for an end to the jamming of the 
voice of america and open access for journalists 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said chinese 
authorities informed western networks they would not be able to 
transmit by satellite after 1 am or noon washington time on 
wednesday 
it is regrettable ms tutwiler said of the satellite 
restriction 
the move ends the networks ability to broadcast pictures 
directly from china 
satellite transmissions had been banned after martial law went 
into effect on saturday the news organizations were prevented from 
using their own satellite installations to transmit their reports 
but foreign broadcasters were allowed to transmit news reports 
for a brief time on tuesday on the satellite operated by the 
chinese television network cctv 
the unimpeded reception of radio broadcasts and unrestricted 
satellite transmissions are in our view among the elements of a 
free press and we hope they will be supported and sustained in 
china ms tutwiler said 
the spokeswoman reminded reporters that president bush had urged 
nonviolence and restraint during his white house meeting on 
tuesday with wan li the chairman of the chinese peoples congress 
she said the president urges that not only the satellite feeds 
but the voice of america not be jammed and that reporters be given 
open access 
many of the demonstrators have relied on foreign news radio 
broadcasts for updates on events in their own country throughout 
the five weeks of protests 
the spokeswoman added that the state departments warning that 
american citizens delay travel to china is still in effect the 
department has also advised americans in china to avoid the 
demonstrations 
she termed the situation in china tense but calm 
the us embassy has been in touch in with american businesses 
in china to keep them appraised of the situation of whats going 
on but ms tutwiler said she was unaware that anyone had been 
advised to transfer personnel out of the country because of the 
unrest

a gleaming american airlines dc10 taxied down 
the runway for takeoff 10 years ago thursday lifting off into a 
nightmarish niche in us aviation history 
flight 191 was over in seconds the jetliner and its inhabitants 
instantly reduced to scattered debris in what remains the nations 
worst air crash 
the plane lost an engine on takeoff banked sideways out of 
control and slammed into a nearby field exploding into a jetfuel 
inferno all 258 passengers and 13 crew members died as well as 
two people on the ground 
just the sound of a jet it just brings it back every time i 
hear a plane go by said raymond devito of mokena who had driven 
his girlfriend debra ann moruzi 21 of joliet to ohare 
international airport 
ms moruzi and a girlfriend were booked onto flight 191 to los 
angeles the first leg of an eagerly awaited trip to hawaii after 
they boarded devito went to an observation deck to watch the 
takeoff 
as the plane moved down the runway devito noticed white smoke 
coming from one engine once the plane was airborne he saw flame 
and black smoke along a wing 
then the plane was down in a column of black smoke and devito 
was scrambling over fences and across runways to the site nothing 
resembling a plane was left 
to this day its something thats hard to comprehend how a 
big plane like that could disintegrate into little pieces said 
devito 34 a real estate salesman i didnt see a sign of a 
person a piece of luggage a magazine 
nobody had to tell me there were no survivors 
the field is green now but chicago police sgt kenneth j 
burger who was at a training facility nearby can still find the 
furrow plowed by the dc10s left wing in the flights chaotic 
final seconds 
i would never forget said burger 
after the crash he and other officers went through the smoke 
and came out the other side and there was no plane he said 
more than 200 lawsuits were filed after the crash american 
airlines and the planes builder mcdonnell douglas corp have 
paid damages estimated at more than 70 million 
the national transportation safety board laid primary blame for 
the crash on american citing maintenanceinduced damage a 
10inch crack in the engine mount that caused the left engine to 
tear loose 
at issue was americans practice of removing the engine and the 
pylon that attached it to the plane as a unit rather than in two 
pieces 
the board said the accident resulted directly from improper 
and abusive maintenance practices 
the ntsb also criticized mcdonnell douglas design as vulnerable 
to maintenance damage 
and it said the federal aviation administration had been remiss 
by not learning that a similar crack had recently been repaired in 
a continental airlines dc10 
one thing we did do is get very specific about what has to be 
reported to us and what doesnt faa spokesman fred farrar said 
wednesday from washington 
elaine bendell a spokeswoman for mcdonnell douglas in long 
beach calif said no changes have been made in the dc10 pylon 
design except for a shift to flathead rather than raisedhead 
bolts 
officials for dallasbased american declined to comment its 
a sensitive issue spokesman tom stack said in chicago he added 
that the airline would prefer to let the public record speak for 
itself

gestures from the kremlin have given hope to 
delegates of the new soviet parliament that they will have an 
independent voice in solving pressing economic and social problems 
when its first session convenes thursday 
early indications had been that communist party leaders intended 
to direct the decisions of the parliament known as the congress of 
peoples deputies but they have been backing off lately 
the leadership called a meeting tuesday of its majority in the 
congress rousing fear that the program would be dictated instead 
the session was thrown open to nonparty deputies and a free 
discussion followed said yuri andreyev a member from moscow 
andreyev a construction engineer described the meeting as a 
rehearsal for similar outspoken sessions in the congress 
there are no decisions required of all the deputies he 
said this is very important 
kremlin leaders also dropped earlier proposals for a party slate 
to fill the 542 seats in a smaller working legislature to be 
elected by the congress said andreyev and marju lauristin a 
deputy from estonia 
vadim medvedev the party ideologist said on state television 
tuesday night i dont think we should limit any discussions we 
just have to live through them 
on monday a meeting of deputies from the russian republic 
rejected a partial slate of 147 names for the legislature submitted 
by party leaders said sergei stankevich of the moscow deputies 
club 
since no slate was offered at the tuesday meeting of communist 
party deputies from all 15 republics the leadership appears to 
have taken notice 
as the opening session approached reformers among the 2250 
members were busy looking for each other 
meetings were scheduled all over moscow volunteers made copies 
of the latest proposals and posted them 
the communist party the only legal political group for 70 
years is far better organized and enjoys such advantages as 
copying machines in a country that banned them for decades because 
of underground publishing 
although party members are an overwhelming majority in the new 
congress mikhail s gorbachevs cautiously reformist leadership 
cannot count on support from either the conservative wing or those 
who want greater change 
ms lauristin said we were surprised that so many deputies 
from russia were so free in expressing their opinions at the 
party meeting tuesday she is a middleaged professor considered an 
extremist by many russians because she favors independence for 
estonia 
hundreds of deputies have arrived with with specific proposals 
that range from a committee to oversee the kgb secret police to 
sovereignty for estonia and the other two baltic republics latvia 
and lithuania 
many soviet citizens frustrated by empty stores and unkept 
promises to fill them have put their faith in the congress 
pravda the communist party newspaper quoted one on wednesday 
as saying he hoped it would make our life our country such that 
you can once again say without blushing i am a citizen of the 
soviet union 
tass quoted vitautas ramanauskas a lithuanian deputy as 
saying a fierce struggle against the bureaucratic system is 
still ahead if we do not crush it now i see no way out of the 
predicament tomorrow 
technically the congress has limited duties electing the 
president presumably gorbachev approving a few top government 
appointments and electing a smaller fulltime supreme soviet from 
its own members 
it includes many reformers however who want the congress 
itself to address major problems among them are human rights 
activist andrei sakharov and boris yeltsin the maverick former 
moscow party chief who got into trouble by pushing for faster 
change 
a poll reported in wednesdays moscow news said 89 percent of 
1100 city dwellers from around the country believed the congress 
should discuss the economic social and political situation 
under the official schedule the congress has just two morning 
sessions before the supreme soviet it elects convenes on saturday 
the party has planned election of the president and supreme soviet 
as the first order of business followed by discussions 
reformers want discussions first then the elections 
we have to pick the supreme soviet deputies after we have seen 
in the discussions who is who or the new system will be no 
better than the old rubberstamp legislature andreyev said 
he said a compromise agenda was being debated that would put 
gorbachevs election and speech at the beginning followed by 
discussions and election of the supreme soviet

a unusual spring fire in a national forest 
next to yellowstone national park still recovering from last 
years huge fires has forest officials nervous about this years 
fire outlook 
the fire in the southern end of the shoshone national forest 
only covered about a quarteracre forest fire officer bernie 
spanogle said tuesday 
but normally you dont get something like that happening this 
early he said 
the fire near dubois southeast of yellowstone so concerned 
shoshone officials that beginning next month rangers will monitor 
fuel conditions in the southern end of the forest he said 
it could be a real problem area spanogle said once you 
get fire in it it could be hard to stop we have a potential 
of having some large fires down there 
last summer forest fires started in northwestern wyoming in 
late june and continued through the fall charring more than 1 
million acres in yellowstone grand teton national park and the 
shoshone and bridgerteton national forests 
the conflagrations prompted the interior department last july to 
abandon the let burn policy which calls for most naturally 
caused fires in the park to burn untended as long as they dont 
threaten structures or people 
federal officials still are reviewing that policy and through 
this fire season all blazes natural and mancaused in national 
forests and parks will be attacked from the outset 
despite the relatively low fire danger conditions now being 
reported in wyoming forests the long memorial day holiday weekend 
kicks off the summer tourist season and rangers will be urging 
campers to be careful with fires said spanogle 
as it stands right now we will have no fire restrictions on 
the shoshone national forest but i will sure urge that any campers 
who have live fires to be very careful he said 
in the bridgerteton national forest spokesman mark van every 
said fire danger currently is low 
contrary to last summer were in pretty good shape we got 
a pretty good snowpack this past winter he said 
in yellowstone officials say heavy winter snow and a moist 
spring should produce a very very lush early summer

the apartment building that 550 pounds 
of dynamite couldnt destroy offered stiff resistance wednesday to 
a wrecking ball 
three families evacuated from their nearby homes before the 
failed demolition attempts prepared to spend at least one more 
night in a motel 
a larger wrecking crane was brought in after the 10story 
hartford park housing project buildings walls buckled but did not 
break when a 2ton wrecking ball slammed against them 
the tower was battered but largely intact after two attempts 
failed to bring it down sunday 
its a hard building said tom santanelli a wrecking crane 
operator its coming apart good but i cant see what im 
doing 
santanelli said the job will take three weeks but the building 
should be low enough that the three evacuated families can return 
thursday 
stephen j orourke executive director of the providence 
housing authority said the authority paid more than 400 to put 
the families up for two nights at a downtown hotel before moving 
them to a less luxurious motel in johnston on tuesday 
orourke said he told the owners of a delicatessen and a coin 
laundry that have been closed by the demolition to file a claim for 
lost business with the insurance company that covered david evans 
the explosives expert who failed to raze the building

new arms control proposals by mikhail s 
gorbachev put pressure wednesday on president bush and 15 allied 
leaders to come to terms with a series of eyecatching soviet moves 
to reduce nuclear and conventional arsenals 
with a nato summit meeting due to open monday in brussels the 
soviet leader virtually accepted western demands that ceilings be 
set on troop levels in each east european country as well as on 
soviet forces overall 
bush administration officials said the soviet leader had agreed 
to negotiated ceilings on soviet troops in czechoslovakia east 
germany hungary and poland and to an overall limitation on the 
red army 
that is the officials said soviet forces could not exceed 35 
percent to 40 percent of the combined strength of the north 
atlantic treaty organization and the warsaw pact 
the two military alliances are in negotiations in vienna over 
reductions in tanks artillery and other nonnuclear armories 
across the expanse of europe the new soviet proposals were 
outlined on tuesday in a closed meeting in the austrian capital 
said the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the soviet negotiators also reiterated gorbachevs proposals for 
drastic cutbacks in troops and in several weapons categories the 
soviet president and foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze had 
given the figures to secretary of state james a baker iii in 
moscow two weeks ago 
bush in a speech wednesday at the us coast guard academy in 
new london conn said the soviets are now being forthcoming 
and we hope to achieve the reductions that we seek 
referring to the specifics in the soviet proposal though he 
said these reductions alone even if implemented are not enough 
to eliminate the superiority the soviet union enjoys now 
still the moves by gorbachev in response to longstanding us 
demands were welcome news even though they add to the task 
confronting bush and the other western leaders in brussels 
the alliance already is divided over whether to negotiate 
reductions in shortrange nuclear missiles west german chancellor 
helmut kohl leads the countries pushing for ussoviet talks 
while bush and british prime minister margaret thatcher are the 
strongest foes of negotiations over the issue 
the united states and britain argue that nuclear missiles are 
necessary and must be made more menacing in order to deter 
soviet attack from a warsaw pact that holds an edge in manpower and 
in some weapons categories 
gorbachevs latest moves however reinforce the opposing 
argument that soviet reductions are eroding any need for 
groundbased lance nuclear missiles as a deterrent 
presure has been building on nato since gorbachev announced late 
last year the soviets would withdraw 5000 tanks and 50000 troops 
from central and eastern europe and cut soviet forces by 500000 
overall 
in january he said defense spending would be slashed 142 
percent although soviet officials said later it was difficult to 
calculate how much was being spent on armed forces 
and two weeks ago he told baker he would unilaterally withdraw 
500 soviet nuclear warheads from eastern europe 
bush in his speech wednesday urged the soviets to open the 
ledgers and provide accurate military spending figures he also 
renewed his proposal for aerial inspections of troop concentrations 
last month roald sagdeyev a leading russian rocket scientist 
and prominent reformer said the kremlin would publish defense 
figures and space budgets by the end of the year 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater sought to play down the 
importance of the latest soviet proposal saying it was a response 
to a plan proposed last march 9 by the united states and its nato 
allies 
but fitzwater said the soviets have provided details in a 
meaningful way at the negotiating table it is a serious proposal 
and we look forward to the negotiations 
bushs response was a holding action until the nato summit 
meeting soviet proposals for cuts in nonnuclear forces require a 
response from the alliance itself not the united states alone 
still bush signaled a shift in tone 
the president felt he appeared too negative before and hes 
trying to appear more positive now said his national security 
adviser brent scowcroft

encouraging progress is being made on developing 
a reversible birthcontrol method for men the first nonpermanent 
male contraceptive since the condom was invented about 200 years 
ago a researcher says 
twentytwo seattlearea men and their sexual partners are among 
about 250 couples worldwide participating in a study in which the 
men are injected with an anabolic steroid that shuts off sperm 
production dr c alvin paulsen said at a news conference tuesday 
the purpose of the injectable contraceptive is to provide a 
reversible alternative method to vasectomy and also to take some 
of the burden of birth control off women said paulsen a 
university of washington professor of medicine and a major 
researcher in male contraception 
the product if successful may be marketable in about 10 years 
he said this is a drugseeking doseseeking exercise paulsen 
said of the human test program 
the injections are a combination of the male hormone 
testosterone and a compound that helps the hormone stay active in 
the body for seven to 10 days when enough of the drug is injected 
the brain senses it signaling the testes to stop sperm production 
the injections of the synthetic hormone testosterone enanthate 
or te are well below the steroid dosages that some athletes use 
paulsen said 
dr john mccracken senior scientist at the worcester foundation 
for experimental biology in shrewsbury mass said wednesday that 
the male injectable contraceptive seems to be effective because 
research so far indicates that te does maintain male sexual drive 
the foundation is where the original female birth control pill was 
formulated by dr gregoy pincus in 1960 
the depression of male libido has been the problem in the past 
with male contraceptives mccracken said in a telephone interview 
dr c wayne bardin director of the center of biomedical 
research in new york said the study needed a much larger sample of 
people to determine if the injections would be effective 
six of the seattle participants have finished a yearlong series 
of injections without making their partners pregnant in that time 
researchers had hoped about half of the couples participating 
worldwide would go a full year without a pregnancy so far about 
threefourths of the participants who have reached the fullyear 
stage about 70 men in six countries have gone without a 
pregnancy said paulsen 
after 16 weeks of weekly injections those men who develop no 
sperm are asked to discontinue all forms of contraception except 
for the weekly injections the weekly injections then are continued 
for a year 
paulsen said te cannot be taken orally because the liver would 
destroy the drugs effectiveness other methods besides injections 
have not been tested yet he said 
paulsen said side effects of te include a weight gain averaging 
about six pounds and in some cases acne may occur in men who were 
acneprone in their younger years 
the uw is one of nine institutions worldwide and the only one 
in the united states working to develop an injectable male 
contraceptive paulsen said the research is sponsored by the world 
health organization the national institutes of health and us 
agency for international developments contraceptive research and 
development center in norfolk va 
the nine other participating centers are in australia china 
sweden france and scotland

three bottlenose dolphins that developed ulcers 
shortly after arriving at the national aquarium had something in 
common with many of the tourists watching them they didnt like 
crowds 
kibby mimi and aphrodite became ill from the stress of being 
unable to escape the hordes of people lining their tank a 
researcher said wednesday they recovered within six months after 
being sent home to florida 
unfortunately the farthest point they could get away to in 
the tank was still within their flight distance the distance 
to which they would flee from the crowds if they could said 
michael k stoskopf chief of medicine at the aquarium from 1981 to 
1988 and a professor of comparitive medicine at johns hopkins 
university school of medicine 
his study is awaiting publication by the animal welfare 
information center of the us department of agriculture 
in july 1982 barely a year after the aquarium opened the 
dolphins were flown home to grassy key fla where they have been 
on exhibit at the dolphin research center 
the multimilliondollar dolphin tank was never used for dolphins 
again 
but the lessons they taught scientists guided the selection of 
beluga whales as the dolphins replacements and the manner in 
which the belugas were moved from the wild to captivity stoskopf 
said 
we learned things about the animals that will help to make not 
only their lives in captivity better but may also make their lives 
in the wild better stoskopf said 
stoskopf and his associates watched the dolphins behaviors and 
where they took place looking for relationships between behavior 
and possible stress factors in the tank 
we looked at everything we thought could be stressful to them 
such as the configuration of the tank temperature being watched 
by the public light levels and noise from the pumps he said 
the results showed the real problem with the exhibit was the 
people 
when the aquarium was crowded almost 98 percent of the dophins 
activity was in parts of the tank away from people as the number 
of visitors increased the animals began showing abnormal 
stereotypic behaviors 
crowds at the newly opened aquarium were three times what had 
been expected said robert l jenkins the aquariums director of 
operations and husbandry 
the building was open until 2 am and then it had to be 
cleaned the lights never went out he said 
the dolphins retreated as far as they could but researchers 
found that by fleeing from the crowds the mammals congregated in a 
spot where noise from the tanks pumps was loudest 
for replacements officials settled on beluga whales arctic 
mammals that are accustomed to very long or very short periods of 
daylight 
we also thought it would be better to acclimate the animals 
slowly to a new home stoskopf said the dolphins had been 
brought to the aquarium too soon after being captured with little 
time to adjust to captivity or people 
the belugas anore and illamar spent their first year in a 
quiet tank at the new york aquarium and were introduced slowly to 
larger numbers of people today they seem to be very happy 
jenkins said they were joined last summer by a third whale

president bush said wednesday that 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs latest proposal to reduce 
conventional arms in europe could make the world safer but was not 
enough to erase the warsaw pacts massive advantage over nato 
bush in a commencement address at the coast guard academy said 
gorbachevs offer confirms what weve known all along that 
soviet military power far exceeds the levels needed to defend the 
legitimate security interests of the ussr 
officials in washington said gorbachev on tuesday proposed the 
imposition of ceilings on soviet forces stationed in eastern europe 
and outlined possible reductions in soviet conventional arms as 
well 
more broadly bush told the newly commissioned officers that 
internationally he sees the ascendancy of the democratic idea 
the world he said is witnessing the end of an idea the 
final chapter of the communist experiment 
communism is now recognized even by many within the communist 
world itself as a failed system one that promised economic 
prosperity but failed to deliver the goods a system that built a 
wall between the people and their political aspirations 
and in some of his most pointed comments yet on the situation 
in china bush took note of the prodemocracy demonstrators who 
have jammed beijings tiananmen square for nearly two weeks and 
said the united states will do all it can to encourage those 
who are speaking the language of democracy and freedom 
but the bulk of bushs speech dealt with relations with the 
soviet union and the prospects for mutual arms reductions in 
europe now the subject of negotiations between nato and the warsaw 
pact in vienna 
the soviets are now being forthcoming and we hope to achieve 
the reductions that we seek bush said but he challenged 
gorbachev to disclose accurate figures on soviet military spending 
open the ledger bush said 
bush told the graduates that for more than 40 years the 
warsaw pacts massive advantage in conventional forces has cast a 
shadow over europe 
now he said the unilateral reductions president gorbachev 
has promised give us hope that we can now redress that imbalance 
we welcome those steps because if implemented they will help to 
reduce the threat of surprise attack 
but he reiterated the us position that nato must maintain a 
strong force of europeanbased nuclear weapons to counter the 
warsaw pacts conventional arms superiority 
earlier this month gorbachev proposed but the united states 
rejected talks aimed at mutual reductions of europeanbased 
nuclear weapons 
bush said it would be irresponsible to depend solely on 
strategic longrange nuclear forces to deter conflict in europe 
bush leaves friday for next weeks 40th anniversary meeting of 
leaders of nato with the future of the alliances nuclear force an 
stillunresolved point of contention between the united states and 
west germany 
the bonn government of chancellor helmut kohl wants the bush 
administration to take the soviets up on their request for talks on 
shortrange nuclear weapons and is also pushing to reverse plans to 
modernize the arsenal of shortrange nuclear weapons on german soil 
the united states says the soviets have such an advantage in 
those weapons that cuts beyond what gorbachev unveiled two weeks 
ago must be made before talks can begin on mutual reductions 
as for gorbachevs newest proposal to reduce conventional arms 
bushs advisers took a largely positive stance 
we find this very promising said spokesman marlin 
fitzwater these are major major concessions that put them more 
in line with the nato proposal 
brent scowcroft the presidents national security adviser said 
gorbachev had given secretary of state james a baker iii a general 
outline of the soviet proposals when the two met earlier this 
month then scowcroft said they were vague now theyve put 
more meat on it 
also on wednesday the white house released the transcipt of an 
interview between bush and european journalists 
in the interview bush said the massive protests in china and 
political reform movements in other parts of the world show the 
democratic way is on the march and it is not going to be stopped 
still the president cautioned im old enough to remember 
hungary in 1956 and i dont want to be a catalyst for encouraging a 
course of action that would inevitably lead to violence and 
bloodshed 
in the new london speech bush said that never before has the 
idea of freedom so captured the imaginations of men and women the 
world over and never before has the hope of freedom beckoned so 
many 
trade unionists in warsaw the people of panama rulers 
consulting the ruled in the soviet union and even as we speak 
today the world is transfixed by the dramatic events in tiananmen 
square 
everywhere those voices are speaking the language of democracy 
and freedom and we hear them and the world hears them and 
america will do all it can to encourage them 
bush reflecting the fastchanging developments on the arms talk 
front made extensive revisions in his speech both before and 
after attending a banquet for white house photographers tuesday 
night and this morning as he flew here in a small gulfstream jet 
the lastminute revisions may have contributed to bushs 
stumbling over one passage where he repeated the word security 
three times and finally told the audience the text is going 
crazy on this machine his prompter

democratic congressional leaders unable 
themselves to convince president bush to sign legislation raising 
the minimum wage above what he has proposed brought three lowwage 
workers to capitol hill on wednesday and gave them a shot at 
changing the presidents mind 
raise the minimum wage so we can live a little better and have 
a little more said eula malone of atlanta who said a custodial 
company she works for has paid her the minimum wage for 18 years 
were not asking for you to give us anything she said we 
want to work for it 
the unusual forum was hosted by the house democratic caucus 
which traditionally holds private meetings to plot strategy and 
hear from people who would be affected by pending legislation 
wednesdays session was opened to reporters as part of the 
leaderships effort to pressure bush to sign the measure 
bush has promised the bill that has cleared congress which 
would raise the minimum wage from 335 an hour to 455 by october 
1991 will be vetoed when it reaches his desk the president 
proposed a 425 hourly minimum wage by 1992 
democrats urging bush to change his stance frequently remind the 
president that the last time the minimum wage was increase was in 
january 1981 
mrs malone put it more simply 
we havent had a raise since president carter was in there 
she said 
also at the forum was verlie reed a receptionist at a 
philadelphia community center whose hourly pay jumped from 335 to 
370 because pennsylvania increased its state minimum wage 
were still working on a poverty income she said i think 
its a disgrace its not right and something needs to be done 
house democratic leaders who applauded each of the three 
witnesses at the hearing also fired a few salvos at bush 
this scandalous neglect of hardworking american workers has 
contributed to the rise of a new underclass in our society the 
working poor and working homeless said rep bill gray dpa 
the caucus chairman 
were trying to do justice to millions of american workers who 
depend on the minimum wage added house majority leader thomas 
foley of washington

arab leaders remained bitterly 
divided wednesday over a proposal to send a joint police force to 
beirut to replace syrian troops that support moslem forces in 
lebanons 14year civil war 
despite that rift and another argument over the palestine 
liberation organization the summit of the 22nation arab league 
appeared significantly to smooth relations between some of the arab 
worlds most bitter foes 
president george bush sent a message to moroccos king hassan 
ii the conference chairman expressing hope the summit would 
strengthen the possibility of an arabisraeli peace settlement 
bush asked arab leaders to support the peace initiatives of both 
israel and plo leader yasser arafat 
he also stressed us support for league efforts to halt the 
fighting in lebanon 
the summit convened tuesday to welcome egypt back to the arab 
fold after a 10year ostracism for making peace with israel it was 
to end wednesday but moroccan delegates said the dispute over 
lebanon threatened to delay the closing by 24 hours 
leaders met behind closed doors and at private meetings tuesday 
and wednesday but made no progress the summit convened for only 
five minutes before it adjourned 
another session for heads of delegations only was set for early 
evening 
lebanons civil war had been dormant for nearly four years when 
fighting erupted march 8 between syrianbacked moslem forces and 
christians supported by iraq 
egyptian president hosni mubarak moved quickly to restore his 
countrys leading role in arab politics by offering a proposal on 
lebanon jointly with king hussein of jordan 
they proposed that all 15000 syrian soldiers withdraw from the 
moslem sector of the lebanese capital to be replaced by a joint 
arab police force that also would deploy in beiruts christian 
sector conference sources said on condition of anonymity about 
25000 syrian soldiers police the rest of lebanon 
they suggested the force be drawn from all arab league member 
states except traditional rivals syria and iraq 
there is no talk about the size of the force yet first they 
syria and iraq must agree to the idea said one source 
other sources said the reluctance of some arab league members to 
send troops to lebanon could undermine the plan 
arab leaders also had planned to discuss recent developments 
concerning the plo arafat like bush wants the arabs to back his 
peace overtures including his recent recognition of the state of 
israel 
bushs message said the casablanca summit offers the arab 
league the possiblity of strengthening the prospectives of a peace 
settlement by approving the measures taken by the leader of the plo 
by recognizing israels right to exist and renouncing terrorism 
unequivocally 
it also asked the arabs not to hinder israels plan for 
elections in the occupied territories 
the summit can give encouragement to the elections bush 
said or if it cannot achieve this it can at least avoid 
measures which would only add to the obstacles which we face 
already 
syria arafats main arab foe is expected to express 
reservations over the plo leaders peace moves conference sources 
said 
hassan invited some quarreling leaders to a private meeting at 
his palace late tuesday among those he persuaded to shake hands 
were libyas col moammar gadhafi and saddam hussein of iraq 
syrian president hafez assad and saddam and everyone with mubarak 
gadhafi had threatened a boycott because of mubaraks presence 
but he surprised reporters and observers wednesday by arriving with 
the egyptian leader and algerian president chadli bendjedid in 
mubaraks limousine 
an algerian delegate speaking on condition of anonymity said 
bendjedid reconciled mubarak and gadhafi during a 3hour meeting

a house panel wednesday endorsed a bill 
allowing federal regulation of the prices charged an increasingly 
confused and angry traveling public by the proliferation of new 
phone companies for operator services 
the bill approved by the energy and commerce telecommunications 
and finance subcommittee on a voice vote would require the 
operatorservices companies to clearly identify themselves provide 
rates to callers not charge for incompleted calls and ensure that 
creditcard callers are billed at their longdistance companies 
rates if they so choose 
the bill was amended to force such companies to file a list of 
their prices with the federal communications commission if the fcc 
finds a companys rates to be unreasonable the company then must 
justify their charges 
the bill also would require the fcc to determine whether the 
operatorservices industry as a whole is charging just and 
reasonable rates if not the fcc would decide how to establish 
rate regulation for the industry 
the bill now goes to the full energy and commerce committee 
where it is expected to pass and be sent to the full house 
operatorservices companies typically lease longdistance lines 
from the major longdistance carriers and then contract with such 
operations as airports motels hospitals and schools to provide 
service in most cases the companies pay airports and other 
customer a commission on each call handled from their phones 
the fcc has received 2000 complaints about operatorservices 
companies mostly regarding prices which sometimes can be two or 
three times the rates charged by the longdistance carriers 
themselves 
but the fcc in february said there was not enough evidence that 
companies were charging excessively and instead told the companies 
to post their names and telephone numbers on pay phones stop 
blocking callers from using the longdistance carrier of their 
choice and stop billing customers from cities other than where the 
calls are made 
the house bill includes similar provisions but rep matthew 
rinaldo rnj said the bill also orders the pricing 
investigation because of the fccs wholly inadequate response 
to the raft of complaints 
the subcommittee chairman rep edward markey dmass said the 
bill was a response to a litany of complaints from consumers 
who innocently picked up pay phones and made calls which resulted 
in charges 250 percent higher than their regular longdistance 
rates 
for the first time in its 100year history the public pay 
phone has become an instrument of confusion and frustration 
markey added a constituent recently told me she was afraid to 
use her local phone booth because she did not know what to expect 
in her next months phone bill this mornings action should end 
the fear and the guesswork

farmers are putting millions of idled crop 
acres back to work this year according to new signup figures for 
1989 commodity programs announced wednesday by the agriculture 
department 
under this years programs farmers will idle 292 million 
acres little more than half of the 542 million acres contracted 
to be taken from crop production under the 1988 programs officials 
said 
despite the decline from last year the prospective 1989 idled 
acreage would represent an area larger than the state of 
pennsylvania 
to be eligible for federal price support and related benefits 
farmers are required to take a percentage of their base acres from 
crop production and put the land in conservation uses that help 
protect the soil 
last years drought cut production severely triggering higher 
grain prices and a drain on us stockpiles the department eased 
idling requirements for this years crops in an effort to rebuild 
inventories 
the idled or diverted acres signed up for 1989 included 
corn 10 million acres down from 28 million signed up for 1988 
sorghum 28 million acres down from 41 million barley 21 
million acres down from 29 million and oats 300000 acres 
unchanged 
in all feed grains acres signed up to be idled under the 1989 
programs totaled 152 million acres down from 282 million 
contracted last year 
additionally wheat farmers signed up to idle 95 million acres 
this year compared with 228 million acres in 1988 cotton 34 
million acres up from 21 million and rice 11 million acres 
unchanged 
the usda report said farmers enrolled 1681 million acres of 
feed grain wheat cotton and rice in the 1989 program which 
represented 763 percent of the 2203 million acres in the national 
base area for those crops the idled acres are part of the 1681 
million acres that were enrolled 
last years gross enrollment was 1878 million acres which 
represented 834 per cent of the 1988 national base of 2252 
million acres

prices of farmland nationally are going up for 
the third consecutive year and may rise more than many analysts 
were saying a few months ago an agriculture department report 
showed wednesday 
the farmland forecast was included briefly in a report on 
agricultural income and finance by the departments economic 
research service it said values continue to rise and could 
advance 7 percent to 9 percent this year 
a tentative forecast made last december called for a farmland 
value gain this year of around 2 percent to 4 percent 
the agency announced last month that farmland values including 
buildings rose nationally in 1988 by 6 percent to an average of 
597 per acre the second consecutive increase farmland prices 
sank to a 19year low of 548 per acre in 1986 before turning up in 
1987 
with real estate now accounting for about threequarters of 
the farm sectors total assets movements in land values 
dramatically affect net worth the report said coupled with 
stable debt higher land values could add 40 billion to the wealth 
of the farm sector

lawson testified at a preliminary hearing in municipal court to

from cotton club 
she had introduced radin to evans and the two were negotiatng a 
deal for the movie about the legendary harlem nightspot of the 
1930s

with her to the restaurant lawson testified he said he walked 
outside and tried to signal wilson but was unsure that wilson saw 
the signal

the agriculture department predicted wednesday 
that barnyard animals in the 21st century may include genetically 
engineered livestock that are naturally resistant to disease 
beef cattle destined for consumer dinner tables may be able to 
thrive on lowgrade crop residues and fibrous plants that are 
barely digestible now and chickens may be grown in closed 
diseasefree environments 
the predictions are part of a project by the departments 
agricultural research service to highlight some of the possible 
changes that agency scientists see over the next 25 to 50 years 
of course there are no guarantees that what the scientists 
envision will become reality said r dean plowman administrator 
of the agency but based on the research theyre involved in 
right now its certainly within the realm of possibility

vice president dan quayle told 
graduating cadets at the us military academy on wednesday that a 
revolution in military affairs will require new military 
organizations and new methods of warfare 
quayle told the 1011 cadets that their job was to maintain a 
military establishment that is respected by friend and adversary 
alike and said that because of their training he was confident 
they would meet that challenge 
the vice president said he expects a revolution in military 
affairs over the next 10 to 15 years that will require us to 
develop new operational concepts new military organizations and 
new methods of warfare 
a new strategic planning tool created by the defense department 
called competitive strategies will help identify develop and 
field the weapons systems we need to be competitive with our major 
adversary and to understand how those weapons might be used 
operationally quayle said 
quayle was sheltered by a canopy during his 10minute speech 
while the cadets and their families stood and sat in a steady and 
oftenheavy rain 
he said the best and shortest speech he could come up with would 
have only two words beat navy the crowd responded with 
thunderous applause 
he noted that two graduating cadets from indiana who he had 
appointed to the academy made the deans list something i was 
unable to do quayles academic record which reportedly was 
below average was questioned extensively during the 1988 
presidential campaign 
the vice president also praised the cadets parents for their 
support understanding and encouragement and called families the 
bedrock of our society 
this is particularly evident on occasions such as these which 
are in effect celebrations of our families and of their role in 
instilling values in succeeding generations of young americans 
quayle said 
after the diplomas were handed out the cadets gave the 
traditional hat toss

more than 20 percent of the costs consultants 
charged to the pentagon in 1988 were deemed questionable with 
fees for advertising and lobbying mixed into the bills according 
to a defense department audit released wednesday 
if the taxpayers knew they were footing the bill for large 
defense contractors to pay for lobbying lawsuits advertising and 
constant reorganizations there would be an uproar sen david 
pryor dark said in releasing the report 
the defense contract audit agency in a study of 118 audits 
found that of the 269 million in consultant costs charged to the 
pentagon contracts worth 537 million were considered 
questionable 
among the charges were 22 million for executive or legislative 
lobbying and about 440000 for unallowable public relations and 
advertising the highest cost was 338 million for lack of 
adequate agreementwork product 
these costs were incurred because a defense contractor did not 
have a written agreement with the consultant 
this type of loosely monitored buddy system is what created 
the need for last years ill wind investigation pryor said i 
can only hope that the defense department learns from these dcaa 
audit reports and improves its management of its contractors 
the audit agency recommended that defense contractors correct 
the deficiencies in their system of estimating approving and 
accounting for consultant costs 
the pentagon is reviewing federal acquisition regulations 
covering the definition allowability and documentation 
requirements for consultant costs

more than 500 leaders of the puerto rican 
community met wednesday at the start of a convention aimed at 
improving what they called desperate social conditions facing 
the 25 million puerto ricans in the united states 
theyre living in dire poverty families are shaking at the 
seams said zorlo torres president of the national congress for 
puerto rican rights weve made very little progress in this 
country over the last 50 years 
congress members issued a report outlining the status of puerto 
ricans in the mainland united states showing that 38 percent of the 
families live at or below the official poverty line the report 
also said 44 percent of puerto rican families are headed by single 
mothers the majority of whom live at the poverty level 
those of us who are here those of us who were born here feel 
we are not sharing in the american dream said angel a 
amymoreno a professor and historian and a member of the local 
congress chapter 
some of us live in the worst conditions in this country she 
said 
torres and amymoreno were among the puerto rican leaders who 
addressed the start of the fifth national puerto rican convention 
wednesday 
the majority of puerto ricans in the united states live in new 
york city or nearby other large groups are concentrated in new 
jersey illinois california connecticut and massachusetts 
the report contained mostly discouraging news about life among 
puerto ricans on the mainland among the other findings 
official unemployment for puerto ricans is almost double that 
of the general working age population in the united states 
aids is the leading cause of death among hispanic men in new 
york city where most puerto ricans in the united states are found 
puerto rican families have incomes that are less than half 
those of nonhispanics 
few puerto ricans own property and spend much of their incomes 
on rent 
only 53 percent of puerto ricans over 25 have attended four 
years of college compared with 75 percent for the us general 
population 
puerto ricans as well as other latinos and african americans 
have benefited the least from the expansion which has characterized 
the economy since the recession of the early 1980s the report 
concluded 
but torres said there are signs of progress some of which were 
sparked by the national congress formed in philadelphia in 1981 
the congress now has more than seven chapters countrywide 
weve provided a forum for puerto ricans to discuss the most 
pressing problems facing the community and how to deal with them 
said torres 
puerto ricans in this country have tried to better their lot 
with labor convention officials said many puerto rican workers at 
a major wall street firm have joined with other minority employees 
to demand equal opportunity and more hiring of hispanics 
the united third bridge a group of puerto rican workers within 
local 3 of the international brotherhood of electrical workers has 
taken the union to court for failing to defend them against 
discrimination in construction

a bill requiring colleges to disclose how many 
of their athletes graduate could improve education standards for 
student athletes a congressman and former pro basketball player 
said wednesday 
rep tom mcmillen dmd a sponsor of the studentathlete 
right to know act called the effort a relatively innocuous 
consumer information bill designed to provide the students and 
parents with valuable information about the school they are 
considering 
mcmillen played for the university of maryland before playing 
professionally with the atlanta hawks and washington bullets 
in testimony submitted to a house subcommittee he said the 
disclosure bill itself will not ensure that athletes get the 
education they deserve but could help to move us back towards the 
primary goal of educating young people and to developing basic 
standards for studentathletes 
the righttoknow measure sponsored by former new york knicks 
star sen bill bradley dnj in the senate would require 
schools receiving federal assistance to report on the graduation 
rates of their athleticscholarship recipients and compare their 
rate with that of the general student population 
rep pat williams dmont chairman of the house education and 
labor subcommittee on postsecondary education heard testimony on 
the bill last week and again at the hearing wednesday 
the rev timothy healy president of georgetown university in 
washington offered a number of recommendations including reducing 
the college basketball season by five weeks and not allowing 
freshmen to play 
he said every school should publish graduation rates and require 
that graduation rates for athletic teams must be equivalent to 
rates for the entire school healy also recommended consideration 
of another idea to limit athletic scholarships based on players 
failure to graduate 
anything would be better than we have today healy said in 
his testimony 
the chancellor of the university of nebraska at lincoln martin 
massengale said the staff of the national collegiate athletic 
association has drafted its own version of righttoknow 
legislation he said ncaa members will consider it at a convention 
in january 
there are several serious issues to be resolved including which 
institutions should have to report and what type of data they need 
to submit and to whom massengale said in testimony submitted to 
the house panel 
he also said it is unclear whether data should be reported by 
race as suggested in the bradleymcmillen bill adding many 
institutions would find such a requirement offensive and in some 
cases it night cause legal problems 
these are all legitimate questions even for one who believes 
in the fundamental concept of disclosure massengale said

in what could have been a sequel to moscow on 
the hudson new yorkers formed bread lines on wednesday to buy 
loaves of real russian rye flown in from the soviet union 
were selling it at a rate of one loaf every two minutes 
right now the line is very long said miraed peake smith 
spokeswoman for bloomingdales where 1100 loaves arrived tuesday 
night 
one person came in and bought 14 loaves she said among the 
buyers were employees from the soviet mission to the united nations 
the bread is good its not a gimmick ms smith said but 
americans also seem to be fascinated with russian items 
yes but theyre still americans and any resemblance to moscow 
ends at the rear of the bread line competition broke out before 
the bread had even arrived in the united states and a chain of 
bakeries is already planning to undercut bloomingdales price a 
hefty 6 for each twopound loaf 
the dense bread was made in moscow on sunday shipped sunday 
night arrived monday via aeroflot underwent federal inspections 
and arrived at bloomingdales on tuesday 
thats what were planning to do every week assuming it 
continues to sell well said ms smith 
two varieties are offered from moscows factory no 10 rjanog 
a sour rye recommended with russian tea and borodinsky a sweeter 
bread with coriander seeds they stay fresh three to four days in a 
regular bread box and will last forever when frozen ms smith 
said 
millionaire entrepreneur fred kayden 58 struck the deal that 
brought the peace bread to bloomingdales the waldorfastoria 
hotel the russian tea room and the rye town hilton which wasnt 
renamed for the bread its in the town of rye just north of new 
york city 
when kayden announced the import plan in march during a 
tastetest at the waldorf he said it would be sold at 15 zaros 
bread basket stores in the new york area 
therein lies the capitalist rub 
kayden and zaros had a falling out stuart zaro president of 
the new york bakery said it was over money kayden was vague about 
the reasons but said his talks with mosinter an economic 
association of the moscow city council had bogged down because of 
the soviet bureaucracy 
zaros made its own contract with mosinter kayden stopped 
negotiating with that agency and quickly made a deal for 
bloomingdales through international farm products a new 
sovietwest german venture run by one of the new breed of 
perestroika entrepreneurs 
its an interesting metaphor for the future i negotiated 7 
months with the moscow bureaucracy and in 7 days i made a deal with 
a soviet entrepreneur said kayden 
zaro said the soviets have promised him 2000 loaves on 
saturday hell sell it for 1 less than bloomingdales 
lets see what happens saturday i dont see how it will get 
through said kayden the bottom line is that the russian black 
bread is sitting in bloomingdales now 
both retailers said theyll seek more deals with the soviets 
kayden said he was working on more imports for bloomingdales 
he wouldnt give specifics zaro said his father philip who is 
company chairman and kaydens nextdoor neighbor will leave for 
moscow on tuesday to discuss selling a product or opening a store 
there 
the competitors also will have a product name in common peace 
bread 
it has nothing to do with what went on between us and 
kayden said zaro it obviously is referring to the two 
nations

they may not rank up there with the works 
of picasso or matisse but michael angelo vidal jrs etchasketch 
masterpieces are drawing rave reviews at the burbank central 
library 
its incredible said michael lewis as he gazed at an 
elaborate drawing of a knight battling a scaly dragon outside a 
brick medieval castle ive been doing etchasketch since i was 
little and all i can draw is a face 
while the art world reels from an insatiable demand for bigname 
creations such as yo picasso the selfportrait which recently 
sold for 47 million the visionary vidal is plotting a new 
artistic course 
equipped with a standard toystoreissue etchasketch vidal 
meticulously moves the horizontal and vertical knobs on the red 
5by7 inch magic screen filled with metallic powder 
soon voila the little black squiggle that has kept kids quiet 
in the back seat for three decades becomes another vidal original 
michael angelo vidal and thats his real name wasnt always an 
accomplished etchasketcher 
it was always easy for me to draw complicated work i thought 
i could get into any medium pencils paint oil but here was 
this etchasketch and i couldnt get it to work for a darn said 
vidal 38 of burbank 
but the freelance carpenter and artist mastered the 
etchasketch so it now takes him 15 minutes to draw a portrait 
although up to 25 hours for a more complex work he said he has 
bought several hundred of the toys over the years and several of 
the drawings on display are more than a decade old 
ive sold several pieces of artwork anywhere from eight to 
10 of them mostly to friends and acquaintances he said 
its unique i get more response out of this medium you have 
to use two hands to use this its a toy and everyone is aware of 
this toy and i can carry it with me 
although his pictures of a housing development reptiles the 
beatles and darth vader havent yet made it to the louvre or the 
national gallery of art the sketchings are prompting openmouth 
amazement at the burbank library where they are on sale at prices 
ranging from 200 to 5000 
its incredible said bill kahikina repeating a common 
utterance by viewers of the etchasketch art all i could do is 
draw a square 
the etchings are exhibited flat in a glass case propped up ever 
so slightly because of the delicate nature of the toy the board 
erases when it is shaken or turned over a feature thats nice for 
kids potentially disastrous for vidal 
once he recalled he had to brake sharply in his car and an 
etchasketch fell off the seat it was a loss vidal said 
special care will be taken next month when the vidal etching 
collection is moved down the street for its next engagement at the 
brand art and music library in nearby glendale could the los 
angeles museum of contemporary art be next 
etchasketch went on the market in 1960 for 298 it has 
become one of the most popular childrens toys ever having sold 
more than 50 million since its introduction and continuing to sell 
about 2 million a year at its current 899 cost said lowell 
wilson vice president of development and marketing for the ohio 
art co which manufactures the toy 
were now into our third generation of etchasketch mothers 
bought them for their children and now those children are mothers 
buying it for their children wilson said 
vidal is not alone in his hobby wilson said there is an 
etchasketch art club with 25000 members most are children 
between 3 and 10 years old but there are also many adult members 
who are accomplished etchers 
these people are amazing wilson said people have 
detailed mount rushmore detailed dollar bills its definitely an 
art form 
vidal couldnt agree more 
theres a technique to it it has great detail you have to be 
an artist to draw them he said i do consider it serious art

the fueleconomy standard for 1989 passenger 
cars will remain at 265 miles per gallon the national highway 
traffic safety administration said wednesday in rejecting a 
petition for reconsideration of the regulation 
the petition filed by two washingtonbased advocacy groups the 
center for auto safety and public citizen asked nhtsa to allow the 
corporate average fuel economy standard to revert to 275 mpg the 
level set by a 1975 law intended to reduce dependence on foreign 
oil 
the advocacy groups failed to make a case that the standard 
should have been set at a level other than 265 mpg nhtsas 
order said 
in their petition the organizations argued that contrary to 
nhtsas findings congress fueleconomy goals remaned unmet the 
organizations said nhtsa erred in determining that general motors 
corp the worlds largest automaker could only meet at 265 mpg 
standard and in blaming declining gm sales on the fueleconomy 
standards 
the petition put nhtsa in a position of defending the 265 mpg 
fueleconomy standard after transportation secretary samuel skinner 
said last week he would allow the standard to revert to 275 mpg 
for the 1990 model year skinner said then he hoped the stiffer 
standard would encourage the automakers to make more efficient cars 
if the agency had applied the same standards to 1989 as it did 
to 1990 it would have kept the standard at 275 mpg said 
clarence ditlow director of the center for auto safety todays 
decision is simply inconsistent with last weeks decision by 
secretary skinner one of the two decisions has to be wrong and 
were sure secretary skinner was wrong this week and right last 
week 
the fuel economy standards require each automakers fleet of 
passenger cars on average to attain a certain gas mileage 
the 1975 law set a gradually rising scale of fuel economy that 
must be met with the goal of reaching 275 mpg but also allowed 
nhtsas parent agency the transportation department to loosen the 
minimum standard through administrative order to account for 
economic and technical factors 
the standard was loosened under that provision to 26 mpg in 1986 
at the request of the automakers and remained there until 1989

one of frances most notorious nazi collaborators 
was arrested wednesday and charged with crimes against humanity 
after spending most of four decades in hiding 
paul touvier captured at a priory in nice faces trial for 
crimes he allegedly committed while leading the pronazi french 
militia in lyon where he worked closely with gestapo chief klaus 
barbie 
touvier 74 was captured wednesday morning in nice and flown to 
paris for questioning police said he was taken in a guarded fire 
department ambulance to the palais de justice where he was charged 
and then transferred to a prison in fresnes south of the capital 
the french news agency agence francepresse quoting neighbors 
who witnessed the arrest said touvier was taken into custody at 
st francis priory which is run by followers of excommunicated 
monsignor marcel lefevbre the vatican expelled the rightwing 
fundamentalist priest last year after a long battle over church 
doctrine 
we see this with great satisfaction said beate klarsfeld 
frances bestknown nazi hunter its a great bravo for french 
justice mrs klarsfeld was instrumental in tracking down barbie 
who in 1987 was sentenced to life in prison for crimes against 
humanity 
touvier was arrested when france was liberated but he escaped 
he was convicted twice and sentenced to death in absentia for 
executing and torturing members of the resistance 
he managed to stay hidden until the sentences against him 
expired under a 20year statute of limitations in 1971 president 
georges pompidou quietly pardoned touvier 
new charges were raised two years later however and the 
collaborator again became a fugitive 
touviers protection during the early postwar period by senior 
members of the roman catholic hierarchy has been extensively 
documented and historian henri amouroux said his trial would bring 
out the role the church played monsignor charles duquaire who 
was private secretary to the archbishop of lyon during the 
occupation urged pompidou to pardon touvier who had lived in a 
succession of monasteries in the southern french region 
one account by the lyon journalist and historian pierre 
merindol said duquaire was fulfilling a pledge in return for 
touvier securing the release of 42 hostages about to be shot by the 
germans in retaliation for an act of sabotage 
when asked to comment on the arrest cardinal albert decourtray 
current archbishop of lyon said he hoped the respect for others 
will prevail over lies and settling of accounts 
written accounts suggest touvier could expose prominent 
frenchmen as collaborators similar fears were expressed before 
barbies trial but no revelations were made 
the new arrest warrant against touvier lists six charges 
including the killing of victor basch president of frances league 
for human rights 
investigators determined that when basch 81 and his wife were 
arrested by touviers militiamen in january 1944 they were judged 
too old to be deported and they were killed on the spot 
a death notice for touvier was published in a grenoble newspaper 
in 1984 giving thanks in the name of his family for expressions of 
sympathy it was never explained and there were frequent reports 
afterward that touvier was seen in monasteries in france italy or 
switzerland 
touviers brother andre 61 said in an interview he was 
surprised by the arrest because he had been 99 percent 
convinced his brother was dead 
in a certain sense his arrest is a good thing the inquiry 
will show even if he is not lilywhite that people have 
exaggerated and made a mythical figure out of him andre touvier 
said 
robert nant who was an 18yearold resistance fighter when he 
says he was captured by the militia and tortured by touvier for 10 
days in may 1944 said the collaborator should be brought to trial 
hes 74 years old time passes but touvier still has an 
account to settle with justice today nant said

the chief arms control negotiator under 
president reagan said wednesday he was rebuffed in january when he 
urged the bush administration to negotiate cuts in shortrange 
nuclear missiles with the soviets 
it was my view that it is important to capture to the extent 
that you can the political initiative said paul h nitze who 
left office may 2 
president bush headed for a summit of the north atlantic treaty 
organization next monday is trying to end an alliance crisis 
involving the shortrange missiles 
west german chancellor helmut kohl whose party faces tough 
elections next year wants bush to open immediate negotiations but 
bush is pressing kohl to agree to modernize the existing 88 lance 
missile launchers in europe 
nitze in a speech at the national press club said bushs 
course would gain no advantage for the united states and was 
putting the germans in an impossible political position 
it appeared to me that we could well take the iniative and 
propose to kohl that we ask the soviets to join us in prompt 
neogiatiations on shortrange missiles said nitze 
this propsal would be contingent on the german government 
agreeing to adhere to its previous position opposing the total 
elimination of shortrange missiles and to support us as we 
attempted to secure equal ceilings on such missiles to a level 
around 200 or 300 such missiles on each side he said 
i thought that the time was right in january to take this 
iniative to secretary of state james a baker but it was 
rejected by him said nitze 
the soviet union has a great superiority in such weapons 
today and without an agreement providing for onesided reductions 
by the ussr to us levels it will be able to maintain such 
superiority indefinitely in the future nitze said 
an exchange betweeen us in shortrange missiles would be 
totally and onesidely destructive for ourselves and our allies 
primarily the germans he said 
if the point is our ability to be able to initiate a nuclear 
attack regardless of its effectiveness we have in the european 
area a variety of nuclear weapons of every significant range the 
true deterrent to soviet attack in europe on ourselves or our 
allies must be the great power and diversity of our strategic 
nuclear forces deployed at sea or based in the united states he 
said 
nitze said he anticipates an agreement will be worked out in 
the past 40 years nato has always appeared to be in more or less 
in dissarray he said 
the manifest and continuing threat from the east and the 
essential reality of the us contribution to both the conventional 
and the nuclear deterrrence to that threat were evident and tended 
to overcome the centrifugal forces in the alliance in every crisis 
situation he said 
the view that the threat from the east has diminished to the 
unimportant is already widespread few credit that shift to the 
continuing strength and unity of nato when that was needed nitze 
said

a hard winter and 
extended hunting season produced a decline of almost 40 percent in 
yellowstone national parks northern elk herd according to 
biologists 
harvest of the animals during regular and lateseason hunting 
accounted for 14 percent to 16 percent mortality and 24 percent to 
27 percent of the herd died from winter exposure the biologists 
said 
earlier this year yellowstone biologist frank singer had 
estimated that roughly onethird of the northern herd would die 
either from hunting or the winter weather however by early march 
nearly onefourth of the herd had already died 
a report issued by the biologists tuesday said last years 
forest fires and drought were followed by a winter of snow that 
ranged from 95 percent to 110 percent of normal three separate 
arctic cold fronts contributed to the winter kill the biologists 
said 
studies of carcasses this spring indicated that most of the dead 
elk were either elderly or calves 
a large number of the survivors are primeage reproductive 
animals the report said 
they said elk died in greater numbers than mule deer and 
antelope because no mule deer or antelope winter range was burned 
by the fires 
the biologists based their figures on aerial counts of the herd 
yellowstones largest in early winter the population was estimated 
at 18506 to 20358 head while on jan 26 the number fell between 
17207 and 19059 
counts in april following montanas lateseason elk hunt outside 
the park placed the herds population between 11801 and 13137 
animals according to the biologists the counts suggested that 
almost 5000 elk died from winter kill alone 
singer and fellow biologist tom lemke of the montana department 
of fish wildlife and parks said in their report that it is 
impossible to separate the effects of drought and the fires of 
1988 upon elk since both factors affected summer and winter 
range 
yellowstone officials said wednesday they havent established 
any average mortality rate for the herd because they have conducted 
serious elk research only in the past couple years

congress must change the war powers act 
witnesses told a house panel wednesday with some suggesting 
measures to strengthen consultations between the executive and 
legislative branches and others calling for repeal of the 
vietnamera law 
rep larry j hopkins rky told the house armed services 
subcommittee on investigations that the law is flawed but he 
cautioned against repealing it 
we have an obligation as lawmakers when we see something 
wrong to right it when something is broken fix it said 
hopkins the ranking republican on the panel 
enacted in 1973 over the veto of thenpresident nixon the law 
requires a presidential report to congress when us military 
personnel are sent into situations of imminent hostilities 
under some instances the troops must be withdrawn after 60 or 90 
days unless congress votes to allow them to remain 
hopkins said the united states was fortunate that the war powers 
act was not invoked in the persian gulf in 1987 when former 
president reagan allowed kuwaitiowned oil tankers to sail under 
the american flag and sent us navy warships to protect them from 
iranian attack 
according to hopkins iran could have taken advantage of the 
limited time the troops could remain in the gulf 
the kentucky republican mentioned legislation he introduced last 
year that would remove the provision automatically withdrawing 
forces and strengthen consultation between congress and the 
president 
the measure has been referred to the subcommittee for 
consideration hopkins said 
morton halperin who served on the national security council 
during the nixon administration said he opposes the time limit of 
the war powers act and urged congress to alter the law 
do not be deterred by critics who say its fine leave it 
alone said halperin who is the director of the washington 
office of the american civil liberties union 
but robert f turner of the university of virginia law school 
called for repeal of the war powers act describing the law as 
irrelevant illegal incompetent irresponsible and insensitive 
to the safety of us armed forces 
turner associate director of the schools center for law and 
national security said the law was unconstitutional because it 
gives congress powers delegated to the president 
in a sharp attack turner also said congress cannot keep 
secrets congress cannot act with speed and dispatch and should 
not have the authority of the executive branch he added 
the war powers act has been the subject of an ongoing battle 
between the white house and congress in november 1983 congress 
voted to override nixons veto of the bill with supporters arguing 
that nixons vietnam war policies were usurping congress 
constitutional right to declare war 
hopkins said president bush recently indicated to him that he 
would be willing to open it up for some discussion on the war 
powers act

hampered by rules against motorized vehicles 
firefighters are battling a fire in the heart of everglades 
national park that has burned more than 75000 acres in an area 
that hadnt burned in 30 years officials said wednesday 
this has become a logistical nightmare said park 
information officer pat tolle you have no roads federal laws 
prohibit the use of motorized vehicles so this has become a major 
firefighters nightmare what looks flat when youre sitting in 
your car is the worst hiking 
she said about 257 people including hotshot teams of 
experienced firefighters from california were battling the blaze 
which has charred more than 75000 acres they use five helicopters 
to move personnel and dump water 
south florida has been plagued by brush and grass fires during 
an unusually dry spring residents of metropolitan miami have grown 
accustomed to a blanket of smelly smoke that sometimes covers the 
area as it did wednesday 
tolle said the everglades blaze is typical of early rainy season 
fires in the park it was sparked by lightning may 16 and if rain 
in the area had been more evenly distributed it might not have 
burned as long as it has 
but rain is not yet general she said it may dump 6 
inches here and none across the road and the lightning struck out 
to the side in areas where its really dry 
the fire is roughly 30 mile southwest of downtown miami ms 
tolle said that particular area hadnt burned over for about 30 
years giving the fire plenty of fuel 
officials had been worried that a miccosukee indian village in 
the park might be threatened but the wind changed direction 
wednesday morning 
the distance to the village is still some 10 to 12 miles from 
the fire line itself tolle said adding that some precautionary 
steps were being taken at the village as much to reassure the 
residents of their safety as to get ready for fire action 
about 500 people live in the village along us 41 known as the 
tamiami trail the southernmost route across the everglades region 
the wind shift may have been part of a weather change that could 
bring firefighters some help according to the national weather 
service office in coral gables 
there is a chance that we will get some rain on it and if it 
does occur it will be a heavy rain said meteorologist bob pifer 
citing a combination of unstable air and warmth

a jury awarded the wife of british mass killer 
peter sutcliffe the socalled yorkshire ripper a record 
942000 in libel damages wednesday against a satirical magazine 
private eye 
ian hislop editor of private eye said the bimonthly may have 
to fold and declared if this is justice im a banana 
sonia sutcliffe whose truck driver husband was jailed for life 
in 1981 for killing 13 women and attempting to kill five more 
hurried from the court with a blanket over her head 
the 200000circulation private eye was ordered to pay the 
damages for alleging that mrs sutcliffe sold her story to a 
tabloid newspaper for 392000 after carousing with its reporters 
at a hotel 
we are totally flabbergasted said hislop i think this is 
very nearly the end of private eye we cannot possibly pay that 
amount of damages we are going to launch a ripper balls fund and 
try to raise some money for an appeal 
hislop whose gossipy muckraking magazine is often sued 
complained the award was 100 times the average compensation paid to 
three of sutcliffes victims 
the award to 38yearold mrs sutcliffe who is legally 
separated from her husband was the highest in britain given by a 
jury in a libel suit 
the previous record was 831000 awarded to novelist jeffrey 
archer in 1987 against the daily star a london tabloid newspaper 
that said he gave money to a prostitute he said he never met her 
pop singer elton john won a record 184 million libel 
settlement from britains topselling newspaper the sun last 
year but in an outofcourt settlment 
private eye also will have to pay 157000 in court costs 
during the weeklong hearing mrs sutcliffe appeared composed 
as she told how she was pressured to tell her story after her 
husbands arrest 
the press seemed to be everywhere banging on the doors 
shouting through the doors and banging on the windows she said 
they pushed notes through the windows offering money and shouted 
ill top any offer 
but she said she decided never to tell her story because she 
believed newspapers only wanted details of her sexual relations 
with her husband 
sutcliffe who is held at a hospital for the criminally insane 
killed the women over five years in the north england county of 
yorkshire at his trial he said he believed god had ordered him to 
kill prostitutes 
private eye first alleged in 1981 that mrs sutcliffe had made a 
deal with londons daily mail newspaper 
in 1983 it repeated the allegation this year after receiving 
her libel writ it published two more articles that mrs sutcliffe 
said implied that she knew about her husbands crimes 
during the trial private eye accepted there was no deal with 
the daily mail but argued the gist of the story was true it said 
mrs sutcliffe had negotiated with newspapers and was prepared to 
capitalize on her husbands crimes 
private eye launched in 1961 is britains bestknown satirical 
magazine with its chatty mix of gossip and satire along with 
reporting on scandal and corruption 
libel and legal fees have often bitten into its profits and its 
founder and first editor richard ingrams once gave his recreation 
in whos who as litigation 
peter carterruck britains top libel lawyer said the award 
showed juries were now determined to punish newspapers and 
magazines as opposed to compensating the aggrieved 
i think this award is disastrous he said adding that while 
big national newspapers could afford to pay huge damages smaller 
publications will simply go out of business

minor maintenance could have prevented a 
neardisaster involving an oil tanker that crashed into a concrete 
catwalk and stopped just short of a major oil transfer station in 
san francisco bay a crewman said 
the exxonchartered oil tanker the overseas juneau was laden 
with 17 million gallons of crude oil at the time of the april 14 
accident the coast guard and state board of pilot commissioners 
are investigating the accident 
boatswain john ballentine 32 said tuesday that inadequate 
maintenance prevented the crew from dropping anchor and slowing the 
ship as it approached a chevron refinery at twice its normal speed 
the tanker demolished a 100foot section of catwalk 
another 50 feet down the dock and it would have been the 
largest explosion in america ballentine said outside the pilots 
board meeting he said the anchors had not been greased properly 
swift action steered the bow of the boat away from the loading 
station and prevented a disastrous explosion inside the partially 
filled tanks he said 
an official of the company that owns the ship denied 
ballentines charges and said the anchors had been greased properly 
the ship had been en route to alaska to help replace the 
crippled exxon valdez after it ran aground in alaskas prince 
william sound on march 24 spilling nearly 11 million gallons of 
oil in the nations worst spill 
no one was injured in the april accident and the only damage to 
the ship was a large amount of concrete debris on deck the ship 
continued on to alaska and is now headed back to california 
the board said the accident is under investigation and declined 
to discuss the matter or take testimony from ballentine the coast 
guard says the cause has not been determined 
the tanker was operated by marine overseas corp of new york and 
chartered by exxon capt robert johnston vice president of 
operations for maritime overseas refused to discuss the accident 
but denied ballentines charges of improper maintenance 
im sure it will come out in the inquiry that the anchors were 
properly greased johnston said 
ballentine said he quit his job aboard the ship as a result of 
the accident johnston said the boatswain had cited a medical 
reason for leaving 
the chevron refinery which processes 365000 barrels of oil a 
day is the largest plant in the san francisco bay area and is 
linked to a major crude oil pipeline said leslie estes of the 
central coast regional studies program

a house subcommittee on wednesday approved a 
bill giving the federal government authority to determine damages 
to be paid by oil companies after spills 
the measure approved by the house merchant marine and fisheries 
coast guard subcommittee bars states from enacting stricter damage 
laws than the federal standard 
the issue of state versus federal standard has been the chief 
hurdle over the past 13 years blocking legislation to simplify 
existing oil spill laws the oil industry has favored having the 
federal government set damages 
while the house has repeatedly passed bills allowing federal 
standards the senate has insisted that states be permitted to have 
stricter standards 
the chief senate supporter of that position has been senate 
majority leader george mitchell dmaine who has introduced a 
liability bill 
the march 24 oil spill of the exxon valdez in alaska has given 
new impetus to attempts to reach a compromise 
i think for the first time we have an incredible momentum for 
a bill said rep w j billy tauzin dla chairman of the 
house subcommittee 
he explained that changes in wording may make the house measure 
more acceptable to past opponents 
states can now tax oil companies to obtain the money needed to 
clean up spills if the bill is approved the federal government 
would create by a cleanup fund bankrolled by a 13 cent per barrel 
tax on all imported oil 
the bill is one of several in congress spawned by the exxon 
valdez accident the nations worstever oil spill the giant 
tanker hit a wellmarked reef pouring 11 million gallons of crude 
oil into pristine prince william sound 
the subcommittee also the prince william sound oil spill 
response act which calls for better surveillance of vessels in 
prince william sound and stronger safety measures in case of a 
spill 
the bill says a persons license to operate a vessel in the 
sound could be revoked if the individual was convicted of violating 
alcohol abuse laws it states that licenses will not be issued or 
renewed if the person is a chronic alcohol abuser 
exxon announced march 31 that it had fired the exxon valdez 
captain joseph hazelwood after federal investigators reported 
that his blood alcohol level was well above the coast guard maximum 
10 hours after the accident it was revealed that hazelwood had a 
history of drunken driving convictions 
in addition the legislation authorizes a total of 15 million 
to study the environmental impact of the spill 
it also authorizes another 5 million to the coast guard to 
improve its response to oil spills in arctic waters and 3 million 
to the maritime administration for studies on the safety of tankers 
operating in alaskan waters 
in a third bill passed wednesday the subcommittee answered a 
problem being created by the administrations zero tolerance 
drug interdiction program 
commercial vessels siezed because illegal personal use drugs 
are found on board can be returned to their owners during the coast 
guards investigation

science is at the point where human 
diseases can be attacked on the molecular level doctors said 
wednesday at the opening of a 50 million center devoted to joining 
laboratory work and patient care 
more than 20 international scientists including five nobel 
prize winners gathered at ceremonies and a symposium at the 
beckman center for molecular and genetic medicine at stanford 
university 
i dont think its too far off base to say that the new era of 
genetic and molecular medicine will offer changes as significant to 
medical sciences as occurred more than 100 years ago when 
scientists discovered that bacteria were the underlying cause of 
disease said nobelist paul berg director of the center 
david korn dean of stanfords medical school said the center 
has attracted at least 40 worldclass medical scientists and 
would have an annual budget of 20 million to 40 million 
the center adjacent to stanford hospital has brought together 
such researchers as molecular scientists and doctors specializing 
in pediatrics infectious diseases and other areas 
the right mind looking at a frustrating clinical problem can 
often come up with an insight which if transferred back into the 
right scientific environment can open up a whole new field of 
research korn said 
other nobel laureates at the symposium were david baltimore of 
the whitehead institute for biomedical research michael brown and 
joseph goldstein of the university of texas southwestern medical 
school and arthur kornberg of stanford 
controlling genetic diseases such as sickle cell anemia and 
certain cancers through molecular genetics were among the papers 
presented at the threeday symposium 
all along weve said that this line of research will lead to 
significant advances and benefits in medicine said berg now i 
think they are very close at hand in the next decade the impact 
of molecular genetics in medicine will be mindboggling i expect 
well see a succession of major breakthroughs in understanding and 
ultimately in dealing with human disease 
researchers in molecular and genetic medicine seek to understand 
human disease or physiology in terms of molecules and genes berg 
said 
the idea of the program is to reach out and encompass 
everybody who shares that same philosophical perspective he said 
the center and a few others like it will speed up application of 
research work because they provide a very necessary channel of 
communication between the patient and the laboratory korn said 
it really is a twoway street it isnt only from the laboratory 
to the bedside 
molecular biologists are probing genetic susceptibility in 
people to particular forms of arthritic disease and identifying 
certain kinds of cells that cause arthritic damage the researchers 
are trying to inactivate those specific harmful cells without 
shutting down the whole immune system 
the same strategy is being used in infantile diabetes and 
multiple sclerosis 
there also is evidence that certain genetically designed growth 
hormones would allow doctors to push radiation therapy and 
chemotherapy to higher levels than ever in fighting cancer the 
hormones would be used to protect and rescue the bone marrow from 
obliteration by the therapy 
another area of research is the search for a tiny group of 
powerful cells that when activated by a hormone specifically go 
after kidney cancers without injuring anything else 
talk about magic bullets this is a kind of magic bullet that 
everybodys been looking for korn said 
still another frontier of research is the study of how cells in 
the nervous system communicate with each other on a molecular level 
korn cautioned against misinterpreting scientists enthusiasm 
for breakthroughs in the laboratories or successful tests with 
some patients with promises of imminent cures for cancer and other 
diseases 
i do think this is a revolution and i do think that molecular 
biology is going to have as profound effects on medicine as 
anything thats happened in the history of biological science he 
said but im not going to tell you that one year from now we 
will have cures for a lot of diseases

three democratic lawmakers saying too many 
former pentagon officials are going to work too soon for private 
defense firms they had dealings with while they were in the 
government proposed on wednesday to toughen the socalled 
revolving door regulations 
democratic reps charles e bennett of florida barbara boxer of 
california and les aucoin of oregon introduced legislation to 
prevent defense companies with more than 10 million in contracts 
from hiring senior defense personnel for two years after those 
officials leave government service 
the lawmakers defined senior officials as those receiving no 
less than 68700 a year and specifically mentioned the defense 
secretary general counsel and the services secretary and chief of 
staff 
in all there are 1580 civilians and 1073 general officers who 
fit the legislations definition the lawmakers said the 
statistics were based on information from the general accounting 
office the investigative arm of congress and the defense manpower 
data center a private group 
the three house members complained that according to fiscal 
1987 data the latest figures available 39 percent of former 
senior pentagon officials worked on the same contract for a defense 
company that they had handled while at the pentagon 
the gao reported that about 70 percent of former defense 
officials violate the law by failing to report their new jobs with 
defense contractors 
the question before us today is whether the american people 
will be asked to throw up their hands and resign themselves to 
having their chicken coops guarded by some very hungry foxes 
aucoin said at a news conference 
bennett called the legislation a simple bill that for two 
years would prevent somebody in a highranking position from 
sitting at one side of the negotiating table and then jumping to 
the other side 
current law prevents former officials from working for a company 
on the same contract they supervised while in government service 
the officials could work for the company on other matters 
defense secretary dick cheney and other bush administration 
officials have complained that the revolving door laws have made it 
difficult to attract qualified people from the defense industry to 
work for the government 
asked whether the regulations are preventing the best and the 
brightest from serving the government boxer said the country 
doesnt need people cashing in on government service 
certain people will not do it and good riddance she said 
we dont want them in government 
boxer said the former officials would be prevented from working 
for two years at about 1300 defense companies of the 40000 they 
would not be restricted from working for universities and think 
tanks 
boxer is cochairman of the congressional military reform 
caucus bennett is a senior member of the house armed services 
committee and aucoin is a member of the house appropriations 
subcommittee on defense

soviet veterans of the fighting in afghanistan 
on wednesday shared their sorrows with americans who are mourning 
friends and relatives killed in the vietnam war 
the 15 afghantsi as they are known in the soviet union 
began their us visit with a trip to the vietnam veterans 
memorial which memorializes those killed and missing in americas 
longest war 
dressed like other tourists the soviets blended into the 
throngs of americans solemnly looking at the 58156 names etched 
into the low black granite wall and the flowers letters flags 
and medals left at its base 
the two wars america in vietnam and the soviet union in 
afghanistan are often compared in terms of the trauma they caused 
the two superpowers and the alienation and other psychological 
problems faced by veterans 
the soviet visit is part of an attempt to gain insight into how 
american veterans coped with their postwar psychological problems 
they also want to learn about developments in artificial limbs and 
other aids for the handicapped said john wheeler president of the 
center for study of the vietnam generation 
the memorial and the us mourners have ignited our fires 
made our pulses beat fasterwe have felt ourselves like those who 
fought in vietnam said alexander karpenko a 27yearold veteran 
with a burnscarred face and forehead 
karpenko wearing a detroit tigers baseball cap given him by an 
american said he was injured in the explosion of his armored car 
in a 1981 guerrilla ambush while he helped guard an afghan army 
convoy from kabul to ghardez 
nikolai knerick of moscow who fought in afghanistan from 
198284 described as a spiritual experience his coversation 
through an interpreter with lewis puller a legless veteran of a 
1968 ambush at danang 
the soviet afghantsi put up their own memorial and began 
their own rehabilitation programs with the help of world war ii 
vets he said now they are waking up the government for social 
and medical rehabilitation knerick said 
puller 43 recalled that he and his late father famed marine 
lt gen lewis b chesty puller disagreed on everything 
politically to which knerick replied that was 
understandable 
the soviets said they have organized the union of afghanistan 
veterans under soviet president mikhail gorbachevs liberalized 
policies 
the soviet veterans accompanied by psychologists were invited 
by us vietnam veterans who visited them last year on a survey of 
soviet war rehabilitation problems the visitors are staying in 
private homes 
they will be shown veterans hospitals and counseling centers 
and told how american vietnam veterans had to organize and fight 
the government to get justice how we work with viet veterans now 
in congress how we used the court system in such matters as 
compensation for victims of agent orange said skip roberts 
executive director of the vietnam veterans of america foundation 
the soviets plan to take part in the citys weekend observance 
of memorial day the national holiday honoring us war dead they 
then will visit homes in cleveland ohio missoula mont 
bainbridge island wash san francisco los angeles and santa 
barbara in california and new york

a mothers 21month jail stay should end 
because further incarceration wont end a bitter child custody 
battle or persuade her to reveal where she has hidden her daughter 
a city appeals court was told wednesday 
dr elizabeth morgan a prominent plastic surgeon was sent to 
the district of columbia jail on civil contempt charges in august 
1987 after refusing to produce her daughter hilary for 
courtordered visits with eric foretich morgans exhusband and 
the girls father 
morgan said she hid the girl because foretich had sexually 
abused her foretich has denied those charges morgan has been in 
prison ever since and the sixyearold hilarys whereabouts are 
unknown 
she will not trade her freedom for her daughters safety 
stephen sachs morgans attorney told a threejudge district of 
columbia court of appeals panel that was reviewing a lower court 
judges decision to keep morgan behind bars 
civil contempt of court jailings are designed to coerce an 
inmate into providing information property or persons the court 
seeks but sachs argued that since morgan has not cooperated and 
has not been charged with a crime her jailing violates her due 
process rights 
dr morgan is confined unconstitutionally because her 
incarceration will not serve a coercive function sachs said 
there is no substantive likelihood that she will relent and 
reveal her daughters location not today not tomorrow not 
ever 
while in jail morgan has been forced to shut down her 
oncethriving plastic surgery practice and sachs said her debts 
now exceed 15 million 
she has demonstrated her resolve sachs argued this is 
not dr morgans word were asking the court to rely on these are 
hard facts here 
the hearing came one day after rep frank wolf rva 
introduced a bill that would limit civil contempt of court jailings 
in the nations capital to 18 months the bill would also apply the 
law retroactively to morgans case which would lead to her freedom 
a house district of columbia subcommittee plans to schedule 
additional hearings on the matter before voting on it 
foretich who attended wednesdays appeals court ruling said 
afterward that he was willing to sit down with sachs and negotiate 
a settlement that would lead both to morgans freedom and the safe 
return of his daughter 
if the appeals court frees morgan there are no guarantees that 
he will see his daughter again foretich said 
until we know my daughter is safe the only tether we have to 
her is dr morgans incarceration said foretich i dont 
derive any pleasure from seeing her in jail but i need to know 
where my little girl is 
appeals court rulings in such cases can take up to two months 
none of the judges on the panel offered any indication when a 
ruling would be issued

troops opened fire on ethnic turks 
demonstrating in northeastern bulgaria for more rights and at 
least two protesters were killed state media said wednesday 
exile sources in vienna austria and a diplomat in sofia 
indicated there were many more casualties in the violence last 
weekend although they could not give figures turkish newspapers 
said as many as 25 people were killed in the clashes 
northeastern bulgaria is home to most of the 900000 ethnic 
turks in the balkan country 
the weekend disturbances were among the worst since a campaign 
in the early 1980s by bulgarian authorities to get ethnic turks to 
adopt bulgariansounding names restrict their moslem religious 
rites and bar the turkish language in public 
the unrest in bulgaria highlighted the recent rise in ethnic 
tensions throughout eastern europe from the soviet union to 
nonaligned communist yugoslavia ethnic minorities have rebelled 
against discrimination and the denial of rights often enumerated in 
national constitutions 
the staterun news agency bta said wednesday that two people 
were shot and killed by security forces and a third died of heart 
failure during the clashes in the village of todor ikonomovo 
three other people also believed to be ethnic turks were 
injured in the village 187 miles east of sofia bta said 
in addition to the todor ikonomovo riots also broke out in some 
areas of the regions of razgrad and varna according to bta 
the diplomat in sofia who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
the demonstration in razgrad involved between 4000 and 5000 
people and 200 arrests were made 
authorities moved in tanks and helicopters after the clashes in 
razgrad the diplomats said and communications to the city were 
cut it was not known if they had been restored by wednesday 
he said he also heard of clashes between ethnic turks and 
security forces in dulovo and kaolinovo in the northeastern part of 
the country 
in ankara turkey foreign ministry spokesman inal batu told 
reporters the government had formally asked bulgaria for 
information about the unrest 
in washington the state department condemned the crackdown on 
ethnic turks 
we deplore bulgarias blatant use of force in attempting to 
silence the longrepressed ethnic turkish minority a statement 
said we have repeatedly raised our objections in both bilateral 
and international fora to the bulgarian treatment of its ethnic 
turkish minority 
bta did not refer to ethnic turks in its report because 
officially there is no turkish minority in bulgaria 
extremistminded individuals some under the influence of 
alcohol committed a gross violation of peace and tried to draw 
groups of the population into acts of lawless violence it said 
it blamed the disturbances on inaccurate information provided 
by some local authorities on recently eased travel laws which 
allegedly created misunderstandings among certain strata of the 
population 
the new laws passed by the bulgarian parliament this month 
make it easier for the countrys 89 million citizens to get a 
passport and travel abroad this would also include ethnic turks 
seeking to make trips to neighboring turkey 
the report did not say exactly how the alleged

the bush administrations international debt 
strategy has cleared a key hurdle by winning endorsement from the 
board of directors of the international monetary fund treasury 
undersecretary david mulford disclosed wednesday 
the approval was considered crucial to implementation of the 
plan because both the imf and its sister organization the world 
bank have key roles to play in the debtreduction strategy which 
was unveiled by treasury secretary nicholas brady on march 10 
under the brady plan third world debtor nations could tap 
resources of the imf and the world bank to use an incentive to 
encourage commercial banks to voluntarily forgive a portion of the 
12 trillion in debt being carried by developing countries 
mulford said the imf agreement came at a closed meeting tuesday 
of the 22 members of the imfs board of executive directors 
in general terms the agreement for the most part endorsed the 
proposals put forward by the united states mulford said 
the brady plan envisions both reduction of total debt and 
reduction of the interest burden countries must pay each year 
mulford said the imf endorsed both of these concepts he 
predicted similar approval when the top executive body of the world 
bank takes up the proposal tuesday 
mulford said he hoped the agreement to go forward with the brady 
plan would help in upcoming negotiations between debtor countries 
and commercial banks in particular in the current talks with 
mexico 
mulford told reporters that the precise sums could not be given 
on the amounts that would be available for debt relief as nobody 
knows how many countries will ask for help 
previously the administration has used estimates that over the 
next three years the plan could wipe out about 70 billion of the 
340 billion owed by 39 of the most heavily indebted countries 
that estimate was based on an assumption that the imf and the 
world bank would contribute together 20 billion to 25 billion to 
back the debtreduction effort

a hightech smuggling operation based in belgium 
sought us computers to bolster the soviet air defense system 
after a west german pilot landed in moscows red square on a lark 
a federal official said wednesday 
the disclosure by patrick obrien the customs services top 
agent in miami came as five people and two corporations were 
indicted by a federal grand jury in a smuggling case involving 18 
million worth of sensitive computer equipment 
the federal government based its case on information from a 
dutch citizen caught working last year as an operative for the 
belgianbased network obrien said 
the informant eddy haak was told by others in the network 
dealing on behalf of soviet bloc countries that us computers were 
needed to shore up their air defense after they found that it was 
ineffective and in disrepair they discovered this when a west 
german pilot landed in red square obrien said after the 
indictment was announced 
nineteenyearold pilot mathias rust evaded soviet air defenses 
as he flew a small cessna aircraft into soviet air space buzzed 
the kremlin and landed before a startled crowd in red square on may 
28 1987 he was imprisoned in the soviet union for 14 months 
his unhindered penetration of soviet air space resulted in a 
shakeup of the soviet military and according to obrien secret 
orders for us computers that could be used to prevent a 
recurrence 
customs agents infiltrated the us end of the smuggling ring 
after haak was lured to the united states and arrested obrien 
said the indictment covers deals made with undercover customs 
agents who replaced the smugglers obrien said 
the indictment charges violation of the export administration 
act which limits the export of sensitive us materials and 
conspiracy to export two digital equipment corp vax 8820 computer 
systems via canada to bulgaria a routine channel for soviet bloc 
procurements 
the indictment named steve smylie 39 and his wife carole 36 
of houston and their technology international consultants inc 
warren wetstein of toronto and his asset conversion specialists 
inc and computer company employees jerry blalock 52 of houston 
and rick parish 44 of dallas 
the four texans were taken into custody last week and wetstein 
is being sought in canada obrien said the name of the suspected 
belgian ringleader has not been released 
if convicted the defendants face up to 15 years in federal 
prison and up to 65 million in fines the companies face up to 
68 million in fines 
the computers listed in the indictment described by digital as 
topoftheline generalpurpose equipment were seized last week 
in colorado springs colo as they were being prepared for export 
haak named as the intended buyer recently was convicted in 
federal court in miami for trying to divert a similar system from 
miami to bulgaria 
federal authorities charged the network also made shipments to 
or through romania hungary libya iran iraq yugoslavia and 
austria

the house judiciary committee on wednesday 
narrowly defeated a republican attempt to blunt the key capital 
reform in president bushs savings and loan bailout plan 
the amendment which failed on a 1717 vote would have allowed 
some institutions to use administrative appeals to delay the 
imposition of tougher capital standards for up to 18 months 
eleven republicans and six democrats supported the weakening 
amedment offered by reps henry j hyde rill and lawrence j 
smith dfla three republicans and 14 democrats voted no the 
committee chairman rep jack brooks dtexas abstained 
the vote was the latest in a series by both the judiciary panel 
and house banking committee in which bush has attracted more 
democratic than republican support for preserving his proposed 
reforms 
the banking committee adopted its version of sampl legislation 
three weeks ago the full house will likely consider it early next 
month along with alternatives to specific sections passed by other 
committees 
the house bill and legislation passed by the senate last month 
then would have to be reconciled in a conference between the two 
chambers before a final product can be sent to the presidents desk 
were very happy to see strong capital survive said 
assistant treasury secretary david w mullins one of the 
architects of bushs sampl plan but we have no illusions well 
have to fight it again and again and again its like one of those 
cheap movies the monster keeps coming back he said 
the key reform in the banking panels bill would require sampl 
owners to risk 3 of real money or tangible capital for 
every 100 they lend senatepassed legislation would require 150 
in tangible capital for every 100 lent 
both versions would eliminate an accounting break known as 
supervisory goodwill in the early 1980s sampl regulators 
authorized some healthy sampls to count goodwill as capital in 
exchange for assuming the losses of ailing institutions 
hyde argued that it is unfair to change the rules in the 
middle of the game and said that 152 institutions would have to 
be considered insolvent unless they are permitted to continue 
counting goodwill as capital 
he would have required financial regulators to conduct hearings 
under the administrative procedures act for sampl owners who believed 
the government was reneging on an agreement by changing the rules 
for counting goodwill 
my amendment says you get a chance at due process before 
we hold the funeral he said 
in other action the judiciary committee defeated on a voice 
vote an attempt by rep william j hughes dnj to halve the 
maximum proposed jail term for financial institution fraud from 20 
years to 10 years and to eliminate sentencing guidelines calling 
for jail terms for first offenders

two congressmen said wednesday they would 
investigate pentagon selection of an italian gunmaker over smith amp 
wesson to make the militarys chief handgun 
the army for the second time in four years selected beretta 
usa a subsidiary of armi beretta spa over smith amp wesson of 
springfield mass sturm ruger amp co of southport conn also was 
rejected by the army 
the army on monday said sample weapons submitted for testing by 
smith amp wesson and sturm ruger failed to meet minimum performance 
requirements and the beretta usa m9 tested significantly better 
i cannot say at this time that the tests were rigged but my 
hunting dog nose tells me that something might be amiss here 
said rep silvio o conte rmass i will not give up until i am 
certain smith amp wesson is given a fair shake 
rep richard neal dmass said he and conte will scrutinize 
every aspect of this competition if there is a hint of any 
irregularity well insist on a full explanation and appropriate 
corrective action 
we have not seen the test results yet but i will insist upon 
a full accounting by the defense department he said 
the latest competition was ordered by congress after conte and 
former democratic rep edward p boland of springfield complained 
that beretta was unfairly awarded a contract in 1985 to build its 
m9 pistol as the replacement for the militarys venerable colt 45 
the general accounting office agreed with the lawmakers that 
smith amp wesson was improperly shut out of the final bidding process 
for the original 75 million contract to build 315000 pistols 
the new contract competition is worth 99 million to build 
56705 guns the army said 
the general accounting office on two separate occasions found 
against the army in favor of smith amp wesson conte said the 
house government operations committee agreed that smith amp wesson 
has previously been treated unfairly in technical 
disqualifications and here we are again you can rest assured that 
i will look into every aspect of this evaluation 
the army in its statement monday did not specify the problems 
with the smith amp wesson or sturm ruger guns army officials said 
they would brief the companies thursday at the aberdeen md 
proving ground 
the contract award comes in the wake of a series of problems 
with the 140000 beretta pistols already delivered 
beretta which opeates a plant in accokeek md where the guns 
are assembled agreed last summer to suspend deliveries while it 
corrected a problem that led to a dangerous cracking of the guns 
chamber slide deliveries resumed earlier this month according to 
beretta officials 
the army ordered reduced usage of the guns after a fifth 
accident in which a chamber slide cracked sending fragments toward 
the shooters chest 
in march the navy said its seal commando forces would not 
switch to the beretta 9mm because of the slide failures

california enacted the nations first 
statewide restrictions on the possession or sale of assault weapons 
wednesday when gov george deukmejian signed two bills sparked by a 
schoolyard massacre 
the bills ban the sale of 55 semiautomatic assault rifles 
pistols and shotguns beginning jan 1 but they allow people who 
currently own those weapons lawfully to keep them if they register 
with the state 
the legislation was prompted by a jan 17 attack at a stockton 
elementary school in which a deranged man with an ak47 assault 
rifle killed five children and wounded 30 other people before 
taking his own life 
the attack prompted similar bills in several states including 
rhode island louisiana michigan and colorado but californias 
are the first to be passed and signed into law the louisiana bill 
failed in committee wednesday and lawmakers there say it is 
unlikely any gun control legislation will be adopted this year 
several cities including los angeles have enacted local 
restrictions 
these bills are not going to bring back to life the five 
beautiful children who were killed on the schoolyard in stockton 
deukmejian said during a capitol billsigning ceremony i hope 
they will help our courageous law enforcement community in fighting 
violent crime 
deukmejian a republican who is a longtime foe of gun control 
measures said he would also sign legislation requiring a 15day 
waiting period for all gun sales but stressed that he still 
opposes any further gun control 
this legislation only bans specified weapons that are not 
needed by individuals for their selfprotection or recreation 
purposes they can still go hunting they can still go target 
shooting with many other guns deukmejian said 
despite those assurances deukmejians signing of the two bills 
written by two los angeles democrats senate president pro tem 
david roberti and assemblyman mike roos sparked immediate recall 
threats 
a lone picket stood in front of the capitol with a sign saying 
impeach antigun traitors during the bill signing and a 
gunowners group announced a recall drive against deukmejian 
the governor said he wasnt surprised or worried about the 
recall threats 
roberti said he hoped californias restrictions will be a 
leadership action showing what can be accomplished in 
washington 
i pledge this is just a beginning said roos today 
clearly shows californias watershed position for the country when 
it comes to crime control and control of violent weapons that 
people unfortunately have had too easy access to

in a further signal of improving relations 
secretary of state james a baker iii will meet in rome this 
weekend with south african foreign minister roelof botha the state 
department said wednesday 
the meeting is part of an expansion of contacts planned by bush 
administration officials with leading south africans both in and 
out of government 
a senior us official asking not to be identified said the 
mood between the two countries has improved partly as a result of 
the usmediated agreement last december under which cuba agreed 
to the phased withdrawal of its forces from angola and south africa 
consented to end its colonial role in namibia 
there is a greater atmosphere of confidence the official 
said 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler disclosed that 
baker will meet with botha during a stopover in rome prior to 
attending the nato summit meeting in brussels 
last week president bush met with three antiapartheid 
activists including nobel peace prize winner archbishop desmond 
tutu the administration also is planning to invite the leader of 
south africas ruling national party f w de klerk regular 
meetings also are planned with representatives of the countrys 
main antiapartheid group the african national congress 
the new assistant secretary for african affairs herman cohen 
hopes to visit south africa within the next two months 
the goal of the intensified us diplomacy is to determine 
whether the united states can help promote meaningful discussions 
among south africans toward the establishment of a system that will 
give the majority black population political rights for the first 
time 
to the extent that the two sides can get together on a 
framework so much the better a us official said 
he added that the december agreement negotiated by cohens 
predecessor chester crocker is progressing well with the 
independence process in namibia moving ahead and the cuban troop 
withdrawal being carried out on schedule 
there are also inconclusive signs that angolas marxist 
government may be interested for the first time in negotiating an 
end to the 14year civil war with usbacked rebels 
ussouth african relations were set back sharply by the 
economic sanctions congress imposed in 1986 and officials 
acknowledged that the relationship is still traumatized by that 
action 
president reagan vetoed the sanctions but was overridden by 
congress

president bush has sent a new letter to the 
west german chancellor helmut kohl on the shortrange missile 
dispute in nato as bushs national security adviser said wednesday 
that time is running out for resolving the rift in the alliance 
bush sent the letter to kohl late tuesday evening and the german 
leader intends to respond to the us proposal as soon as 
possible a diplomatic source in washington said 
officials on both sides of the atlantic have been scrambling to 
heal the rift in advance of a summit meeting of leaders of the 16 
nato countries in brussels belgium next week 
the disagreement may continue to fester until the meeting which 
is bushs first as the leader of the western alliance and is 
designed to mark the 40th anniversary of the founding of the north 
atlantic treaty organization 
the leaders will gather amid a series of arms control proposals 
by soviet president mikhail s gorbachev that have enticed many in 
western europe to question the need for updating natos nuclear 
stockpile 
bushs national security adviser brent scowcroft commented to 
reporters as the president delivered the commencement address at 
the coast guard academy in new london conn 
asked if there had been progress in negotiations with the west 
germans scowcroft responded not measureably 
queried whether that meant that the president would travel to 
the summit without a solution he said time is running out 
the national security adviser added that both sides were still 
talking and that the united states had not given up on finding a 
way out of the problem 
at the state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler confirmed 
that the united states had responded to the west germans but she 
refused to give any details of the us reply 
were not negotiating in public i just cant get into the 
specifics she said 
she repeated secretary of state james a baker iiis expression 
that the united states is hopeful that a compromise can be 
reached prior to the summit meeting in brussels 
the controversy stems from a push by the united states and 
britain to update aging lance surfacetosurface nuclear missiles 
most of which are based in west germany 
public opinion in west germany has turned against such a move 
and kohl has pressed for an early round of ussoviet talks on the 
missile in part as a means of shoring up his domestic political 
position 
baker told west german defense minister gerhard stoltenberg last 
week that the united states accepted the idea of such negotiations 
in principle but has opposed opening any such talks until warsaw 
pact forces are reduced the americans have also demanded that the 
germans oppose the total elimination of the weapons 
if the shortrange lances were modernized their range would be 
tripled to just below 300 miles all us and soviet missiles with 
ranges between 300 and 3000 miles were banned under a 1987 treaty 
the usbuilt lances now can hit targets from about 75 miles 
away

a nervous whitehaired printer from italy 
was honored wednesday for having the courage to stand up to the 
nazi holocaust and save thousands of jews from death by printing 
false documents for them 
trento brizi and his town of assisi are examples of what 
ordinary people can do in the face of tyranny said harry waldman 
chairman of the graphic arts association in a wreathlaying 
ceremony at the citys holocaust memorial 
the association invited brizi to philadelphia to receive its 
third annual freedom of the press award the award for 
demonstrating commitment to a free and uncensored press and to the 
basic human rights of all people has gone to the wall street 
journal and knightridder newspapers in the past 
with brizi 80 came the rev aldo brunacci and mayor edo 
romoli representing the clergy and townspeople of assisi 
assisi became an underground haven in 1943 as the nazis were 
intensifying their campaign to round up jews in territories they 
controlled 
assisi the centuriesold home of st francis had no jewish 
population of its own but became a haven for the hunted people at 
one point according to waldman nearly half the people of assisi 
were hiding jews sought for the concentration camps 
brizi wounded in the war came home to help his father luigi 
in the family print shop the rev ruffino niccaci an underground 
leader asked them to print false identity papers and transit visas 
that would allow those in hiding to escape to safe lands 
the father and son team used names from the rome telephone book 
and designed fake city seals as they thought they might look they 
counterfeited seals of cities under allied control making it 
difficult for the nazis to check them 
they ran their printing shop by day and worked on the documents 
by night eventually printing documents for more than 5000 jewish 
and political refugees no one was ever captured with their false 
documents according to the printers association 
brunacci helped distribute the fake papers hiding them inside 
the frame of his bicycle the assisi underground eventually 
involved almost 500 priests half the townspeople and the 
cloistered nuns of the convent of san quirico 
the nuns broke a 700yearold tradition of not allowing men 
inside the convent to hide jewish refugees 
eighty to 85 percent of the italian jews survived because this 
kind of thing was happening all over italy waldman said in 
the rest of europe 80 percent of the jews were killed 
brunacci and rabbi max hausen placed the floral wreath bearing 
the message assisi remembers at the foot of the 20foot statue 
of twisted intertwined arms and legs 
luigi brizi died in 1969 his deeds never officially recognized 
trento brizi who still operates the family business accepted a 
plaque but didnt speak at the morning ceremony 
i was nervous when i got up this morning but im all right 
now he said through an interpreter as television cameras bustled 
around him and city traffic roared by 
he said he clearly remembers working in the night hiding what 
he and his father were doing from the nazi occupiers 
at that time none of us was really sure how it would all come 
out he said 
why did he and the people of assisi take such a great risk to 
save the jews 
we felt we had to do something he said

texas death row inmates expressed worry 
wednesday after a fellow prisoner was executed for a 1981 
abduction rape and slaying because his case sailed through appeals 
courts without even a temporary stay 
stephen mccoy a 40yearold electrician from houston was 
pronounced dead at 1225 am wednesday seven minutes after a 
lethal mixture of drugs was injected into his arms 
mccoy lost a final appeal late tuesday when the us supreme 
court voted 54 to deny a stay without further comment the appeal 
was mccoys first to reach the high court and it has been routine 
for initial appeals to merit at least one reprieve 
the significance of this is the courts very clearly are 
indicating impatience with dilatory tactics within the process and 
they intend to expedite the process said state attorney general 
jim mattox who witnessed the execution and predicted the pace of 
executions in texas would accelerate 
mccoys execution was the 31st in texas and the 110th in the 
nation since the 1976 us supreme court ruling allowing states to 
resume use of the death penalty texas has had the most executions 
followed by florida with 21 and louisiana with 18 
we anticipate the length between the time of conviction and 
execution will grow shorter mattox said legitimate issues 
for appeals are getting fewer and fewer 
things never look good for death row inmates condemned 
prisoner lester bower said wednesday things look especially poor 
now were running out of generic issues to bring to the supreme

a french humanitarian group said wednesday it was 
withdrawing part of its claim about the use of toxic gas during 
street protests in soviet georgia last month in which 19 people 
were killed 
a statement issued tuesday by medecins sans frontiers doctors 
without borders said autopsies on 16 victims identified 
chloropicrine as one of the gases 
on wednesday the organization said its doctors were denied full 
access to soviet autopsy reports but laboratory analysis of the 
substance allegedly used in tbilisi to disperse 10000 protesters 
april 9 revealed chloropicrine 
chrloropicrine is a highly toxic substance used widely during 
world war i in combat dr benoit nemery a belgian toxicoligist 
told reporters in a telephone connection with a news conference at 
the groups paris headquarters 
it is highly probable that it was used but until we have the 
results of a biological analysis performed on an organ of a victim 
it is impossible to say with complete certitude he said 
doctors without borders said a georgian doctor invited dr barry 
rumack of denver colo representing physicians for human rights 
to analyze a small container of gas the georgian said had been used 
on the protesters 
the fourmember french team worked with american and georgian 
doctors and representatives of the georgian health ministry 
chloropicrine was approved in the soviet union for use as a tear 
gas until 1981 when it was reclassified as a suffocant or 
asphyxiating gas for combat use the french organization said 
soviet authorities have denied toxic gas was used to disperse the 
protesters 
members of the french team said they learned through soviet 
doctors that two victims showed no signs of external physical 
trauma and death probably was due to inhaling gases but both 
victims had burned lungs and the doctors concluded ordinary tear 
gas would not cause such damage 
the doctors said they examined and questioned hundreds of 
witnesses and victims they said many people had been admitted to 
hospitals with symptoms common to trauma victims 
children came staggering in unable to walk straight 
complaining about intense fatigue nauseau dizziness 
irritability anxiety depression and indigestion said dr 
pierre barel a lung and heart specialist 
waves of people began pouring into doctors offices and 
hospitals on may 17 he said which was 40 days after the event 
barel said not all of them had been gassed 
that corresponds to the end of the period of mourning for 
russian orthodox he said they showed some of the same 
symptoms of the people who had been in the streets on april 9 
hundreds of other people were admitted to hospitals long after 
the clash believing they were suffering from secondary effects of 
the toxic gas but barel said they showed no evidence of nerve 
damage

ten years ago thursday 6yearold etan patz 
walking alone for the first time to his school bus vanished from 
the streets of lower manhattan police and his parents still get 
reports of purported sightings of him 
but despite extensive publicity a 25000 reward and 
photographs of the boy plastered all over the city etan has not 
been found 
the case no 8367 is still open and there have been thousands 
of leads so many of them credible that investigators have been to 
every state and some foreign countries 
but the odds are very very much against etan being alive 
said lt robert davis of the police departments missing persons 
squad 
it has never happened in the history of this department that a 
person missing that long has been found alive said davis who 
was one of the many officers who canvassed the soho neighborhood 
where etan vanished 
most children abducted by strangers which is what the police 
believe happened to etan are killed right away davis added 
etans parents stanley and julie patz whose faces were almost 
as familiar around the city as their missing sons because of their 
willingness to be interviewed said wednesday they had decided not 
to talk with reporters about the anniversary 
the thousands of interviews the couple had granted have not 
been helpful and its intrusive it cuts into our privacy patz 
said 
the patzes have two other children shira now 18 and ari 12 
patz told the associated press he doesnt agree with the police 
i think hes still alive but theres not much evidence to 
support that its an article of faith he said 
davis said his squad still receives two to three sightings a 
week on etan from all over the country the lieutenant predicted 
his squad will get more calls because of news stories about the 
anniversary 
the patz family also receives calls from cranks and psychics 
about their son theres a hard core out there patz sighed 
we live with it every day this is just a worse week than 
others he added the parents speak weekly with detective robert 
shaw who handles the case police said 
interest in the case still remains strong it has captured the 
publics imagination like no other case said davis 
when asked why he shook his head if i could answer that i 
think i could solve the case he said

federal programs allowing livestock grazing 
and hay cutting on land taken out of production under this years 
crop acreage programs have been expanded in kansas nebraska and 
iowa agriculture secretary clayton yeutter announced wednesday 
im encouraged by the rain that has fallen in the midwestern 
and great plains growing areas in the past week yeutter said 
in many places the drought has broken however the additional 
relief actions taken today will help reduce livestock selloffs in 
areas where haying and grazing conditions are still not adequate 
yeutter said he will allow statewide emergency haying and 
grazing of cropland normally held out of production under 1989 
commodity programs in states where 75 percent of the counties have 
been designated as already eligible for haying and grazing 
states which meet that requirement are kansas nebraska and 
iowa he said other states will be added when they meet the 75 
percent criterion yeutter also relaxed the departments forage 
sales policy so producers in eligible counties can sell forage from 
the conservation land at full market prices instead of at levels 
only to recover harvest costs which is the current policy 
rain is predicted for much of the midwest and great plains 
areas in the next several days which could prove to be extremely 
beneficial for those growing areas he said the usda drought 
task force will continue to monitor situations on a daily basis 
and forward additional recommendations to me if and when the 
situation warrants it 
in his latest actions yeutter stopped short of approving 
requests from some farm leaders who wanted him to open up for 
haying and grazing millions of acres taken from production under 
the 10year conservation program dozens of states were made 
eligible to cut hay from crp land in last years drought but none 
has been approved for 1989 
kelly shipp yeutters press secretary said we have not 
ruled out opening up crp its just at this point we think that it 
is prudent to watch that very carefully 
asked if some additional states might be near the 75 percent 
level required for statewide haying and grazing approval on idled 
program land shipp said that missouri would be the closest with 
around 50 percent or so of the counties currently eligible

the united nations on wednesday rebuked 
south africa for claiming it has primary authority over namibia 
until the country gains full independence in november 
in a private briefing with the security council 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar stressed that the united 
nations has ultimate authority over military affairs in namibia 
diplomats who attended the meeting said on condition of anonymity 
the un chief drew a clear line between south africas 
responsibility for local law enforcement and the security councils 
authority over any potential callup of the territorial militia or 
the south african army they said 
in a letter to the united nations south african foreign minster 
rf botha said that responsibility for the administration of 
namibia through independence is the primary task of the south 
africanappointed administratorgeneral that includes 
responsibility for maintaining law and order in the territory 
botha said in his letter dated may 19 
south africa agreed to a unmediated independence for namibia 
that began april 1 and is to culminate in elections nov 1 but the 
process was interrupted the day it began when hundreds of armed 
guerrillas from the southwest peoples organization crossed into 
namibia from angola in subsequent fighting 316 guerrillas and 27 
south african security force members were killed 
both said the administratorgeneral louis pienaar has the 
right to use such measures and means as he would deem appropriate 
to counter activities of an aggressive violent or intimidatory 
nature emanating from whatever quarter 
but african diplomats said they were concerned pienaar would 
feel free to recall the army to handle any new incursions by swapo 
the main rebel group in the territory 
under accords signed in december by south africa cuba and 
angola pretoria pledged to cooperate with the plan to make namibia 
an independent black majorityruled nation 
under the un timetable the 50000 south african soldiers in 
namibia were to withdraw by july 1 leaving only 1500 troopers 
confined to base south africas un mission said wednesday that 
their numbers in namibia will be cut to 1500 a week before the

a joint panel on sensitive areas in 
polishsoviet history says the soviet foreign ministers comments 
after poland was invaded in 1939 were contradictory to 
international law and offensive to poland 
a report called origins and beginning of world war ii was 
published wednesday in the communist party newspaper trybuna ludu 
which said it appeared simultaneously in pravda the soviet party 
newspaper 
it includes a reference to the aug 23 1939 hitlerstalin 
nonaggression pact and the secret protocol attached to it defining 
how the nazis and soviets would divide poland 
world war ii began with the german invasion of poland sept 1 
1939 the day after the supreme soviet ratified the agreement 
soviet soldiers invaded from the east sept 17 
foreign minister vyacheslav molotov told the supreme soviet a 
month later that the two armies had wiped out this grotesque 
product of the treaty of versailles the report said 
molotovs statement was contradictory to international law and 
offensive to poland the report declared the present soviet 
leadership and the scientific community of the soviet union 
distance themselves decisively from it 
western historians learned of the secret protocol from captured 
nazi documents the report published wednesday said the original 
could not be found in soviet or other archives 
it also said a soviet goverment statement handed to the polish 
ambassador sept 17 1939 declaring the polish state to be no 
longer in existence was discrepant with the norms of 
international law 
that statement said soviet forces entered poland only to protect 
the inhabitants of western byelorussia and the ukraine 
the course of events connected with the movement of the red 
army in september 1939 to the west requires more detailed 
historical studies the joint report said 
wojciech ziembinski a roman catholic journalist and historian 
said the report only complicates the process of resolving 
historical discrepancies 
this does not satisfy the polish nation in any case and 
certainly does not satisfy polish historians this document will 
receive my reply although i dont know how it will be with the 
censorship said ziembinski who has written extensively on 
polishsoviet relations in world war ii 
two years ago authorities banned an article by ziembinski on 
nazisoviet cooperation in partitioning poland 
for poles the sorest points of mutual history are the murder of 
more than 4000 polish officers in the katyn forest and the 
internment of at least 10000 more in soviet prison camps 
official polish and soviet histories say the nazis killed the 
officers in 1941 but many poles and western historians believe the 
soviets killed them in 1940 
the commission established two years ago has yet to deliver 
its findings on the katyn massacre but a soviet popular magazine 
recently raised the possibility that the soviets were responsible

vermont on wednesday became the first 
state to ban vehicles that use ozonedepleting chemicals in their 
air conditioning 
americans are ready to take tough actions to protect our 
fragile environment even if it requires changing our own behavior 
or giving up certain luxuries gov madeleine kunin said in 
signing the legislation into law 
by enacting this important legislation vermonters are 
demonstrating that we are willing to act immediately to protect the 
stratospheric ozone layer she said 
the ban covers the sale or registration of 1993 models that use 
chlorofluorocarbons a class of chemical blamed for destroying the 
ozone layer that protects the earth from the suns harmful 
ultraviolet rays 
car air conditioning systems are the single largest source of 
ozone depletion from the united states 
the legislation takes other more immediate steps to reduce cfc 
emissions 
starting in 1991 equipment used to service air conditioners 
in vehicles must recycle the cfc coolant rather than release it 
into the atmosphere 
as of march 1 1990 cfc recycling equipment must be used to 
service building air conditioners and large refrigeration units if 
such equipment is portable and suitable for those purposes 
the sale of cfc recharge kits will be prohibited so that 
consumers cannot circumvent the laws recycling requirements by 
servicing their own cars air conditioning systems 
the sale of cfcbased fire extinguishers consumer cleaning 
sprays and cfcpropelled party streamers and horns is also 
prohibited 
despite years of research into a replacement coolant the 
nations big three automakers have said they doubt they can meet 
the 1993 deadline 
there is no way any manufacturer will be able to modify its 
entire car line for vermont in essentially three years ford 
motor co spokeswoman beryl goldsweig said earlier this month

their roles in a stonethrowing riot in which a jewish guard 
accidentally killed an israeli teenager 
the shooting attack was the second reported against israeli 
security forces in bethlehem in two days no one was hurt in either 
incident 
the attacks have fueled concern over palestinian threats to step 
up violence against israeli targets by using guns a police van was 
hit in mondays shooting 
soldiers on wednesday carried out two in a series of more than 
30 predawn raids on west bank villages this week in which dozens 
of suspected palestinian activists have been arrested

baker iii of harming the chances of israels peace plan and 
breaking the practice of not speaking publicly about usisraeli 
disagreements 
in a nablus military court five palestinians were convicted and 
jailed in connection with the death of 15yearold tirza porat 
the death caused a furor in israel last year because of the 
conflicting explanations of what happened jewish settlers claimed 
the girl was stoned to death or shot by palestinians who attacked 
her and fellow settlers while they were on a hike in the west bank 
but the army later said she was shot accidentally by an israeli 
guard who was hit by a stone during the april 6 1988 rioting in 
beita village 
in court the five defendants confessed to crimes in the 
incident in which the israelis shot and killed two palestinians

jail for forcing the hikers into a violent situation and attempting 
to stab the guard his companions were sentenced to terms of

bank village of biddya 16 miles east of tel aviv no one was 
injured but the car was totally gutted by the flames israel radio 
said 
the army on wednesday asked for an additional 233 million to 
put down the 17month uprising against israeli occupation of the 
west bank and gaza strip it is the same amount that was cut when 
the militarys 589 billion allotment was approved in february 
in the latest army offensive arab reports said troops 
wednesday deported to jordan six women and 10 children because the 
women overstayed permits allowing them to visit their palestinian 
husbands

mr bakers speech may make it more difficult to get 
european support for the plan said arens the things that were 
expressed publicly were harmful to the state of israel 
the plan calls for electing palestinians to negotiate with 
israel on selfrule in the territories with talks in three years 
on the final status of the occupied lands palestinians oppose the 
plan because it does not offer independence or israeli withdrawal

the house voted wednesday to pump an extra 
822 million into federal efforts this year against illegal drugs 
but decided not to increase antidrug spending even more by taking 
money out of the star wars research budget 
on a partyline 227197 vote in which the chambers majority 
democrats prevailed the house finally passed a 37 billion 
domestic spending measure for fiscal 1989 that included 822 
million for antidrug efforts the legislation was a pareddown 
version of a 47 billion bill the house refused to pass a month 
ago 
but on a 213205 vote lawmakers rejected a measure that would 
have transferred to next years drug programs any 1990 spending for 
star wars missile defense research above this years 37 billion 
president bush has sought nearly 900 million more for star wars in 
fiscal 1990 which begins oct 1 
on a 4090 vote the house then reiterated its support for a 
12 billion measure for hardpressed veterans programs a bill 
that has bounced back and forth between congress two chambers 
because of a dispute between them over pet projects the vote sent 
the legislation back to the senate which has approved a smaller 
version 
the democratic effort to bolster antidrug initiatives was 
opposed by the bush administration and put republicans in the 
politically embarrassing position of having to vote against higher 
drug spending house minority leader robert michel rill called 
the two measures containing the drug funds a twoheaded 
malodorous swamp animal 
nonetheless gop lawmakers argued the extra money for drug 
programs could wait until next year and would add even more red ink 
to the federal deficit they also insisted that spending for 
antimissile research should not be whittled down 
nobodys opposed to putting more money for drugs said 
silvio conte of massachusetts ranking republican on the house 
appropriations committee what we are opposed to is the 
irresponsible way were doing it 
but democrats argued that congress should provide money for the 
antidrug abuse act enacted last year and finance a struggle 
against drug traffickers that president bush emphasized during his 
campaign last year 
lets put our resources behind this war said rep jim 
chapman dtexas 
the domestic spending bill contained 822 million for new 
prisons extra law officers and other antidrug initiatives it 
included 893 million for the guaranteed student loan program for 
college students 423 million for staterun foster care programs 
342 million for the costs of battling last years western forest 
fire and money for other programs 
it also contains a provision that would grant the latrobe 
brewing co a temporary exemption from a federal law that requires 
alcoholic beverage containers to carry health warnings latrobe had 
complained that the painted labels on the beer it brews rolling 
rock would be too expensive to alter the measure was sponsored by 
rep john murtha dpa whose district includes latrobe pa 
on april 26 a 47 billion version of the measure failed to 
gain house approval after lawmakers voted down a plan by democratic 
leaders to pay for the bill by cutting domestic and defense 
programs by 057 percent 
the separate measure to transfer spending from star wars to 
federal drug initiatives was sponsored by a trio of democratic 
liberals les aucoin of oregon george miller of california and 
marty russo of illinois it would freeze 1990 star wars spending at 
the 1989 level of 37 billion and transfer the amount by which 
that program was to grow 862 million to next years drug 
efforts 
last thursday the house took the 12 billion for veterans out 
of the domestic spending bill after republicans the bush 
administration and veterans groups complained that disputes over 
other portions of the legislation were bogging down the veterans 
funds 
the house then passed the separate 12 billion veterans bill 
which provides money for health care a costofliving benefits 
increase and other programs run by the department of veterans 
affairs 
several hours later however the senate approved a different 
version of the bill providing only enough money for veterans 
initiatives through june 15 or about 75 million the senate then 
left on its memorial day recess which lasts until may 31 
senators argued that by saving most of the needed veterans money 
for a later bill they could attach to that measure spending for 
programs they favor chairman robert byrd dwva of the senate 
appropriations committee singled out 66 million needed this year 
for a program that subsidizes airlines serving remote communities 
members of the house objected to this wednesday claiming that 
veterans would suffer so the senate could win approval for programs 
it favors 
the senate wont release the veterans as hostages conte 
said 
the 12 billion for veterans was also included in the houses 
larger domestic spending bill house members argued that by putting 
the money in both measures it enhanced their bargaining position 
for upcoming negotiations with the senate on the legislation

for poles the sorest points of mutual history are the murder of 
more than 4000 polish officers in the katyn forest and the 
internment of at least 10000 more in soviet prison camps 
official polish and soviet histories say the nazis killed the 
officers in 1941 but many poles and western historians believe the 
soviets killed them in 1940 
the commission established two years ago has yet to deliver 
its findings on the katyn massacre but a soviet popular magazine 
recently raised the possibility that the soviets were responsible

senegal and the african neighbors may go to war mauritanias 
interior minister said wednesday 
djibrill ould abdallahi said in an interview on the french 
television network antenne 2 that mauritania was ready to make war 
if senegal makes it 
when a frontier that seemed to be settled is thrown into 
question and troops mass on the other side one is obliged to do 
the same thing he said without providing any details on 
senegalese troop movement 
he said mauritania massed troops on the border along the senegal 
river although he declined to give their precise location or 
number 
asked if war was possible said it was 
he said france was partially responsible for the conflict 
because it transferred people from one country to the other during 
colonial rule

mauritanians in senegal in recent weeks has left an estimated 260 
people dead the dispute between the countries has long historical 
and racial roots but the latest confrontation was sparked by a 
minor border incident near the river in april

house majority leader tom foley of washington 
was the center of speculation wednesday as the oddson favorite to 
succeed jim wright as speaker should the embattled texas 
congressmen be forced to relinquish his leadership post 
there is near unanimity of support for tom foley said rep 
pat williams dmont 
but as sources said wrights lawyers were negotiating a deal 
under which he would step down in exchange for dropping the most 
serious ethics charges against him there was no guarantee that 
foley who has spent 25 of his 60 years in the house would gain 
the top house post without opposition 
foley a former prosecutor from spokane emerged as a democratic 
leader in 1974 when younger house democrats overturned the 
longstanding seniority system he became chairman of the 
agriculture committee that year and moved into the leadership in 
1980 when he was made majority whip the thirdranking position 
rep richard gephardt of missouri was mentioned as one possible 
democratic oopponent for foley but in the supercharged political 
atmosphere of a house in transition there was no shortage of names 
mentioned for other leadership posts vacant or otherwise 
i dont think the angel gabriel could beat tom foley said 
one congressman who insisted on anonymity 
but there also was talk of a clean sweep ticket that would 
seek to oust all members of the current leadership including foley 
and majority whip tony coelho of california 
if wright were to leave the speakers post the chambers 260 
democrats would then choose a successor 
lawyers for the speaker were discussing an arrangement under 
which wright would resign his post in exchange for the ethics 
committee dropping the most serious charges against him said 
sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
one house member who has been a wright supporter said speaking 
only on condition of anonymity that he had found no evidence on 
the house floor that anyone was maneuvering overtly to garner 
support for a leadership race 
coelho the thirdranking member of the house leadership has 
his own ethics problems the congressman has acknowledged that he 
failed to disclose a 50000 loan from a savings and loan in 
california that he used toward purchase of 100000 worth of junk 
bonds 
mentioned as the possible slate to replace the current 
leadership were rep richard gephardt of missouri for speaker rep 
ed jenkins of georgia for majority leader and rep bill gray of 
pennsylvania for whip 
such a bid would be considered highly unlikely and none of those 
named would acknowledge any such ambition 
gephardt an unsuccessful candidate for the 1988 democratic 
presidential nomination is a former chairman of the house 
democratic caucus and is widely respected by his colleagues 
i dont want to answer hypothetical questions responded 
gephardt when asked if were planning to run for speaker a 
response considered significant for its lack of a direct denial he 
was also mentioned as a potential candidate for majority leader if 
foley succeeded to the speakership 
gray succeeded gephardt as caucus chairman after serving as 
chairman of the house budget committee he is the only black in the 
current leadership 
jenkins strength in speculation was based on his southern base 
should wright resign there would be no southerner in the 
leadership ranks 
othere names circulating as potential leadership candidates were 
two powerful committee chairmen rep dan rostenkowski of illinois 
of the ways and means committee and rep john dingell of michigan 
who heads the energy and commerce committee 
if wright were to resign said dingell i would expect the 
majority leader tom foley to be a candidate and i support him 
if foley chose not to seek the speakership i would consider 
my own options at the appropriate time said dingell 
rostenkowski was described as happy with his chairmanship and 
unlikely to bid for the leadership his background in chicago 
machine politics also was considered a detriment should he change 
his mind

the turkish breakaway state on cyprus 
claimed ownership wednesday of sixth century mosaics already 
involved in a tugofwar between an indianapolis art dealer and the 
republic of cyprus 
the selfproclaimed turkish republic of northern cyprus asked 
us district court for permission to intervene in a lawsuit filed 
in march by the greek cypriot republic and the greek orthodox 
church of cyprus 
experts believe the case could lead to a landmark decision on 
worldwide dealing in national art treasures 
cyprus claims art dealer peg goldberg of suburban carmel 
purchased the rare mosaics illegally and they should be returned to 
the church 
turkish cyprus asked judge james e noland to delay the civil 
trial which is scheduled to begin next tuesday noland did not 
rule immediately 
as far as were concerned there cannot be a full adjudication 
of these issues without the input of the people who have control 
over that land mass said joseph d youssouf a freehold nj 
attorney representing the turkish occupation state 
turks have governed the northern third of the mediterranean 
island since turkish forces invaded in 1974 the turkish occupation 
state is not recognized by any nation except turkey 
you can say that something doesnt exist but if you can prove 
that it does has a flag a national anthem a population and 
regulates the territory from which these four mosaics were stolen 
we are a real party in this case youssouf said 
goldberg a county commissioner in hamilton county north of 
indianapolis bought the mosaics for 11 million in july 1988 from 
a turkish dealer in switzerland she claims she has legal title to 
them under swiss law 
the rare mosaics are made of glass and were once part of a much 
larger work in the church of panagia kanakaria in the cypriot 
village of lythrankomi the 2footsquare mosaics depict the heads 
of the christ child the apostles james and matthew and an 
archangel experts say they are among only a handful of artworks 
surviving from the first centuries of christianity 
the republic of cyprus and the church of cyprus claim agents of 
the turkish occupation state surreptitiously ripped the mosaics 
from the walls of the church in 1979 
court records show the mosaics were allowed to leave cyprus 
under an export document purportedly signed by osman orek who 
acted as prime minister for turkish cyprus orek denies signing the 
document and will testify in indianapolis if allowed to do so 
youssouf said 
turkish cyprus is asking for the return of the mosaics for 
restoration in the church unspecified damages and court costs

a bill to require registration of 
semiautomatic assault rifles was killed wednesday and louisiana 
lawmakers said it was unlikely the sportsmans paradise would 
adopt any gun legislation this year 
gun control proponents said rural legislators had failed to 
appreciate the problems of violent crime in new orleans and other 
metropolitan areas 
the house committee on criminal justice deferred action on the 
bill effectively killing it 
sponsor rep cr jones said he at least wanted to get the 
attention of the committee that something needs to be done 
rep diana bajoie gave up earlier on her bill to prohibit the 
sale and possession of assault weapons 
i sense the mood of this committee but sooner or later were 
going to have to keep these weapons out of the hands of people who 
use them for the wrong reasons bajoie said 
backers of bills to set waiting periods for handgun buyers said 
they expect no better luck when their measures are considered 
thursday 
what gun control advocates failed to consider is that louisiana 
where license plates read sportsmans paradise is a largely 
rural state where hunting and owning guns are ways of life said 
rep ed scogin 
you outlaw guns and only the outlaws will own them said 
scogin 
jones said that a few months ago a teenager in new orleans 
stole a shipment of israelimade uzi assault weapons from a boxcar 
he was selling them in the projects for 80 apiece said 
jones a 16yearold has been charged with killing someone with 
an uzi

the perjury trial of former us rep pat 
swindall moved closer to opening arguments wednesday as attorneys 
finished questioning potential jurors 
the attorneys next will choose from a group of 33 jurors and 
opening arguments could come thursday in the trial in which 
swindall stands accused of lying to a federal grand jury 
investigating money laundering 
fortyseven potential jurors were questioned over two days 
regarding their knowledge of the heavily publicized case and their 
feelings about the former republican congressman 
us district judge richard c freeman dismissed 14 thirteen 
said they possibly could not put aside their unfavorable 
impressions of swindall and be impartial jurors and the 14th was a 
former law partner of swindall 
at least eight of the 33 people in the jury pool said they too 
had unfavorable opinions about swindall but could put them aside 
and decide the case on the basis of the evidence 
the potential juror pool also includes one woman a former 
swindall fundraiser who said she admires swindall but 
promised to be openminded 
defense attorneys have asked the judge to move the trial because 
of extensive publicity but freeman said he would rule only after 
hearing from potential jurors

federal grand jury investigating his dealings with charles 
lechasney an associate and nowadmitted money launderer and a

grand jury his discussions of how to cover up the sources of an 
850000 loan to be used to pay for his home swindall returned 
uncashed a check for the first installment of the loan

gen manuel antonio noriega told an 
international delegation wednesday that the united states is to 
blame for panamas political crisis 
we told them our truth the general panamas de facto 
leader said in a brief statement after meeting with organization 
of american states delegates for 2 hours 
noriega commander of the armed forces told a news conference 
the threehour meeting had been postive and gave the defense 
forces an opportunity to express their idea about the economic 
aggression and the foreign intervention that caused the 
deterioration in panama 
each officer spoke of his concept of this reality he went 
on we talked about the intimidation of outrages of excessive 
foreign presence and intimidation by air sea land submarine 
even the ozone layer has suffered intervention he joked 
president bush sent about 2000 extra us troops to panama 
after the government nullified the may 7 presidential election and 
noriega supporters beat up opposition candidates 
when he was asked what he planned to do noriega thought a 
second and said thats the million dollar question 
an aide said noriega told the delegation his resignation is an 
issue that would be decided by the defense forces not by an oas 
request 
international observers say the election was won by opposition 
candidate guillermo endara over noriegas candidate carlos duque 
the government said duque won 
the delegation led by oas secretary general joao baena soares 
included foreign ministers diego cordovez of ecuador mario 
palencia of guatemala and sahadeo basdeo of trinidad and tobago 
earlier the delegates met with leaders of the opposition and 
the roman catholic church opposition leaders told the delegation 
they wanted their election victory recognized and noriega retired 
we want democracy and justice for the people of panama 
endara said after meeting with the delegation 
endara and his two vicepresidential candidates ricardo arias 
calderon and guillermo ford were accompanied by 300 cheering 
supporters as they marched several blocks from a church to the oas 
delegations hotel 
about 25 riot police wielding bullhorns peacefully dispersed the 
crowd opposition spokesmen said one bodyguard and an arias 
calderon aide were arrested 
acting president manuel solis palma said no new elections were 
possible before sept 1 when his term as minister in charge of 
the presidency is supposed to end 
solis palma told a meeting of bureaucrats that new balloting 
could not be held because of the expense and because of the 
psychological condition of the panmanian people after the trauma of 
the elections 
he suggested he would continue in office citing an 
administrative code that says a person must serve until he is 
replaced 
juridically there is no problem but politically we will have 
to define a transfer of power he said adding it could 
possibly be the succession of one person by another of the same 
group 
after the nullification the oas passed a resolution criticizing 
noriega and calling for a transfer of power in the shortest 
possible time 
we want recognition of our electoral victory and the 
retirement of general noriega arias calderon said wednesday 
we will not betray the people the may 7 vote is a mandate 
from god said endara the oas listened but didnt want to 
comment they said they would like to meet again 
the march wednesday marked the fourth time the opposition has 
defied a government ban on demonstrations in effect until june 5 
when the oas commission is due to file its report 
on tuesday night the panamanian government presented its case 
against the united states during a meeting with the oas delegation 
solis palmas government has said it hoped the mission would 
establish the truth of the crisis as a conflict between panama 
and the united states and cited us economic sanctions as proof 
of malice 
the government also has proclaimed it will accept no 
interference in internal panamanian affairs and that some aspects 
of the oas resolution violate the oas charter 
the first street demonstrations against noriegas rule began in 
june of 1987 
since then noriega has been indicted on us drug charges 
charges he says are part of a us plot to renege on its commitment 
to give up the panama canal at the end of 1999

house speaker jim wright his political career 
of 35 years in shambles bargained through lawyers wednesday to 
resign his leadership post in exchange for the dismissal of some of 
the ethics charges confronting him 
wright denied that he was considering stepping down and issued a 
statement saying he would press ahead with his defense even 
so democrats were looking beyond his departure to selection of a 
succcessor and apparently closing ranks behind majority leader 
tom foley of washington 
wrights representatives shuttled through a daylong series of 
meetings with key members of congress in a bid to nail down an 
unprecedented agreement stripping him of his post as leader of the 
house and second in line of succession to the presidency within a 
week the extraordinary drama of political abdication overwhelmed 
normal business at the capitol even though it was played out 
almost exclusively behind closed doors 
what i know is that negotiations are taking place that deal 
with resolving this issue very soon said rep bill richardson 
dnm they involve dropping one of the charges in exchange for 
the speaker resigning the post and its something that will 
probably be settled in the next 24 to 48 hours other sources 
suggested it would be next week before the issue was resolved 
richardson said he understood wright would retain his house seat 
under the terms of the discussions but there was no word on 
whether the speaker would seek reelection from his fort worth 
congressional district in 1990 
other sources said the deal involved dropping 
conflictofinterest charges that wright accepted gifts of housing 
and a car and salary for his wife if those charges were dropped 
wright could step down as early as next week the sources said 
but sources said the committee was not receptive to any 
arrangement that would clear wright of charges that he evaded house 
limits on outside income through bulk sales of his book 
reflections of a public man 
one congressman familiar with the talks speaking on condition 
of anonymity said a majority of the ethics committee favored some 
sort of negotiated settlement but the ethics committee adjourned 
late wednesday until june 1 without acting on wrights case and 
sources said the negotiations were continuing 
rep julian dixon dcalif the panels chairman met at one 
point during the afternoon with foley to discuss wrights situation 
at the same time the timing of any resignation was uncertain 
and rep john myers of indiana the ranking republican said i 
personally am opposed to any arrangements deals plea bargaining 
its kind of a dance a very tentative kind of dance said 
one house member who spoke only on condition of anonymity 
in the background the politics of succession flourished 
there is near unanimity of support for tom foley as speaker 
said rep pat williams dmont there would be no campaign for 
the top leadership post he said 
even so rep richard gephardt of missouri was careful not to 
dampen speculation that he might seek the speakers job and a long 
list of contenders was mentioned to take foleys rung on the 
leadership ladder and vie for other spots the partys whip tony 
coelho of california caucus chairman bill gray of pennsylvania 
deputy whip david bonior of michigan rep lee hamilton of indiana 
and gephardt headed the roster of potential candidates 
house republican leader robert michel rill who normally has 
avoided comment on wrights plight said i guess if i had that 
kind of a problem i wouldnt be around here if the conditions 
were exactly the same and i were dragging my party into the kind of 
area that i see id have no alternative but to step aside 
wright who spent his day in a serious of meetings with his 
supporters and his leadership team left the capitol early in the 
evening without speaking to reporters 
the speaker also issued a statement saying i very firmly 
believe that my position is right i hope and trust that the 
committee will consider the matter on its merits and dismiss the 
charges 
i eagerly await the time and opportunity when my side of this 
whole question may be heard clearly by my colleagues and the 
american people to this end i shall press ahead 
rep robert torricelli dnj a member of wrights defense 
team met with ethics committee counsel richard j phelan and made 
the initial offer the sources said the proposal ran into 
opposition from ethics committee republicans and still was being 
negotiated said the sources who commented only on condition they 
not be named 
the ethics committee made up of six democrats and six 
republicans met for much of the day in private deliberating 
wrights motion to dismiss the two most serious allegations the 
chairman rep julian dixon dcalif promised a fresh look 
but there was no indication any of the committee members had been 
persuaded 
other signs were ominous for wright as fellow texas democrats 
began to talk openly of growing odds against his keeping his post 
the most serious allegations facing wright are that he used bulk 
sales of an autobiographical book to evade rules limiting outside 
income and that he improperly took gifts from a developer friend 
who had a direct interest in legislation 
earlier wednesday entering a luncheon with texas democrats 
wright was asked about widespread speculation that he was 
considering stepping aside as speaker until the ethics case is 
resolved 
no im not he answered 
asked whether his political position was eroding he said i 
dont feel that at all 
however a fellow texas democrat in the house mickey leland 
said there is some hint jim might step aside at least 
temporarily until this whole thing is resolved 
wright met with clark clifford an elder statesman of the 
democratic party and a member of wrights legal defense team for 
1 hours wednesday morning and torricelli later met with ethics 
committee attorney phelan 
when asked whether there was a deal in the works to drop some of 
the charges against wright in return for his stepping down the 
speakers spokesman mark johnson declined comment 
theres no question the speaker is in serious trouble said 
rep charles stenholm dtexas the speakers problems have 
translated into institutional problems for all of us the 
institution is getting a black eye 
stenholm said some of his constituents now are telling him the 
evidence against wright is overwhelming and that where theres 
that much smoke charlie theres gotta be a spark somewhere 
he added there obviously have been some mistakes made some 
rules if not broken bent severely 
public opinion is weighted against him at this time added 
leland i think the die is cast there is still a glimmer of hope 
he might survive but the cards are stacked against him 
rep philip sharp dind who previously called for a 
leadership change embraced the idea of wright stepping down at 
least temporarily and appointing a replacement there is a state 
of continuing erosion of public confidence in the house and i 
dont think thats a good state for anybody sharp said 
on tuesday night wright had told reporters i want to be an 
effective person in america and ive had that privilege most of 
all now i want to protect my good name and that of my family and my 
wife and my colleagues 
the ethics committees two senior members indicated there was 
nothing new in the fiery arguments they heard a day earlier from 
wrights lawyer stephen susman during a televised hearing 
my mind wasnt changed said myers the committees senior 
republican there were no new points raised absolutely no new 
points 
dixon said i think mr susman indicated in his remarks that 
he was not optimistic that any or all of them would be dismissed 
but i do think we have a responsibility to reassess that and give 
it a fresh look

nearly 200 teachers went on strike 
wednesday in the first serious display of worker discontent since 
january when the government announced a tough austerity plan to 
fight 20000percent inflation 
educators at two schools split from the national union and gave 
the leftist sandinista government a deadline to answer demands for 
pay raises and other improvements 
the prosandinista national educators association of nicaragua 
known as anden by its spanish initials struck a conciliatory note 
the nationwide labor union backed most demands but warned 
proimperialist and rightist pseudoleaders against instigating 
strikes 
this is the crucial moment to reach our vindication and we 
cant lose it said teacher cesar cuevas this is the awakening 
of the teaching profession 
monthly salaries now range from 2162 for high school teachers 
to 8108 for college professors 
cuevas is a member of the negotiating committee from the mexico 
experimental center one of two schools in managua that gave the 
government until thursday afternoon to answer the teachers demands 
for better pay and working conditions 
the mexico experimental center a high school has 120 teachers 
while the other school maestro gabriel has 112 teachers 
in san rafael del sur a town 30 miles south of managua the 
entire force of 198 teachers was on indefinite strike until our 
situation has been solved said orlando estrada garcia principal 
at the ricardo morales aviles elementary school 
today they came from the education ministry with an offer 
which we didnt think is correct said estrada the 5000 
cordobas we earn daily doesnt cover anything you buy a soft drink 
and a piece of bread and there goes your 5000 cordobas 
estrada said the 47 teachers at the school earn an average 
150000 cordobas monthly and they are demanding a tripling of the 
salary although even 600000 cordobas a month would barely cover 
a familys basic needs 
at the current rate of exchange of 7400 cordobas to the dollar 
150000 cordobas equals 2027 and 600000 is worth 8108 
olivia sanchez de solis principal of the jose ignacio estrada 
high school in san rafael del sur said representatives of the 
teachers would meet with government officials on thursday 
the government also has been meeting with teachers in managua to 
negotiate a solution but already it has said that granting pay 
raises would undo its antiinflationary measures 
inflation in 1988 reached more than 20000 percent 
anden issued a communique saying the teachers had legitimate 
grievances but a pay raise would make inflation explosive and 
would not contribute to the logic of the governments economic 
measures 
barricada the official newspaper of the ruling sandinista 
national liberation front accused rightwing politicians and the 
us embassy of trying to manipulate the teachers discontent

hoards of homeless wont be dispatched in 
bus loads to this celebrity beach retreat in spite of actor martin 
sheens official welcome for them in his capacity as honorary mayor 
there will not be any buses things have spiraled to such a 
degree they are out of my control rush limbaugh a nationally 
syndicated radio talk show host who had threatened to organize a 
homeless march on malibu said wednesday 
sheens declaration offering malibu as a nuclearfree homeless 
sanctuary triggered limbaughs proposal to arrive saturday with 
busloads of indigents but the continuing uproar gave limbaugh 
second thoughts 
call me a coward call me a wimp but i am doing what is 
right he said in a telephone interview from new york the 
bottom line is that i will not be able to guarantee their safety 
limbaugh a conservative has been needling sheen and what he 
calls the hollywood left coast for years and limbaugh had 
maintained busing homeless to malibu was a fair response to sheens 
declaration 
but on wednesday he said i dont have to bring a bunch of 
homeless down there to prove my point the left just loves evidence 
that we conservatives are heartless and cold 
olivia thornton the chamber of commerce president who picked 
sheen as honorary mayor expressed relief 
meanwhile los angeles homeless activist ted hayes said 
wednesday he felt limbaugh had a point 
why doesnt martin take them in his house how can he go 
around the country and tell everybody they should do something and 
then he has no plan in his own neighborhood he asked 
the declaration sparking nearly two weeks of turmoil in malibu 
read i hereby declare malibu a nuclear free zone a sanctuary 
for aliens and the homeless and a protected environment for all 
life wild and tame 
hayes sees a positive side to the malibu brouhaha although he 
believes sheens days as honorary mayor are numbered 
malibu can set an example for all the other affluent 
communities he said i think martin sheen was a godsend for 
the chamber of commerce everyone knows there are homeless now 
its time for a yesinmybackyard campaign 
sheen who has been in canada directing gary busey and son 
charlie sheen in the movie count a lonely cadence wasnt 
available for comment on the latest developments his publicist 
said 
the actor who once portrayed a homeless activist himself in a 
movie made for television has said his remarks were misunderstood

the goal is to blitz cancer cells with huge doses of killer

down the cancer deep within the body 
in initial experimental use researchers found that the strategy

gospel rescue missions long a champion 
in the inner city for the homeless are responding to a whole new 
range of needs that were practically unthinkable even a decade ago 
expansion in the role of these downtown missions was highlighted 
at the recent annual convention of representatives of about 300 
such missions in cities across the country 
it long has been a stereotype that they mostly serve older 
alcoholics and drug abusers however young adults women and 
children are just as likely to seek help these days 
that has put a growing load on rescue missions to meet needs not 
met by state or other agencies 
in the last 10 to 15 years things have changed drastically 
said the rev stephen burger president of the international union 
of gospel missions weve been called on to do things we hadnt 
done before 
a look at some of the issues raised at the iugms 76th annual 
conference here earlier this month tells part of the story aids 
childrens nutrition unschooled minors battered women drugs 
it used to be almost unheard of to have to worry about children 
in the missions burger commented at the close of the fiveday 
conference but women and children now are the fastest growing 
proportion of those served now amounting to about 40 percent 
burger nephew of retired supreme court chief justice warren 
burger in august will become executive director of the nonprofit 
protestant organization which oversees some 300 rescue missions in 
the united states and canada 
he says there has been a vast upheaval in the social fabric of 
this country today there are millions of homeless in america a 
population that continues to grow and become more diverse he 
says 
no city has been left untouched by the homeless problem he 
notes suggesting a look at the shuttered up steelmill towns of 
pennsylvania or a place like astoria ore population 15000 
i thought of that as a picturebook place and here they were 
with the fishing industry falling apart the lumber industry 
falling apart alcoholism on the rise and all of a sudden 
recalls burger we have a homeless problem 
astoria is one of a number of cities across the country which 
have turned to the iugm in setting up programs for the homeless and 
what burger calls the nearhomeless or those people whose 
whole condition is unstable and regularly move in and out of the 
system 
he says there is agreement on causes of the homeless crisis the 
disintegration of the family changing values drug and alcohol 
abuse a changing economy 
what is not so clear are what the solutions will be 
but there is reason to hope burger says the church has 
become awakened to the possibilities 
he says there are more volunteers and churches which over the 
years have tended to move away from the inner city are getting more 
involved 
he says one key is to persuade people to pitch in 
part of the problem is weve challenged but we havent told 
them what to do you have to provide the vehicle to get people 
downtown a formidable task burger says when there are already 
so many demands on peoples daily lives 
another key he adds is creating innovative programs to help 
those trying to rebuild shattered lives 
even those of us in this work can get a fortress mentality 
and not see the new needs the mentally ill the hispanics the 
folks being dumped out of hospitals the elderly being kicked out 
of homes being turned into condos burger says 
government can provide funding but it cant get involved with 
people on a personal level to help overcome years of abuse 
alcoholism 
burger says the thinking now must be how do you get that 
person to see with gods help what they can do as well as 
what are you doing to keep people out of the mission 
under the bush administration the homeless could fare better 
he believes 
i think the problem is quite obvious at this point and it 
seems secretary of housing and urban development jack kemp has a 
real commitment burger says 
for others out in the communities wanting to commit themselves 
to the homeless issue burger plans to develop videos of model 
programs across the country

this was supposed to be national tap dance 
day but congress never got around to proclaiming it its had 
trouble getting around to a lot of things this year 
this was going to be the historic highpowered 101st congress 
so far the bicentennial session has been long on ceremony and 
heavy on intramural disputes 
chief among them now is the ethics case against house speaker 
jim wright of texas the top democratic official in the government 
struggling to hold onto his job 
as he tried to get the major charges dismissed wrights lawyer 
suggested to the ethics committee that the tough line against the 
speaker is part of the fallout from other episodes such as senate 
rejection of the nomination of john g tower a former republican 
senator from texas to be secretary of defense and the continuing 
effort to deal with the savings and loan crisis 
along with those issues came one in which wright himself played 
the leading role the 50 percent congressional pay raise originally 
programmed to go through without a vote it was derailed and 
defeated after a public outcry led the speaker to put it to a roll 
call 
wrights own ethics case is a distraction or worse although 
other democratic leaders insist it has not diverted the house from 
conducting its regular business wright himself takes a somewhat 
different line insisting the charges are unfounded and should be 
dropped so that congress can concentrate on the work of governing 
three major measures that have passed this session are a 117 
trillion federal budget for the fiscal year beginning next oct 1 
a measure providing limited aid to the nicaraguan contras and a 
455 hourly minimum wage bill 
the budget wasnt really legislated it was negotiated with the 
administration at the urging of the democratic leaders of congress 
and of president bush to make the deal the negotiators put aside 
contentious tax and spending questions until next year 
its no more smoke and mirrors than in the past said sen 
pete domenici of new mexico senior republican on the budget 
committee and he said the process that produced the budget 
agreement is itself a stride toward a better way of doing things in 
the future 
the contra package was a negotiated deal too and it is subject 
to an intricate system of congressional vetoes 
the minimum wage increase will be an issue not a law for a 
while yet the democratic congress raised the rate past the level 
bush said he would accept but by margins that are not wide enough 
to override a veto the lines are drawn on that one and despite 
his preference for compromise and bipartisanship bush cant afford 
to back down

think theyre right 
early in the session sen alfonse damato rny introduced 
his joint resolution to designate today as national tap dance day 
this being the birthday of bill bojangles robinson born in 
richmond va in 1878 
he proposed to honor robinson king of the tap dancers and 
to refocus the attention of the nation on american tap dancing 
rep john conyers jr dmich introduced the resolution in the 
house and added some more bojangles lore 
he coined the phrase everything is copasetic which means 
its going along just fine conyers said unfortunately this 
phrase no longer holds true for the art form he brought to near 
perfection 
nor for the resolution which never got to the floor for the 
routine approval that is customary on such commemorative measures 
but then not much is copasetic in congress these days

treat williams who made a name for himself 
playing offbeat characters in often obscure films earlier in his 
career has been on a mainstream roll lately 
williams played a hippie in the film version of the musical 
hair a cop tugged by divided loyalties in prince of the 
city a charming airliner hijacker in the pursuit of db 
cooper and a seedy casanova in smooth talk 
in third degree burn premiering sunday on hbo he plays a 
more accessible character a hardluck private detective he also 
plays a drug enforcement agent in next seasons nbc miniseries 
desperados the kiki camarena story and a reporter in the 
theatrical film the heart of dixie 
ive had a tendency in the past to play characters more on the 
edge of normalcy he said in my younger years i was more into 
character work and not leading men as ive gotten into my late 
30s im playing characters in the mainstream of life not on the 
edge of life like my character in smooth talk 
the screenplays that writers are writing for men in their late 
30s are more interesting the characters are more interesting life 
is more complex and they are more complex theyve lived longer 
and had more experiences the simple fact of the mechanics of the 
business is that you try to find the best role in the best story 
directed by the best director that you can among all the options 
available to you 
the movie the heart of dixie also stars ally sheedy 
virginia madsen and phoebe cates it takes place in alabama but was 
filmed in oxford miss 
i spent two months on the picture but i didnt work that much 
on it williams said i got to travel and see a lot of the 
south 
williams is now preparing for a broadway musical version of 
elmer gantry sinclair lewis story of a 1930s evangelist who 
turned out to be a charlatan it will be his first musical since 
the pirates of penzance 
meanwhile he is completing his role as dea agent ray carson in 
desperadoes steven bauer and craig t nelson also star in the

there 
in third degree burn williams plays scott weston a former 
policeman who supports himself by investigating smalltime divorce 
cases hes hired to check up on anne scholes played by virginia 
madsen 
scott has an achilles heel which sets the plot in motion 
said williams he has a tendency to sleep with other mens wives 
he becomes involved with the woman hes investigating he becomes 
ensnared in a trap that includes murder and spends most of his time 
trying to figure out how he got there 
its a film noir said williams i hope it doesnt seem 
imitative im sure every story has been told at least once we 
were trying to tell a contemporary story but it certainly falls 
into the category of film noir 
the movie directed by roger spottiswoode was filmed in tucson 
and seattle 
williams who lives in vermont usually flies to locations in 
his own twoengine piper seneca i have as much flying time as 
most airline copilots he said i call it twa for treat 
williams airlines 
he began flying while at the kent school in connecticut 
my high school coach lost my ring he explained he said 
he couldnt pay me the 35 but since he was a flying instructor he 
would give me two free lessons i soloed when i was 17 and bought 
my first plane when i was 21 and doing grease on broadway 
williams was married last june to pamela van sant a modern 
dancer and actress they were married by one of his former 
classmates now an episcopal minister and headmaster of the kent 
school

as the legitimate investment world has boomed in 
the 1980s so has its dark underside where the ripoff artists ply 
their trade 
stories abound of operations selling gold that is actually 
dirt penny stocks at pumpedup prices packages of government 
securities that never existed and tax shelter deals that cant 
stand up to the slightest scrutiny 
of course financial scams are just about as old as the history 
of money a lot of the ploys in use today are merely recycled 
versions of schemes dreamed up long ago 
but the volatility of all securities markets in this decade and 
the fastbuck atmosphere it has helped foster seems to have 
created an especially fertile breeding ground for financial phony 
business 
weve never been this aware of so many frauds in things such 
as penny stocks coins gold piles and so forth said raymond f 
devoe jr an analyst at the wall street firm of legg mason wood 
walker inc 
one apparent cause of this devoe says is the proliferation of 
new investment vehicles that wall street has devised to offer to 
pension fund managers and other sophisticated clients 
some of the financial creations of the last few years are so 
bizarre that even professionals dont completely understand them 
he observes 
because the legitimate financial creations are so complex it 
is very hard to tell them from the phony ones 
all this leaves many individuals who have money to manage in a 
tough spot how to protect themselves while still attempting to 
invest their money productively 
harold finlay at the clevelandbased investment firm of 
prescott ball amp turben suggests three basic rules beware of 
very high yields know the person with whom you do business dont 
make hasty decisions 
it seems laughable that many people spend more time selecting 
a necktie or dress than investing their life savings finley 
observed in the firms monthly publication investor news 
a prime tool of the scammers trade is the telephone the north 
american securities administrators association acknowledges that 
many aboveboard investments are promoted over the phone 
but it has published a list of tips for dealing with what you 
suspect is a boiler room operation selling questionable or 
fraudulent goods 
among the associations most compelling recommendations the 
harder a telephone salesperson presses the wiser it is to resist 
if a caller turns abusive hang up 
dont fall for any claims of spectacular rewards or promised 
guarantees until you can verify the legitimacy of the deal and 
have a clear picture of all the risks involved if you cant 
understand an investment dont buy it without the counsel of a 
trusted and knowledgeable adviser 
never give your creditcard number to a stranger on the phone 
be especially suspicious of propositions involving delayed delivery 
of the investment in question 
likewise look warily at any deal in which the seller proposes 
some unusual arrangement to collect your money such as sending a 
messenger to pick up your check some con artists try to avoid 
mail fraud charges by using overnight courier services nasaa 
points out 
a deregulated financial world is also a letthebuyerbeware 
world requiring a good deal of healthy skepticism 
that means mustering the strongest doubts when the callers 
voice is most persuasive or when the name of the purported 
business is most impressivesounding flybynight boiler rooms 
have been known to call themselves national exchanges 
research institutes bureaus in fact almost anything but 
what they really are

with asking prices below their highs of a few 
months ago with large numbers of unsold houses on the market and 
with interest rates falling an investment opportunity may be 
developing in singlefamily housing 
while such opportunities are more common in housing than in most 
markets partly because housing is made up of a greater percentage 
of amateur versus professional sellers as in cars they are 
transitory 
in fact as soon as such opportunities appear they begin to 
vanish thats the housing market for you up and down more sharply 
than other markets and always exaggerating the usual economic 
cycle bust to boom and back to bust 
the most important element in the opening for buyers is the 
general decline of interest rates which many forecasters expect 
will continue right through the year 
interest rates are key since interest is the biggest housing 
expense for those who take out 20year or 30year mortgages 
sometimes equalling the total cost of all other factors including 
land and the structure itself 
when you have a combination of lower rates and relatively softer 
prices asking prices that are below their earlier highs or that 
are negotiable you have a buying opportunity now add to that a 
big inventory of unsold units 
earlier this year the national association of realtors 
estimated the inventory of unsold homes at more than 29 million 
units or a ninemonth supply of existing homes and 75month 
supply of new houses 
what that means is a lot of unhappy sellers while they could 
rationalize the inattention given to their offerings during the 
winter when weather and mood keep people from shopping they are 
now in the prime selling months 
another factor enters the picture the news about housing has a 
rather dismal cast of late just a month or two ago for example 
sellers and buyers were loudly lamenting the deadly duo of rising 
prices and interest rates 
in many areas those factors have changed in some they have 
been reversed but the mood lingers keeping many potential buyers 
from the market it is of course a situation that can change 
overnight it has happened before 
still another factor is involved in the potential investment 
opportunity if the price of the house purchased today is to have 
greater market value tomorrow it would help tremendously if future 
housing were in short supply 
there is no proof that such a situation will develop but it 
should be noted that the number of residential building permits 
issued in 1989 could be the lowest in seven years future demand 
therefore might not be met 
the national association of home builders forecasts 102 million 
singlefamily housing starts this year a figure that would make 
1989 the weakest homebuilding year since 1983 lomas mortgage usa 
a large mortgage lender estimates new housing permits this year at 
1394 million 21 percent lower than in 1986 
building activity today creates tomorrows markets and if 
building this year is weak it could tip tomorrows buyerseller 
balance those who buy today that is conceivably could find 
market values higher a few years hence

the number of american women ordained to the 
churchs full ministry preaching the word and administering 
the sacraments has about doubled in the last decade 
they total 20730 as statistically projected nearly twice the 
10470 of 1977 they now constitute 79 percent of the clergy in 
denominations ordaining women 
that percentage also has about doubled from 4 percent and 
seems likely for a further steep increase as indicated by the boom 
in women enrollment in seminaries 
the figures were gathered by constant h jacquet jr of the 
research office of the national council of churches his report 
says women still face some discrimination but adds 
there has been an increasing acceptance of women clergy in 
local church situtations especially by younger people and by those 
of higher educational attainment 
women have also gained acceptance as pastors once they have 
been given the opportunity to demonstrate their competence in 
preaching and pastoral care at the local level 
among mainline denominations the lutheran church in america 
merged in 1988 into the evangelical lutheran church in america 
had the highest percentage of women heads of local pastoral staffs 
more than half its clergywomen 
american baptist also ranked high in this category among 
mainliners lutherans and the united methodist church had the 
highest perentage of women clergy serving in local congregations 
generally 
getting on the staff of a local church particularly as chief 
pastor or head of staff is considered a key measure of acceptance 
of women clergy it also is seen as a common obstacle 
women clergy appear to be more easily accepted in church 
employment outside the local church at various denominational 
administrative offices in ecumenical conciliar positions and in 
many institutional roles the report says 
among 221 denominations included in the survey 84 of them 
ordain women and 82 do not with uncertainty about it in 49 others 
six do not ordain clergy at all 
the proportion of denominations ordaining women had grown little 
since 1977 when 76 ordained women and 82 did not however those 
ordaining women had now become a slight majority 84 to 82 
with totals projected as of 1986 the assemblies of god led the 
field in numbers of women clergy 3718 of them up from 1572 or 
137 percent others among the next ranked l0 and their decades 
increase or decrease in women clergy were 
salvation army 3220 up from 3037 or 6 percent 
united methodist church 1891 up from 319 or 496 percent 
presbyterian church usa 1519 up from 370 or 310 percent 
united church of christ 1460 up from 400 or 265 percent 
episcopal church 796 up from 94 or 747 percent 
christian church disciples of christ 743 up from 388 or 91 
percent 
lutheran church in america 484 up from 55 or 780 percent 
international church of the foursquare gospel 666 down from 
804 or 17 percent 
southern baptist convention 450 up from 20 or 2150 percent 
american baptist churches 429 up from 157 or 173 percent 
apart from those numerical rankings other large percentage 
gains in women clergy were by the reformed church in america which 
went from one to 42 of them up by 4100 percent 
also the american lutheran church now also merged into the 
evanelical lutheran church in america increased women clergy from 
18 to 306 or 1600 percent while the menonites went from four to 
48 up 1100 percent 
in the smaller mormon branch the reorganized church of jesus 
christ of latterday saints womens ordination was authorized only 
in 1984 and since has shot up from none to 860 the report says 
in some instances the numbers of women clergy dropped the 
church of the nazarene count fell from 426 to 355 a 17 percent 
drop 
like the roman catholic and eastern orthodox churches some 
larger conservative protestant churches do not ordain women 
including the lutheran churchmissouri synod 
the present fundamentalist administration of the southern 
baptist convention opposes womens ordination but the report shows 
the denominations women clergy up from 20 to 450 have multiplied 
more than 20 times 
congregations in that denomination are autonomous and may ordain 
without higher approval but few have hired women pastors 
until recent times the increase in women clergy was relatively 
slow it took 27 years for the 1950 total of 5591 most of them 
among pentecostals or parachurch groups to double by 1977 
now that most mainline denominations ordain women the totals 
have zoomed doubling again in one decade the report says 
there is every reason to believe that the percentage of women 
ordained will continue to increase as women gain wider 
acceptance in the various denominations based on demonstrated 
performance and on the changing attitudes of those currently 
opposing equal roles for women

babes in arms is the rodgers and hart 
musical that people think they know and dont 
what everybody recalls is the folklore that has obscured this 
classic come on kids lets put on a show musical that 
introduced such standards as my funny valentine the lady is 
a tramp johnny one note i wish i were in love again and 
where or when 
they remember the vastly different and softer andy 
hardystyle movie starring judy garland and mickey rooney and not 
the broadway musical which opened two years earlier at the shubert 
theater with a cast of young unknown performers that included 
alfred drake mitzi green wynn murray dan dailey the nicholas 
brothers and ray heatherton father of joey 
it is a concert revival of the original broadway version that 
will grace lincoln centers avery fisher hall june 5 performers 
include judy kaye gregg edelman judy blazer jason graae and a 
singing group called jq and the bandits some of the book will be 
performed but anita morris will serve as narrator to tie together 
some of the plot developments 
the concert a benefit for the starlight foundation which helps 
critically ill children will be presented and conducted by evans 
haile a juilliardtrained musician who has conducted at the 
seattle opera and other opera companies he will lead the new 
jersey symphony in hans spialeks original orchestrations 
this show has a unique place in musical theater history 
says haile babes in arms is a score that has five standards 
but hasnt been done in new york since its premiere and the 
original book is much more interesting in a lot of ways than the 
later versions because it deals with social issues 
the story for babes in arms which rodgers and hart also 
wrote as well as the music and lyrics is set during the 
depression it concerns the children of outofwork vaudeville 
performers who put on a revue so they will not be sent to a work 
farm the show flops but the kids are saved in act 2 when a 
transatlantic flyer a frenchman named rene flambeau crashes in 
the area and helps the teenagers out of their financial 
predicament 
there is a whole argument about socialism vs capitalism in 
the musical said haile explaining what was in the original 
script one of the other big issues in the show is that when the 
children find an underwriter for the show they are trying to put 
on they discover hes a bigot and wont let the two black kids 
played in the original by the nicholas brothers go into the 
show 
that was the musicals first act finale when the curtain came 
up the on the second act the kids were on the work farm and the 
black performers did not reappear in the show 
the show boosts several lesser known rodgers and hart songs such 
as you are so fair and imagine as well as two long ballet 
sequences originally choreographed by george balanchine the music 
from both will be performed at lincoln center although in abridged 
versions particularly the johnny one note ballet which 
consists of some 12 minutes of the song repeated in the same key 
even stage versions of babes in arms that audiences have 
seen over the last three decades have been different than the 
original says ted chapin who oversees the rentals of rodgers and 
hart musicals as manager of the rodgers and hammerstein library 
in the 1950s and 60s according to chapin richard rodgers 
encouraged revised versions of three or four rodgers and hart shows 
which were basically not being produced at all that quartet 
included babes in arms 
i can only surmise that in the 1950s he felt the way to get 
the rodgers and hart shows performed more was to do more 
uptodate versions chapin said with babes in arms george 
oppenheimer wrote a new book that was what everybody thought babes 
in arms was from the beginning a summer stock musical kids in 
the barn on cape cod trying to put on a show 
babes in arms has had very few major revivals over the last 
half century the st louis municipal opera performed it in 1940 
julie wilson starred in a production at the royal poinciana 
playhouse in palm beach fla in 1959 and the goodspeed opera 
house had its own version with andrea mcardle of annie fame in 
1979 
the revised version by oppenheimer that we rent does very well 
in high schools but more and more as people are becoming aware of 
originals they are asking for originals chapin said there 
has been interest but it has never been followed through with 
babes in arms mark bramble coauthor of the book for 42nd 
street wanted to do a production in london based more on the 
original but that didnt work 
hailes concert presentation could awake interest in babes in 
arms again already several recording companies have indicated 
they might want to record the show

its 1937 and barbara stanwyck playing the 
outcast stella dallas watches from outside as her daughter gets 
married it is one of hollywoods classic tearjerking scenes 
flash forward to 1989 
the feisty funny bette midler is starring in a remake that the 
production team says updates the old concepts of high society but 
keeps the basic story intact so instead of stanwyck needing to 
chase after a rich husband to make her unsuccessful attempt to move 
upward midler can grumpily tell her friend how she told off the 
rich guy and doesnt need his money 
the new version called stella was filmed in toronto this 
spring for a planned release in the winter 
the handkerchiefs though will still be needed at the end 
just as her predecessor did midler will be watching from outside 
at her daughters elegant new york wedding 
i think the old movie was really about class distinction 
said director john erman said in an interview this movie is 
really about opportunities 
this will be the third version of the stella dallas story based 
on a novel by olive higgins prouty samuel goldwyn made a 1925 
silent film starring belle bennett ronald coleman jean hersholt 
and douglas fairbanks jr he produced the king vidor version in 
1937 starring stanwyck who was nominated for an academy award 
the samuel goldwyn co held the rights now samuel goldwyn jr 
is coproducing the new movie with touchstone pictures which has 
an exclusive arrangement with midler touchstone will domestically 
distribute the movie and goldwyns company has international 
distribution 
goldwyn traces the idea to remake the movie back to 1986 he 
said he didnt intend to get involved in a coproduction but the 
chance to get midler as the films star was too good to pass up 
shes really become a reason to redo the picture he said 
as for the script goldwyn said that the original movies 
reliance on the class system wouldnt totally work today but the 
emotional scenes still do 
among the set pieces as he called them are the birthday 
party for the daughter to which nobody comes and the famous ending 
he and others involved in making the movie say theres no 
doubt that some sort of class system still exists even if it is not 
as ironclad as in the earlier part of the century 
the new version ranges from 1969 to the present midler plays a 
bartender in a small upstate new york town who meets rich new 
yorker steven dallas while he is a medical student in the area she 
gets pregnant he backs off she brings up their daughter without 
any help that of course is just the start 
its bettes picture all the way said actor stephen 
collins who plays steven dallas 
the trick of the plot is to show that steven and stella 
simply dont belong together 
so nobodys a bad guy collins said taking a break from 
tuning fellow actor john goodmans guitar theyre having a great 
affair but realistically marriage is not in the cards for them 
as for the famous scene where midler will be watching her 
daughter get married collins said if anybody in this day and 
age can make that scene fly she could 
if it works itll be similar to beaches a really good 
cry and the kind of story people really like going to the movies 
for 
the burly goodman off from the smash hit television series 
roseanne is playing midlers oldest friend harddrinking ed 
munn 
i have to make it work for myself he said when asked about 
the difficulties of updating the story i cant think of whats 
gone on before 
erman who directed such television movies as the two mrs 
grenvilles and an early frost said the key update is that 
stella and steven choose not to be together 
weve all worked very hard to make sure this is credible and 
plausible he said i frankly think that if you had done this 
with an actress who didnt have the range that bette has then it 
might seem more like a soap opera

dale brittain has no illusions that the 
forestry program he supervises for young inmates will help all of 
them but authorities say a little respect and some incentives can 
go a long way toward helping some 
when youre at the bottom and have never had anything 
anything is important to you brittain said these boys come 
from a rough background some of them youre going to change some 
of them youre not 
inmates who participate in the bridge program range in age from 
18 to 25 and learn such skills as carpentry forestry logging and 
fighting forest fires in the states three mountain districts 
bridge is an acronym for building rehabilitating instructing 
developing growing and employing 
brittain credits the programs success to incentives 
theres gain time for every eight hours a bridge inmate 
works a day is subtracted from his sentence the inmates wear 
special uniforms with logging boots and get a break from prison 
food by eating at restaurants near worksites 
at the programs administrative offices at the burke youth 
center there is a display of photographs of the participants with 
the inmate of the month at the top thats another incentive 
brittain said because some of the inmates have never had an 
8by10 photograph of themselves 
theyre not boy scouts added carl johnson who directs the 
bridge program from raleigh they did something wrong but if you 
treat them well you get something back 
the participants in avery county are constructing buildings that 
will house up to 50 inmates in the program 
pointing to five young inmates skimming the bark off a pine tree 
at a makeshift sawmill gary poole a division of forest resources 
project leader said thats a good crew right there they 
actually hunt work to do 
nearby several young men used hammers and handsaws to put the 
finishing touches on one of three buildings resembling vacation 
lodges that are perched on a hillside in the blue ridge mountains 
inmate tony walker who is serving a threeyear sentence for 
breaking and entering had never seen a sawmill before but took to 
the work quickly 
its a lot better than sitting around all day said walker 
22 who entered the program about four months ago and has about 
seven months left they treat you just like youre at work 
some inmates are chosen to work on the helitack crew which 
fights forest fires from a bright yellow army helicopter equipped 
with a collapsible water bucket 
while theyre building the camp facilities the programs 26 
inmates are temporarily housed at the burke youth center 
instructors from nearby mayland community college have provided 
training in carpentry and masonry but no professional contractors 
have been hired 
a lot of it we just beat and bang and learn ourselves 
brittain said 
harry layman director of the division of forest resources said 
the young prisoners have a chance to develop skills such as 
carpentry and plumbing and they are also attracted to the program 
because they are treated less like inmates 
our nicest compliment on the program was one young man gave up 
his parole to stay in the program layman said the kids begin 
to feel part of something we treat them with respect 
since the program was begun in 1986 it has taken in 206 
inmates about dozen have reentered the prison system brittain 
said others have been hired by the state forestry division and 
private employers 
the youths volunteer for the program and are carefully screened 
brittain said 
layman compared the program with the civilian conservation corps 
begun by president franklin d roosevelt during the depression 
its using the forest as remedial he said there is 
something healing about taking them out in the woods and letting 
them work with nature 
we cut down the logs then build the camp ourselves with our 
forestry supervisors and the inmate labor he said 
layman said the program was begun after a fire in burke county 
destroyed 47 homes built on little switchback roads he said it 
was born a union of the states prison and forestry divisions 
the program is one of just two east of the mississippi state 
forest officials said the other is in florida modeled after 
similar programs in california and oregon the bridge program uses 
only young minimumcustody prisoners 
melvin bruton 21 has been in the program 19 months he has 
earned 674 hours of gain time enough for more than 2 months off 
his sentence and has nearly completed a 13year prison term for 
breaking and entering 
you hear of forest fires on tv said bruton they offered 
it to me and i thought it would give me a change from regular 
prison 
bruton has learned carpentry landscaping and the operation of 
heavy equipment such as bulldozers and a knuckleboom loader 
used by the logging industry he also spent 18 months on the 
helitack team 
ive learned so much he said i didnt know nothing 
before i came in

were looking in broom closets for space 
says a new jersey prison official if his voice and others in

desperate no wonder theres no more room in americas prisons 
but the inmates keep coming

the us prison system is like a stopped up 
pipe built to contain a stream of criminals the plumbing is 
overflowing 
spillover inmates end up in tents in florida and on surplus 
troop barges in new york city in texas powstyle camps may be 
built 
some states have installed juryrigged emergency valves to free 
prisoners ahead of their time but last year when courts freed a 
wave of philadelphia inmates they committed a wave of new crimes 
and 10 days after one florida prisoner got an early release he was 
charged with killing two cops 
the states swamped the worst are trying to bail themselves out 
with new prison construction california 70 percent over the brim 
is spending 32 billion on building president bush wants an extra 
1 billion in 1990 for federal prisons which are 55 percent over 
capacity 
authorities say these vast amounts and desperate measures are 
not enough to ease the jam and the threat of riot that goes with 
it they propose shorter sentences for nonviolent criminals and 
more use of work release probation restitution halfway houses 
and electronically monitored house arrest 
the entire system is filled beyond capacity its clogged 
said anthony travisono executive director of the american 
correctional association 
its like trying to mop the bathroom floor without turning off 
the spigot on an overflowing bathtub said gordon bonnyman a 
civil rights lawyer in nashville tenn 
recent mandatory sentencing rules and a jump in drugrelated 
prosecutions have packed prisons officials said but the flood of 
inmates is not new this year was the 14th straight that opened 
with the us prison population at an alltime high the number 
imprisoned has nearly tripled since 1975 
the 627402 people behind bars at the start of this year were 
60504 more than the system was designed to hold according to the 
justice department 
are the streets safer 
theres not a criminologist or a sociologist in the country 
that can say as a result of more incarcerations we have lowered the 
crime rate said herb hoelter director of the national center on 
institutions and alternatives weve been blackmailed by our fear 
of crime 
if so its expensive blackmail the annual tab for locking 
people up is 16 billion a year in some places the 20000 cost to 
imprison an inmate each year could send a student to stanford or 
harvard or pay a cops salary 
an average new prison costs 40 million last year the system 
grew by 42967 inmates which translates to the need for 86 new 
prisons 
states are building furiously this year 9 billion is being 
spent for construction an additional 6 billion is on states wish 
lists 
but if the number stayed the same and every projection says it 
will keep accelerating it would take eight years just to build 
cells for all the inmates who need them the correctional 
association said 
even corrections officers say new prisons wont solve 
overcrowding 
nobody has been able to build their way out of the 
overcrowding problem once built a prison bed will soon find an 
inmate said larry meachum commissioner of the connecticut 
department of corrections 
if all 24000 beds that bush wants to add to federal prisons 
were available immediately they would eliminate only the overflow 
the 48039inmate system is 55 percent over capacity 
new york city may put prisoners in shelters for the homeless 
recently 75 inmates at rikers island slept in a single room with 
one toilet the city is housing prisoners on two surplus ferryboats 
and two converted british troop barges a fivestory 625foot long 
floating jail is being built 
california with the largest inmate population in the country at 
80721 is spending 32 billion on more space it has built 21000 
new beds since 1984 
americans expect criminals to serve hard time to suffer 
said robert johnson professor of justice at american university in 
washington dcthey want these people off the streets but 
theyre not inclined to think through what it will cost 
the cost could be another attica or soledad some officials 
warn the potential for explosion is always there in an 
overcrowded prison said samuel sublett president of the aca 
thirtyfive states the district of columbia and puerto rico are 
under court order to relieve overcrowding all but alabama 
arkansas maine massachusetts minnesota montana nebraska new 
jersey new york north dakota oklahoma oregon pennsylvania 
vermont and wyoming according to the american civil liberties 
union 
twentyseven have population caps set by federal courts 
until 1988 florida housed 1046 inmates in 12person tents the 
state is building 9376 new prison beds at a cost of 109 million 
and to comply with a cap the state has an early release program in 
which inmates serve only 35 percent of their sentence 
one convict charlie street was accused of killing two miami 
police officers in november 10 days after he was released from 
prison and served eight years of a 15year sentence for attempted 
murder 
the system is broken said florida attorney general robert 
butterworth in a speech to the american jail association what we 
have now is a legal escape system we just open the door for them 
philadelphia prisons twice released inmates last year to meet a 
court order of 256 inmates released in june 106 were arrested 
within six months and accused of 156 new crimes 
thats 156 crimes that shouldnt have happened said 
district attorney ronald castille were sending a message to 
criminals that theyre not going to jail here you cant imagine 
how frustrating it is 
because of a courtordered cap texas closed its system to new 
inmates in april the 31st time since 1987 the doors were shut 
that just burdens county jails one judge authorized tarrant county 
to build powstyle camps that could be patrolled by the national 
guard 
in connecticut parole was outlawed in 1981 and a 1984 state 
law mandates emergency release if the prison population is at 110 
percent of capacity for 30 days 
to avoid opening prison doors the number of people in a 
parolelike program called supervised home release has increased 
from 700 to 3400 in the last 18 months 
nine states have militarystyle boot camps where young felons 
trade their sentences for a few months of predawn wakeups pushups 
and hard labor under bombastic drill sergeants critics doubt the 
discipline will help and fear it might just make criminals meaner 
fifty overflow inmates from the district of columbia were blamed 
for death threats fires food fights and sabotaged toilets after 
they arrived at a prison in spokane wash guards threatened to 
strike 
last week 10 massachusetts prison guards charged in a lawsuit 
that overcrowding was so severe their lives were in danger 
arizona gov rose mofford too has reason to worry her state 
spent 100 million in five years for 4500 new prison beds and 
still pays 28000 a day to house an overflow of 700 inmates in 
county jails 
the money she said has begun to restrict the states ability 
to educate our children provide health care for the elderly 
disabled and lowincome citizens and fulfill other state

if you sometimes think the daily grind is a 
dogeatdog world you ought to see what goes on between the fungi 
and the pathogens 
of course says the agriculture department there are good 
fungi but there are also bad fungi pathogens theyre the tiny 
things like viruses that cause diseases and theyre mostly bad 
the idea of using natures own organisms to fight hold back and 
destroy plant diseases has been around a long time and the 
departments agricultural research service says the search 
continues for biological ways of protecting crops 
recent reports from the agency show the task to be slow and 
painstaking fungi and bacteria exist naturally in the same soil 
that nourishes corn wheat rice cotton soybeans and even 
backyard tomatoes 
one of the tasks of the scientists is to sort out those 
organisms and choose through experiments the ones that can help 
protect crops 
twenty years from now well have many more biological 
controls like fungi to use says deborah r fravel an agency 
plant pathologist they may not be as common as chemicals but 
they certainly will be increasingly important i dont think 
biological controls will ever completely replace chemicals but 
they will help reduce the amount of chemicals used 
half a dozen beneficial fungi are being studied at the agencys 
biocontrol of plant diseases laboratory in nearby beltsville md 
where fravel works each is under scrutiny for its ability to fight 
pathogens such as the bad fungi bacteria microscopic worms called 
nematodes and even viruses 
the idea is that we can enhance whats out there in nature 
fravel said a lot of management practices in use right now such 
as adding organic matter to the soil actually are biocontrols 
because organic matter feeds the organisms already in place 
fungi used in biocontrol fight plant pathogens in several ways 
parasitism or actually feeding on the pathogen antibiosis or 
producing some sort of compound that is toxic to the pathogen and 
through competition the most common action 
for example she said plant roots leak carbon sources such as 
sugar the biocontrol organisms get to those carbon sources before 
the pathogens do so the pathogens cant get anything to eat and 
cant grow or the biocontrol organisms may simply occupy all the 
space around the root so the pathogen cant get in 
fravel and her colleagues are conducting tests in some new 
jersey eggplant fields to see how well a beneficial fungus 
talaromyces flavus fights verticillium wilt disease in previous 
field tests the fungus in combination with a reduced amount of 
chemical fumigant reduced wilt disease in eggplant crops by as much 
as 75 percent 
jack a lewis a soil scientist at the beltsville laboratory 
said work recently began on encasing two other fungi trichoderma 
and gliocladium in pellets which then are mixed into infected 
soil or potting material to test their effectiveness 
the pellets contain food for the biocontrol fungi lewis 
said the organism grows out of the pellet and spreads through 
the soil where it attacks the pathogen and kills it 
a number of other fungi also are being studied as possible 
weapons including some that might be targeted against pathogens 
that help cause the rotting of seed and the seedlings of cotton 
sugarbeets and many vegetables and ornamental plants 
still other fungi are being used experimentally against some of 
their bad relatives noted for causing stalk rot in corn 
plant pathologist nader g vakili who works at the usda 
agencys cereal and soybean improvement research unit in ames 
iowa said the good fungi enter and live inside the corn plant 
where they eat away at the rot fungi 
vakili sprayed spores of melanospora damnosa on corn plants in 
test plots in the first year the beneficial fungus infected only 
about onehalf of 1 percent of the stalk rot fungus fusarium 
moniliforme in the stalks but after five years as the good 
fungus built up in the soil 50 percent to 80 percent were infected 
the results suggest that strains of biocontrol fungi could be 
selected for compatability with specific lines of corn he said 
the corn would be bred to support large numbers of the fungi 
organisms 
in the us alone stalk rots reduce yields by some 500 
million bushels annually vakili said 
but fungi are not the only weapons being looked at by usda 
scientists chemist jeffrey s buyer and two colleagues have 
produced and tested a monoclonal antibody a custombuilt protein 
that will seek out and fasten onto ironhoarding compounds called 
siderophores 
virtually all bacteria and fungi good and bad alike produce 
siderophores to meet their own iron needs buyer said sometimes 
but not always these compounds help control pathogens 
right now we have no good methods to study the compounds in 
their natural state or determine why they sometimes do and 
sometimes dont help control disease organisms buyer said 
the new antibody which is headed for greenhouse tests this 
summer on roots of barley seedlings hopefully will seek and bind 
to siderophores so they can be measured and studied more fully 
eventually it may be possible for farmers and home gardeners to 
make bad microbes anemic by loading the soil with certain 
beneficial bacteria that will deprive the pathogens of their iron 
supply

charles robinson had one of your better 
supporting roles on tv as newdell dabney colemans intimidating 
makeup man on buffalo bill 
when the critically acclaimed comedy failed to reach a wide 
audience and was canceled by nbc robinson landed on his feet in 
yet another great supporting role on nbcs night court 
buffalo bill was a wonderful show robinson said but 
unfortunately it didnt make it i thought maybe my career was 
over then i heard i might go to night court three days later i 
got the call 
robinson joined the night court cast in september 1984 when 
the show began its first full season he has been with the hit 
comedy ever since as laidback court clerk mac robinson 
the series features a parade of defendants through the 
unconventional nighttime new york court session its sometimes 
difficult to separate the itinerant loonies from the officers of 
the court 
harry anderson stars as the hip judge john larroquette has won 
four emmys as the licentious prosecutor markie post is the perky 
defense attorney and richard moll and marsha warfield are the 
bailiffs 
macs a more difficult character to play than newdell was on 
buffalo bill robinson said hes a wonderful guy but its 
hard to play a guy like that newdell had all those colors he was 
unpredictable newdell could show up in a dashiki what do you 
dress mac in khakis and a sweater 
macs the normal person on the show he stands back and 
observes the others but he also participates in the craziness he 
can say something that shocks me he has better control than the 
others i love playing mac it takes a lot of discipline hes 
always on the verge he senses whats going on and can be touched 
by it newdell would step away but mac sees them as part of his 
family 
night court is a variation on the concept of barney 
miller and was created by reinhold weege a former producer of 
barney miller the show had a tough shakedown and was not an 
immediate hit 
it has also undergone a lot of cast changes anderson 
larroquette and moll are the only members of the original cast 
selma diamond began as the caustic wisecracking bailiff and after 
her death from lung cancer in 1985 she was replaced by florence 
halop halop also suffered from lung cancer she died in 1986 and 
was replaced by warfield 
karen austin was the first court clerk and paula kelly was the 
first defense attorney 
theyre taking mac in a new direction said robinson mac 
has always wanted to be an attorney and theyre sending him back 
to school 
mac also got married on the show to an asian woman named quon 
lee played by denice kumagai i think a lot of its based on my 
own life he said my wife is from the philippines 
robinson grew up in houston texas where he organized a singing 
group called the drells and worked in local theater 
i always wanted to entertain he said when i was 5 i 
wanted to be a minister then i started singing with various 
groups but after a while i got discouraged i wasnt thinking 
about acting but i was watching television and saw bill cosby and 
said i bet i can do that 
he studied at a houston workshop but felt he wasnt getting 
anywhere and quit chris wilson the workshop director called 
me and asked me to come back and i never quit again he said 
she gave me a scholarship after about five years i moved to los 
angeles 
he also trained with cecil pickett a wellknown houston drama 
teacher and father of actress cindy pickett he challenged me 
robison said when i was young my attitude was that i knew it 
all he would see if i wasnt giving my all id drive home in 
tears finally i decided to listen he was so important to my 
career 
robinson worked on such shows as hill street blues st 
elsewhere columbo and lou grant he was in roots the 
next generation rehearsal for murder haywire the 
trial of lee harvey oswald and such theatrical films as gray 
lady down apocalypse now and the river 
he was in a pilot based on the movie the last detail and 
another called temporary insanity he also starred with philip 
michael thomas and john beck in a pilot called the buffalo 
soldiers about black cavalry in the last century

us companies operating in china are reacting 
to the tumultuous political events there by delaying visits and 
telling expatriate workers to avoid street protests but few are 
taking people out of the country 
most companies believe its premature to even consider 
divestment or withdrawal particularly because the protests arent 
antiforeign and violence has been rare 
but many were surprised at how quickly the governments seeming 
stability weakened because of the demonstrations for democratic 
reforms gripping beijing 
so much depends on what ultimately happens here jerome 
cohen a lawyer and expert on doing business with the chinese said 
in a telephone interview from his hong kong residence 
im still holding open the possibility that a new surge of 
modernization a more open china could come out of this he said 
roger sullivan president of the uschina business council a 
washingtonbased association of american companies with interests 
in china said business requests for information have multiplied to 
50 or 60 daily since the crisis intensified vs two or three a day 
ordinarily 
but sullivan said he knew of no companies that were rethinking 
their longterm plans in china 
theres a lot of handwringing going on but companies are 
intelligent enough not to make decisions in that environment he 
said companies dont react to something like this until they see 
the longerterm implications 
the unprecedented demonstrations come against a background of 
broadening us business operations in the worlds most populous 
country with ventures as ranging from openpit coal mining to 
nuclear power 
the united states is a leading foreign investor in china and one 
of its most important trading partners more than 600 uschinese 
joint ventures have been established since the countries normalized 
relations a decade ago 
telephone interviews tuesday with business consultants and 
executives in the united states china and hong kong suggested many 
visits to beijing had been delayed until the political crisis 
stabilizes 
most postponements were attributed to a us state department 
travel advisory and uncertainty over whether the demonstrations 
would turn violent 
everybody is just tentatively rescheduling things cohen 
said 
some companies also curtailed beijing operations 
american telephone amp telegraph co for example closed its 
office temporarily over the weekend and offered its 27 us 
staffers the option of sending family members out spokesman rick 
wallerstein said it was unclear whether any had left 
weve closed the office just because we dont want our people 
coming in to work in light of that situation he said weve 
also asked them to stay in their residences as much as possible 
avoid public gatherings and not carry cameras around with them 
among other us companies with offices in beijing bechtel 
group inc said three expatriate employees temporarily had left the 
country and united technologies corp said one had partly because 
the protests paralyzed traffic in much of the capital making 
ordinary work nearly impossible 
its really not business as usual there said larry miller 
a spokesman for bechtel so we sent our three nonchinese 
employees to hong kong on a temporary basis until normal business 
conditions return to beijing 
others including international business machines corp and 
chrysler corps jeep jointventure were said by sources in 
beijing to have evacuated an undetermined number of staffers and 
dependents but spokesmen for those companies said they were 
unaware anyone had left due to the crisis 
nevertheless ibm spokesman tim sheehy said the computer giants 
50 expatriates in beijing were taking what he described as prudent 
precautions 
we just make sure the employees are using good sense he 
said if you cant get to work dont come to work 
preston torbert a partner and chinese legal expert at the 
chicagobased law firm baker amp mckenzie which has offices in 
beijing said he was unaware of any clients withdrawing plans for 
investment or business negotiations 
torbert also said many business representatives in beijing were 
rooting privately for the protesters cause of greater freedom and 
democracy 
in fact people are excited to be there he said its 
such an exciting moment what are you going to tell your 
grandchildren that you left

jeanne hood once could count herself 
among atlantic citys most powerful women the only female casino 
president in this oceanside gaming resort 
but the president of elsinores atlantis casino hotel lost her 
status as she presided over the demise of the financially troubled 
casino 
everybody liked her quite a while ago she seemed like she was 
working toward everyones benefit pit clerk charles hersh one 
of more than 1200 laidoff casino employees said tuesday on his 
way to the unemployment office 
everyone used to be fairly well impressed with her intentions 
but in hindsight everything she did was bad he said 
the state casino control commission on monday closed the 
atlantis which had run up 150 million in debts regulators are 
considering a bid by developer donald trump to buy the atlantis for 
63 million and convert it into a luxury noncasino hotel 
about 600 hotel and restaurant employees still on the atlantis 
payroll are anxiously watching the outcome of trumps purchase 
agreement which is being challenged by the casinos 
stateappointed conservator 
mrs hood wasnt around for the casinos final day of gaming on 
sunday her 63rd birthday atlantis spokesman robert arrow said 
tuesday that mrs hood is in las vegas repeated attempts to reach 
her directly or through a spokesman were unsuccessful 
during the casinos chaotic final two years mrs hood was a 
study in contrasts she dressed elegantly but said she drove to 
the local mall in a honda she kept in the atlantis parking garage 
during an employee strike in 1987 pickets chanted jeannie 
hood shes no good while faithful workers talked with reporters 
inside about her loyalty to the company 
and though her fondest dream was to see news reports stop 
referring to the atlantis as the financially struggling casino 
mrs hood failed to accomplish just that 
marvin b roffman a gaming analyst for janney montgomery scott 
inc of philadelphia said strained relations between mrs hood and 
workers often were reflected in the treatment of customers 
their level of tips was at half the level of the other houses 
but a lot of them stayed because they could not get similar jobs in 
other casinos most casino jobs in atlantic city today are 
entrylevel he said 
in mrs hoods defense roffman said she inherited an 
illdesigned and illmanaged casino from her arrival in late 1985 
the threelevel casino floor was never popular with customers and 
the atlantis is burdened with a heavy debt structure 
the atlantis also failed at a marketing campaign aimed at 
middleclass customers that steered away from highrollers who pump 
money into gaming halls 
mrs hood succeeded her husband david as president of the four 
queens casino hotel in las vegas nev which also is owned by 
elsinore corp after his death in 1977 she has said the promotion 
was a matter of convenience as employees accepted her as readily as 
her popular spouse 
mrs hood added the job of president of elsinores atlantic city 
operations eight years later when the president quit a month after 
her arrival playboy enterprises inc a former partner that was 
owed money on a promissory note filed an involuntary bankruptcy 
petition against the atlantis 
the casino promptly filed for bankruptcy itself seeking 
protection from its 15000 creditors mrs hood has candidly 
admitted she had no idea what bankruptcy meant at the time 
in the ensuing years mrs hood lived fulltime at the atlantis 
returning to her nevada home occasionally for family visits 
i have the touch and feel of the property she said in a 
1988 interview i have my arms around it 
but in the casinos final weeks mrs hood could only watch as 
the state handed control to a conservator and then ordered the 
atlantis closed on one of her final walks through the casino many 
employees called her unflattering names mrs hood reacted by 
smiling and waving

gov michael s dukakis has proposed 
erecting some of the nations toughest barriers to hostile 
takeovers in an effort to protect the massachusetts miracle from 
corporate raiders 
the former democratic presidential candidate said tuesday the 
barriers would include mandatory severance pay for workers laid off 
during takeover battles and a higher percentage of share ownership 
required for control 
dukakis said he hoped the package would inspire similar measures 
across the nation he had called for antitakeover action during 
last years presidential campaign 
in the absence of federal action the states have got to 
move and were going to move he said 
the governor outlined the legislation in cambridges technology 
square outside the headquarters of polaroid corp which recently 
staved off a 31 billion hostile bid from shamrock holdings inc 
of burbank calif 
dukakis said polaroids experience helped shape the bill 
the instant photography company which is incorporated in 
delaware made use of a delaware law that bars completion of a 
takeover for three years unless the raider either gets approval of 
the target company or buys 85 percent of its stock 
by placing millions of its shares in friendly hands through an 
employee stock ownership plan polaroid made it virtually 
impossible for shamrock to reach the 85 percent level 
the massachusetts law would go further raising the threshold to 
90 percent the law would also be triggered earlier delaying a 
takeover as soon as a hostile bidder acquires 5 percent of a public 
companys stock rather than 15 percent as in delaware 
the bill was drafted by a 27member commission appointed by 
dukakis and including labor leaders corporate executives lawyers 
and legislators 
some provisions such as the severance pay are expected to draw 
opposition from business lobbyists merger specialists also 
predicted that the 5 percent threshold would be challenged in court 
as an unconstitutional intrusion on federal authority over 
interstate commerce 
its an admirable effort but the question is going to come 
down to state regulation versus federal regulation and i think 
theres going to be a lot of debate about it said thomas j 
dougherty a partner in the law firm of skadden arps slate 
meagher amp flom theyre going to be in and out of court 
dukakis maintained the legislation was not designed to ban all 
takeovers or even all hostile takeovers 
rather he said the aim is to force takeover artists to be 
socially responsible and block them from buying companies laying 
off workers and then selling the companies piecemeal at big profits 
among the legislations provisions is a requirement that an 
acquiring company assume all of the takeover targets labor 
contracts 
in addition boards of directors would be given explicit 
permission to consider the interests of employees customers and 
communities in deciding whether to reject a takeover offer that 
would help insulate directors from lawsuits by shareholders who 
favor selling out quickly for the highest price 
from the time a raider acquires 5 percent of a companys stock 
until two years after the takeover is completed all employees who 
are laid off without good cause would be entitled to two weeks 
severance pay for each year they had been employed 
also the legislation would make it easier for corporations to 
set up shareholder rights plans or poison pill defenses which 
boost the price of a takeover by giving shareholders an automatic 
right to buy additional shares 
proponents of the takeovers that have reshaped corporate america 
in the 1980s contend that hostile bids have shaken up entrenched 
managers and forced companies to pay more attention to providing a 
good return to stockholders 
but dukakis said in massachusetts the most common takeover 
targets are not weak companies but wellrun firms whose stock is 
undervalued because executives focus on longterm opportunities not 
quarterly profits 
its our best corporate citizens that are being attacked 
its the polaroids the primes the gillettes the stop n 
shops he said referring to a string of massachusetts companies 
that have faced takeover battles in recent years

pan am corp isnt taking seriously a 
statement by a new york man who says he heads a group formulating a 
proposal to acquire pan am and nwa inc simultaneously for 49 
billion 
the printed statement released in new york on tuesday said a 
company called trans global holdings inc was in the final stages 
of creating an investor group that might bid up to 130 a share for 
nwa and up to 7 per share for pan am for the 49 billion total 
in addition the company would acquire up to 300 new aircraft 
for more than 22 billion the statement said 
michael stern who was identified as chairman of trans global 
declined to elaborate but said in a telephone interview that the 
announcement was not a hoax 
jeff kriendler a pan am spokesman said stern has shown 
previous interest in acquiring pan am but has not made a legitimate 
bid 
he never has been able to demonstrate any financial support 
and in view of that history we would not view this proposal as 
being credible either kriendler said 
nwa parent of northwest airlines has been contacted by stern 
but has not received a bid from him said kevin whalen a spokesman 
for the nations fourthlargest carrier 
to limit the impact of the trans global announcement and provide 
time for traders to review it the new york stock exchange halted 
trading in shares of the two airlines for about 25 minutes tuesday 
afternoon 
nyse spokeswoman sharon gamsin later termed sterns news release 
as appearing somewhat less than credible 
nwa stock closed up 212 at 106 a share pan am rose 37 
cents to 475 
the trans global statement said further information could be 
forthcoming by next week but did not indicate who would finance 
the plan 
the statement said a major wall street investment banking firm 
and a major domestic banking institution had indicated an interest 
in participating in the joint bid but stern declined to identify 
the institutions and would not provide details about himself when 
questioned by telephone 
the news release described trans global as a privately held 
new yorkbased holding company 
the release said a former senior official of the us 
transportation department who was not identified had expressed 
interest in acting as the groups legal adviser it also stated the 
bid would include up to 600 million of equity and would not result 
in the breakup of either airline 
northwest which has been a takeover target since late march 
has invited interested buyers to submit bids by may 30 pan am 
announced may 9 that it might submit an offer but it was 
continuing to seek financing 
mike hamilton an airline industry analyst for piper jaffray amp 
hopwood inc of minneapolis said he never had heard of trans 
global 
curt kruse a spokesman for the air line pilots association at 
northwest said he had no information on the trans global bid 
theres a lot of little outfits coming out of the woodwork 
here to try to get their moment in the sun kruse said trans 
global could be the sultan of brunei for all we know

great western financial corp claims that 
federal regulators unfairly thwarted the savings and loan companys 
plan to leave the thrift industrys federal insurance fund 
the widely watched tussle between the large thrift and the 
federal home loan bank board demonstrates the anger felt by 
managers of healthy sampls who blame sloppy or dishonest rivals for 
the present crisis in the fund that insures customers deposits 
great western the nations thirdbiggest thrift stands to lose 
20 million this year because of the bank board ruling that amount 
is the difference in the cost of coverage by the federal savings amp 
loan insurance corp and the federal deposit insurance corp the 
fund for banks 
great western filed suit against the government in federal court 
tuesday one day after the bank board rejected its proposal to 
merge two subsidiaries in a deal that would in effect take the 
companys big california operation out of the fslic 
the suit calls the decision arbitrary and capricious and 
contends great western met the legal requirements for changing 
insurance funds 
the bank boards erroneous refusal to approve the application 
unjustifiably imprisons great western bank within the ailing fslic 
system the company said in announcing the suit 
bank board spokesman mark adams said officials had expected the 
suit and stood by their decision 
great western financial a beverly hillsbased sampl holding 
company sought to merge its california subsidiary great western 
bank into another subsidiary great western bank of bellevue 
wash despite the use of bank in the names both institutions are 
chartered as savings and loans 
the bellevue institution already has fled the fslic the 
california sampl is barred from such a switch by state law but by 
merging into the smaller washington institution would be able to 
change insurance funds 
great western financial with 35 billion in assets has 280 
retail sampl branches in california washington state florida 
arizona and new york 
its chairman and chief executive james montgomery has been 
outspoken in his belief that healthy thrifts are being unfairly 
tapped to make up losses incurred by the onethird of the industry 
that is in trouble 
the fslic is strapped by a wave of failures and federally forced 
mergers among thrifts pummeled by failing real estate markets in 
some states and according to some critics by fraud and 
mismanagement that regulators overlooked 
fslic insurance which once cost about the same as fdic 
insurance for banks has nearly doubled in price because of 
surcharges imposed to replenish the fund because of the wave of 
failures and mergers 
in order to preserve the insurance fund congress in 1987 
imposed a moratorium on departures from the fslic but great 
western is among some 30 thrifts that could qualify for exemptions 
to the moratorium because they stated an intent to leave the fund 
before the moratorium was approved 
among those thrifts that have applied to leave the fund is the 
nations biggest thriftholding company hf ahmanson amp co of los 
angeles parent of home savings of america

in the latest crackdown on penny stock 
fraud four former employees of a defunct brokerage have pleaded 
guilty in connection with a scheme prosecutors say bilked customers 
nationwide of 67 million 
these are not mere technical violations of securities laws 
us attorney samuel a alito jr said tuesday they were blatant 
frauds that cost investors millions of dollars 
the paramusbased company fd roberts securities inc 
systematically manipulated stock prices that bilked thousands of 
customers across the country alito said 
before declaring bankruptcy last february the company also had 
offices in boca raton and tampa fla and in california 
robert humphrey fd roberts former national sales manager 
admitted in us district court here to conspiring with other top 
management at the firm to use dozens of fraudulent techniques to 
sell the stocks 
humphrey faces up to 20 years in prison and a fine of 1 
million he specifically pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy 
to commit securities fraud and three counts of securities fraud 
also pleading guilty to related charges were kenneth eisen the 
former manager of the firm and pamella rutherford a broker both 
of boca raton and glenn siesser a broker of highland beach fla 
eisen and rutherford pleaded guilty to one count each of 
securities fraud seisser pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud 
all face maximum sentnces of five years in prison and fines of 
250000 
us district judge nicholas h politan will sentence them aug 
22 
alito said the first step in the scheme was for fd roberts to 
locate or create companies which usually existed only on paper and 
had few or no assets 
the companies would then make an initial public offering of the 
stock fd roberts would then purchase the stock in nominee 
accounts that its officals referred to as dirtbag accounts 
alito said 
fd roberts stockbrokers would then conceal their ownership in 
the accounts while they touted and sold the securities at inflated 
prices alito said and humphrey admitted in court 
the sales manager hired a young inexperienced sales staff with 
little or no training in securities the employees used 
highpressure badgering telephone sales techniques to sell the 
stock 
alito said up to 250 of the brokers worked at any given time 
some of them making up to 250000 a year 
alito said he would seek restitution for the investors but he 
added officials are not sure where all the money generated by the 
fd roberts is

debtladen southmark corp has agreed to sell its 
largest insurance subsidiary for 1355 million as it pares down 
its holdings and looks for cash 
southmark which is in violation of agreements with holders of 
about 11 billion in bonds said tuesday it had reached agreement 
in principle to sell its 89 percent stake in integon corp for 
521 a share to a partnership of jupiter industries inc in 
chicago and head insurance investors lp 
integons other stockholders will receive no less than 2272 
million or 7 a share for their holdings under the agreement 
in addition southmark also will receive 30 million in 
preferred stock in exchange for the 35 million in preferred stock 
it currently holds in integon 
southmark has been shopping integon based in winstonsalem 
nc and its other insurance holdings since january when its two 
top officers were ousted by outside directors 
the proposed sale of integon is another step in our efforts to 
downsize southmark through selective asset sales said chairman 
arthur g weiss brought in to run the company after chairman gene 
e phillips and vice chairman william s friedman were forced out 
southmark spokeswoman susan seiter said the sale will help the 
companys cash flow but will not bring it into compliance with net 
worth provisions of the outstanding bonds 
southmark said two weeks ago stockholders equity had fallen 
from 701 million on june 30 1988 to a negative 428 million on 
march 31 although the change opens the door for creditors to begin 
proceedings to force southmark into bankruptcy they have not done 
so and southmark says it can continue to pay interest on the bonds 
for some time 
the sale is subject to further discussions among the parties 
including obtaining fairness opinions and regulatory board approval 
of the various companies 
integon with assets of more than 14 billion last week 
reported firstquarter income of 489 million compared with last 
years 580 million loss in the first quarter 
the company markets a diversified line of life insurance and 
annuity products especially property and casualty insurance and 
private mortgage insurance through nine subsidiaries although most 
operations are in the southeast it is licensed in 47 states and 
the district of columbia 
the sale also comes in the midst of a bitter fight for control 
of southmark which two weeks ago announced a 104 billion 
quarterly loss due primarily to an 829 million writedown of its 
real estate assets 
herbert parks a greensboro nc developer and real estate 
investor is leading a proxy fight to win three seats on 
southmarks sevenmember board of directors

steelmakers are trying hard not to look 
prosperous as they wait for president bush to unveil his plan for 
extending restraints on steel imports 
prices are up but not as high as they were when president 
reagan established fiveyear quotas on steel imports in late 1984 
domestic producers say as they gather in washington for their 
annual meeting starting today 
supplies of certain products are tight but not because of 
reagans voluntary restraint agreements the market is working as 
it should they say 
and they probably made 3 billion last year so its kind of 
hard to claim injury said charles bradford steel analyst for 
merrill lynch capital markets 
under the trade rules they have to be injured by imports to 
get trade protection he said 
they have a real problem bradford said but since bush 
promised youd better believe they are going to get it 
an extension of reagans vras was a lastminute campaign promise 
by bush and during their meeting steel executives are expected to 
call on the president to fulfill his pledge promptly 
legislation enabling the president to enter another round of 
quota agreements with steelproducing nations has 57 cosponsors in 
the senate nearly twice the number who sponsored the 1984 quota 
bill the american iron and steel institute counts 231 house 
members as cosponsors 
with the broad support in congress for renewal of vras the 
industrys big questions concern the duration and strength of the 
bush program not whether there will be another round of quotas 
among options being discussed in washington is a twoyear 
version of reagans fiveyear plan another option is a fouryear 
plan that would relax restraints on individual countries as they 
eliminate unfair trade practices according to richard bryers 
legislative director for us sen john heinz rpa no version has 
emerged as the most popular 
bush is expected to unveil his quota plan as early as june 
there is little debate that the industry has healed during the 
last 4 years although some authorities argue the turnaround was 
less the result of import quotas as of industry streamlining 
equipment upgrading and the weakening of the dollar 
average employment edged higher by about 6000 jobs to 168900 
workers in 1988 the first yearly increase since 1979 according to 
the american iron and steel institute 
following losses of 12 billion from 1982 to 1986 the industry 
had operating profits of 1 billion in 1987 and 3 billion in 1988 
exports are rising reviving an outlet that was largely closed 
to us producers for much of the 1980s 
the improvement is largely a result of a swing in the value of 
the dollar compared with other currencies when the dollar was 
strong against other currencies us goods were more expensive 
overseas and imports were cheaper in the united states 
bethlehem steel corp the secondlargest us producer this 
month agreed to raise wages and benefits in a tentative agreement 
with the united steelworkers that is being criticized on wall 
street as too generous 
the agreement also could set a pattern for talks between the usw 
and other steelmakers just two years ago bethlehem explored its 
options under a possible bankruptcy filing

the government in its continuing fight against 
resurgent inflation today pushed up interest rates a full 
percentage point to 14 percent the highest level in more than four 
years 
weakness in the british pound triggered the increase the first 
since november 
the bank of england signaled the rise in british commercial 
banks base lending rate by announcing it was raising its own money 
market rate to 14 percent effective today 
britains four major commercial banks barclays bank plc 
midland bank plc national westminster bank plc and lloyds bank 
plc responded by raising their base rate one point to that level 
after its announcement the bank of england underlined its 
support for the pound by intervening against the dollar foreign 
exchange dealers said 
both moves helped lift sterling about one cent against the 
dollar but the pound quickly fell back from highs reached 
immediately after the rate announcement 
the pound stood at 15665 at late morning in london down from 
a high of 15750 after the rate increase but up from 15645 in 
new york late tuesday 
stock prices fell sharply on londons stock exchange the 
financial timesstock exchange 100share index fell 262 points or 
12 percent to 21254 by late morning 
the government was obviously reacting because it is concerned 
about the fall in the pound said tim fox an economist at 
midland bank 
prime minister margaret thatcher speaking at the conservative 
partys womens national conference repeated that high interest 
rates were necessary to bring down inflation which is running at 
an annual rate of 8 percent compared with 39 percent a year ago 
she said that while the effects of high interest rates might be 
uncomfortable continued high inflation would be worse 
a treasury official who wasnt identified in accordance with 
british practice said the government has always made it clear 
that we will take no risks with inflation 
he said that while consumer demand is slowing the government 
couldnt ignore the fall in the currency 
chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson the treasurys top 
official has repeatedly stated over the past few months that the 
government was prepared to defend sterling because a decline in the 
currency would increase inflationary pressures 
the 8 percent annual inflation rate for april raised 
expectations that inflation would climb higher rather than peak at 
that level as lawson had forecast in march some analysts have 
said that the government might raise interest rates as far as 15 
percent before they come back down again 
the interest rate rise might not be passed on to mortgage 
holders this time officials from building societies which are the 
major lenders of mortgage money in britain have indicated recently 
that they might hold off on increasing mortgage rates especially 
if they view a base rate rise as a shortterm measure 
mortgage rates were last increased in january to between 135 
percent and 142 percent 
building societies flush with funds arent keen to suppress 
the mortgage market which has already been depressed by previous 
rate rises 
the last time interest rates stood at 14 percent was in march 
1985 the interest rate increase was the 10th since june when the 
base rate stood at 75 percent a decade low 
the commercial banks corporate customers can obtain loans at 
one percentage point above the base rate

share prices were sharply lower but recovering 
from an earlier plunge by midday wednesday as the bearish effect of 
a rise in british interest rates was offset by indications economic 
growth has slowed 
the financial timesstock exchange 100share index was off 267 
points or 12 percent at 21249 by about 1215 pm in london 
it was above the morning low of 333 points down which came a few 
minutes after the bank of england signaled a rise in base rates to 
14 percent from 13 percent 
the central bank prompted the interest rate hike after the 
recent plunge in the pound started to threaten the british 
governments antiinflationary strategy 
but the latemorning news that british retail sales volume fell 
a surprising 14 percent in april gave some comfort to the market 
suggesting that previous measures to slow the economy were having 
the desired effect 
paul walton an equity analyst at the london investment firm 
warburg securities said 14 percent base rates probably would be 
sufficient to counter inflation without denting corporate profits 
too much 
this will be the final turn of the screw walton said 
volume came to 3069 million shares by midday compared with 245 
million shares at the same time tuesday

aetna life and casualty officials say the 
company will resume writing new property and casualty insurance 
policies in california 
the announcement follows a moratorium on new policies that began 
after the california supreme court upheld most of proposition 103 
two weeks ago 
the hartfordbased insurance company reversed itself because the 
department of insurance is interpreting the measure in a way 
consistent with the court ruling which clearly permits a fair 
return on our business and permits us to petition for relief from 
proposition 103 rate rollbacks said aetna spokesman jason wright 
aetna was the only insurer to stop writing new policies after 
the court ruling it continued to renew policies of existing 
customers 
the court ruled that the 20 percent rate rollback imposed by 
proposition 103 is constitutional but it said insurers must first 
be allowed to earn a fair return on their investments 
the department of insurance has since issued a detailed form 
that insurers must complete by june 3 if they want to be exempted 
from the rate cut insurance commissioner roxani gillespie has 
promised that decisions will be made by november 
aetna is the ninthlargest property and casualty insurer in 
california auto insurance makes up a small portion of the 
companys business

the opec president said an increase 
in the cartels output is needed if members want to maintain an 
18perbarrel benchmark price through 1989 according to an 
interview published wednesday 
if we wish to maintain the current level until the end of the 
year then we must increase the production quotas said rilwanu 
lukman in an interview published in the saudi arabian weekly 
magazine alyamamah 
the ministerial council of the 13nation organization of 
petroleum exporting countries holds its biannual meeting june 5 in 
vienna to consider production and pricing policy for the july to 
december period 
the cartels 185 million barrelperday production ceiling for 
the first six months of the year has been largely responsible for 
arresting a downslide in prices and raising them beyond opecs 
targeted 18 price 
at times the price has overshot that level by 2 to 3 though 
oil industry analysts also attribute this hike to major oil 
accidents in the north sea and alaska 
lukman who is also nigerias oil minister referred to demand 
by some opec members for an increase in the overall quota between 
one and 15 million barrels per day 
we want a moderate and gradual increase in prices not a 
sudden one and we therefore have to study the market to decide on 
the best production level for the second half of the year he 
said 
lukman said that opec should have a moving ceiling which it 
can raise or lower to maintain the price levels it sought 
but he also noted that in case output had to be considerably 
hiked it would only be the opec member states with high reserves 
and production capability that could accommodate such demand he 
listed in this respect saudi arabia kuwait the united arab 
emirates iraq and iran 
producers outside the cartel could harm the opec price system if 
they did not cooperate on output levels he said 
we definitely need assurances from them that they will 
cooperate with us and work together with us not doing anything 
that would harm the market he said

offer for the shuttle from developer donald trump 
eastern attorney harvey miller announced the deadline during an 
abbreviated hearing before us bankruptcy judge burton r lifland 
all parties in easterns bankruptcy case including the airlines 
unions and creditors were expected to discuss the competing 
offers for the washingtonnew yorkboston shuttle 
but tuesdays court session lasted 20 minutes and followed a 
brief hearing monday when miller told lifland that eastern still 
had questions about america wests financing for the shuttle 
purchase 
the parties were to return to court thursday morning if america 
west has arranged its financing commitments by this afternoons 
deadline lifland must determine whether they are satisfactory 
before both offers for the shuttle are considered further lifland 
must approve any sale of eastern assets 
america west also must win approval from the port authority of 
new york and new jersey as a tenant at laguardia airport the port 
authoritys board of governors is scheduled to meet thursday

said monday he would not raise his bid or extend the offer past the 
deadline 
america west based in phoenix is offering eastern 415 million 
for the shuttle and 336 million for 10 boeing 757s alternatively 
america west would buy only the shuttles gates and landing slots 
in the three airports for 375 million without 21 boeing 727s that 
are included in trumps deal

properties including facilities at the philadelphia airport and 
eastern routes from philadelphia to montreal and toronto 
the unions want the airline sold as one entity but texas air 
corp easterns parent wants to sell 18 billion of the 
airlines assets and operate as a smaller carrier 
eastern president phil bakes said today in atlanta the carrier 
must become streamlined before it can be saved and said pilots who 
walked out in sympathy with striking machinists may not have jobs 
when the airline recovers 
bakes told a group of travel industry representatives that while 
there are no plans to liquidate eastern the airline would need to 
part with the 18 billion in assets to become financially solvent

the government raised interest rates by a full 
percentage point wednesday hiking them to a fouryear high in a 
counterattack against newly resurgent inflation that has been 
worsened by a drop in the british pound 
the bank of england signaled the change by raising its base 
lending rate to 14 percent and major commercial banks responded by 
boosting their prime lending rates one point to that level 
it was the 10th increase since last june when rates stood at a 
decade low of 75 percent but economists called the latest action 
particularly meaningful the last time interest rates stood at 14 
percent was in march 1985 prime minister margaret thatchers 
government has sought to curb an annual inflation rate which has 
moved up to 8 percent in april compared with 39 percent a year 
earlier 
stephen king an economist with james capel and co said 
wednesdays rate hike is an important statement that the 
government is not going to accommodate any inflationary pressures 
growing in the economy 
after announcing the increase the bank of england also 
intervened in the foreign exchange market by selling dollars for 
pounds underscoring its support for the british currency dealers 
said 
both moves helped lift sterling about one cent against the 
dollar but it quickly fell back from highs reached immediately 
after the rate announcement the pound closed at 15695 in london 
up from 15675 dollarslate tuesday 
prices fell sharply on londons stock exchange the financial 
timesstock exchange 100share index closed down 189 points at 
21327 
but shares were off their lows on news that british retail sales 
volume fell an unexpected 14 percent in april providing evidence 
that the previous interest rate rises were having some effect of 
curbing strong consumer spending 
a treasury official who wasnt identified in accordance with 
british practice said that while consumer demand was slowing the 
government couldnt ignore the fall in the currency a weaker pound 
fuels inflation by making imports more expensive 
mrs thatcher speaking at the conservative partys womens 
national conference said that while the effects of high interest 
rates might be uncomfortable continued high inflation would be 
worse 
chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson the treasurys top 
official said in a radio interview overheating is on the way to 
subsiding it is only a matter of time before inflation is coming 
down 
but opposition labor party leader neil kinnock attacked the 
governments move saying the higher interest rates could broaden 
the countrys trade deficit which stood at 27 billion in march 
economists predict the british economy will grow between 25 
percent and 28 percent this year vs 38 percent in 1988

with republicans taking the lead the house 
judiciary committee voted today to cut by half the increased civil 
penalties that president bush wants to impose on fraudulent savings 
and loan operators and embezzlers 
voting 1714 the committee adopted an amendment by rep william 
j hughes dnj to reduce the proposed new civil penalties to 
500000 for each violation and to a maximum of 25 million 
against any one individual 
as part of his 90 billion sampl bailout package bush had sought 
to raise the civil penalties for defrauding banks thrifts and 
other financial institutions backed by federal deposit insurance 
from the current maximum of 5000 to 1 million for each violation 
hughes said his amendment which was backed by the american 
bankers association but opposed by the administration was intended 
to make the civil penalties remedial rather than punitive 
opponents however said the effect will be to reduce the 
governments ability to recover billions of dollars in federal 
deposit insurance funds that might be lost in the future to insider 
loans fraud and embezzlement the major contibutors to the 
current sampl crisis 
the taxpayers are going to have to fork up 300 billion 
because of a bunch of high rollers said rep romano l mazzoli 
dky he referred to the interest costs over the 30 years for the 
taxpayer share of bushs bailout plan 
i dont think we should be worrying about remedializing 
them mazzoli said of fraudulent sampl operators we should worry 
about punishing them 
five of the judiciary committees 21 democrats including 
hughes and 12 of its 14 republicans supported the amendment 
although bush got all he wanted and more from the senate and the 
house banking committee in seeking to make sampl owners put more of 
their own money at risk he faced new opposition to that as well 
today from members of his own party 
rep henry hyde rill said he would offer an amendment today 
before the house judiciary committee to make sampl regulators go 
through lengthy hearings before making thrift operators put up 
billions of dollars in new capital 
robert glauber bushs no 2 official at the treasury 
department called hydes measure a grave error 
bushs proposal approved by both the full senate and the house 
banking committee would raise from the current five years to 20 
years the maximum sentence for bank and sampl fraud and embezzlement 
the maximum fine would rise from 5000 to 1 million 
fraud has been blamed by the general accounting office 
regulatory officials and the justice department as the single 
biggest contributor to what has become the nations largest 
financial crisis since the depression 
the legislation is the price the administration is demanding for 
a 90 billion bailout of the industry 
bush jumped into the fray tuesday asking house leaders in a 
letter to hold absolutely firm against any attempt to weaken 
those vital elements which protect the american taxpayer from 
additional costs 
now is the time for the house to act bush said in identical 
letters to house speaker jim wright dtexas democratic leader tom 
foley of washington democratic whip tony coelho of california 
house republican leader bob michel of illinois and house gop whip 
newt gingrich of georgia 
bipartisan majorities in both the senate and house have 
defeated determined special interest lobbying against the tough 
capital standards needed to protect american taxpayers from a 
repeat of this tragedy he said 
hyde denied his measure is an attempt to weaken the capital 
standards adopted earlier this month by the banking committee 
were not touching the capital requirements at all he said 
an effort will be made to provide for hearings under the 
administrative procedures act so that sampls affected by the new 
capital structure requirements will have an opportunity to get due 
process 
but rep bruce morrison dconn a member of both the judiciary 
and banking committees described the proposal as a backdoor 
attempt to undercut the ability of the federal deposit insurance 
corporation to enforce the capital standards 
if we create a whole scheme of appeals and litigation to 
prevent the fdic from enforcing the standards then well have 
another run on the taxpayers because we wont have real money 
representing these institutions 
the 51member banking committee approved the bill three weeks 
ago two weeks after it was approved by the full senate the house 
ways and means committee last week changed bushs proposal to make 
the 50 billion taxpayer share of the bailout part of the federal 
deficit over the next three years 
after the house judiciary committee completes its action the 
bill still has to go before the house government operations 
committee and the house rules committee before reaching the house 
floor for action there now anticipated the second week of june

the european parliament on wednesday 
adopted proposals for a law that would cut the number of us 
television programs shown in europe despite intense lobbying from 
the united states 
the proposed law will most likely be adopted by the governments 
of the 12 european economic community members at a meeting in 
luxembourg june 14 
the proposal was designed to coordinate broadcasting regulations 
in the 12nation eec and includes provisions to reserve a majority 
of transmission time to european works and to limit the amount of 
advertising allowed on television 
parliamentarians adopted a stronglyworded amendment to try to 
ensure that at least 501 percent of entertainment programs 
broadcast be europeanproduced by 1993 
last week carla hills the us trade representative sent a 
letter to lord plumb president of the european parliament to 
express washingtons strong objections to the proposal 
the enactment of such a measure is unjustifiable and would 
almost certainly have a disastrous effect on the us industrys 
substantial european earnings mrs hills wrote 
whatever benefits this television directive might promise to 
bring to europe will undoubtedly be outweighed by its extremely 
negative impact on our bilateral trade relations she said 
mrs hills warned that if the measure were adopted she would 
have no choice but to consider how to proceed in response to it 
underspecial 301 provisions 
these provisions allow the united states to issue a list of 
nations that have erected the most harmful barriers against us 
products the administration would have 18 months to negotiate the 
removal of the barriers and if it failed it could slap 100 percent 
levies on imports from these trading partners 
members of the us delegation said legislators had listened to 
their arguments but said the tv law was a matter of political 
concern 
the measure is part of steps being taken by the european 
community in its drive to form a single market allowing the free 
flow of goods people and money among the dozen nations by the 
end of 1992

if you believe the optimists of wall street the 
stock market is sending out a happy message for the american 
economy these days 
the crash of 1987 is fading fast into history without having 
caused much trouble outside the world of wall street itself 
and the economy which hasnt suffered an official recession in 
seven years appears to be sailing into the 1990s with its momentum 
intact and no slump in sight 
but the sixmonthold rally in stock prices that has helped 
engender this kind of enthusiasm still has its skeptics in fact 
they maintain investors in the securities markets have drifted 
into a dream world that could be setting them up for another rude 
shock 
from the middle of november through the end of last week the 
dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks rose almost 23 percent 
surpassing the 2500 level for the first time since a week before 
the black monday crash of oct 19 1987 
the average which is the oldest and best known measure of 
market trends has moved within striking distance of the high of 
272242 it reached on aug 25 1987 
by some gauges that include dividends as well as the level of 
stock prices the market already has recouped all its 1987 losses 
and has reached new peaks maintains norman fosback editor of the 
investment advisory letter market logic in fort lauderdale fla 
any way its measured it has been a remarkable comeback 
especially considering that it took stocks 25 years to recover from 
the crash of 1929 
the rally has drawn support from a spreading belief that the 
federal reserve board has found a way to steer the economy safely 
past the threat of rising inflation without causing any serious 
slump in production consumption or investment 
it also has bolstered the case of new wave economists who 
believe that the system for a variety of reasons is now able to 
withstand the forces that used to drive it into a cyclical decline 
every four years or so 
the new wave is on a roll declares one of its most 
prominent proponents edward yardeni at the investment firm of 
prudentialbache securities 
of course inflation is still a problem but there are many 
recent developments that should help to offset such business cycle 
pressures as high capacity utilization and low unemployment which 
in the past pushed inflation higher 
meanwhile corporate earnings a primary longterm determinant 
of stock market trends have risen sharply in the past couple of 
years 
the market has far firmer foundations now than when it last 
moved to this general level in mid1987 fosback says 
but a vocal group of dissenters calls this kind of reasoning not 
only dubious but dangerous 
players in the stock market are dancing to a tune only they 
can hear says erich heinemann chief economist at ladenburg 
thalmann amp co 
when tight money bites in earnest repercussions will ripple 
through the entire economy in many ways the atmosphere in wall 
street reminds us of the summer of 1987 just prior to the market 
meltdown 
says raymond f devoe jr an analyst at legg mason wood walker 
inc the slowdown in the economy currently under way is supposed 
to make a soft landing without going into recession 
several new bull market scenarios call for the nicest 
recession youve ever seen that would lower interest rates and 
cause foreign money to come surging into the us stock market 
in our view this all sounds like deja voodoo the best of 
all possible worlds there is a recession out there somewhere in 
time and all the new era or new wave rhetoric wont make it go 
away

from labor travails to terrorist threats to rising fuel prices 
to aging planes the nations airlines face daunting challenges as 
their busiest season of the year begins this memorial day weekend 
nonetheless many industry analysts and travel agents expect a 
strong summer for air travel as stable fares at home and a more 
valuable dollar abroad lure vacationers 
i think its going to be a record summer said louis 
marckesano an airline analyst for janney montgomery scott inc a 
philadelphia securities firm 
the airline industry has been turned on its head with 
competition growing fiercer and takeover raiders swarming over 
profitable northwest airlines 
but the industrys biggest trauma this year a bitter labor 
strike at eastern airlines hasnt resulted in the mass 
inconvenience to travelers that originally was feared in fact 
its turned out to be a boon for easterns leading competitors 
delta air lines american airlines pan am corp and usair group 
inc especially are reaping windfall profits from the woes of 
eastern which has been in chapter 11 bankruptcy protection since 
march 9 together the rivals have captured an estimated 6 million 
to 7 million a day in revenue lost by eastern which has been 
virtually grounded by the walkout that started march 4 
the extra profits have given many big airlines a cushion against 
surging fuel prices sparing them from having to hike fares 
marckesano and others suggested 
easterns sister carrier continental airlines announced last 
month that it was raising its maxsaver discount fares by up to 
18 percent but continental often a price leader recently 
retracted the fare hike after other carriers failed to match its 
initiative 
that could signal an end at least for a while to what had been 
a trend of rising fares air tariffs have increased as much as 20 
percent this year over 1988 some analysts reckon 
i dont think there are going to be vast increases in fares 
said andrew geller who follows the industry for provident national 
bank in philadelphia the airlines have tested almost the 
limits of fares 
the halt to the fare spiral has occurred despite a dramatic rise 
in prices of jet fuel caused partly by the alaskan oil spill and 
expectations of possible short oil supplies 
jet fuel one of the biggest costs in the airline industry has 
jumped to about 65 cents a gallon from 587 cents in february 
before the march 24 exxon tanker spill that delayed shipments of 
crude oil to refineries 
projections by avmark inc an aviation consulting concern 
suggest jet fuel costs will rise even more in years ahead hitting 
at least 80 cents a gallon by the end of the century 
since theyre not raising fares many carriers are resorting to 
more creative ways of making money 
the most important strategy is the use of sophisticated 
reservations computers to determine the lowest possible number of 
cutrate tickets that should be offered on each flight thats why 
its often difficult or impossible to get a discount seat on a 
highdemand new yorklos angeles sunday afternoon flight and easy 
to fly cheaply midweek from salt lake city to pittsburgh 
the apparent slowdown in the economy credited in part to higher 
interest rates that have discouraged consumers from spending 
doesnt appear to have dampened air travel 
it may darken the skies a bit but i dont see any big storm 
clouds said robert joedicke an analyst at shearson lehman 
hutton inc in new york 
he expects passenger traffic this summer to be at least as good 
as last year within the united states and stronger than a lot of 
people think overseas 
our business is up fairly substantially for this summer over 
last year said david perelman president of dms travel in 
midtown manhattan bookings to europe are running 15 percent to 30 
percent above last summer while domestic travel is up slightly he 
estimated 
the anticipated growth in foreign travel is largely due to the 
rebounding dollar analysts say the us currency has been surging 
in value against the japanese yen west german mark and british 
pound in recent weeks this means it takes fewer dollars to 
vacation in japan and europe than it did a year ago 
in addition international airlines like pan am are sharply 
discounting fares to europe this summer pan ams foreign passenger 
traffic rose 19 percent in december 1988 from a year earlier but 
it dropped 86 percent in january and 140 percent in february 
largely as a result of the dec 21 crash of a usbound flight 
over scotland that has been blamed on a terrorist bomb the 
disaster scared many potential fliers away 
pan ams overseas traffic has been picking up and is expected to 
post an increase for may spokeswoman pamela hanlon said in new 
york 
air terrorism isnt the only fear of flying that has kept 
travelers away some wouldbe passengers are still wary of the 
stories about aging planes that break up in midair despite the 
recent flurry of orders for new aircraft by many big carriers 
seeking to rejuvenate their fleets 
there are constant reminders this past tuesday for example 
the national transportation safety board laid the major blame on 
aloha airlines maintenance program for failing to detect fatigue 
damage to the fuselage of a 19yearold boeing 737 that split open 
over hawaii slightly more than a year ago

grain and soybean future prices drifted lower 
wednesday in moderate trading on the chicago board of trade as 
rainfall in growing areas improved the prospects for good crops 
the price of the new crop corn and soybeans were reflecting 
enhanced soil moisture said ted mao an analyst for shearson 
lehman hutton inc in new york 
soybean futures suffered as some private forecasts suggested 
that the national weather service 6 to 10day outlook will 
indicate abovenormal rain in crop areas 
but wheat prices were up on news from exporters that egypt 
bought about 300000 metric tons of us soft red winter and soft 
white wheat 
corn prices were mostly lower but up from the days low because 
of technical support and spillover from a rally in soybean futures 
as is the case in general the market tends to overdo 
itself mao said we went from inflated levels to levels low 
enough that we assume we will have an above average crop the 
growing season is still a long one 
at the close wheat was 2 cents lower to 3 cents higher with 
the price for delivery in july at 392 a bushel corn was 3 
cents to 5 cents lower with delivery in july at 261 oats were 
1 cent to 2 cents lower with july at 173 a bushel soybeans were 
2 cents to 8 cents lower with july at 696 a bushel

turmoil within the airline industry has some 
passengers a little nervous but theyre still flying and generally 
want the government to stay out of the business 
random interviews with travelers by ap reporters at big airports 
nationwide suggested the underlying demand for airline seats 
remains strong as the country heads into the traditional memorial 
day summer kickoff 
at the same time theres a high level of awareness by the 
traveling public on issues confronting the airline industry 
theres a bitter eastern airlines strike northwest airlines is on 
the auction block and aging aircraft is a frequent topic 
flying is probably less safe because some of the jets are a 
lot older said mike osborne a st louis businessman passing 
through chicagos ohare international airport this week 
structurally theyre beginning to have problems i guess 
many carriers are rushing to buy airplanes to expand and replace 
their fleets this past tuesday the national transportation safety 
board reported an industrywide deficiency in the inspection of 
the popular but aging boeing 737 airplanes 
everybodys on strike richard siska a st louis 
businessman said in chicago youve got management doing work 
that theyre not qualified to do and its the passengers who take 
the risks 
despite the concerns flying is still safer than driving 
said jason manning a jewelry salesman traveling through 
seattletacoma international airport 
its safer than driving a car said jeff reistroffer 32 a 
fairbanks alaska resident arriving at los angeles international 
airport on wednesday 
if youre going down the freeway two cars at 50 mph one 
driver sneezes its all over a pilot can sneeze and he can go all 
over the place theres a lot of leeway 
employees meanwhile have mixed feelings about the changes in 
their industry 
i havent noticed any difference in the attitude here at 
northwest said one pilot in atlanta my job has not changed 
one iota 
but a northwest flight attendant in chicago said i feel 
secure that northwest wants to stay in the airline business but 
buyout possibilities make me a little nervous 
an american flight attendant in chicago said i make less 
money because of deregulation the girls who have been flying for 
more than 10 or 15 years are making 30 to 40 thousand dollars a 
year and those whove been flying for 10 years or less only make 
10 to 20 thousand 
americans twotier wage scale where it takes 12 years to reach 
top pay is a frequent target of union criticism and was one of the 
important issues in recently concluded contract negotiations 
a businessman at hartsfield atlanta international airport agreed 
the government shouldnt reassert its regulatory authority over the 
airline business which it largely relinquished 10 years ago 
prices are going up theres no question a lot of it is to 
cover their operating expenses he said but because of 
deregulation many airlines are marking down their prices to 
compete passenger traffic is up but i think they are 
concentrating on improving their aircraft and upgrading 
maintenance 
the airlines are doing just fine now and competition will 
establish the price he said 
cynthia kensy an air force airplane mechanic travel through 
chicago was one of the few who said more regulation is needed 
its letting people get a little loose with what they do 
ms kensy said safety service theyre all sliding a little bit 
here and there 
the changes in the industry are having some effect on the 
airports depending on their connections with specific airlines 
atlanta for example is a major hub for eastern and at times 
it certainly has been more hectic due to the eastern strike said 
a delta employee 
but at dallasfort worth international airport the main effect 
of the eastern strike is expected to be a boost in public relations 
value 
dfw spokesman joe dealey said the reduction in easterns 
operations in atlanta should allow the texas airport to leapfrog 
over hartsfield to become the worlds second or third busiest 
airport 
dfw last year ranked third in operations behind ohare and 
hartsfield and fourth in passengers behind those and los angeles

her investment account to generate more than 1 million in 
commissions for himself has been awarded 31 million by an 
arbitration panel 
in one of the biggest securities case awards ever the national 
association of securities dealers disclosed tuesday that an

million by broker d elliott dahle jr and 21 million by shearson 
lehman hutton inc his former employer

uneventful trading today with little news to spur investors 
the market opened lower behind weakening bond prices after the 
bank of england said it would raise its base lending rate from 13 
percent to 14 percent

rising bond prices then moved narrowly for the remainder of the

peroni technical analyst with janney montgomery scott 
analysts said the market spent most of the day in a 
consolidation phase with some investors taking profits amid mostly 
evenkeeled buying and selling 
after the 5 percent rally of the last couple of weeks its 
natural for the market to pause for rest and relaxation said

despite concern on tuesday that the dollar was rising too fast 
against japanese and european currencies many analysts said the 
market continued to view the strengthening us dollar as positive

opec nations supplied slightly more oil 
to the world market in april than allowed in a production accord 
designed to lift crude prices the organization said wednesday 
it was the first time this year that the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries reported a supply level above the 
ceiling set in an agreement covering output for the first six 
months of 1989 
private analysts have detected a recent pickup in production by 
opec nations 
subroto secretarygeneral of the 13nation oil organization 
urged the producers to try to sustain the present hardwon 
stability in the market 
production restraint by all producers both inside and outside 
opec is still necessary in view of the fragility of the present 
price structure he was quoted as saying in a statement issued by 
the opec news agency 
the statement said 12 of the 13 members poured 1754 million 
barrels a day into the international market last month 
the production agreement for the first half of 1989 sets a 
supply target of 1751 million barrels a day for the 12 members 
opec said total production by the dozen nations amounted to 
1847 million barrels a day in april figures were not available 
for the united arab emirates it said 
the socalled opec overproduction to which the media has been 
calling attention has not been supplied to the market but has gone 
into building stocks in a concerted effort by member countries not 
to destabilize the market the cartel said 
during january to april the 12 countries added nearly 70 
million barrels to their stocks 383 million barrels to stocks 
held abroad and 316 million to those within national boundaries 
it said 
analysts have attributed the recent increase in production 
partly to an effort by opec nations to stake out positions in 
advance of a key meeting next month in vienna at that gathering 
the oil chiefs will agree on a production level for the second half 
of the year and set individual quotas for each country 
kuwait and the united arab emirates analysts say want a bigger 
share of the overall ceiling negotiated by the producers 
the international energy agency in its monthly oil market 
report estimated opec output at 205 million barrels a day in 
april up from 198 million barrels the previous month 
the current accord worked out in late november set a 
production limit of 185 million barrels a day for the entire 
cartel opec measures a nations quota by figuring crude production 
and the amount of oil put into or drawn out of stocks 
the output ceiling well under december levels was set in an 
effort to boost prices to a target of 18 dollars a barrel 
prices soared beyond that benchmark although the rally has 
eased a bit recently west texas intermediate the benchmark 
american crude has been trading in the range of 19 dollars to 20 
dollars a barrel 
the price surge has been attributed not only to opecs 
production cuts but also to accidents in oilproducing areas that 
have reduced the supply in the world market

car and truck sales rose a modest 27 percent in 
midmay from the same period last year manufacturers reported 
wednesday although analysts noted the sales compared with a 
yearearlier period that may have been slower than usual 
during the may 1120 period sales of cars and light trucks made 
by the eight major usbased automakers rose to a rate of 39360 a 
day from a pace of 38334 during the same period last year 
last year many buyer incentives expired may 11 prompting some 
consumers to hasten purchase plans in order to take advantage of 
the deals that effectively borrowed purchases from later sales 
periods 
in the may 1120 period this year wideranging incentive 
programs by general motors corp ford motor co chrysler corp 
and some of the other major automakers were in effect 
but analyst mary anne sudol of fitch investors service inc in 
new york said consumers seemed to be ignoring the bait 
i dont know what its going to take to bring customers back 
to the showrooms she said i think demand is just tired at 
this point 
tom webb a senior economist with the national automobile 
dealers association in mclain va said basically what sales 
have shown is that the underlying demand is less than what most 
people expected given those sales theres going to have to be 
some further production cuts they would be modest though 
automakers have been trimming their inventories by offering 
incentives to spur sales and by cutting production 
ford spokesman bill carroll said that on may 31 when the 
companys current incentive program expires he expected another 
more limited incentive package to be announced 
gms program ends june 5 and chryslers continues indefinitely 
the incentive programs were prompted by slowerthananticipated 
sales during the first three months of the year 
through may 20 car and truck sales by the eight makers were 36 
percent behind the pace during the same period last year which was 
the secondbest in automotive history car sales were down 54 
percent and truck sales were down 03 percent 
ford sold cars at an average daily rate of 7616 during may 
1120 this year up 28 percent from the 7410 rate a year earlier 
car sales for the year to date period were 05 percent behind last 
years rate fords midmay truck sales were 61 percent higher 
than the rate during the period last year and for the year were 
running 29 percent behind last years pace 
gm cars sold at a daily rate of 11895 during midmay this year

gladys stern held a peanut butter 
jar in one hand and in the other she clutched the notice that 
publix super markets inc was abandoning green stamps she took it 
hard 
stern was on the front lines of making fort lauderdale the top 
green stamp redemption area for sperry and hutchinson co since the 
mid 1980s for years stern had been turning samph green stamp books 
into toasters a breakfast set and dozens of other gadgets and 
knickknacks 
and now no more are they serious who decided this she 
said 
the decision by samphs largest customer to drop green stamps from 
its south florida stores this saturday reflects the troubles and 
transitions at the 94yearold trading stamp stalwart which is 
banking on hightechnology ventures such as plastic shopper id 
cards to adapt to changing consumer habits they say the days of 
pasting stamps in saver books may be numbered 
in the past two decades green stamps have gone the way of the 
beauty shopgroomed housewife they now are largely a symbol of 
nostalgia 
in 1969 more than 77 percent of supermarkets and 20 percent of 
service stations gave out green stamps today the sticky green 
strips are available in less than 7 percent of checkout lines and 
in less than 1 percent of the gas stations 
people just dont go home and lick stamps anymore said bill 
schroter spokesman for publix which accounted for 35 percent of 
green stamp sales nationwide last year theres been a steady 
decline in interest in green stamps 
publix the nations ninthlargest supermarket chain with 361 
florida stores cut green stamps in 1986 from its southwest florida 
stores and followed suit in northern florida the following year 
the high concentration of elderly green stamp loyalists in south 
florida kept the program going until this month said schroter 
many of our younger customers didnt even know what green 
stamps were he said its a thing of the past that doesnt fit 
in well anymore 
like other supermarkets around the country lakelandbased 
publix have been experimenting with other shopper incentives such 
as a frequentbuyer award system the using a credit cardtype 
device to log visits 
market researchers at new yorkbased samph agree their traditional 
following has been eroded by the popularity of discount coupons and

including the comparably high us interest rates growing 
inflation overseas and perceived weakness among the g7 in

energy futures prices climbed wednesday on the new york 
mercantile exchange reflecting increased confidence that the opec 
nations will agree on production quotas for later this year 
on other markets grain and soybean prices drifted lower 
precious metals finished mixed and livestock and pork prices 
plunged 
there had been speculation in the energy market that the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries would be unable to 
agree at its june meeting on production quotas for the second half 
of the year there is greater confidence now reflected in prices 
that an agreement will be reached said robert baker an energy 
analyst for prudentialbache securities inc in new york 
west texas intermediate crude oil was 44 cents to 62 cents 
higher with the contract for delivery in july at 1966 a barrel 
heating oil was 175 cents to 211 cents higher with june at 4961 
cents a gallon unleaded gasoline was 113 cents to 259 cents 
higher with june at 6683 cents a gallon 
baker said the sharp rise in energy prices also can be 
attributed to a report from the american petroleum institute that 
total oil stocks in the united states are down 9 million to 10 
million barrels 
traders also reacted to reports that norwegian helicopter pilots 
servicing norways north sea oil platforms could go on strike a 
prolonged strike would cut deeply into norways 15 million barrel 
daily north sea oil production baker said 
grain and soybean futures drifted lower on the chicago board of 
trade as rain continued to fall in growing areas 
the price of the new crop corn and soybeans were reflecting 
enhanced soil moisture said ted mao an analyst for shearson 
lehman hutton inc in new york 
soybean futures suffered as some private forecasts suggested 
that the national weather service 6 to 10day outlook will 
indicate abovenormal rain in crop areas 
wheat prices were up with news from exporters that egypt bought 
about 300000 metric tons of us soft red winter and soft white 
wheat 
corn prices were down but up from the days low because of 
technical support and spillover from a rally in soybean futures 
wheat settled 2 cents lower to 3 cents higher with july at 
398 a bushel corn was 3 cents to 5 cents lower with july at 
262 oats were 1 cents to 2 cents lower with july at 173 a 
bushel soybeans were 2 cents to 7 cents lower with july at 697 
a bushel 
precious metals prices were up a fraction in fairly quiet 
trading on new yorks commodity exchange 
the precious metals market is still concerned about the 
strength of the dollar said fred demler a metals analyst with 
drexel burnham lambert inc in new york 
the market is oversold but the feeling is prices will 
continue on the down side demler said 
gold settled 20 cents to 60 cents higher with june at 36470 
silver was unchanged with june at 5181 
copper which has given up nine cents this week was down again 
wednesday 50 cent to 70 cent with may at 108 a pound 
increases in exchange inventories high worldwide production 
and low industrial consumption is pushing down copper prices 
demler said 
livestock futures were sharply lower on the chicago mercantile 
exchange 
the drop in the cattle market was caused by stoploss selling 
and computer fund liquidation said paul hare an analyst with 
linnco futures inc in chicago 
the drop was assisted by a weak cash market outlook 
pork futures reacted negatively to heavy movement of bellies 
into storage and heavy hog marketings this week 
live cattle settled 10 cent to 110 cents lower with june at 
6987 cents a pound feeder cattle were 25 cent to 65 cent lower 
with may at 7672 cents a pound hogs were 15 cent to 62 cent 
lower with june at 4845 cents a pound frozen pork bellies were 
117 cents to 170 cents lower with july at 3310 cents a pound

stock speculators renewed their interest in avon 
products inc wednesday bidding the cosmetics companys shares 
higher in response to a report that avon may be the target of a 
hostile takeover attempt 
separately a congressman asked the federal trade commission to 
investigate avon stock purchases prior to a failed bid by amway 
corp on grounds that investor irwin l jacobs and amway executives 
may have sought to skirt antitrust laws 
avon stock closed up 137 to 3587 in composite trading on 
the new york stock exchange with 313 million shares changing 
hands composite trading volume in avon stock on tuesday amounted 
to 962100 shares 
the catalyst for the heavy trading appeared to be a report 
published in usa today that said jacobs and an unidentified major 
company plan to launch a joint bid for avon at 40 a share 
a secretary in jacobs office in minneapolis said he was out of 
town and unavailable to comment 
the newspaper said jacobs and the company are in the process of 
completing financing and other details of the hostile offer 
jacobs partner was said to be a company other than mary kay corp 
a dallasbased cosmetics seller that reportedly has expressed an 
interest in avon 
jacobs owns 103 percent of avons common stock through a 
partnership with amway amway an ada michbased direct selling 
firm last week withdrew its 39ashare offer for avon after avons 
board rejected the proposal 
usa today said if jacobs and his partner prevail over avon 
jacobs would meld part of avons business into his watkins products 
inc which sells vitamins beauty products and foods doortodoor 
avon spokesman john cox said the company had no comment on the 
report 
one wall street arbitrager said the report was treated with some 
skepticism and didnt trigger as much buying as it might have if 
the memory of the losses sustained when amway withdrew its proposal 
werent still fresh in speculators minds 
avon stock surged to a 52week high of 4125 shortly after 
amways may 10 bid amid hope that the bid might be increased when 
amway pulled out the stock sank 
rep john dingell dmich chairman of the house energy and 
commerce committee on wednesday asked the ftc to investigate avon 
stock purchases by jacobs and amway executives prior to amways bid 
antitrust laws require that a proposed merger must be reported 
if the acquirer holds 15 percent or more of the targets voting 
stock 
in the case of the attempted avon takeover mr jacobs and 
amway appear to have sought to avoid this requirement by arranging 
for the purchase of avon stock in the name of the aj 
partnership dingell wrote in a letter to ftc chairman daniel 
oliver 
aj partnership was the vehicle used by jacobs and amway to 
launch their takeover bid 
jacobs and amway have said there was nothing illegal or improper 
about their stock transactions

some of the nations top computer 
scientists angry over a wave of lawsuits seeking to copyright 
basic computer software picketed wednesday outside the 
headquarters of lotus development corp 
the scientists said lotus and a handful of other computer 
companies are trying to lock up rights to software that is as 
fundamental to computers as a steering wheel and pedals are to a 
car 
if there were copyrights like this on cars then every 
manufacturer would have to give you a different way to steer 
said richard stallman a programmer at the massachusetts institute 
of technology if you learned to drive a ford you wouldnt know 
how to drive chevrolets 
chanting slogans through a bullhorn stallman led about 150 mit 
professors graduate students and programmers from bostonarea 
computer firms in a march from cambridges technology square to 
lotuss headquarters 
under gray skies and intermittent rain they picketed for about 
an hour carrying signs saying innovation not litigation 
dont ruin our industry and no writs for bits 
the rash of lawsuits includes complaints filed by apple computer 
against competitors microsoft and hewlett packard and by ashton 
tate against fox software 
lotus which makes the bestselling computer accounting program 
lotus 123 is suing competitors paperback software international 
and mosaic marketing inc 
all of the suits allege illegal copying of a user interface 
technical jargon for what is often called the look and feel of 
a computer program including its basic commands menus and 
displays 
lotus and many other software companies contend that unless 
their products enjoy strong copyright protection they will not 
have an economic incentive to develop new programs 
our argument is that outandout copying of other peoples 
work stifles creativity and innovation said lotus spokeswoman 
betsy kosheff copyright law allows you to take other peoples 
work and build on it but not to steal it 
the protest grew out of an advertisement placed in an mit 
student newspaper last month by stallman gerald j sussman a 
professor of electrical engineering and marvin minsky founder of 
mits artificial intelligence laboratory 
they warned that the lawsuits could freeze out new companies 
make computers harder to use and ultimately retard the industry 
until quite recently people invented things everybody gave 
each other all their software we had fun and people made money 
anyway sussman said wednesday id like to see that come 
back 
stallman a prominent programmer who developed emacs a widely 
used system for editing computer programs said it is in the public 
interest to have computer programs share basic attributes so users 
do not have to learn each program from scratch 
the lawsuits he charged will lead to inefficiency and 
gratuitous incompatibility with a heavy cost for the economy 
among the protesters were brian kocher president of the 
association for computing machinery hal abelson a mit professor 
who helped develop the logo educational computer language ray 
solomonoff an eminent boston mathematician and patrick winston 
head of mits artificial intelligence lab 
stallman said the protesters have formed a new organization the 
league for programming freedom to try to pressure lotus and other 
firms to drop the lawsuits 
in leaflets handed out at the pickets the group urged people to 
boycott the firms bringing the lawsuits and to buy competing 
products instead they also advised programmers not to go to work 
for lotus apple and ashton tate 
copyright lawyers said the rash of look and feel lawsuits 
began in late 1986 after a federal judge in california ruled that 
a small software company unison world inc had infringed a 
competitors copyright on a program for making customized greeting 
cards 
since then several companies have won similar cases but each 
case rather than settling the law has tended to unsettle it and 
raise more questions said thomas ms hemnes a partner in the 
boston law firm of foley hoag amp eliot 
hemnes and other attorneys said the issue of how much of a 
computers basic programming can be patented eventually may be 
decided by the us supreme court

house lawmakers wednesday lashed out at fax 
attacks by advertisers who bombard facsimile machines with 
unsolicited material and they said telephone merchandisers who use 
computers to dial phone numbers at random could endanger public 
health and safety 
the lawmakers said advertisers were shooting themselves in the 
foot with intrusive sales pitches that in the case of facsimiles 
use up their receivers paper and for mobile and pagerphone users 
often make them pay for the calls 
on top of that citizens have a right to privacy said rep 
barney frank dmass the author of one of three bills that would 
restrain the use of junk fax advertising and computer 
autodialers 
frank told a hearing of the house energy and commerce 
telecommunications and finance subcommittee that it was stupid 
to assert that restrictions on unsolicited telepone messages would 
violate the senders first amendment rights 
were saying that you cant use technology to burden other 
people frank testified were not putting anybody out of 
business were not interfering with anybodys rights 
the subcommittee chairman rep edward markey dmass said 
unsolicited telemarketing increasingly crosses the line between 
helpful and unacceptably obtrusive 
he noted that in massachusetts 200000 phone customers 7 
percent of the states total said yes recently when asked if they 
wished to be excluded from such calls 
computers can dial 1000 phone numbers a day with prerecorded 
messages markey said 
each day they are used by more than 180000 solicitors to call 
more than 7 million americans unfortunately these machines are 
often programmed to dial sequentially whole blocks of numbers 
including hospitals fire stations pagers and unlisted numbers 
this not only makes the machine an equal opportunity nuisance 
but an equal opportunity hazard markey said 
franks bill would make it illegal to make interstate 
computerdialed calls to anyone who told their phone company they 
didnt want such messages it would require advertisers to pay the 
costs for phone companies to maintain lists of such customers 
a bill cosponsored by markey frank and reps matthew rinaldo 
christopher shays rconn and pete stark dcalif would require 
the same for unsolicited messages to facsimile machines 
a bill by rep marge roukema rnj would make autodialed 
solicitations illegal unless the calls were placed between 9 am 
and 5 pm weekdays the messages gave the name and telephone 
number of the caller and the computer automatically disconnected 
the call five seconds after the called party hangs up or refuses to 
hear the message 
rinaldo said telephone lines have become life lines for 
businesses and citizens particularly the elderly abuses of phone 
lines not only are inconvenient and costly to consumers they 
even could endanger the lives of our citizens 
tying up emergency phones lines with autodialers that wont 
disconnect clearly has the potential for disaster rinaldo 
said there may be legitimate purposes for which autodialers can 
be used however they should not be permitted to endanger the 
usefulness of the telephone 
richard barton a vice president with the direct marketing 
association told the subcommittee his group was sympathetic to 
the concerns expressed by the bills 
he said his group opposes sequential dialing by telemarketers 
and it favored standards that would require immediate disconnects 
but he said it would be very difficult to define as markeys bill 
requires unsolicited messages and what constitutes a 
preexisting business relationship that would allow 
transmission of unsolicited material to offices 
he said there also were about 1000 directories of facsimile 
machine phone numbers and it would be difficult and costly to 
purge them of names 
he urged the subcommittee to let the marketplace decide if 
unsolicited facsimile ads were going to be anything more than a 
shortlived phenomenon 
professor robert ellis of the indiana university school of law 
said many businesses want to receive ads from sellers they deal 
with regularly he said restrictions could chill normal 
business correspondence

bid for the 20 former mcorp banks taken over by the federal deposit 
insurance corp earlier this year 
first city chairman a robert abboud said his institution has 
financial agreements in place to make the purchase should the fdic 
accept the offer 
we are going to submit a bid abboud said tuesday i 
think as well as anyone we know the mechanics and the fragilities 
of presenting such a bid we will be competitive

restructuring of houstonbased first city last year that included a 
pledge to raise 500 million of private capital to go with 970 
million of fdic assistance 
federal officials seized 20 of mcorps 25 banks in march 
claiming they were insolvent the fdic wants to sell the banks 
abboud said first city also has made a rudimentary 
examination of national bancshares of texas and texas american 
bancshares although he did not rule out bidding on those two 
banks he said first city is concentrating on mcorp 
the 20 former mcorp banks with assets of 1309 billion now 
operate as deposit insurance bridge bank mcorp holds the five 
other banks and is operating them under protection of chapter 11 
bankruptcy 
abboud said he understands that may 31 is the deadline for

to critics the vancouver 
stock exchange has been a hucksters paradise duping investors and 
sucking up capital that could be better used elsewhere 
to defenders the exchange fills a valid and serious economic 
function they say its where entrepreneurs turn to raise the 
startup capital they need a marketplace based in the regions 
mining and resource industries now moving into high technology and 
other innovative businesses 
the exchange has had its fair share of scandal and controversy 
since its founding in 1907 and a new round of criticism from such 
high profile business publications as barrons and forbes has 
placed it back in the spotlight 
we do specialize in venture capital and that by nature is 
risky joyce courtney the exchanges spokeswoman said in an 
interview people have long memories and it seems that people 
remember us by the bad company weve kept 
the exchange claims to be the third most active in volume in 
north america after new york and toronto 
the focus on junior companies as the exchange prefers to 
call its startup offerings and the generally inexpensive price 
tags on their stocks push the volume up a typical trade is 2000 
shares worth a total of 2000 
courtney calls the offerings on the exchange the startup the 
emerging the young 
twothirds of the companies on the vancouver exchange still are 
in precious metal mining the other third and the fastest growing 
area is in such venture capital fields as hightech agriculture 
and franchising 
were still really canadas mining exchange but our world is 
changing too courtney said 
its still buyer beware and people dont like to hear that 
she said the venture market is not for everybody 
i think a lot of the misunderstanding is because we have less 
stringent listing requirements she said people misunderstand 
that and we get labeled the wild west and the casino of the 
north 
indeed donald j hudson the exchanges president said 
firsttime visitors almost invariably express surprise that the 
exchange is not a small operation but employs 320 people in several 
floors spread through a downtown skyscraper 
weve taken the position that the world and canada doesnt 
need another bluechip stock exchange he said our view is 
that weve been in the venture business and we should make that our 
prime thrust 
hudson said that doesnt mean emphasis will be taken away from 
the traditional resourceexploration stocks 
but we are certainly going to do whatever we can to encourage 
listings outside the resource fields he said 
on march 1 the exchange overhauled listings rules and policies 
requiring more complete disclosure about the companies issuing 
stocks 
it added special requirements for companies outside of the 
resourceexploration area partly because some of their stocks have 
raised alarmbells about the potential for hype 
among the hardtoassess stocks that have cropped up on the 
exchange for example are those from companies claiming to offer 
cosmetic franchises treasure hunts and a new way to hull rice 
hudson said it cant be denied that incidents have taken 
place with companies listed on the exchange and they tend to be 
spectacular 
the way to stop all that is stop having incidents he said 
as recently as april former stockbroker dale ciochetti was 
sentenced to three years in prison and fined some 300000 canadian 
dollars or 252000 for for fraud in the rise and fall of 
international tillex enterprises ltd 
the new yorkbased insurance company was underwritten at 20 
canadian cents a share in january 1985 and rose to 77 canadian 
dollars a share in 1986 before the exchange suspended trading 
you cant have it both ways hudson said when asked why 
fraud cases continue to surface if the exchange is making a more 
serious effort to regulate itself than it has in the past 
he objected to those who say proper enforcement doesnt exist 
and then say its all bad when a case is found as a result of 
enforcement 
two years from now we wont have the court cases coming along 
with the frequency theyve been coming along hudson said 
securities commissions operate at provincial level in canada 
and british columbias historically has been weak 
hudson said trading on the vancouver exchange has not recovered 
fully since october 1987 hit harder in value than in volume 
i dont think we have bounced back he said trading has 
been how shall i describe this slow 
he ascribed it to worldwide trends and the slide in the price of 
gold which has weakened the price of many mineral and mining 
stocks 
record volume of 48 billion shares worth 56 billion at 
current exchange rates in 1987 declined to 35 billion shares worth 
27 billion last year the exchanges index of all listed issues 
dropped from 115002 at the end of 1987 to 79272 at the end of 
1988 
elsewhere analysts say a loss of confidence in the exchange 
also has played a part 
john woods publisher of the daily newsletter vancouver 
stockwatch forecast 1989 as a stable year and said the overhaul of 
regulations is a big step in the repair job that the exchange had 
to do to stop its slide into oblivion 
woods said no regulations can erase all bad cases on any 
exchange but the new policies should eliminate what he called the 
joke companies that had proliferated in vancouver over the past 
five years 
you have to conclude that the vse has been weakened he 
said it is not in a good position to recover fast

bankruptcy court hearings on a proposal 
to allow hasbro inc to buy most of ailing coleco industries inc 
for more than 85 million were adjourned for one week a coleco 
lawyer said wednesday 
daniel golden said all pending matters will be taken up in us 
bankruptcy court in new york next wednesday 
he declined to discuss details of a hearing wednesday or the 
proposal citing an agreement on a news blackout reached last month 
a hartford newspaper reported this week that details of the plan 
in avonbased colecos 10monthold bankruptcy case were still 
being negotiated john oneill hasbros chief financial officer 
declined wednesday to discuss the plan but said he expected an 
announcement would be made soon 
we continue to work inside the bankruptcy court he said 
we would imagine that something will happen soon however we do 
not anticipate at this point making an announcement 
coleco officials did not return telephone calls seeking comment 
on tuesday an estimated 200000 of colecos surplus furniture 
office machines and manufacturing equipment was auctioned off 
symbolizing the demise of the company that introduced cabbage patch 
kids dolls 
the sale conducted by a new york auction house in a warehouse 
adjacent to colecos avon offices was held to help the foundering 
toy manufacturer reduce its equipment in storage and raise cash to 
stay alive 
but unnamed sources told the hartford courant the plan to sell 
most of colecos assets to the pawtucket ribased hasbro will 
likely mean the disappearance of coleco and loss of the remaining 
150 jobs 
the courant said the deal would involve selling most of colecos 
assets to hasbro ending colecos 57 years as an independent 
company 
sources told the newspaper colecos committee of unsecured 
creditors would drop a 71 million lawsuit against the companys 
largest creditors new york businessmen isaac perlmutter and 
bernard marden perlmutter and marden in turn would reduce their 
80 million claim against coleco 
the lawsuit contends that perlmutter and marden cheated coleco 
out of millions of dollars through a complex scheme of trading 
television advertising time for products 
coleco grew to be one of the nations largest toy companies in 
the past decade but demand for its cabbage patch kids dolls wanted 
and new products didnt make up lost sales coleco had debts of 
5403 million when it filed for bankruptcy last july 
colecos first reorganization plan filed in january was 
rejected by the creditors committee 
in march coleco said it was considering selling the company 
outright but several weeks later coleco said it would instead 
propose a new reorganization plan offering a larger repayment to 
creditors 
the company had not filed that new plan when creditors announced 
april 19 they had negotiated a deal to sell most of coleco to 
hasbro for more than 85 million in cash

cnw corp urged its shareholders wednesday to 
delay selling stock to japonica partners while the railroad company 
searches for other potential buyers 
a committee of cnw directors set a june 2 deadline for 
submitting bids for the company which operates the chicago and 
northwestern transportation co a 6000mile railroad serving nine 
states

44ashare for outstanding cnw stock and already owns 88 percent 
of the company 
the cnw committee said it will not take a position on japonicas 
hostile takeover attempt while it talks with other potential 
bidders 
we decided not to take a position on japonicas tender offer 
at this time because we are continuing to investigate whether there 
are alternatives that would maximize stockholder value said 
cj gauthier chairman of the directors committee 
the committee is also seeking more information on japonicas 
ability to finance its tender offer he said 
the committees financial advisers are having discussions with 
other potential bidders as well as with japonica 
we expect to know more about where matters stand after the 
deadline for bids has expired gauthier said we urge 
stockholders to defer acting on the japonica tender offer until the 
committee has made a further announcement 
shareholders reelected cnw directors on tuesday by a nearly 
2to1 margin but managements recommendation for an executive 
incentive plan was rejected 
japonica had urged shareholders at last weeks annual meeting to 
reject both the incentive plan and managements slate of directors

eastern airlines boss frank lorenzo said 
wednesday the imminent sale of easterns prized northeast shuttle 
was critical to his plan to restructure the strikebound carrier and 
would give the plan further momentum 
without the shuttle sale you can forget about our 
alternatives lorenzo said in an interview with the associated 
press shortly before a federal bankruptcy judge approved a deal to 
sell the shuttle to developer donald trump 
the shuttle is the most easily salable separable asset of 
eastern airlines said lorenzo chairman of easterns parent 
texas air corp 
us bankruptcy judge burton r lifland approved in principle 
trumps 365 million offer for the shuttle 
earlier america west airlines withdrew a higher offer for the 
new yorkwashingtonboston shuttle after deciding it couldnt meet 
a 5 pm deadline set by eastern to arrange financing for the 
purchase 
miamibased eastern filed for chapter 11 protection from its 
creditors on march 9 five days after its machinists union struck 
pilots and flight attendants have honored the walkout forcing 
eastern to cut back its flight schedule by around 90 percent 
the federal bankruptcy court must approve any sale of eastern 
assets 
the shuttle was easterns only consistently profitable operation 
before the strike 
easterns unions wanted the airline sold as a single entity but 
texas air sought to sell the shuttle and another 14 billion or so 
of the airlines assets separately and rebuild as a smaller carrier 
lorenzo said the sale of the shuttle would give momentum to his 
plan to reshape eastern he said he believes lifland who has 
repeatedly urged that eastern resume flying at full strength is 
leaning toward approving the restructuring plan 
he lifland is now gradually realizing that nobody out 
there is going to invest the hundreds of millions of dollars that 
are now necessary to bring this airline up in its original form 
lorenzo said 
under easterns plan lorenzo said eastern would be rebuilt as 
a smaller carrier that is concentrated on more protected 
markets such as atlanta and destinations in the northeast 
several potential suitors have approached texas air about buying 
all of eastern but the company has not received any proposals it 
considered viable 
lorenzo indicated trump had an edge over america west in the 
shuttle fight partly because the trump deal was certainty 
while details of the america west bid such as financing remained up 
in the air up through the deadline 
lorenzo also called trump the logical owner for the shuttle 
because he was willing to pay for the franchise value 
the shuttle is a diamond he saidanybody whos willing to 
look at the plaza hotel and pay the price for that as a diamond is 
going to look at our plaza hotel which is the shuttle 
trump bought the landmark manhattan hotel for 395 million about 
a year ago 
if somebody were to buy the shuttle just based on earnings 
you would have a hard time with 365 million he said

southmark corp saddled with 11 billion in debt 
and struggling to avoid bankruptcy reached agreement with a 
dissident investor wednesday that ended a proxy fight 
southmark agreed to add herbert parks a greensboro nc 
developer and real estate investor and two associates to an 
expanded board of directors 
parks had first sought to gain control of the company from 
chairman arthur g weiss he had complained that weiss was 
incapable of managing the troubled financial services company as it 
tried to recover from losses suffered mainly because of texas real 
estate depression and thrift troubles 
although parks had first sought to replace southmarks entire 
sevenmember board with his own nominees he was forced to cut back 
to three nominees because of federal regulations governing thrifts 
owned by southmark 
our concern from the start has been to ensure that southmark 
is managed for the best interest of all its shareholders said 
parks who owns about 45 percent of the dallasbased companys 
outstanding common stock 
this agreement satisfies us that that will be the case 
parks said in a joint statement with weiss 
the three nominees will be seated immediately on southmarks 
board which will be expanded from seven to 10 members the 
management team will remain unchanged 
parks also agreed not to seek control of the company or to 
participate in a proxy battle for at least two years in return 
southmark agreed to reimburse the parks group an unspecified amount 
for certain expenses 
southmark last month reported a 104 billion quarterly loss 
due mainly to an 829 million writedown of its real estate assets 
the company said the loss left the company with a negative 428 
million in stockholders equity and placed it in default on 11 
billion worth of mainly highyield bonds issued to build up its 
portfolio 
bondholders could begin proceedings to force the liquidation of 
the company but so far have declined to do so weiss said the 
company will begin meeting with bondholders june 7 to discuss the 
companys restructuring 
southmark pays about 30 million in interest on the bonds each 
quarter and so far has made all its payments spokeswoman susan 
seiter said the next payment is due july 15 and ms seiter said 
southmarks board has not decided whether it will be able to make 
that payment 
on tuesday southmark announced an agreement in principle to 
sell its 89 percent interest in integon corp its largest 
insurance subsidiary for 1355 million 
in the past few months the company also has sold off other 
holdings for a total of 167 million all but 7 million in cash
