professor josiah thompson is an expert on 
such noted philosophers as kierkegaard nietzsche and sam spade 
spade what in the name of humphrey bogart is going on here a 
career change thats what 
in 1976 thompson driven by a thirst for experience left 
his tenured position as professor of philosophy at haverford 
college a prestigous quaker school in pennsylvania came to san 
francisco and became a private detective 
he couldnt have picked a better city in which to set up shop 
san franciscos hills are steeped in the lore of dashiell 
hammett and his legendary sleuth sam spade the blond satan 
whose hair darkened when brought to the screen by humphrey bogart 
in the maltese falcon 
theres even a bronze plaque on a san francisco street 
recalling a murder that took place only in hammetts mind on 
approximately this spot miles archer partner of sam spade was 
done in by brigid oshaughnessy 
thompson whose previous writings were mostly limited to the 
academic world has recounted his metamorphosis in a book 
appropriately called gumshoe reflections in a private eye 
little brown 1795 
he was born 53 years ago in east liverpool ohio where his 
father sold dishes during world war i his father took a pair of 
field glasses from a dead german and gave them to the youngster 
thompson whose nickname is tink still uses the glasses on 
cases he keeps them hanging over his desk and has used them on 
stakeouts 
even though slightly built he played halfback in high school 
closing his eyes on every play later he was under fire in 
lebanon as an ensign with a navy underwater demolition team the 
elite frogmen 
why did he become a professor in the first place going from 
football bruises and the sound of warfare to the safety of a 
college campus 
i had plenty of money when i got out of the navy with 
demolition and combat pay he said i was a good student in 
high school so i went to oxford and from there took the line of 
least resistance 
when that line became a culdesac he took a sabbatical and 
grabbed a job with an established detective agency in san francisco 
during his apprenticeship and as his own boss thompson has 
worked on such headline cases as the defense of black panther huey 
newton on assault and murder charges and the defense of william 
and emily harris in the patty hearst case 
there were also other less publicized capers ranging from 
recovering 30000 from under the floorboards of an attic in a drug 
case to retrieving a kidnapped child from india 
thompsons wife nancy sells real estate they have two adult 
daughters and a son who plays soccer in college he never carries a 
gun and he thinks the most dangerous part of his job is mistaken 
identity 
i was taken for a spy on a case in morocco he said and 
one time in canada while working on a drug case word got around 
that a hit man was being brought in when people heard i was from 
california some of them thought i was the guy the bars would 
clear when i came in 
while honing his skills as a gumshoe thompson has become 
fascinated by hammett and spade so much so that on one case he 
took the time to interview some of hammetts relatives 
hammett through spade was a bit of a philosopher he says 
in order to love one must put off hardness and shiftiness 
thompson said the ability to lie effectively to appear 
different than one really is all the disguises essential in the 
world of power become in the world of love temptations artful 
excuses to avoid the nakedness love requires to avoid love 
hammett knew this he said 
thats why in the last line of the maltese falcon he makes 
spade shiver as he looks down the cold barrel of his future

a fire that has charred a 
35mile swath across the heart of yellowstone national park 
threatened one of the parks most picturesque areas and forced out 
hundreds of visitors officials said wednesday 
the rapidly burning north fork fire which started july 23 in 
idahos targhee national forest grew to nearly 100000 acres and 
forced the closure wednesday morning of the canyon area 
winds expected to reach 50 mph wednesday in the park failed to 
materialize and by nightfall the fire remained one mile to the 
west of the area which is located a bit north of the center of the 
60milesquare park 
elsewhere crews southeast of helena mont said they expected 
to contain the 37600acre warm springs creek blaze by friday 
evening and in idaho air tankers and fire crews fought a surging 
1000acre blaze on the slopes of hells canyon the nations 
deepest gorge 
the closure of canyon yellowstones largest development with 
600 cabins and 280 campsites sent more than 700 visitors and 
employees to other parts of the park 
my children are all excited about it said tourist allen 
jones of staffordshire england it didnt detract from our 
visit at all 
by midmorning wednesday only firefighters and reporters 
remained at canyon and the buzzing of chain saws filled the air as 
crews hurriedly removed downed trees and undergrowth smoke in the 
air partially obscured the view of the 308foot lower falls and 
109foot upper falls 
fire officials said they hoped to keep the north fork fire 
burning to the north of the canyon area but feared that embers 
could bring the blaze right into canyon 
michelle rotter a park service public information officer said 
the north fork fire could then conceivably burn from canyon and 
into the area blackened by the clover mist fire some miles to the 
east in effect cutting the park virtually in two 
although not the biggest of the 10 fires that have burned more 
than 354000 acres in yellowstone the north fork blaze has become 
the most dangerous to structures firefighters previously had come 
near to containing the fire but the lack of rainfall combined with 
winds gusting to 60 mph repeatedly have fanned it out of control 
the 156500acre clover mist fire earlier this week swung into 
the shoshone national forest east of yellowstone in the national 
forest 635 army regulars were working with professional 
firefighters to halt the advance 
the socalled snake complex of fires which includes the red 
shoshone and falls fires in southern yellowstone spread over 
80000 acres by wednesday while forcing the closure of the grant 
village area and the parks south entrance the fires were not 
threatening any structures 
fires also posed threats both north and south of the park 
to the south in grand teton national park and the bridgerteton 
national forest firefighters dwarfed by 150foot walls of flame 
battled to keep the 12600acre huck fire from crossing into 
yellowstone about 1 miles away the fire had more than doubled in 
size from tuesday to wednesday 
just over the montana line north of the park nearly 600 
additional firefighters and a toplevel firemanagement team from 
alaska arrived wednesday to take over the 27000acre storm creek 
fire the blaze is burning out of control in a wilderness area 
seven miles north of cooke city a town near the northeast corner 
of the park 
near helena crews had expected to contain the 37600acre warm 
springs creek blaze wednesday night but pushed the deadline back 
two days because of one troublesome area along the fire lines fire 
information officer bob krepps said the 2weekold fire has burned 
more than a dozen structures 
once thats done and held theres nothing much left to cause 
us any problem krepps said wednesday were getting close the 
noose is tightening 
in idaho more than 400 firefighters were committed to the eagle 
bar blaze in hells canyon which was burning out of control with no 
containment target in sight the blaze made two significant runs 
wednesday moving into the deep creek drainage containing 12 
million board feet of timber and toward the base camp at kinney 
point 
in southern oregon a fire in crater lake national park that 
charred 85 acres tuesday grew to more than 1000 acres wednesday 
burning across the park boundary into neighboring winema national 
forest 
in central oregon firefighters nearly contained a blaze that 
charred 110 acres and forced the brief evacuation of three homes 
but several lightningcaused blazes elsewhere in the state were 
reported out of control 
in southwestern washington calmer winds and cooler temperatures 
allowed firefighters to cut a containment line around 75 percent of 
a 500acre fire 30 miles southwest of mount rainier national park 
officials said the fire grew from 60 acres to 500 on tuesday 
thanks to gusty wind 100degree air and low humidity

sen dan quayles version of duties he handled 
as a consumer watchdog when he worked for the indiana attorney 
general in 197071 appear to be exaggerated an ohio newspaper 
reports in its friday editions 
the cleveland plain dealer reported that state records in the 
indiana archives reveal that quayle 41 was a research assistant 
an entrylevel job in the attorney generals office for most of 
that time and held the consumer watchdog job for only 2 months 
from july to midseptember in 1971 
quayles senate biography which is being distributed as 
official background of the republican vicepresidential nominee 
says he was chief investigator for the consumer protection 
division of the indiana attorney generals office from 19701971 
the plain dealer reported that the division was just being 
organized at the time 
he just helped set it up said robert e lybrook a lawyer 
in martinsville ind who became the chief investigator in 
september 1971 when the division officially opened for business 
state personnel records show quayle was already working for 
thengov edgar whitcomb as an administrative assistant when the 
consumer division was officially launched 
the consumer division had been created earlier in 1971 by the 
indiana legislature the division was empowered to help resolve 
consumer complaints over such things as defective products false 
advertising odometer tampering and mailorder fraud 
i dont remember when quayle first started out said robert 
a smith an indianapolis lawyer who was the consumer divisions 
first director smith said quayle was assigned to his staff for a 
brief time before leaving to work in the governors office 
said m stanton evans an editor at the indianapolis news who 
arranged quayles job interview with thenattorney general theodore 
l sendak he sure didnt start in that consumer job he wasnt 
chief of anything when he went over there 
evans worked for eugene c pulliam publisher of indianas 
largest newspapers and quayles grandfather 
state records show that quayle who graduated from depauw 
university in may 1969 with a political science degree went to 
work in the attorney generals office as a legal assistant in 
january 1970 
the job is similar to that of a law clerk it involved drafting 
legal memoranda performing research for opinions and writing 
letters according to other employees who worked in the attorney 
generals office at the time quayle was attending night school at 
indiana university school of law at the same time 
the offices annual report filed in the indiana state archives 
shows sendak didnt have a consumer division in 1970 quayles 
picture was in the report with those of seven other research 
assistants 
sendaks 1971 annual report which he was required to file under 
state law has the pictures of the three staffers in the new 
consumer division the three included smith as the director 
roland d mather as assistant director and robert e lybrook as 
chief investigator quayle was not even listed as being on the 
attorney generals staff

a former us army sergeant 
arrested in west germany headed an international spy ring that sold 
nato defense secrets to the soviets at high prices for a decade 
officials said thursday 
we cant exclude the possibility that millions of dollars are 
involved said alexander prechtel spokesman for the chief 
federal prosecutors office 
a second american soldier who was not identified received a 
fivefigure sum of money for supplying the ring with military 
secrets said chief federal prosecutor kurt rebmann and prechtel 
said two hungarianborn brothers arrested tuesday in sweden with 
cipher keys coded messages and radios were a part of the ring 
it was too early to know how much damage was caused to the north 
atlantic treaty organization prechtel said in an interview but 
the ring is believed to have stolen documents concerning nato 
defense plans for europe and us army contingency plans for a 
ground war with the soviet union in europe 
clyde lee conrad the former sergeant was arrested tuesday and 
a statement from the prosecutors office said he was charged with 
compelling suspicion of espionage activities in an especially 
grave case 
the new york times in its friday editions quoted officials as 
saying conrad gave away information on rocket bases and a secret 
nato oil pipeline in west germany to resupply tanks the report 
from washington did not identify the officials 
conrad was born in 1947 in ohio and worked for the us military 
for 20 years prechtel said army records list his hometown as 
sebring ohio 
he worked as an infantryman and then as an administration 
specialist during his active duty according to his service 
records released in washington conrad received the national 
defense service medal the vietnam service medal five army 
commendation medals the army achievement medal three meritorious 
service medals and seven good conduct medals 
prechtel said conrad worked with classified military defense 
plans for seven years at a us army base in bad kreuznach in 
central west germany and had access to a wide array of secret 
documents conrad allegedly continued espionage work after he left 
the service in 1985 prechtel said 
rebmann said conrad turned over the most recent batch of 
information to his soviet bloc contact in vienna just last month 
cable news network on thursday quoted unidentified west german 
sources as saying conrad systematically photographed files between 
1980 and 1985 the cnn report said investigators believe he may 
have transferred material onto a personal computer which was 
seized at his home 
espionage cases are common in west germany where soviet bloc 
agents are active and sometimes are caught but allegations of deep 
involvement by an american citizen in a west germanbased ring are 
extremely rare 
an official at the us justice department speaking on 
condition of anonymity called the case a serious encroachment on 
our national security 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said president reagan had 
been kept informed about the investigation on a continuing 
basis but he added we wont have any response or reaction at 
this point were looking into it 
a special panel of west germanys supreme court ordered conrad 
held in prison pending further investigation rebmann said 
prechtel said the west germanbased spy ring started in the late 
1970s and used couriers from sweden 
in goteborg sweden authorities said they detained two 
hungarianborn brothers who confessed to working for the hungarian 
secret service 
the two men physicians who immigrated to sweden in the 1960s 
were detained with radios cipher keys and coded messages 
authorities said their names were not released 
the new york times reported thursday that eight people were 
arrested by swedish and west german in the ring operating through a 
germanhungarian connection 
the report said investigators believe the spy ring provided 
us west german and nato secrets to the hungarian intelligence 
agency the hungarians then shared the secrets with the soviet 
union officials told the times 
prechtel speaking from his office in the city of karlsruhe 
confirmed virtually all of the times report but he said 
several people were taken into custody or arrested and could 
not confirm that the number was eight 
the times said the network was uncovered by west german and us 
officials including agents from the fbi and the army the army has 
about 250000 military personnel in west germany at more than 200 
installations and frequently warns its personnel to beware of 
soviet bloc spies 
rebmann said conrad is under compelling suspicion of having 
delivered documents to a soviet bloc secret service by means of 
a command officer and couriers living abroad in return for high 
payments 
he did not identify the command officer but said the two last 
met in vienna last month when conrad allegedly again handed over 
secret documents for payment 
after his retirement conrad tried to recruit other soldiers for 
espionage rebmann said 
he recruited another member of the us army for espionage 
work and paid him a fivefigure sum for the delivery of military 
documents rebmanns statement said the type of currency was not 
disclosed 
the prosecutors spokesman declined to release any further 
information about the second soldier

democrat michael dukakis said thursday that cocaine imports have 
tripled in seven years and charged the reagan administration with 
permitting a drug cancer to take root george bush said he 
represents proven tested leadership and likened his 
presidential rival to jimmy carter 
dukakis and bush sparred long distance as their vice 
presidential running mates encountered turbulence on their own 
campaign rounds 
democrat lloyd bentsen was booed repeatedly when he praised 
dukakis before the veterans of foreign wars meeting in chicago 
the simple truth is gov dukakis is a veteran a patriot and an 
advocate of american strength and steadiness the texas senator 
said 
republican vice presidential candidate dan quayle was greeted in 
columbia mo by competing groups of supporters and demonstrators 
and a few signs that read war wimp and quayles a chicken 
that was a reference to the furor over his national guard service 
at the height of the vietnam war 
the indiana senator told reporters the public was getting a 
little sick of the controversy and at a meeting later with 
farmers he added i wont take any questions about the subject 
quayle said he was qualified to assume the presidency if that 
situation arises he added that at 41 he is nearly as old as 
john kennedy was when he won the white house 
quayle faced new questions on his resume however the 
cleveland plain dealer reported in its friday editions that 
quayle held an entrylevel job in the indiana attorney generals 
office for most of the time he claimed to be chief investigator 
for the offices consumer protection division 
the candidates spoke as the debate over campaign debates 
continued in washington nancy m neuman president of the league 
of women voters said she was encouraged that aides to bush and 
dukakis would meet next week to begin negotiations on debates for 
the fall 
democratic chairman paul kirk criticized bush for indicating on 
wednesday that he wanted to wait until at least sept 20 before 
meeting dukakis in debate hes not going to be able to refuse 
to debate kirk said 
dukakis leveled a sharp attack on the drug policies pursued by 
president reagan and said bush had failed in his task as a leader 
in the administration war on drugs he said the administration was 
actively in business with panama general manuel noriega while 
noriega was involved in drug activity 
my friends thats criminal thats criminal he said 
why after seven years of task forces and policy boards and 
grandiose claims have cocaine imports tripled drugrelated deaths 
doubled and heroin imports risen by 50 percent dukakis added in 
a speech in cleveland he said the drug cancer was undermining 
governments overseas and was the single greatest cause of 
violence in america today 
an upbeat bush said the campaign momentum belonged to him as he 
opened a fourday campaign swing through his adopted home state of 
texas he said the country needs proven tested leadership in 
the white house 
the vice president compared massachusetts gov dukakis to former 
president carter adding he did not want to return to the 
malaise that occurred the last time a governor came out of 
nowhere and became president of the united states carter won the 
white house in 1976 campaigning as a former governor of georgia 
standing in the latesummer heat in san antonio bush told a 
riverfront rally that he would revive the faltering oil industry 
create a better climate for small business fight against federal 
gun control and provide jobs for the states large minority 
population 
i want to help these minorities who havent really had a shot 
at the starting line he said 
bush made no mention of quayle in his remarks but said yes 
i do when asked if he thought the controversy was behind him 
bush meanwhile appeared to be softening his stance on the 
strategic defense initiative the new york times quoted bush in its 
friday editions as saying a decision on whether to deploy a full or 
partial star wars defense system must await more research into its 
capabilities and costs 
i dont think we yet know what the price tag will be bush 
said if you went to a full deployment of a full strategic 
defense it would be very expensive what i want to do is to 
continue reserach at the levels of funding essentially that we 
have requested 
bentsen was wearing his vfw cap as he defended dukakis before a 
hostile audience the simple truth is this gov dukakis is a 
veteran a patriot and an advocate of american strength and 
steadiess he said he can be trusted as a defender of american 
security and as a champion of american values 
but the texas senator and world war bomber pilot was interrupted 
four times by booing including once when he said that carter had 
begun the muchheralded defense buildup 
the booing appeared to be led by vfw members from massachusetts 
and at one point the organizationss national commander earl l 
stock jr appealed for quiet i had a tough assignment and i 
fulfilled it bentsen said obviously some of them didnt want 
to hear it 
quayle campaigned through the midwest telling his audiences it 
was time to talk about the future and not his controversial 
past 
referring to questions about his vietnamera stint in the 
national guard quayle said the public is getting a little bit 
sick of that issue 
ive answered questions for seven days now he told 
reporters as he arrived in columbia mo 
were going to talk about the future were going to talk 
about jobs were going to talk about other issues that the 
american people are interested in 
quayle said he was qualified to be elected to a job placing him 
first in line for the presidency i am qualified if that 
situiation arises the indiana senator said im very close to 
the same age as jack kennedy was when he was elected kennedy was 
43 in 1960 when he won the white house and had been in congress for 
eight years compared to 12 for quayle

dade countys approval of a whopping 28 percent 
teacher salary increase and a larger role for teachers in school 
decisionmaking has brought a flood of applications from around the 
country officials say 
news of the new contract approved by the dade school board last 
month has spread like wildfire said terence garner director 
of teacher recruitment in dade county 
my desk is literally covered with messages from people calling 
and wanting applications or copies of the contract sent said 
garner 
we have enough candidates so principals can look at five to 
eight people for every one position garner said we promised 
the school board were going to hire the cream of the crop and now 
were getting it 
lastminute hiring is under way and is expected to continue even 
after classes begin monday in the dade countys system which 
includes the city of miami with about 255000 students and more 
than 15200 teachers its the nations fourthlargest 
theres also an avalanche of applications in rochester ny 
where the city school district attracted national attention last 
fall with a contract that boosted salaries and gave teachers more 
responsibility 
when we go to college recruiting fairs we have lines of 
people waiting to talk to us said ed delaney director of 
teacher personnel for the district 
the threeyear contract in rochester raised salaries an average 
40 percent over three years and offered some teachers who accept 
difficult assignments and work longer hours the chance to make 
70000 a year by the third year of the contract 
in dade county average teacher pay will rise to 33066 the 
first year of the contract 9 percent above last years pay of 
30000 veteran teachers with doctorates could earn up to 64000 
a year by the third year of the contract the average pay would 
rise to 39646 28 percent above last years pay 
the contract also calls for expanding teachers say in school 
decisionmaking teachers principals and union stewards will sit 
together on faculty councils and make shared decisions and teacher 
committees will help design schools and hire principals teachers 
are expected to approve it overwhelmingly when they vote thursday 
and friday 
dades 33066 average salary will be the highest in the state 
nearly 8000 above floridas statewide average in 198788 and more 
than 5000 above the 198788 national average of 28031 as 
calculated by the national education association 
i think many other districts will have to follow what weve 
done in order to be competitive garner said teacher salaries 
all over will have to continue to rise 
but state school officials say it could be some time before 
districts elsewhere in florida follow dades lead 
i think dade county has unique characteristics the cost of 
living is more in dade county the unionadministration 
relationship is extremely strong and cooperative the emphasis on 
local solutions is greater there than anywhere else said david 
voss spokesman for education commissioner betty castor 
we probably have the best labormanagement relationship in the 
united states said annette katz spokeswoman for the dade 
teachers union that happened over a number of years and it 
happened because of trust 
katz said dades contract could encourage frustrated teachers 
elsewhere in florida to flock to the miami area although other 
spokesmen say dades real competition is other large urban 
districts nationwide not other florida districts 
were not trying to raid people but yes people are 
interested katz said we have to recruit the best teachers we 
can find 
laurie murray executive vice president of the teachers union in 
duval county which includes the city of jacksonville agreed that 
things are better in dade 
weve made some of the same proposals that dade has but 
theres been no interest at the administrative level in shared 
decisionmaking she said teachers have only a minimal input 
in every area managements latest offer in duval is for a 4 
percent pay hike she said

both suggestions might have appealed to the british troops who 
were bedeviled by the 16yearold heroine of the revolutionary war 
but local officials who made the suggestions insist they mean sybil 
no harm they just want to help her overcome an embarrassing 
problem 
it seems that sybil a statue of her that is has begun to 
foam at the mouth 
last month putnam county officials were nearly ready to remove 
the head of the statue to clean out the mold causing the foam but 
tuesday night a committee of the county legislature heard an 
alternate remedy 
by slicing a small hole in the statues head legislator lynn 
greenwood said workers might be able to remove the growth 
ms greenwood said she opposed decapitation preferring a 
scalp job which will be done at a more reasonable cost and be 
less dramatic to the people who see her every day

officials have dumped more than 30000 
gallons of milk at a dairy farm following the recent deaths of more 
than 20 cows possibly from something they ate authorities said 
the milk apparently was not contaminated but was dumped as a 
public health precaution until the cause of the cow deaths is 
determined according to officials from the farm and the state 
agriculture department 
i do not believe there is any contaminant or toxicant causing 
the cattle deaths jay boosinger director of the division of 
dairy industry for the florida department of agriculture and 
consumer services said wednesday 
but its better to err on the side of public health and safety 
and recommend that they not market the milk 
boosinger said milk water and feed samples as well as tissue 
samples from one of the cows that died during the past two weeks 
were collected from the 967acre imagination farms which milks 
1100 cows test results were not expected until later this week

the number of people throughout the 
world who belong to the communist party declined slightly from 1986 
to 1987 according to the hoover institution 
total membership decreased from 898 million in 1986 to 886 
million the following year the conservative think tank at stanford 
university reported in its 1988 yearbook on communist affairs 
that compares with a 76 percent increase in party membership 
from 1985 to 1986 the yearbook reported the publication also has 
recorded a leap of more than 70 percent in international communist 
membership since the early 1970s when the total was about 50 
million 
the small drop from 1986 to 1987 indicates that communists 
around the world are fed up with the soviet union said yearbook 
editor richard staar 
it can be attributed to several factors most important 
is the openly admitted failure of the politicoeconomic system in 
the ussr he said 
the system has failed it no longer serves as a model even 
for eastern europe staar added 
another factor is the increased exposure of young people living 
in communist countries to the success of capitalist governments 
around the world staar said 
but while there may be fewer communists throughout the world 
there are more in california the party said 
we have found a tremendous renewed interest in marxism and the 
communist party in the last year said kendra alexander 
chairwoman of the california communist party 
our own membership while admittedly not very large has 
climbed by about 250 members to about 1000 people she said

congressional investigators are faulting the 
justice department for not routinely evaluating its ethics program 
or providing enough training on ethics 
the general accounting office in a report released wednesday 
also said the justice department is the only federal agency that 
does not require many of its employees to file confidential 
financial disclosure forms 
other agencies have found such reports to be a necessary part 
of their ethics program the gao said 
highranking justice employees like those at other agencies 
must submit public financial disclosure forms under the 1978 ethics 
in government act 
but every agency except justice requires civil servants with 
significant duties and responsibilities to file the confidential 
forms listing assets investments and a spouses job 
this deviation from the practice elsewhere in the government 
is based on justices view that there has been no legal authority 
to require confidential reports since january 1979 when the ethics 
in government act of 1978 took effect said the gao congress 
auditing arm 
justice officials have said they will ask for the confidential 
forms when the office of government ethics which monitors the act 
submits final regulations possibly this fall 
an official at the ethics office said justice was the only 
agency that has balked at the confidential forms 
we have recognized for years that they justice department 
officials desperately need a confidential system said the 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity they are the main 
law enforcement branch they should have it 
the gao said the overall justice ethics program contains many 
of the basic elements required by law and regulations however 
certain required elements are missing 
ethics programs are handled by the various divisions of the 
justice department allegations of ethical misconduct are reported 
to the office of professional responsibility which reports to the 
attorney general 
as a result of the decentralization procedures on how to 
implement ethics programs differ at the department for example 
some components procedures for reviewing public financial 
disclosure reports were more comprehensive than others the 
report said 
moreover justice has not periodically evaluated the ethics 
program and not all of the justice components have provided formal 
ethics training 
without proper evaluation department officials are unable to 
determine if various divisions are properly reviewing and 
certifying public financial disclosure reports the gao said 
the report suggests periodic evaluations of the departments 
ethics programs and a new program to train justice employees in 
ethics and standards of conduct matters including postemployment 
the report was released as attorney general richard l 
thornburgh assumes command of the department with a promise to 
review the departments operations thoroughly 
thornburgh succeeded edwin meese iii whose ethical conduct is 
still under review by the departments office of professional 
responsibility 
the report was requested last december by reps william d ford 
dmich and gerry sikorski dminn ford is chairman of the house 
post office and civil service committee sikorski chairs a 
subcommittee on human resources 
sikorski said at the time that his panel observed that justice 
has failed to maintain an effective system of preventing ethics 
violations by doj department of justice employees 
he cited questions about meeses stock holdings in seven 
regional telephone companies and a june 1987 letter by meeses 
wife ursula to a federal judge in tennessee requesting leniency for 
a family friend who was awaiting sentencing 
meeses activities were investigated by independent counsel 
james c mckay who concluded that meese probably broke tax and 
conflictofinterest regulations but said there was not enough 
information to prosecute 
meese said mckays report vindicated him

the long arm of the environmental protection 
agency is reaching out to the local town dump and the huge 
metropolitan landfill as well 
epa in its first major effort to regulate the land disposal of 
household trash and garbage is proposing rules that officials say 
would force nearly every municipal dump to take steps to protect 
the environment 
announced wednesday the plan would require all of the nations 
municipal solid waste landfills to install oftenexpensive 
monitoring equipment to detect pollution of groundwater supplies 
the proposal not expected to be popular with local governments 
would require the cleaning up of dumps found to be leaking 
contaminants into underground aquifers 
the draft regulations would force operators to put waterproof 
covers over dumps when they are closed and would set restrictions 
on where a new dump can be located 
many dumps that open after the rules take effect probably not 
before 1991 would have to install bottom liners to prevent leakage 
and have systems to collect the polluting liquids found in dumps 
its a very strong protective rule said j winston porter 
assistant epa administrator for solid waste and emergency response 
in some cases people are going to have to spend a lot of 
compliance money 
the plan would leave many compliance details up to states so 
long as a dump did not impose any greater danger to humans than a 
1in10000 chance of contracting cancer from water contaminated by 
a dumps leachate 
porter told a news conference that states would have flexibility 
to operate their own compliance programs with an underlying 
proviso we dont care what you do but you cannot leak 
the proposal would apply to an estimated 6000 solid waste 
landfills 78 percent of them owned by local governments that 
handle about 80 percent of the 160 million tons of household refuse 
produced each year he said 
at least one of every four municipal dumps is believed to be 
violating one or more state groundwaterprotection standards he 
said 
porter said the dangers posed by municipal dumps can be seen in 
the superfund priority cleanup list where nearly one of every 
five facilities awaiting decontamination was once a municipal solid 
waste landfill 
around the nation less than a third of the operating dumps have 
groundwater monitoring systems only 15 percent have bottom liners 
and only 5 percent have leachate collection systems according to 
epa 
almost all landfills will have to do something porter said 
there are very few landfills that meet all these requirements 
he said he could not estimate precisely how much cost would be 
added to the nations annual 4 billion to 5 billion bill for 
dumping burning and recycling its trash and garbage 
one epa control scenario estimated the extra cost could reach 
800 million a year or about 11 per household 
it will add something to the homeowners bill porter said 
we dont think it will be dramatic 
he said he expects positive reaction from states because they 
will have flexibility to structure their dumpcontrol programs to 
meet particular hydrogeologic and topographical conditions 
i think well get two other reactions local governments will 
say this is too expensive and environmental groups will say it 
isnt strong enough porter said 
he said the higher dump operating costs under the proposed rules 
could nudge local governments to make greater efforts to recycle 
trash a move that could aid epas national goal of recycling 25 
percent of all household refuse 
epa expects to take a year to obtain public comment on the 
proposal before making it final porter said dumps would then have 
18 more months before they had to comply with the requirements 
he said some dumps might close to evade the proposed rules a 
move he acknowledged would leave them without leakproof covers 
unless they are in one of the handful of states that now require 
them

world output of poultry meat is up 3 percent 
this year and is expected to gain further in 1989 according to the 
agriculture department 
a survey of 51 major producing countries by the departments 
foreign agricultural service released wednesday showed 1988 poultry 
meat production at 3012 million metric tons up from 2921 million 
last year the forecast for 1989 is for 3109 million tons 
the european economic community and the united states account 
for most of this years increase while brazil will be a major 
contributor in 1989 the report said 
six countries in addition to the 12nation eec account for 231 
million tons of this years poultry meat total and 238 million 
tons of the 1989 forecast 
looking at the 1989 forecast the report showed us production 
at 979 million tons brazil 2 million canada 700000 eec 601 
million hungary 500000 soviet union 33 million and japan 
15 million 
other countries not listed are expected to account for 729 
million tons of the 1989 forecast of 3109 million tons 
world egg production is expected to be up 1 percent this year 
with the largest increase in the soviet union production is 
expected to grow more slowly in 1989 the report said 
in a related report the department said us egg production in 
july dropped 2 percent from a year earlier to 568 billion eggs 
the total number of laying hens declined to 268 million birds down 
3 percent from july 1987 
however july production per hen was up averaging 2118 eggs 
per 100 birds compared with 2097 a year earlier

version of the longstemmed lisianthus next spring 
roger h lawson of the departments agricultural research 
service said wednesday the deeppurple lisianthus may be the first 
commercial flower developed through biotechnology research 
the dwarf lisianthus will be sold as a potted plant rather than 
seed and will be available in april 1989 he said it will be made 
available by the society of american florists and usda 
lawson who heads up a new floral crops program funded jointly 
by usda and the floral society said the new plant bears several 
tulipsized blooms at once is a 6 to 10inch mutation of a

federal regulators hope to put on the back 
burner claims that some ford motor co seat belts can cause 
crippling injuries an attorney representing a paraplegic childs 
family alleges 
the national highway traffic safety administration opened an 
investigation wednesday into 17 million ford escort and mercury 
lynx cars to determine if the rear seat belts are safe the agency 
turned down a request by the childs family that the cars be 
recalled immediately 
everything i know tells me that study on top of study means 
finesse said harold sakayan a washington attorney for the 
family of james garrett who was crippled at age 11 in the 1985 
crash of a ford escort it puts it on the back burner for 
awhile 
he accused the agency of seeking to placate congressional 
critics while deferring action on the issue until after the next 
president is inaugurated 
garrett in january filed a petition for recall of the 19841988 
cars on behalf of the childs parents larry and patricia garrett 
of la plata md 
the couple alleged a strap retainer caused the seat belt to ride 
around their childs waist rather than the hips when the car in 
which they were riding smashed headon into a tractortrailer the 
seat belt cut through the soft tissue to their sons spine they 
said 
the garretts in january won a 33 million judgment against ford 
for their childs injuries 
nhtsa said in a letter to the garretts attorneys that a limited 
technical review had left the agency unable to conclude that the 
strap retainer has had an adverse effect on the performance of the 
system 
the agency said the lynx and escort seat belts met federal 
safety standards but added testing did indicate that the 
rear safety belts with and without the strap retainer fit 
differently on test subjects compared to rear safety belts in some 
other cars 
the agency ordered a midlevel investigation an engineering 
analysis to probe the safety effects of the belts fit 
ford said it believes the belts are safe they meet or exceed 
all federal motor vehicle safety standard performance requirements 
including those for location fit strength and ease of use ford 
said 
we are confident that the agency too will conclude that no 
safetyrelated defect is involved ford said 
in the 1985 accident near annapolis md a second backseat 
passenger 14yearold christopher gaboury was killed the two 
frontseat occupants were hospitalized after the accident but 
escaped crippling injury even though the passenger compartment 
crumpled in the collision 
the accident and subsequent lawsuit prompted public questioning 
of the safety of rearseat safety belts particularly those with 
the unusual design found in the escort and lynx 
belts that ride against the hips are braced on a large mass of 
bone in an accident keeping the passenger anchored while avoiding 
damage to the spine belts that ride above the hip under the impact 
of a crash can slice through the bodys soft tissue to the spine 
resulting in paralysis or death 
nhtsa said its strong recommendation that seat belts be used 
remains unchanged 
whether it be at the front or the rear you are far better 
off wearing any kind of belt than no belt at all and that is based 
on studies of hundreds of thousands of accidents and fatalities and 
injuries said ron defore nhtsa spokesman

this summers drought has caused plants 
literally to cry out for water as they wither and scientists 
are trying to determine if their sounds too highly pitched for 
the human ear are attracting destructive insects 
department researchers have been using electronic gadgets for 
more than four years to hear corn and other droughtstressed plants 
make noises as cell structures or water tubes break down from a 
lack of water traveling from roots to the leaves 
when there is adequate water in the soil the water and 
nutrients flow upward in the tubes under tension if the soil lacks 
enough water the tension becomes too great and the tubes fracture 
one potential benefit from this kind of research would be new 
ways of letting irrigation farmers know precisely when to water 
their fields also it could aid in developing new plant varieties 
which would be better equipped to move water and nutrients from 
roots to leaves 
robert haack an entomologist at the departments north central 
forest experiment station east lansing mich and a colleague 
bill mattson think there might be a connection between the noises 
and flocking of some insects such as bark beetles to 
droughtdamaged trees 
the noises are called ultrasonic acoustic emissions and are in 
the 100kilohertz range while sound heard by humans is no more 
than about 20 kilohertz 
while the ultrasonic emissions have been documented their role 
in attracting insects remains only an educated guess 
haack the research leader said in a telephone interview 
wednesday from his east lansing office that he thought it was a 
neat idea that the noises of stricken trees might attract insects 
were just starting up on the treeinsect project he said 
we dont have enough to make any speculation on what we might 
find 
haack said insects have been known for a long time to be 
attracted by certain influences such as color and scent but haack 
said that to the best of his knowledge there has not been 
conclusive work linking the ultrasound of trees to insect behavior 
the project only got under way three weeks ago he said a lot 
of time has been spent rounding up necessary equipment part of it 
borrowed from other laboratories near michigan state university 
where the forest service operation is located 
it could turn out that these sounds do attract insects 
haack said or it might not or it might be a combination of 
things 
in any case haack is starting by depriving potted white pine 
seedlings of water and recording their ultrasounds the next step 
will be to see if the recorded sounds attract beetles 
eventually haack hopes to see what role the tree sounds play in 
the choice of sites for beetles to mate and lay eggs

president reagan came to the defense of gop 
vice presidential candidate dan quayle by claiming that the junior 
senator from indiana has more experience on military issues than 
democrat michael dukakis 
reagan appearing wednesday at a rally with vice president 
george bush offered his lengthiest comments to date about quayle 
since the vice president tapped the 41yearold last week as his 
running mate 
since the announcement was made bush and quayle have been 
dogged by questions about the conservative senators use of family 
connections to help him join the national guard and avoid the draft 
when many young americans were being sent into combat in the 
vietnam war 
although reagan made no mention of the flap he opened his 
remarks by praising bush and adding i like your running mate 
too 
he has had many more years of experience dealing with national 
security affairs than the head of the other ticket reagan said 
the president lauded quayles work on a major job training bill 
without mentioning that sen edward m kennedy dmass 
cosponsored the measure 
dan quayle stands for the same principles as george bush and i 
do the president said 
and he has the most important qualification of all for a 
copilot he wont be trying to turn the plane in one direction 
while the pilot is flying it in the other 
reagan argued that bush is wellprepared for the presidency 
after eight years in the copilots seat 
i once said that he is a great vice president but i know and 
ive seen that it didnt come easily george bush is a man of 
action a man accustomed to command reagan said 
the president offered no examples of duties hed handed the vice 
president but said that day in day out ive sought george 
bushs counsel 
reagan as he has in several campaign appearances here amidst 
his annual august vacation in california poked fun at the 
democratic ticket calling it a threeheaded ticket that doesnt 
know left from center 
the president has often referred to the democrats as running a 
triumvirate for the white house attempting to paint jesse jackson 
as an unseen but powerful force in the campaign of dukakis and his 
running mate sen lloyd bentsen dtexas 
the president who is scheduled to undergo a battery of annual 
eye ear nose and throat exams during his weeklong stay in los 
angeles has no public events until saturday when he is scheduled 
to take part in two fundraisers for the california gop and rep 
robert lagomarsino rcalif 
afterwards reagan and his wife nancy are to return to their 
santa barbara ranch until after labor day

patrick d kelly spent hundreds of 
dollars to beat a traffic ticket for running a red light but said 
he is glad to have his name cleared even if it took 2 years and 
11 court appearances 
the 35yearold house painter said his battle cost him more than 
2000 of which he expects to get back only 17150 from the city 
in repayment of the fine and court costs 
a jefferson county circuit jury tuesday acquitted kelley after 
less than 10 minutes deliberations 
i almost broke into tears he said i guess it shows truth 
will prevail the system does work if you fight it long enough 
kelley who received the citation in march 1986 was convicted 
in municipal court two months later he appealed saying the 
citation contained several errors including identifying him as 
black rather than white 
on tuesday judge mike mccormick offered to dismiss that case 
but kelley said he wanted his name cleared by a jury 
officer aw ellis testified the mistakes he made on the 
citation probably occurred when carbon paper in his ticket book 
accidentally transferred information from another ticket

rival presidential candidates george bush and 
michael dukakis are saying they want to debate this fall but sound 
far from agreement on when or where or how often they will meet 
vice president george bush will debate his opponent this 
fall said a brief statement wednesday from the bush campaign 
but the announcement also said it was unlikely that a debate can 
occur prior to sept 20 
that brought an outraged reaction from dukakis campaign chairman 
paul brountas who accused the bush campaign of seeking to 
unilaterally reject debates scheduled for sept 8 in birmingham 
ala and sept 14 in annapolis md 
brountas said the bush campaign decision not to accept the 
earlier dates threatens the full schedule of debates anticipated 
for the fall it is a transparent effort to limit the number of 
debates 
dukakis during a stop in michigan said flatly im going to 
be in annapolis on the 14th with or without him 
the birmingham debate is being sponsored by the league of women 
voters the annapolis forum by the bipartisan national commission 
on presidential debates 
a bush spokesman said that while the republican presidential 
nominee had said long ago he would debate his democratic opponent 
he had never agreed to any specific events 
bush campaign chairman james a baker iii is expected to meet 
with brountas in washington next week to negotiate the debate 
format 
the campaign statement said they would discuss sponsorship 
timing ground rules and other related matters 
the announcement said bush aides were confident the two 
campaigns would be able to work out the details of the debate 
schedule between themselves 
it also said the campaign thanked the groups and organizations 
which had offered to help expedite the process 
brountas retorted mr baker stated that the campaign is not 
prepared for a debate prior to sept 20 this is inexcusable the 
presidential commission debates have been scheduled for over a year 
and the vice president has known he would be his partys nominee 
for more than five months 
the american people have a right to the full schedule of these 
debates as agreed upon by the two national political parties 
dukakis added during a campaign stop in cleveland after seven 
years of onthejob training it seems to me that he ought to be 
able to go to work and debate the issues the vice president 
has been saying a lot about defense and national security and im 
ready to debate him 
bush campaign spokesman mark goodin said there were never any 
commitments made on specifics of a debate schedule weve been very 
specific in saying the vice president wants to debate governor 
dukakis

the aflcio is gearing up a drive to deliver 
democrat michael dukakis a margin of at least 2 million votes 
among its 14 million members on election day 
presidents of 87 of the labor federations 91 affiliated unions 
gave the massachusetts governor an unqualified endorsement 
wednesday 
union political operatives said the first step in their campaign 
for dukakis is to make sure that 85 percent to 90 percent of union 
members and other voters in their families are registered compared 
with 72 percent of the voting age population as a whole in the last 
presidential election 
you need about six weeks in most states to have an effective 
drive said john perkins the labor federations political 
director perkins will head the effort using computers at aflcio 
headquarters here 
the next step will use computers to track individual members 
concerns on various issues with letters sent to them on dukakis 
position on those issues the aim is to obtain at least 65 percent 
to 70 percent turnout nov 8 
aflcio president lane kirkland estimated the federations 
endorsement of walter mondale in 1984 was worth a net 2 million 
votes despite exit polls showing that as many as 47 percent of 
voters from union households cast their ballots for president 
reagan 
our rule of thumb is that we have to do twothirds or better 
in order to be successful in the election kirkland said we 
fell short of that im reasonably confident that the results this 
time will be improved 
united steel workers president lynn williams said winning 
passage of a law requiring employers to give 60 days advance notice 
of plant closings and layoffs has renewed labors confidence going 
into the campaigns final 11 weeks 
in the primaries we had our members running as potential 
delegates to national conventions on behalf of every democratic 
candidate but we have a very united position now in the steel 
workers and my sense is its that way across the labor movement 
williams said 
owen bieber the president of the united auto workers said a 
poll of his members by the american arbitration association showed 
a 969 percent level of support for dukakis 
and that was before dan quayle bieber said referring to 
the indiana senator tapped last week as the gop vice presidential 
nominee and the controversy since then on his use of family 
connections to help him avoid the vietnam war draft 
quayle led the reagan administrations opposition on capitol 
hill to the plant closing notices law and has one of the lowest 
prolabor voting records 9 percent in the senate 
labor leaders acknowledged that an overwhelming majority of 
their rankandfile probably are unaware of quayles role in 
defeating unionsought labor legislation over the past seven years 
one of their missions between now and election day they said 
is to educate their members on quayles votes 
at this point i just hope hes not forced off the ticket 
rachelle horowitz political director for the american federation 
of teachers said of quayle i want him out there campaigning 
bush campaign spokesman mark goodin called the aflcios 
endorsement of dukakis a classic dog bites man story 
every four years the aflcio trots out what has become an 
obligatory endorsement of a democratic presidential candidate and 
1988 is obviously no exception goodin said 
among those unions abstaining in wednesdays endorsement was the 
largest the 16 millionmember teamsters which endorsed ronald 
reagan in 1980 and 1984 after making no presidential endorsement in 
1976 
newly installed teamster president william mccarthy of boston 
who according to union sources dislikes dukakis said he is 
withholding an endorsement until a mail poll of his members is 
completed sept 16 
asked if the teamsters might endorse bush a union official 
said i just dont see it 
if the poll comes back strong for dukakis well probably 
endorse him said the teamster official who spoke on condition 
of anonymity if its close well probably remain neutral 
the 30000member air line pilots association said it was 
delaying an endorsement until after its convention next month the 
40000member marine engineers union also voted to abstain 
reaffirming its decadesold policy of making no presidential 
endorsements 
the newspaper guild qualified its endorsement voting 4000 of 
its 25390 members as abstaining primarily because of opposition by 
its 1000member wire service guild local to taking sides in the 
election

the united states and the soviet union have 
agreed tentatively to extend their grain deal for another year 
while trying to complete a new longerrange accord a us 
official says 
the official who asked not to be identified said wednesday 
that the two countries agreed through diplomatic channels last week 
on an extension that is essentially identical to the current pact 
a second official insisted that no final agreement had been 
reached but said he believed that one could be completed shortly 
we feel like we made some progress but were still far apart 
on pricing minimums and things of that nature thomas kay chief 
of the department of agricultures foreign agricultural service 
said of the first three ussoviet negotiating sessions 
kay said the two countries are trying to schedule a fourth 
meeting 
im optimistic at the next session well reach an agreement 
he said 
under the current fiveyear pact which expires sept 30 the 
soviets must buy at least 9 million tons of us grain annually 
the grain deal benefits american farmers now experiencing 
severe drought problems and the soviet union which often looks to 
the west for grain even though it has had a good harvest this year 
last month the agriculture department estimated that the 
soviets would have a bumper harvest of 215 million metric tons 
which would be their third best crop ever the soviets are 
importing grain to build up their stockpiles and to feed expanding 
livestock herds 
the soviets already have been given permission to purchase more 
than 12 million tons of grain for this year as of last month they 
had bought more than 5 million tons of corn more than 9 million 
tons of wheat 830700 tons of soybeans and 13 million tons of 
soybean meal

a genetically engineered aids vaccine made 
with the virus used in smallpox vaccinations soon will be tested on 
volunteers at six university medical centers the national 
institute of allergy and infectious diseases says 
each of the medical centers will recruit nine volunteers to 
first determine the vaccines safety and its ability to produce an 
immune response 
there is no chance of contracting aids from the vaccine since it 
contains no live or killed human immunodeficiency virus that causes 
the deadly disease the institute said wednesday 
the volunteers must be healthy men or women who pass a blood 
test showing they are not infected with the virus that causes aids 
and who are not engaged in behavior that would place them at high 
risk of contracting hiv the institute said 
while the institute is conducting numerous research projects to 
find effective drugs to treat hiv victims this is only the second 
vaccine to be approved for testing the first study began a year 
ago 
we are quite a distance away from getting a vaccine that would 
be approved for general use said elaine baldwin spokeswoman for 
the institute it is estimated we will not have an aids vaccine 
until the mid1990s 
the vaccine is produced by using live vaccinia virus which has 
been used for years as a smallpox vaccination that disease has now 
been wiped out worldwide 
at each of the six centers six volunteers will receive the aids 
vaccine and three will receive vaccinia vaccine alone as a 
control neither the volunteers nor the physicians conducting the 
test will know which vaccine each person is receiving until data is 
analyzed 
the medical centers that will conduct the studies are the 
university of maryland baltimore johns hopkins university 
baltimore vanderbilt university nashville tenn university of 
rochester new york baylor college of medicine houston and 
marshall university huntington wva 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome attacks the bodys immune 
system rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases and 
infections aids most often is spread through close contact with 
blood blood products or semen from infected persons its chief 
victims have been homosexual men and intravenous drug users 
as of monday aids had been diagnosed in 71171 americans of 
whom more than half or 40090 have died according to the federal 
centers for disease control no one is known to have recovered from 
aids

a deputy police chief resigned under fire 
wednesday as the police commissioner issued a report blaming him 
and other brass for a riot at a park that led to 100 complaints of 
police brutality 
deputy chief thomas darcy a 31year police veteran commanded 
hundreds of police officers who were deployed to defuse a 
demonstration at tompkins square park on manhattans lower east 
side on aug 6 
the demonstration against a 1 am curfew at the park turned 
violent and more than 50 people were hurt in clashes between police 
and protesters more than 100 charges of police brutality were 
later filed with the civilian complaint review board 
commissioner benjamin wards report said a lack of supervision 
was responsible for the appalling behavior of some members of the 
department 
the control of the situation was lost during the first 
confrontation between police and demonstrators and never 
sufficiently regained wrote chief of department robert j 
johnston who prepared the 16page report 
for this chief darcy the highestranking member of the 
department at the scene must be held accountable 
the other two supervisory officers at the confrontation deputy 
inspector joseph wodarski and capt gerald mcnamara also were 
disciplined 
wodarski was the ranking officer at the scene during a crucial 
period when darcy returned to his office about a dozen blocks away 
to go to the bathroom but he deferred all major decisions to 
mcnamara 
unfortunately the report said capt mcnamaras actions 
were not well planned staffed supervised or executed unnecessary 
confrontations resulted which culminated in a riot 
a key mistake according to ward was mcnamaras decision at 
the beginning of the demonstration to transmit an emergency signal 
that mobilized 300 police officers from all over the city without 
making any provisions for adequate supervision of the officers 
even after darcy returned to the park the mobilization call was 
never taken off the air as a result officers continued to pour 
into the area further confusing the situation ward said 
wodarski was reassigned from his prestigious post as commanding 
officer of the midtown south precinct to another as a command in 
queens 
mcnamara will be temporarily removed from his job commanding the 
9th precinct for a six to sevenmonth retraining period ward 
said during that time the east village precinct house will be 
placed under the command of inspector elson gelfand 
the civilian complaint review board has already identified 
several officers involved in the melee relying in part on 
videotapes taken by neighborhood residents the videotapes show 
police officers some of whom covered or removed their badges 
striking demonstrators for no apparent reason 
the board recommended that charges be brought against two 
officers both of whom were placed on modified assignment wednesday 
pending outcome of a departmental trial 
darcy 56 had been criticized anonymously shortly after the 
riot when ward cited the decision by the ranking officer at the 
park to leave the scene to go to the bathroom at a crucial moment 
the commissioner had said that was one of 10 mistakes that led to 
the melee 
darcy was trained in crowd control during the 1960s as a member 
of the tactical patrol force the new york police department was 
widely praised in those years for developing tactics that helped 
the city avoid the widescale civil disorder that plagued many 
other big cities

the california lotto machine that selects 
winning numbers jammed wednesday night during a drawing for a 38 
million jackpot one of the nations largest gambling windfalls 
lottery officials following disaster recovery guidelines 
hastily conducted another televised drawing a half hour after the 
regular time 
there are procedures to handle this sort of thing and they 
were followed said bob taylor the lotterys top spokesman at 
sacramento headquarters 
the first incomplete drawing was ruled invalid taylor said a 
drawing announcer called out the number 33 during the initial 
drawing but no ball bearing the number rolled out of the machine 
at the outset of the second drawing the announcer said weve 
reloaded the machine and are beginning a new drawing 
the reason the device failed was still being investigated 
lottery officials said it was the first failure in the 22month 
history of the game 
before the first drawing californians were grabbing 1 lotto 
tickets at an estimated average rate of more than 500 a second 
the lines are unreal people who normally buy 5 worth of 
tickets are buying 20 worth said anaheim liquor store owner 
mike notery sr anybody with money to spend is thinking nothing 
ventured nothing gained 
the fast pace of sales left lottery officials unsure of the 
exact jackpot total officials expected to determine thursday 
whether there was a winner and verify that persons identity later 
if nobody picked the correct six numbers out of a choice of 49 
numbers the jackpot will be added to saturdays drawing said 
officials

mayor w wilson goode circumvented the city 
prison board and ordered condoms distributed to inmates as part of 
an aids prevention program in philadelphia jails 
on monday the board voted 32 with one abstention against 
making condoms available to prisoners despite pleas from health 
officials and testimony from an inmate suffering from the deadly 
disease 
goode said wednesday his program which takes effect sept 1 
also includes anonymous aids testing counseling and treatment of 
prisoners 
prison board member m mark mendel an attorney who strongly 
opposes distributing condoms said goode had the prerogative to 
circumvent the board 
mendel said he opposed the proposal because the law prohibits 
sex between prisoners 
were sending mixed signals he said 
he also said he doubted that prisoners will use the condoms 
especially in cases of rape 
a prisoner with aids is an animal who would not care whether 
his sex partner has protection from the disease mendel said 
mendel said only eight prisoners in the citys jails have been 
diagnosed as having acquired immune deficiency syndrome indicating 
that prisons are not aids factories 
david fair director of aids programs for the city health 
department said earlier this week that two prisoners have died 
from the disease he said the number of prisoners infected with the 
aids virus would be difficult to estimate but could total more than 
half of the 3700 in custody 
during a twohour discussion before monday nights vote public 
health commissioner maurice c clifford urged approval of the 
policy saying sexual activity was rampant in the citys jails 
we are not condoning sexual activity clifford said we 
are saying it is taking place and the best protection against 
aids is using a condom

the justice department should not have allowed 
former attorney general edwin meese iiis wife to accept a free 
trip to china last year the office of government ethics says 
the bottom line is if the department of justice considers it 
an official function then the department of justice must pick up 
the tab for its own employees said don campbell a spokesman at 
the ethics office 
ursula meese accepted the allexpensespaid trip as a guest of 
peopletopeople international of kansas city a nonprofit 
organization 
she and deborah morris the wife of joseph morris head of the 
office of liaison services accompanied their husbands to an 
international legal seminar after justice officials said it was 
proper for them to do so campbell said 
we disagreed with them in the outcome campbell said they 
analyzed it and they saw it a little bit differently than we 
did federal regulations prohibit relatives of federal employees 
from accepting trips and gifts 
the justice department paid for travel by the attorney general 
and other department employees 
the ethics office plans no more action campbell said terming 
the decision on the china trip a close call but the office has 
sent a letter to justice spelling out how similar trips should be 
handled in the future 
five justice officials along with meese who resigned aug 12 
and is now a private citizen plan to attend a similar legal 
conference in tokyo between aug 29sept 1 
what we basically said was that we are not going to challenge 
anything on the china trip but here is guidance for the japan 
trip campbell said 
the justice employees who are traveling to japan are patrick 
korten the departments chief spokesman charles rule assistant 
attorney general for antitrust morris of the liaison office 
cheryl nolan one of morris subordinates and richard abell 
director of the office of justice programs mrs morris is not 
scheduled to go on the trip a secretary in morris office said 
deborah burstionwade a justice spokeswoman said the 
conference is designed to explore legal and economic relations

republican sen dan quayle whose 
candidacy for the vice presidency has been dogged by controversy 
should be thankful hes not being ignored say republican 
legislators 
they say that as an elected official even bad press is good 
press said state delegate martha klima of lutherville md 
quayle who spoke to the southern legislative conference on 
wednesday was unanimously endorsed by fellow republicans who said 
his troubles actually may help him in the long run 
it has added to the party and i want to thank the press 
said west virginia delegate robert jones of martinsville its 
inviting more questions and i think the exposures good 
it was one of the first appearances quayle has made on his own 
on the campaign trail since his selection by gop presidential 
nominee george bush 
the most persistent questions have been about whether he used 
his familys influence to gain a spot in 1969 in the indiana 
national guard to avoid a tour in vietnam 
kentucky rep ken harper of crestview hills said the publicity 
has turned what would have been a twomonth job of introducing the 
relatively unknown quayle to the public into a free advertising 
campaign 
its taken a person who was not wellknown and made him a 
household word harper said 
sen lloyd bentsen of texas the democratic vice presidential 
running mate of michael dukakis preceded quayle on the platform 
before the southern lawmakers 
other southern gop lawmakers said the attention focused on 
quayle has taken away from the gop ticket 
i think anytime you spend a lot of time about an ancillary 
issue obviously its divisive said louisiana state sen john 
hainkel of new orleans it hasnt been good because its taken 
the spotlight off the things we ought to be talking about 
kentucky state rep bill strong of hazard agreed saying its 
kind of stymied the ticket its dominated the news where bush 
cant get his message across 
georgia state sen jim tysinger of dekalb county said the 
democratic ticket also has suffered by the attention paid to quayle 
it has hurt both of them tysinger said dukakis hasnt 
been in the news and neither has bush 
no republican said quayles problems are serious enough to 
warrant his dismissal from the gop ticket 
i think it would be terrible to take him off the ticket 
said hainkel if i was george bush i wouldnt even consider 
that youd infuriate every man who ever served in the national 
guard for one thing 
many lawmakers thought the news media would suffer the 
consequences of a backlash if they continued to harp on quayles 
service in the national guard 
there was unanimous agreement that enough had been said about 
the subject 
its detracted from what the american people need to know 
said tennessee state rep edward h moody of morristown 
maybe we can get on to some of the campaign issues now

its one thing getting filmgoers to watch the 
makebelieve violence of a nightmare on elm street its 
another luring them to witness a truetolife racial lynching that 
mirrors the sickness of their society 
yet thats the challenge facing the makers of the explosive 
movie betrayed which opens in theaters across the country on 
friday but has already suffered one advertising snafu that left 
preview audiences steaming 
filled with unbridled bigotry and an alltooreal racial murder 
the film stands as a study in how and how not to market an 
earthshaker 
this movie is enormously difficult says gordon weaver who 
is supervising the advertising campaign this is a very tough 
tough film 
what makes betrayed directed by costagavras a hard sell 
is its explicit depiction of us white supremacists a topic 
audiences might want to avoid so producer united artists looked 
for another marketing hook within the movie 
cut to debra winger and tom berenger the films stars for 
united artists the popular pair made for a natural advertising 
angle thus in the first betrayed posters or one sheets 
as they are called winger and berenger were shown embracing 
from the looks of the poster betrayed appeared to be a 
steamy little film perhaps an update of jagged edge which 
was in fact written by betrayed author joe eszterhas 
but preview audiences expecting betrayed to resemble an 
adventurepacked pulp romance were startled to see a band of 
hardworking midwestern farmers who lead a double life as racist 
killers 
the white supremacists murder a talkshow host reminiscent of 
denver radio personality alan berg who was gunned down in 1985 by 
members of the order they hunt down and lynch a black youth and 
denounce homosexuals jews and various ethnic groups 
in more than one instance preview audience members 
spontaneously erupted in anger either walking out or speaking out 
against the film while it was still on screen said one woman at a 
century city screening all white people are not like that 
the time was ripe it seemed for a new advertising campaign 
the films future hung in the balance 
what we found out was that people didnt know how to react to 
this film said brenda farrier who with weaver was called in to 
consult on the 6 million advertising campaign 
we had to help the audience along and say it is going to be 
an upsetting film it is not going to be a musical farrier 
said the decision was ironic if the movie were to be popular 
united artists was saying people had to be ready to hate what they 
saw 
powerful films do cause people to say i dont want to see 
this it makes me uncomfortable thats the risk that you 
run said tony thomopoulos chairman and chief executive officer 
of united artists pictures 
costagavras a french director has made a career specializing 
in disturbing films such as missing state of siege and 
z 
when we first started screening the film for people 
thomopoulos said we found out that if people were not prepared 
for what they were going to see their reaction was so shocked that 
they werent able to digest it all and they missed a great deal of 
the film now we are taking this approach of making people aware 
among the first moves that farrier and weaver made was dropping 
the sexually tinged poster which was to have been used as a 
newspaper advertisement 
the poster was replaced with an unusual unillustrated fullpage 
ad that ran in newspapers in los angeles new york and chicago 
but in the hardnews not entertainment sections 
the movie the ad said is a profoundly disturbing and often 
shocking motion picture portrait of a hidden part of contemporary 
america it will anger you it will upset you 
a new television ad which began the first week of august was 
just as blunt it will change the way you think forever 
soon united artists introduced a television commercial built 
around interviews with averagelooking moviegoers leaving 
screenings said one the movie was terrifying said another 
it will kick you in the rear end 
after that ad ran united artists finally began running 
commercials that addressed the entire storyline and winger and 
berenger were finally revealed to be lovers 
while reviews and boxoffice receipts will ultimately prove 
whether betrayed is an interesting movie united artists has 
at least set the stage 
said weaver all we can do now is wait

french director costagavras admits he has a 
knack for hitting sensitive nerves with his films about political 
repression but hes fascinated by what he sees as dualism in 
american society 
his latest movie betrayed examines racist paramilitary 
groups in the united states and is likely to come under siege 
itself for its depiction of hardworking midwestern farmers who 
lead a double life as racist killers 
as an outsider thats what fascinates me and confuses me 
about this country the 55yearold director said in a recent 
interview you have racism here especially against outsiders 
yet you can have a presidential candidate who is greek boy with a 
jewish wife 
you have worked so hard to fight totalitarianism and keep your 
democracy yet your government supports dictators 
costagavras also filmed missing about a rightwing 
dictatorship in chile conservative columnist george will called 
the story about a young american who disappeared during the coup 
that brought gen augusto pinochet to power a fraud and a hit 
n run act of cowardice 
in state of siege an earlier film shot in chile during the 
regime of marxist president salvador allende costagavras offended 
the left wing the chilean army refused to cooperate in making the 
film and procommunist actors quit during the filming claiming 
the movie was procia 
you have to understand that people of my generation thought we 
knew the truth the only right way we learned the hard way that 
it wasnt so easy said the greekborn costagavras who now 
lives in france 
so when i make movies i feel its absolutely important to be 
critical of everyone i dont accept everyones ideology 
automatically

his 1962 novel the graduate 
became a smashhit movie evoking the discontent of a generation fed 
up with materialism today however charles webb finds himself 
looking for a handout 
the things he stands for and believes in are principles he 
cant live by any longer said webbs exwife fred who has 
accompanied him through two itinerant decades that has left the 
couple virtually homeless 
webb 49 says his abhorrence of material things led him to give 
away two houses during the good times he says he is nearly 
destitute living out of a van on a few thousand dollars a year 
its hard to make anybody believe the author of the graduate 
needs money he said wednesday 
webb said hard times have driven him and his 48yearold exwife 
out of the southern california campground where they lived for the 
past decade to the massachusetts town where webb went to college 30 
years ago 
he came east he said in hopes of finding a publisher for his 
latest project a compilation of writings on prejudice 
his plight however has taken him to the welfare office in 
north adams which rejected him because he has no permanent address 
the novelist whose hero in the graduate benjamin braddock 
struck a chord among young readers with his postgraduate misery at 
his parents suburban home has lived until now according to what 
friends consider impossibly high and even selfdestructive 
standards 
if hes hard up for dough its obviously due to his 
inclination toward divestiture said eric davis who graduated 
with webb from williams college in 1961 and teaches at the private 
commonwealth school in boston 
he said the couples tendency to rid themselves of property 
explains why they gave their hollywood house to a real estate agent 
in the 1960s and a home to the massachusetts audubon society in 
1970 when webb said he felt the need for getting free of 
things 
after the webbs marriage in 1962 in freds posh hometown of 
lakeville conn they sold their wedding gifts at a yard sale 
many of them to the guests who had given them 
a yearning to be free also explains their decision to divorce 
eight years ago although they had no intention of separating 
fred an artist whom webb met when she was a student at bennington 
college in vermont said the couple felt marriage was a violation 
of their constitutional right to freedom 
webb the son of a welltodo california doctor espoused odd 
views back in college davis said 
we always used to wonder whether chuck was putting us on he 
said hes quite sophisticated a very intelligent person with a 
real heart but he always said things that sounded peculiarly 
simple 
webb was the envy of classmates with the publication of the 
graduate which he wrote after his own graduation in a small 
apartment in cambridge that he rented with the help of a college 
creative writing grant 
the obscure 1962 novel was catapulted to fame by the movie and 
webb was declared a highly gifted writer with a keen ear for 
dialogue the graduate was followed by four other novels 
including the marriage of a young stockbroker which also was 
made into a movie his last work booze was published in 1978 
webb says he received only 20000 for the film rights to the 
graduate which starred dustin hoffman in the days before 
authors insisted on a percentage of the movies sales the novel 
however is still in print and continues to earn a few thousand 
dollars in royalties annually 
but he doesnt regret the unusual life that led to his dilemma 
its hard to think there would be another way to do it he said

protesters hoping to block plans for an 
archaeological dig at two indian mounds kneeled around a colorful 
indian prayer blanket and called on the great spirit for help 
this is a spiritual issue these grounds are sacred to native 
americans said harry moore regional director of the national 
conference of christians and jews 
moore accompanied three protestant preachers and an indian 
spiritual leader wednesday as they joined a dozen other critics of 
the proposed dig the mounds are all that remain of an indian 
village that sat beside the mississippi river about a thousand 
years ago 
protests led by several american indians who said the graves of 
their ancestors would be violated stopped a dig scheduled at the 
site in june by a memphis state professor and his students 
now state officials are considering a dig at the mounds but 
state archaeologist nick fielder said the protesters dont 
understand what hes up to 
archaeologists are interested in seeing such sites preserved 
we dont have to be at odds fielder said 
the state is trying to have the mounds registered as a national 
historic site he said and digs will be conducted only if required 
as part of that application 
the mounds are not believed to contain graves but if any are 
found they will be left alone fielder said 
however protesters said the site is sacred to american indians 
and should not be disturbed for any reason 
freedom of religion is as dear to these people as it is to me 
as a baptist said the rev wc holmes pastor of beulah baptist 
church 
holmes the other pastors and moore joined with rosemarie 
abeita an indian spiritual leader from new mexico in the prayer 
beside the mounds the group kneeled before an altar made of wood 
carvings eagle feathers and other religious items 
make of us one people and help us recognize our common home of 
this earth said the rev nancy hastings sehested pastor of 
prescott memorial baptist church 
after their prayer the demonstrators held hands in a circle 
sang we shall overcome and recited the lords prayer 
ms abeita said the mounds already have been disturbed too much 
over the years they were used for fortifications during the civil 
war and 27 skeletons were dug up and removed from the mounds in 
the 1930s she said 
fielder said the skeletons were uncovered by a work crew 
building a road not by archaeologists placing the mounds on the 
national register of historic places would prevent that sort of 
thing from happening again he said

scientists who built a 1400squareyard roof to 
shield the ground from acid rain reported today their experiment 
gives new hope that lakes and streams can recover when such 
pollution stops 
acid rain which results from certain kinds of manmade 
pollution can harm fish other aquatic life vegetation buildings 
and monuments 
for the experiment begun in 1984 and reported in the british 
journal nature norwegian and swedish researchers built the roof 
over a site in southern norway that had been exposed to acid rain 
precipitation that fell on the roof was filtered to remove 
acidrain components then distributed beneath the roof by 
sprinklers 
analysis showed the runoff beneath the roof began to recover 
normal chemistry after the structure was built 
that indicates that chemical changes caused by acid deposition 
are largely reversible the researchers wrote 
the results agree with previous studies from canada the united 
states and scotland they said 
further studies of soil and runoff will be needed to see if they 
can completely recover from acid rain they said

ancient clay deposits provide evidence that a 
global fire contributed to widespread extinctions of dinosaurs and 
other life forms 65 million years ago scientists reported today 
the hypothesis put forth in 1985 is that the fire was ignited 
by the impact of a huge meteorite 
some scientists say such an impact could have kicked up enough 
dust to block sunlight for a long time triggering extinctions by 
lowering temperatures and killing vegetation a worldwide fire 
could have added other dangers university of chicago chemist 
edward anders said wednesday in a telephone interview 
apart from burning or choking in the flames organisms could 
have perished from newly formed toxic compounds or from an 
eventual warming of temperatures triggered by carbon monoxide the 
fire poured into the atmosphere he said 
the study by anders and others appears in the british journal 
nature and involved close examination of ancient clay samples from 
five sites in europe and new zealand 
researchers found that carbon thought to be from the soot 
settled on the ground at about the time as particles of iridium 
which are believed to have come from the meteorite that suggests 
the fire was ignited by the impact rather than occurring much 
later anders said 
analysis also showed uniformity in the types of carbon found at 
the sites suggesting the carbon came from a single global fire 
anders said two sites show a particular type of hydrocarbon that 
may have come from the burning of coniferous trees he said

millionmember party ne win 77 cited his age and accepted 
indirect responsibility for bloody studentled riots against his 
government in march and june

other in a traditional celebration

the countrys military leaders have 
lifted all state of emergency measures for the first time since 
president augusto pinochet seized power in 1973 a move the 
opposition greeted with cautious approval 
wednesdays decree comes just days before the fourman ruling 
junta is expected to nominate pinochet an army general as sole 
candidate in a presidential referendum slated for october 
interior minister sergio fernandez in a news conference told 
reporters the presidential decrees lifting the emergency will 
take effect upon publication in the official bulletin probably 
today or friday 
opposition leaders said they hoped the move would increase the 
likelihood of a clean referendum but they said it should have come 
sooner and that it remained to be seen if the government would 
actually allow citizens to fully exercise basic political freedoms 
the two measures are a state of emergency and a state of 
disturbance to internal peace 
under the state of emergency the government is authorized to 
suspend publication and broadcasts by news media and restrict 
public gatherings 
the state of disturbance measure permits pinochet to order the 
arrest and detention of opponents for up to 20 days send into 
exile citizens deemed dangerous to internal security order 
internal exile for up to three months and restrict freedom of 
information and public gatherings 
lawyer gustavo villalobos of a roman catholic human rights 
organization told the associated press in a telephone interview 
that the lifting of the states of emergency could allow most of 
chiles 504 political exiles to return in london an amnesty 
international report issued today said clandestine groups linked to 
chiles security forces have increased their attacks on government 
opponents and become a major force of political repression 
more than 100 people have been assaulted or kidnapped in the 
past 18 months while hundreds more have received death threats 
said the londonbased international human rights group 
emergency measures have been in effect since sept 11 1973 
when pinochet led a coup that toppled the government of elected 
president salvador allende a marxist such measures have been 
lifted before but never all at once as in wednesdays move 
fernandez said the government believed it could do without the 
emergency powers because authorities had succeeded in establishing 
order within chile 
a leading progovernment politician hermann chadwick said the 
decision means that the country can rest assured that the 
upcoming electoral event will be held with full democratic 
guarantees 
in the presidential referendum chileans will vote yes or 
no on a single candidate to be picked tuesday by pinochet as 
commanderinchief of the army and by his counterparts in the navy 
air force and national police pinochet himself is considered 
virtually certain of gaining the nomination 
if voters approve the candidate he will start an eightyear 
term on march 11 1989 if not an open election will be held 
within a year with pinochet remaining in power until then 
no precise date has been announced for the vote but pinochet 
said it will be held in early october 
the political opposition the catholic church the reagan 
administration and even some government supporters had asked that 
the restrictive measures be lifted before the referendum 
its better late than never said alejandro hales a leading 
opposition activists and president of the chilean lawyers 
association 
i now hope that the government will not resort to any legal 
loopholes to prevent chileans from exercising rights of which they 
have been deprived for 15 years hales said 
patricio aylwin president of the moderate opposition christian 
democratic party said we now hope that all chileans will be 
allowed to really and effectively exercise public liberties 
manuel bustos president of the nations main labor federation 
said the decision creates better conditions for a clean 
referendum 
monsignor carlos gonzalez president of the national bishops 
conference said the governments decision will contribute to the 
peace of everyone it gives tranquility it gives confidence

as authorities tried to shut them off 
from the outside world striking coal miners communicated through a 
clandestine network of couriers and listened in the dark to radio 
reports of the standoff 
provisions in stores in jastrzebie a southern mining city of 
100000 dwindled after the strikes began aug 16 with cheese and 
fresh meat virtually disappearing from the shelves 
but food still reached the strikers farmers donated food and 
funds for the strikers and on wednesday 330 pounds of fresh pork 
arrived from solidarity supporters in bialystok a city 335 miles 
away near the soviet border 
the police presence at the july manifesto mine increased 
dramatically when more than 30 police vehicles took up positions at 
the main gate 
a few hours later 103 police vehicles including an armored 
personnel carrier jeeps trucks and three water cannons rolled 
through the city in the direction of another mine 
the road leading to july manifesto where the leaders of the 
silesian mine strikes set up headquarters was sealed off by an 
army roadblock 
a nightime curfew took effect tuesday residents were ordered 
off the street from 11 pm to 5 am to preserve the peace 
according to signs posted throughout the city 
the miners helped organize an effective network of couriers to 
relay messages among the striking mines and through a strike 
information center in the citys blessed virgin mary church 
police detained at least two couriers and accused them of 
speculating in bread and butter wednesday the two later were 
released and immediately resumed their rounds at the mines 
strikers resolved to continue their occupation until they won 
legalization of solidarity and better wages 
there are fewer people but they are in an excited mood and 
they will stay to the end said a regional solidarity leader who 
visited several mines wednesday 
not all the towns attention focused on the strike 
mothers in jastrzebie were busy buying school supplies and new 
clothes for children who return to school sept 1 
those items take a big bite out of the family budget a new 
school bag costs the equivalent of 450 or a miners wages for a 
full day 
at the church a group of students from universities in warsaw 
and krakow typed newsletters and communiques they put the latest 
word on strikes around the country on a blackboard and flags of 
poland were pinned on a map of the country to mark strike locations 
in between radio news bulletins students listen to the doors 
and other old rock groups 
at least two mines july manifesto and 30 years of peoples 
poland printed daily strike newsletters on the premises on 
tuesday 125 miners at the latter mine descended 500 yards 
underground because they feared a police assault 
on wednesday the miners decided to divide up shifts to have 
about 40 at time underground 
music soothed strained nerves and whenever possible miners 
played cassettes over the loudspeakers 
still according to the couriers inside the mines radio news 
was the first priority on the hour strikers huddled together to 
listen to the latest news of the situaion of those who joined them 
in their struggle 
they tuned by turns to polish state radio radio free europe and 
the polishlanguage service of the british broadcasting corp

central banks decision on its discount rate which has been 
keeping them from buying stocks said an analyst at a major 
securities firm 
although the recovery on wall street overnight led to the 
tokyo markets rebound this morning lack of direction in the 
market reversed the trend he said speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
foreign exchange dealers said the us currency fell partly 
because dollarselling intervention by us and european central 
banks to support the west german mark finally has become effective 
but the dollars sluggishness will continue until investors 
determine whether the german central bank will raise its key 
lending rate to support its currency they said

muhammad ali is receiving 
bloodcleansing treatments by a doctor who blames the former boxing 
champions weakened condition on household pesticide poisoning and 
not blows to the head 
the 46yearold former heavyweight champion walked into a 
hospital waiting room throwing jabs in the air minutes after 
undergoing an eighthour blood treatment to relieve the slurred 
speech and tremors that have plagued him in recent years 
i feel like i can fight heavyweight champ mike tyson ali 
said in a hoarse voice slightly above a whisper at hilton head 
hospital 
ali referred questions to his physician dr rajko medenica an 
immunologist who specializes in cancer and blood disorders 
ali arrived in hilton head on tuesday night to undergo 
plasmapheresis during which his plasma was removed and replaced 
with an artificial product prepared by medenica plasma is the 
yellowish fluid in which other components of the blood circulate in 
the body 
although ali has been diagnosed as having parkinsonian syndrome 
possibly brought on by blows to the head during his boxing career 
medenica disagrees 
calling it the muhammad ali syndrome he blamed household 
pesticide poisoning which probably affected him so severely 
because of his rapid metabolism when he was in peak physical 
condition 
ali likely will return to hilton head for the treatments every 
three months or so medenica said 
my goal is to remove the circulating toxins by the end of the 
year he should be much better he said 
although ali had trouble speaking he moved with ease and 
appeared to be in good spirits moments after a brief 
questionandanswer session he playfully pulled a small red 
handkerchief from his pocket and made it appear and disappear 
several times 
i like to show people how easily they can be deceived he 
said ali then performed other tricks signed autographs and posed 
for photographs with delighted hospital workers 
his wife lonnie said that other than the slurred speech ali 
is doing better than many people realize he feels no pain hes 
never sick there is no hard part living with muhammad there is 
nothing special i have to do for him except make sure he takes his 
medication 
ali called medenica the greatest doctor in the world hes got 
methods ive never seen before he said

despite a bounty of good will and aid found 
here droughtafflicted iowa farmers are worried that the idaho hay 
they are cutting for hungry livestock back home wont be enough to 
make it through winter 
a lot of us guys are just plain out of hay said albia 
iowa dairyman don tibbals one of the farmers who were to begin 
cutting today but when things are as bad as they are back home 
every little bit helps 
the 64 men women and teenagers who arrived late tuesday after 
a 40hour 1600mile bus trip scouted fields wednesday where they 
would begin harvesting hay near deary about 30 miles northeast of 
moscow 
the farmers from south and central iowa came to the palouse 
region of northern idaho to cut hay on lands set aside for a 
government erosioncontrol program 
conservation reserve program land is normally not farmed but 
the us department of agriculture has released it for harvest by 
droughtafflicted farmers said mike tracy spokesman for the idaho 
farm bureau which is coordinating the hay project with the iowa 
farm bureau 
at a dinner wednesday night the iowans were assigned to fields 
and machinery plans were to work from field to field like an 
assembly line until hay is harvested from the 4500 acres 
available 
the harvest could take 10 days but cutting and bailing must be 
finished by aug 31 a deadline set by the agriculture department 
depending on field conditions the program was expected to 
produce 1500 tons to 5000 tons of hay which will be shipped 
without charge to iowa by the burlington northern railroad 
sipping coffee wednesday morning while waiting for a bus to take 
them to the fields the iowans fretted over their ability to feed 
and water their livestock through the winter 
the iowans said that where usually there are three to four 
cuttings of hay a season this year there was one poor harvest 
a lot of farmers are feeding their winter hay now said 
junior mccall of clarinda iowa we usually dont have to start 
feeding hay until december added larry keller of nunia iowa 
in addition to donations of transportation equipment food and 
lodging the idaho farm bureau received countless offers to assist 
in the harvest tracy said offers of money to help the project 
poured in from around the country he said

stock prices plunged today and 
businessmen expressed fears for government stability after 
ferdinand marcos requested permission for the first time to return 
home and confront an accuser 
the 70yearold expresident living in exile in hawaii filed a 
petition wednesday with the anticorruption court demanding the 
right to defend himself when a former cabinet minister testifies 
agaist him in november 
last week the court ruled that marcos had the right to 
crossexamine former public works minister baltazar aquino when he 
gives evidence in a deposition hearing nov 7 
it was the first time marcos formally sought permission from any 
philippine institution to return to the land he fled after the 
february 1986 uprising that toppled his administration and 
propelled corazon aquino to the presidency 
mrs aquino said today that she would stand by a commitment to 
abide by whatever decision the court renders in the case 
at the same time im also committed to work for the national 
interest she said without elaboration in a statement read by 
spokesman teodoro benigno mrs aquino had previously refused to 
allow marcos to return 
marcos asked the department of foreign affairs to issue him a 
passport within three days and to request the us government to 
lift restrictions that bar him from leaving hawaii 
us officials have said they will not allow marcos to leave 
without mrs aquinos consent 
in the petition marcos said the court had no choice but to 
grant his request or order the philippine government to halt a 
preliminary investigation that authorities say will lead to the 
filing of formal criminal charges against marcos 
solicitorgeneral francisco chavez said baltazar aquino who is 
not related to the president will testify about alleged bribes 
paid by japanese firms during the marcos administration 
marcos said that as a lawyer he demanded the right to represent 
himself 
the only possible way of lawfully preventing the undersigned 
from personally appearing and defending himself in all such cases 
is for the incumbent government to dismiss any charges with 
prejudice marcos said meaning no charges would ever be filed 
defense secretary fidel ramos told reporters wednesday that the 
military was drawing up security plans in the event marcos comes 
home 
today share prices on the manila stock exchange fell 20 points 
and brokers said the drop reflected concern over a possible marcos 
return 
stock prices began falling monday as rumors spread the former 
president would come back soon and one dealer predicted a 30 
percent decline unless mrs aquino takes an unequivocal stand 
against marcos returning 
luisabel cortez clerk of the anticorruption court told the 
associated press the three justices were studying the marcos 
petition but had not decided whether to call a hearing 
the aquino government has been under pressure from swiss 
authorities to file formal charges against marcos before they will 
provide information about secret bank accounts marcos allegedly 
maintains in switzerland 
government officials claim marcos embezzled up to 10 billion 
during his administration and stashed millions in swiss bank 
accounts 
philippine law bans trials in absentia and officials have 
delayed filing criminal charges for fear marcos would insist on 
returning 
last saturday military chief of staff gen renato de villa said 
the armed forces command would not try to block marcos return but 
noted that the former presidents presence would cause security 
risks 
marcos still enjoys support among conservatives in both the 
general population and the ranks of the armed forces 
his supporters have been agitating for mrs aquino to let marcos 
come home for the funeral of his mother josefa edralinmarcos who 
died may 4 family members and marcos supporters say no date for 
the burial will be set until the ousted president is allowed to 
come home

a study published today casts doubt on the widely 
held belief that the grief of losing a loved one can shorten the 
lives of surviving relatives 
the research conducted in israel found that parents who lose a 
son to war or accidential death go on to lead full lifespans 
despite their grief 
these findings raise questions about the effect of grief as a 
deathprovoking factor wrote dr itzhak levav and colleagues 
from hadassah medical organization and hebrew university in 
jerusalem 
an editorial published with the study in the new england journal 
of medicine concluded that the stress of grief is unlikely to cause 
illness in most people 
the physician owes it to the patient to point out the 
strengths of the human response rather than the susceptibilities 
that are often belabored in the media wrote drs malcolm p 
rogers and peter reich of brigham and womens hospital in boston 
rather than emphasize the disruptive power of stress they 
concluded the physician may do better to emphasize human 
resilience and the power of life 
some studies have found that when a spouse dies the surviving 
husband or wife is also at risk of an untimely death however this 
could result from a lifetime of sharing the same hazards such as 
smoking or poor diet rather than grief 
in the latest study the researchers reviewed the lifespans of 
two groups of bereaved israeli parents those of all 2518 soldiers 
killed during the yom kippur war in 1973 and those of 1128 young 
men who died in accidents between 1971 and 1975 
overall mortality among these parents was the same as for the 
general population of jewish israelis however there was one 
exception they found that the death rate was significantly 
elevated among widowed mothers who lost a son

exposure to low levels of lead early in life is 
linked with subtle impairment of mental development in 4yearold 
children according to a study published today 
the study increases the growing body of research suggesting that 
small amounts of lead can hinder the growth of babies brains 
last year a boston study found slow mental growth among 
2yearolds who had been exposed to low levels of lead before 
birth although these children were not considered retarded the 
latest research conducted in australia provides similar findings 
for older children 
the researchers wrote that their findings suggest that any 
adverse effect of lead is cumulative and may result in longterm 
impairment in development rather than a delay in development 
the study published in the new england journal of medicine was 
conducted by dr anthony j mcmichael and colleagues at the 
university of adelaide 
the doctors studied 537 children who lived in port pirie a town 
in south australia near a large lead smelting plant 
at age 2 their average blood level of lead was 21 micrograms 
for each deciliter of blood a microgram is onemillionth of a 
gram a deciliter is a tenth of a liter which equals 21 pints 
large amounts of lead have clearly been linked with brain damage 
and death but the potential ill effects of low levels is still 
controversial 
no one knows precisely how much if any lead in the blood can 
be considered safe until recently us scientists considered 
levels above 25 micrograms unacceptable but the boston study 
conducted at childrens hospital found that development is slowed 
if fetuses are exposed to levels above 10 micrograms before birth 
the australian researchers determined the youngsters average 
blood lead concentrations during their first four years of life and 
gave them tests to assess their mental development they found that 
those with lead levels of 32 micrograms of lead scored 7 percent 
lower than those with levels of 11 micrograms 
however those with higher lead exposure were not retarded even 
though they did worse than those with low lead exposure their 
scores were slightly above average 
the findings could not be explained by other possible influences 
upon mental development such as the mothers intelligence or their 
home environment 
the researchers said that their work along with the boston 
study indicate that there may be no clear threshold below which 
an adverse effect on mental development does not occur 
in the united states the level of lead in the air has fallen 
substantially in recent years because most cars now use unleaded 
gasoline however flaking layers of old lead paint may still be a 
hazard as well as water tainted by lead pipes

amnesty international today said evidence 
indicates chiles security forces are linked to clandestine groups 
that have carried out more than 100 assaults or kidnappings in the 
past 18 months 
hundreds of government opponents have received death threats as 
the clandestine groups have become a major force of political 
repression the londonbased international human rights group 
amnesty said chiles military government blames the attacks and 
threats on ordinary criminals or independent extremist groups but 
it said there is convincing evidence they are in fact carried 
out by groups linked to the security forces 
evidence which has emerged through the courts the groups 
methods of operation the impunity with which they operate and the 
vast resources available to them all clearly point to an 
association with the security forces and official condonement 
said the report 
in addition it said in rare instances members of units have 
been photographed or otherwise identified as belonging to the 
military or police 
anyone perceived as critical of government practices risks 
harassment and thousands live with the uncertainty of possible 
abuse the report said intimidation by clandestine groups is 
now one of the most common methods of political persecution in 
chile 
the report said intimidation by such groups began to spread in 
1983 following an increase in opposition demands for a return to 
democracy 
the attacks have increased in the buildup to an october 
presidential referendum it said the military junta will choose a 
single candidate for president and voters will approve or reject 
that choice 
victims of harassment or abuse have included political and trade 
union officials human rights workers community leaders in poor 
neighborhoods bishops lawyers court officials journalists and 
political activists amnesty said 
the report cites 128 cases of intimidation including that of 
oscar eloy gomez regional president of the chilean teachers 
association in the northern town of arica and leader of a local 
campaign for a no vote in the referendum 
in april he was forced into a vehicle by unidentified men who 
later fired shots at his feet kicked and beat him and told him he 
would get more of the same if he continued his activities 
other victims have been given electric shocks burned with hot 
metal or acid or had marks cut into their flesh amnesty said 
as well hundreds of death threats have been sent some with 
drawings of coffins and skulls or accompanied by dead animals it 
said 
sergio del solar president of the quilpue humans rights 
commission said he found a dead cat outside his home its throat 
slit 
it was terrible he was quoted as saying all i could 
think of was to hide it so that my family wouldnt suffer 
the report said that secret groups reportedly were behind the 
1987 disappearance of five political activists the 1986 murder of 
four opposition politicians and three other deaths in 1985 
amnesty said that although the government has said these 
incidents will be investigated not one of the hundreds of cases 
brought to the attention of the courts resulted in any of the 
perpetrators being brought to justice 
president augusto pinochet has ruled chile since sept 11 1973 
when he led a military coup that toppled the government of elected 
president salvador allende a marxist

the police chief in charge of hundreds of 
officers at a demonstration that turned into a riot resigned as the 
police commissioner released a scathing report blaming the violence 
on poor supervision 
the report on aug 6s confrontation at tompkins square park 
criticized deputy chief thomas darcy 56 for a series of mistakes 
beginning with his leaving the scene for about 90 minutes at a 
crucial time to use the bathroom 
it was clear from the review that some police officers engaged 
in the excessive use of force against private citizens by striking 
demonstrators with nightsticks and kicking other apparently 
defenseless people said commissioner benjamin ward 
darcy a 31year veteran who was the designated commander of the 
hundreds of officers deployed at the lower east side park offered 
his resignation shortly before ward released the report wednesday 
the two other supervisory officers at the confrontation deputy 
inspector joseph wodarski and capt gerald mcnamara also were 
disciplined departmental charges also were brought against two 
other officers and more were expected ward said 
the demonstration against enforcement of a 1 am curfew that 
has since been suspended ended with injuries to more than 50 
people including passersby 
more than 100 charges of police brutality were filed 
a police review board us attorney rudolph giuliani and 
district attorney robert morgenthau are conducting separate 
investigations into the complaints 
the control of the situation was lost during the first 
confrontation between police and demonstrators and never 
sufficiently regained wrote chief of department robert j 
johnston in the report 
a key mistake according to ward was mcnamaras decision at the 
beginning of the demonstration to transmit an emergency signal that 
mobilized 300 officers from all over the city without making any 
provisions for adequate supervision 
other major errors included use of a lowflying helicopter with 
a search light whose hovering presence acted as a magnet and drew 
people to the confrontation and the premature decision to send 
police on horses into the crowd 
wodarski was reassigned from his prestigious post as commanding 
officer of the midtown south precinct to a command in queens but 
he did not lose his rank ward said mcnamara will be temporarily 
removed from his job commanding the a precinct for six to seven 
months of retraining 
darcy will receive a 55000 annual pension 
the police review board has identified several officers involved 
in the melee relying in part on videotapes taken by neighborhood 
residents and recommended charges against two 
the commissioner noted that 17000 of the departments 26000 
officers had been hired since 1980 and they as well as their 
superiors had no experience with riots 
however he said the new york city police department is 
better than the events in tompkins square park would have you 
think 
among the reports recommendations was a major training program 
in crowd control and policing of street disorders

ptls bankruptcy trustee says hell 
shorten the time the ministry has to sell its assets when he 
submits a revised reorganization plan to a bankruptcy judge who 
rejected his first proposal 
in rejecting the reorganization plan wednesday us bankruptcy 
judge rufus reynolds said it failed to take into account the 
ministrys poor financial health 
this plan does not work reynolds said it does not 
reflect the situation 
he gave ptl bankruptcy trustee mc red benton until oct 1 
to prepare a new plan and until sept 10 to return with 
information on potential buyers of the ministrys assets 
benton said ptls secured creditors rejected the plan because it 
allowed five years for the sale of the assets ptls major 
contributors called lifetime partners also rejected the plan he 
said 
reynolds could have approved the plan despite the negative votes 
from creditors but decided against it 
proceeds from the sale of assets would repay ptls debts which 
could top 130 million 
reynolds rejected the idea of closing down operations saying 
that would kill ptls revenue sources which include donations from 
viewers of the televised ministry and proceeds from the heritage 
usa christian retreat near fort mill 
the ministry which entered bankruptcy proceedings in june 1987 
after the resignation of founder jim bakker in a sexandmoney 
scandal has been divided into the newly named heritage ministries 
and a corporation holding ptls assets 
benton said after the hearing that he would propose speeding up 
the time required for the sale of assets to six to seven months 
benton did not address the effect of the reorganization plans 
rejection on potential buyers of the assets but he said setting a 
sale within seven months would let creditors know how much they 
would be receiving much quicker than the five years allowed in the 
original plan 
benton told the court the debtor corporation has been losing 
400000 a month and needed 885000 from the sale of other assets 
to survive 30 more days reynolds approved that request 
benton said he expected to have by a sept 1 a firm offer from 
canadian peter thomas of the samoth capital corp to buy the 
heritage usa theme park satellite television network and other 
property the company has offered 113 million for the network 
park and 1700 acres of undeveloped property 
he said there also may be offers from bakker charlotte nc 
businessman george shinn and an oklahoma group he declined to 
identify

formal campaigning began today for next months 
general elections but the contest has been overshadowed by a 
public exchange between the only leader singapore has known and his 
designated successor 
the tension began in a threehour speech aug 14 when prime 
minister lee kuan yew cited the shortcomings of deputy prime 
minister goh chok tong on monday he suggested goh see a 
psychiatrist 
goh said that lee really meant a psychologist and added that he 
planned to nudge the prime minister out of office probably within 
two years 
lee said monday that his deputy could not communicate as well on 
television and at mass meetings as he could in small groups i 
dont know why i have suggested to him perhaps a bit of 
psychological adjustment maybe a psychiatrist something holds him 
back 
goh told reporters tuesday that lee suggested he consult a 
psychologist not a psychiatrist who is for mentally distressed 
people 
i do not believe that a psychologist could help me a speech 
therapist and trainer will and i have been seeing my speech 
trainer for over a year said goh who sometimes appears stiff 
and uneasy during televised speeches 
i am not president reagan i am not good at oneliners 
neither am i prime minister lee i am not good at making threehour 
speeches 
goh quoted lee as saying the prime minister is only waiting to 
be nudged out by a firm elbow when the time comes probably inside 
two years i will gently nudge him out 
goh was picked as the next leader by cabinet members in 1984 
but lee will remain in power following the sept 3 elections and 
there are no formal plans to end his rule 
the dispute and the eventual shift in power has overshadowed the 
election in the rich island nation a former british colony that 
separated from malaysia in 1965 lee has been its only prime 
minister and the peoples action party its only governing party 
the business times said in an editorial today that the 1988 
election is really about the handing over of the baton from lee 
kuan yew to goh chok tong the final passing of power 
the governing party captured unopposed 11 of the 81 seats in 
parliament when nominations closed wednesday formal campaigning 
started today 
the party is favored in most of the contested districts against 
137 candidates from seven opposition parties and four independent 
candidates only 51 opposition candidates ran in the last election 
in 1984 
all but three seats in parliament which was dissolved last 
week were held by the governing party which needs at least 41 to 
form a new government and run the country for the eighth 
consecutive term 
opposition leaders have denounced changes in the constitution as 
attempts to strengthen governing party rule 
one proposed constitutional amendment is to change the now 
ceremonial presidency into an elected office with enhanced powers 
it is widely assumed that if the 46yearold goh takes power 
lee who will be 65 on sept 16 will become the first elected 
president 
in that role he would have veto power over the nations 
spending and nominations of supreme court judges the attorney 
general and other senior posts 
the new president would lack full executive power but would be 
able to make speeches in parliament and have access to all 
government departments

a mentally retarded 6yearold girl afflicted 
with aids may stay in a home instruction program while an appeals 
court decides whether she must be enclosed in a glass booth if she 
attends school a federal judge ruled 
eliana martinez earlier won the right to attend school with 
other retarded children when the fall term begins monday in 
hillsborough county but she would be isolated in a special 
6by8foot booth until she is potty trained and stops sucking her 
thumb 
the childs adoptive mother rose martinez fought in court for 
two years to get her daughter in the class but balked at the glass 
cage required by district judge elizabeth kovachevich 
ms martinez attorney steve hanlon appealed to the 11th us 
circuit court of appeals in atlanta he also filed a motion for a 
local stay asking that eliana be allowed to attend classes with no 
restrictions or be kept in the countys homebound school program 
until the atlanta court rules 
chief judge william terrell hodges ruled on that motion 
wednesday allowing the girl to continue her instruction at home 
until the appeal is heard 
hanlon said he asked the appeals court for expeditious 
consideration that if granted could mean a ruling in late 
september or october 
the school board tuesday displayed the glass booth equipped 
with a desk toilet and sound system to about 150 parents of other 
children who will attend the manhattan exceptional center this 
fall only 11 of the schools 189 students would be in elianas 
classroom 
several parents expressed concern over having their children in 
school with the aidsafflicted girl one parent rob preston said 
his child would not go to school if eliana shows up

antigovernment demonstrators 
controlled this southernmost burma town today and student leaders 
claimed similar takeovers were occurring throughout the country 
this correspondent traveling by motor launch from the thai 
mainland found no burmese immigration officials at their posts and 
was told all army and police units had withdrawn wednesday to an 
area about one mile from this prosperous market town 
the pullout student leaders said came after president maung 
maung announced that the ruling burma socialist program party would 
next month hold an emergency congress to consider popular demands 
for a return to democracy 
about 300 workers merchants and students today marched through 
victoria point known as kawthaung in burmese asking others to 
join them in further demonstrations in coming days two jeeps were 
packed with students 
well continue to demonstrate we want elections as soon as 
possible said student leader nyi htwe calling maung maungs 
promises of democracy a political trick 
he said there was support among demonstrators for aung gyi a 
leading dissident released today from nearly a months 
imprisonment but the 21yearold rangoon university senior 
admitted uncertainty over burmas future 
only lord buddha can know what will happen in the future he 
said speaking at the student headquarters set up in the towns 
high school 
nyi htwe claimed the intelligence network set up by student 
organizations in rangoon was reporting that authorities in other 
burmese cities similarly had surrendered control and in some areas 
were cooperating with antigovernment forces 
he said a volunteer defense group was being organized among the 
towns 80000 residents to help maintain law and order 
students said that they carried no weapons and there had been no 
bloodshed as demonstrators confronted troops in the town last week 
they described some soldiers applauding as protesters gathered 
outside a military compound pleading with them to refrain from 
using force they said about 70 soldiers from the merguibased 
101st division had been stationed in the town armed with automatic 
weapons and usmade m79 grenade launchers 
in earlier demonstrations in rangoon and other areas troops 
opened fire on crowds of protesters and hundreds of casualties were 
reported 
nyi htwe said he and about 100 other students from rangoon had 
arrived at victoria point in july to begin directing 
antigovernment agitation he said most of the students were former 
residents of the town located on an island off the southern tip of 
burma about 490 miles southeast of rangoon 
university and high school students have spearheaded the 
uprisings against 26 years of authoritarian rule but buddhist 
monks laborers professionals and even government civil servants 
swelled their ranks as the protests intensified 
the town appeared calm despite the ongoing demonstrations 
the central market was open and passersby looked at posters 
affixed to walls of lowslung houses 
one poster showed ousted president sein lwin widely held 
responsible for ordering troops to fire on protesters with an m16 
rifle and a bandoleer stuffed with bullets slung around his neck 
it read sein lwin is rambo 
another depicted ne win who resigned as burmas leader last 
month as a dog perched on a chair with maung maung sitting under 
him and sein lwin off to one side and labeled running dog 
maung maung although a civilian has been closely associated 
with ne win and the authoritarian system for decades and is 
considered unacceptable by many antigovernment protesters 
victoria point is one of the few points along the thaiburmese 
border where thai nationals are officially allowed access most of 
the border is controlled by ethnic minority rebels fighting the 
rangoon government 
the town has prospered and its population has mushroomed because 
of trade with thailand and twoway smuggling as tension mounted in 
recent weeks burmese authorities closed the entry point 
intermittently 
but after a 20minute boat ride from the thai town of ranong 
today no officials were at dockside to inspect border passes

the international office of the 
solidarity free trade union movement today appealed for funds for 
strikers their families and victims of repression in poland 
the needs are great jerzy milewski head of the 
brusselsbased international office of solidarity said in a 
statement if the authorities adopt the worst possible tactics 
thousands of strikers are threatened with dismissal from work and 
extreme poverty 
on aug 16 strikes began in the coal mines of southern poland 
since them more than 20 enterprises joined in including shipyards 
transport companies and steel mills 
strikers demand higher pay better working conditions and the 
legalization of the solidarity trade union movement which was 
outlawed in 1982 
in a separate statement the european trade union confederation 
called on the 12 european economic community nations to urge the 
polish authorities to stop using violence to end the strikes 
the european union federation said it fully supports the 
aspirations and demands of polish workers and solidarity 
the strikes now under way in poland show clearly the absence 
of trade union liberties 
the federation said five east european nations the soviet 
union bulgaria czechoslovakia east germany and hungary have 
asked for formal diplomatic relations with the eec and that a 
polish request was expected soon 
as part of its improving relations with eastern europe the eec 
must raise the issue of respect for trade union rights the

more than 300 employees of a coal mine 
in southern hungary returned to work today after a 20hour strike 
that posed the first worker challenge to the strict economic 
policies of premier karoly grosz 
in negotiations with senior government officials the strikers 
won a promise the government would try to iron out a quirk in a new 
income tax law that allows workers on sick leave to earn more than 
those working regularly 
the strikers at the komlo mine 100 miles south of budapest 
threatened to halt work again if parliament does not remove this 
quirk 
in addition the government instructed companies to pay bonuses 
to miners who complained they had lost 30 percent to 50 percent of 
their bonuses under the new tax laws 
the daily magyar nemzet published the text of a letter sent by 
the strikers to grosz who in may became communist party leader 
urging him to settle the oftrepeated problems of miners at 
komlo 100 miles south of budapest 
the letter attacked the personal income tax introduced jan 1 as 
part of groszs attempts to stimulate the stagnating economy it 
said the tax does not stimulate increased production or the 
undertaking of extra shifts 
we all realize the present position and the problems both in 
the national economy and in our own company but we are faced with 
a situation in which our own living conditions have become worse 
our real income having been reduced as a result of the inflationary 
impact the letter added 
inflation has reached 18 percent this year the income tax has 
reduced the net income of many workers by introducing taxes on 
bonuses and earnings from second and third jobs 
grosz government is trying to stimulate the economy to curb a 
foreign debt of 18 billion 
the letter justified the strikers demands for changes in the 
tax system by noting government and party leaders have said for 
years that they consider the demands of workers legitimate and 
will see that these are met 
we miners have always honestly done our duty toward the 
dictates of the national economy and feel it is the ethical duty 
of the government to meet our requests now the letter said 
reports of strikes in communist hungary are extremely rare and 
the relatively swift media coverage of the stoppage at the komlo 
mine appeared to reflect the greater openness of the staterun 
media since grosz became party leader

the union contends pesticides contribute to cancer miscarriages 
and birth defects among those who pick grapes 
california table grape growers acknowledge that four pesticides 
are used but say the same chemicals are sprayed on other 
vegetables and fruits and pose no health risk 
a spokesman for california table grape growers said chavez is 
targeting the industry because the union does not have any 
contracts with growers 
thats the bottom line spokesman adam ortega said from los 
angeles theyre accusing stores of selling poisoned grapes 
thats not true theyre scare tactics

michael dukakis today accused the reagan 
administration of criminal dealings with panamas gen manuel 
antonio noriega and demanded that the president and vice president 
george bush explain why the united states has been in bed with 
general noreiga 
the democratic presidential nominee in a sharply worded attack 
on the reaganbush antidrug effort said the administrations 
indifference to the war on drugs threatened the nations children 
families schools streets and economy 
the most serious threat to our national security in this 
hemisphere is the avalanche of drugs that is pouring into this 
country and poisoning our kids dukakis said in a speech at the 
cuyahoga county courthouse 
and it is the drug traffickers and those who cover for them 
who are the enemies of everything we stand for in the world today 
how can we ask our kids to say no to drugs here at home when 
we have an administration thats been in bed with general 
noriega dukakis asked 
he chided president reagan for refusing to seek the help of 
latin and central american leaders to curb drug trafficking and 
said if elected he would use more foreign aid to assist those 
countries in eradicating drug crops and protecting public officials 
whose lives are endangered by drug cartels 
today after seven years of tough talk the american people 
want some answers dukakis said 
he then recited a litany of administration and bush policies he 
said were misguided saying the star wars space defense program 
is an unnecessary and costly idea taking vital resources away from 
antidrug efforts 
dukakis frequently criticizes reagan and bush for dealing with 
noriega the panamanian strongman who is under us indictment on 
drug charges but today was the first time he called the 
administrations conduct criminal 
for years while general noreiga of panama was actively 
involved in the drug business we were actively in business with 
general noreiga dukakis said that my friends is criminal 
on wednesday dukakis questioned bushs promise to create 30 
million new jobs and his credentials to manage the nations economy 
the next president of the united states must be an economic 
leader not a cheerleader dukakis said in speeches in washington 
and grand rapids mich 
he must do more than talk about jobs he must be a president 
who knows how to build a strong economy and has done it the 
massachusetts governor said a president who knows how to create 
and save jobs and has done it a president who has the strength and 
the vision and the values to build a strong and vibrant future for 
america 
the democratic presidential nominee traveled to the midwest on 
wednesday after visiting the nations capital to accept the 
endorsement of the aflcio 
he attended a briefing at a hightech center at a university in 
grand rapids in predominantly republican west michigan and then 
delivered essentially the same speech he gave to the aflcio 
delegates 
but he did add a fresh attack on bush whose promise to create 
30 million new jobs if elected president has been questioned by the 
gop presidential nominees own advisers 
this election isnt about whether mr bushs own economists 
believe his speeches dukakis said its about making every 
american a full shareholder in the american dream its about 
creating jobs with a future jobs you can count on jobs you can 
raise a family on 
dukakis conceded that more americans are working today than at 
any time in history but said most people who have been forced to 
change jobs during the reagan administration have had to accept 
lowerpaying jobs he also said that in real terms average family 
income has not risen in 20 years despite a substantial increase in 
the number of dualincome households 
thats the price our workers and their families are paying for 
voodoo economics dukakis said and thats why were going to 
have a democratic president and vice president in 1989 
dukakis told the grand rapids crowd that he had a sad 
announcement that bush has refused to appear at a debate 
scheduled for sept 14 at the naval academy in annapolis md 
where dukakis has suggested the topics be foreign policy and 
national security 
the vice president said hes not ready yet dukakis said 
after seven and a half years the crowd laughed and 
applauded as dukakis voice trailed off

about 3000 striking municipal 
workers confronted security forces at city hall today after one of 
the largest protest marches in a black township in recent years 
leaders of the march unsuccessfully demanded a meeting with 
sowetos black mayor and white town clerk and police ordered the 
strikers to disperse the strikers then marched back to a church 
three miles away where the march began 
many of the strikers have been fired in the past two weeks 
trucks loaded with black soldiers followed the procession and 
army riflemen were deployed atop the city council chambers a 
police helicopter buzzed low over some of the workers as they began 
the return march and police fired some tear gas 
as they approached city hall marchers chanted slogans in 
support of the outlawed african national congress guerrilla 
movement and unfurled banners denouncing the local government 
protest marches are illegal in south africa unless the 
government gives advance authorization 
the strike which has disrupted trash collection and other 
services in the township of 25 million people began in late june 
when soweto officials said they could not raise pay until a 
widespread rent boycott ended the strike was suspended briefly 
then resumed july 19 
soweto near johannesburg is one of dozens of black townships 
nationwide affected by a rent boycott that has cost local 
administrators more than 220 million in unpaid rent the boycott 
started in a group of townships south of johannesburg in september 
1985 and spread to soweto in june 1986 
the boycott was launched to press a variety of political 
demands including lifting the national state of emergency 
withdrawing security forces from black townships and releasing 
political prisoners 
authorities have tried several tactics including evictions in 
an attempt to break the boycott the latest strategy is to sell at 
auction the homes of boycott participants 
many blacks have low regard for their local officials who are 
widely viewed in the townships as collaborating with the 
whitedominated central government 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate districts schools and health services

a new study says most homeless people are not 
mentally ill or alcoholic but are simply poor and in need of help 
for the general public the stereotype of mental illness is 
there but more and more researchers are finding thats not the 
situation said michael sosin a professor at the university of 
chicagos school of social service administration 
sosin and two associates conducted the twoyear study which was 
released wednesday in 1986 the researchers interviewed 535 
homeless people in chicagos soup kitchens shelters and other 
places where free meals are served 
only about 20 percent of those who were or had been homeless had 
spent time in a hospital for treatment of mental illness sosin 
said 
advocates for the homeless agreed with the studys findings 
the indigent are not mentally ill or alcoholic there are 
families single women with children abused women and runaway 
youth who have been threatened or abused said ronald vander 
kooi a specialist in housing and homelessness for the salvation 
army in chicago 
the only common denominator they have is being without 
shelter he said 
these findings mirror the new face of homelessness in every 
region of the country said robert hayes founder of the 
coalition for the homeless an advocacy group in new york city 
homeless people are not sick they need help finding jobs and 
affordable housing 
sosin said stringent welfare requirements that make it difficult 
for the poor to receive public aid contribute to homelessness he 
said that while it may appear the economy is improving for the 
people at the bottom it isnt getting better 
we were surprised that many of the homeless had at one time 
held workingclass jobs he said most are without shelter 
for the first time and have been on the streets for about six 
months theyre not longtimers

sen paul simon met today with 
south african foreign minister pik botha and the two men said they 
aired their differences over apartheid without yelling at each 
other 
you name the controversial agenda we talked about it 
said simon dill who favors us economic sanctions against 
south africa we had a good frank discussion 
simon who unsuccesfully campaigned for the democratic 
nomination for the presidency this year is on a fiveday 
factfinding tour of south africa 
simon is chairman of the senate foreign relations subcommittee 
on african affairs and will play a major role in deliberations on 
pending legislation to intensify us sanctions against south 
africa 
limited sanctions have been in effect since 1986 
we never yelled at each other botha said after the meeting 
in a johannesburg suburb the senator has put all the difficult 
questions but he has given me the opportunity to put my side 
thats all i can ask 
botha and other south african leaders say they are pursuing 
gradual race reforms at their own pace and will not be pressured by 
sanctions they also say black south africans stand to suffer the 
most from any economic hardships caused by sanctions or foreign 
disinvestment 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate districts schools and health services 
simon predicted wednesday that congress would intensify 
sanctions against south africa unless the government agreed to a 
timetable for dismantling apartheid 
simon came here determined to find justification for 
sanctions the citizen a progovernment daily said in an 
editorial today 
but then americans do tend to have a simplistic should we 
say a simple simon approach to other countries and south africa 
is probably the worst example of this american madness to recreate 
countries in their own image the newspaper said 
simon visited several black townships and met with black leaders 
such as anglican archbishop desmond tutu 
the senators request to meet with imprisoned african national 
congress leader nelson mandela was rejected by the government 
the 70yearold mandela south africas best known black leader 
is in cape towns tygerberg hospital being treated for tuberculosis

art rooney sr who bought the pittsburgh 
steelers in 1932 for 2500 in racetrack winnings and turned the 
team into a national football league powerhouse in the 1970s died 
today he was 87 
at 745 am this morning the chief passed away in his 
sleep with his family at his bedside said dr theodore gelet 
rooneys personal physician 
rooney had been in a coma since monday he was admitted to mercy 
hospital with a stroke aug 17 after becoming dizzy at the teams 
offices at three rivers stadium 
rooneys steelers struggled for 40 years until the 1970s when 
coach chuck noll and quarterback terry bradshaw led the team to 
dominance in the nfl becoming the only club to win four super bowl 
games 
rooneys reputation for honesty sincerity and benevolence won 
him thousands of friends and once prompted supreme court justice 
byron white known as whizzer during his steeler playing days 
in the 1930s to say 
there is no man in the world i respect more than art rooney 
yet the chief as he was known was a shrewd entrepreneur 
and racetrack operator who earned millions before turning over his 
sports empire to his five sons in the late 1960s 
despite his wealth rooney never left the decaying neighborhood 
on pittsburghs north side where he grew up his daily rituals 
mass at a neighborhood church fiveminute walk to the stadium 
cigars and chats with reporters rarely changed 
im a pittsburgh guy rooney would say 
born jan 26 1901 in coultersville pa rooney was one of 
eight children of a saloon keeper who moved his family to 
pittsburgh in 1903 as a youngster he played where three rivers 
stadium now stands 
though his steelers brought him the most fame rooneys first 
love was horse racing his racing holdings once included yonkers 
raceway in new york a dog track in florida the william penn 
racing association at liberty bell near philadelphia and the green 
mountain race track in vermont 
he even blamed his love of racing for the steelers early 
football failures i didnt give it the time i was always going 
to the race track it wasnt until after 1969 a 113 season 
that the steelers luck changed rooneys son dan the teams young 
president hired away baltimore colts assistant coach chuck noll 
to lead the club then in the first round of the college draft 
the steelers took a promising defensive lineman named joe greene 
the steelers firstround pick in 1970 was a brash quarterback 
named terry bradshaw who threw just six touchdown passes and 24 
interceptions that season 
when i was getting a lot of heat early on he was the one who 
told me youre going to be great dont worry about what those 
guys are saying bradshaw said of rooney 
there was no other owner like him bradshaw said he was 
an original he was a northern dancer a joe namath one of a 
kind 
the team went on to win super bowls in 1974 1975 1978 and 1979 
and were hailed as the team of the decade 
rooney one of pittsburghs finest athletes played football 
against jim thorpe baseball against negro league greats satchel 
page and josh gibson and was a superior boxer asked to represent 
the united states in the 1920 olympics 
he is survived by his sons dan the steelers president art 
jr a vice president and former scouting director and pat tim 
and john who are involved in various familyrelated businesses

democratic presidential candidate michael 
dukakis complained today about recent accusations by republicans 
against him and his wife saying the charges are becoming a 
distraction to the campaign 
speaking at a roundtable discussion with local reporters 
dukakis said he and his wife kitty are having to deny 
nonexistent facts 
i think theres a pattern here he said raising his hand 
above his head i hope to keep a high place 
on wednesday the democrats campaign issued a statement saying 
that a suggestion by idaho republican sen steve symms that mrs 
dukakis had burned an american flag is totally false and beneath 
contempt 
symms comment was the third time in a few days that prominent 
republicans have aired allegations that the democrats have rebutted 
swiftly 
the allegations come at a time when republicans are struggling 
to shift the campaign focus away from gop vice presidential nominee 
dan quayle and questions about his vietnamera service in the 
national guard 
in an interview tuesday with a radio station in blackfoot 
idaho symms raised the allegation that mrs dukakis burned the 
flag during an antiwar demonstration in the 1960s 
as ive been told i havent seen this but i heard that there 
are pictures around that will surface before the elections are over 
of mrs dukakis burning the american flag while she was an antiwar 
demonstrator during the 60s symms said 
but paul costello an aide to mrs dukakis issued a denial 
wednesday that read 
senator symms statement about mrs dukakis is totally false 
and beneath contempt mrs dukakis believes that the american flag 
is a symbol of our nations commitment to freedom and she respects 
everything for which it stands 
the suggestion that mrs dukakis had burned a flag was 
absolutely false costello said adding that while she opposed 
the vietnam war she could not recall ever participating in 
antiwar protests 
dukakis aides twice called back to heap abuse on symms 
i guess the republicans are doing the limbo to see how low 
they can go costello said 
dukakis aide mark gearan added senator symms should be 
especially careful with rumors 
the other incidents 
on sunday in an appearance on abcs this week with david 
brinkley new hampshire gov john sununu referred to a report i 
saw in the press that allegedly said democratic vice presidential 
candidate lloyd bentsen had run to get his son admitted to a 
special slot in a national guard unit 
bentsens son denied the allegation and said he enlisted in the 
texas national guard in 1968 after personally contacting the 
commander of the unit he wanted to join he was wrong 
absolutely categorically wrong lloyd m bentsen iii said of 
sununus comment 
on monday new york rep gerald solomon the senior republican 
on the veterans affairs committee called reporters to talk about 
dukakis draft deferments i just want to point out that dukakis 
received his first of three educational deferments eight months 
before the korean war ended solomon said in chicago my point 
is not to point fingers at dukakis because what he did was legal 
but he avoided combat by using his education deferments theres 
nothing wrong with what he did because it was allowed 
dukakis swiftly denied any suggestion that he had used college 
deferments to avoid combat in the korean war saying i served my 
country proudly 
dukakis attended swarthmore college from 19511955 requesting 
and receiving draft deferments in 1952 1953 and 1954 he said he 
went to his draft board with several weeks of school left and asked 
to be drafted immediately he spent slightly less than two years in 
the army including 16 months as part of a united nations 
contingent assigned to the demilitarized zone in korea after the 
fighting ended

historic shopping district killed one person and injured 29 before 
firemen brought it under control 10 hours after it began in a 19th 
century department store 
maj anibal matos silveira the official coordinating more than 
800 firemen at the scene told reporters that the chiado shopping 
district would continue to smolder for another day

soldiers in burundi shot to death 
hundreds of hutu tribesmen and dropped firebombs on villages after 
hutus burned and hacked hundreds of rival tribesmen to death 
refugees say 
the hutu refugees are pouring into rwanda from neighboring 
burundi where ethnic warfare with the rival tutsi tribe has killed 
at least 5000 people and sent more than 40000 fleeing for their 
lives across the border 
nearly two weeks after the flareup in a centuriesold tribal 
feud between the majority hutu and dominant tutsi refugees from 
burundi are arriving at the rate of 2000 a day into rwanda 
africas most densely populated country 
were trying to help them but they are overwhelming us 
fredric karangwa governor of this province said wednesday 
the influx of refugees all hutu began aug 15 the refugees 
say that a day earlier hutus turned on tutsi tribesmen in two 
northern communes hacking hundreds to death with machetes and 
burning others in huts 
none of the refugees admitted involvement in the slaughter and 
it was not known what prompted the massacre 
refugees said the tutsidominated army sent north as 
peacemakers turned into executioners when they arrived and found 
the carnage against their brethren 
the soldiers were rounding up hutus and shooting them 
refugees said they are collecting them into groups taking them 
inside houses closing the doors and windows and then shooting 
the burundi government denied the allegations and blamed the 
bloodshed on exiled hutus who infiltrated the tiny central african 
nation but many of the refugees in rwanda have knife slashes 
bullet or shrapnel wounds and burns 
the refugees most of them peasant farmers said government 
helicopters dropped firebombs on fleeing villagers 
the short stocky hutu account for 84 percent of burundis 5 
million people but the tall lanky tutsi about 15 percent of the 
population control the military and the government 
about 8000 people were crammed into three camps in this section 
of southern rwanda most were camped on hills overlooking a 
marshland and the akanyaru river the route to safety for fleeing 
burundians 
in a local clinic a doctor and several nurses said they treated

republican presidential nominee george bush says 
democrat michael dukakis was looking for a reason to veto a 
bill permitting classroom recitations of the pledge of allegiance 
pushing what chief of staff craig fuller called a winning 
issue for us bush jumped on dukakis on wednesday for vetoing a 
1977 massachusetts bill that would have required teachers to lead 
children in saying the pledge 
i would have signed that bill the vice president with 
president reagan on the stage told some 3000 republicans packed 
into a los angeles hotel rally replete with celebrities and red 
white and blue balloons 
the attorney general of massachusetts jumped to the defense of 
dukakis today telling a television interviewer that the bill 
dukakis vetoed would have imposed criminal penalties on teachers 
who declined to lead their classes in the pledge even if they did 
so because of their religious convictions 
attorney general james shannon a dukakis supporter also said 
on abcs good morning america that in the last decade the 
states governors have obeyed all 25 advisory opinions the 
massachusetts supreme court has issued on pending legislation 
he did what he should have done under our system shannon 
said we have a constitutional system and he took an oath to 
uphold the constitution 
bush and reagan rarely seen together did a political tapdance 
on the massachusetts democratic governor who is trying to recapture 
the white house after nearly eight years of republican rule 
bush flew to his adopted home state of texas afterward and the 
vice president planned campaign appearances in san antonio 
longview and dallas over the next three days 
bush had republican national convention delegates in new orleans 
join him in reciting the pledge of allegiance as he concluded his 
nomination acceptance speech a week ago 
vice presidential aides at the time would not say why bush had 
ended his speech in this unusual fashion although media consultant 
roger ailes barked to a reporter thats the way he lives 
now the bush campaign leadership thinks it has found an issue 
for the vice president to seize upon in fact bush concluded a 
campaign rally monday in spokane wash with the pledge of 
allegiance 
dukakis told reporters tuesday he says the pledge of allegiance 
himself and would urge children to do so but said the question 
before him was whether a governor or any other chief executive 
could sign into law a bill they knew to be constitutionally 
defective because of previous court rulings 
if the vice president is saying hed sign an unconstitutional 
bill then in my judgment hes not fit to hold the office 
dukakis said tuesday 
striking back bush said he would sign such a bill and let the 
supreme court wrestle with the constitutional question 
bush said that gov jim thompson rill had faced a similar 
piece of legislation and had signed it 
lets face it my opponent was looking for a reason not to 
sign that bill he said i would have to look for a reason to 
sign that legislation 
bush said it was hard for me to imagine that the framers of 
the constitution would have considered it a violation of anyones 
constitutional rights to be present for a recitation of the pledge 
of allegiance 
i just dont believe that was their concept when they wrote 
the constitution for our great country he said 
the sponsors of the reaganbush show had lined up an allstar 
cast of celebrities to serve as warmups including comedian bob 
hope actress cheryl ladd actor charlton heston and singers 
tiffany and pat boone 
reagan addressed directly for the first time a question that has 
hovered about bush ever since he made his presidential ambitions 
known his reputation for having failed to make his presence known 
as vice president 
i once said that he is a great vice president reagan said 
but i know and ive seen that it didnt come easily 
george bush is a man of action a man accustomed to 
command he said the vice presidency doesnt fit easily on 
such a man but george bush is also a patriot and so he made it 
fit 
reagan said that day in day out i have sought george bushs 
counsel from the very first day of our administration no one 
has been closer to my side and has contributed more to our 
successes

while in the air force following his naval career 
the address however had been crossed out and return to 
sender stamped on the envelope 
dina martin of the navy liaison office could confirm only that 
the package had come from her office but not why nor did she know 
where the items had been for the past 32 years 
we dont send out anything unless there is a request for it 
ms martin said hume however said hes hasnt talked to the navy 
since 1955 
that may change 
he said hes still waiting for the purple heart and a good 
conduct medal from the navy and the air force

riot police crushed strikes at three 
southern coal mines miners said today other strikes continued 
along the baltic seacoast but appeared to falter at a major steel 
mill activists said 
there were conflicting reports on the status of the strike at 
the lenin shipyard in gdansk where indirect talks between the 
government and solidarity leader lech walesa were reportedly under 
way 
strike spokesman bogdan olszewski said walesa and 1300 
supporters spent wednesday night at the strikebound shipyard but 
state radio estimated only a few hundred people were on strike at 
the shipyard 
the gdansk port the countrys busiest remained shut down said 
reporters who visited it today the government had claimed part of 
the port had reopened 
gdansks port director also issued an ultimatum that dockworkers 
would be fired unless they signed statements that they are not on 
strike by thursday afternoon state radio said but strikers were 
ignoring the appeal 
a prominent roman catholic intellectual andrzej stelmachowski 
met with walesa today as an intermediary to get talks started in 
the strikes said adam michnik an adviser to walesa 
stelmachowski met twice with senior government officials before 
coming to gdansk and his visit to the shipyard was approved 
michnik said but it was unclear if he carried any message from the 
authorities for the strikers 
the nineday wave of strikes is the most serious to confront 
communist authorities since solidarity was crushed in 1981 the 
strikers are demanding legalization of the independent union 
federation higher wages and better working conditions 
activists said strikes continued at seven mines in the coalrich 
southern region of silesia and in the baltic port of szczecin 
at the nowa huta steel mill outside krakow a strike continued 
but had weakened since wednesday when about 1000 employees 
stopped work said maciej mach an activist at the plant nowa 
huta which has 30000 employees was the scene of a major strike 
in may during the last wave of labor unrest a police raid ended 
the previous stoppage 
police completely cleared strikers from the borynia mine in 
jastrzebie and the morcinek mine in nearby koszyce during the 
night according to workers from both mines all strikers were 
evicted from the nearby moszczenica mine except 40 who managed to 
elude police and descended into the mine shaft with bread and 
lanterns witnesses said 
the staterun news agency pap in a brief dispatch said miners 
left the mine at morcinek and also reported the strike ending 
at borynia it did not mention the moszczenica mine 
i was convinced the police would just try to intimidate us and 
not rush us but it didnt turn out that way said francinek 
cichon a member of the morcinek strike committee 
he said police detained andrzej andrzejczak leader of the 
morcinek strike committee and beat at least six men at the borynia 
mine and an unspecified number at the morcinek mine he said none 
required hospitalization 
the raid at the borynia mine began shortly after a column of 
about 100 police vehicles entered jastrzebie cichon said 
one striker said at least 30 vehicles blocked the mines main 
gate the miners then linked arms sat down and began to sing 
hymns said the man who refused to give his name 
riot troops ordered strikers to leave but the miners did not 
budge until the troopers began to drag them out by their clothes 
the miner said police herded men into waiting buses and drove them 
home he said management told men to return to work friday 
government spokesman ryszard straus said all but a few strikers 
left the moszczenica mine and that the mine was working he said 
about 20 strikers were still inside 
no action was taken at three other mines on strike in jastrzebie 
the july manifesto 30 years of peoples poland and the 
jastrzebie mine activists said before the raids labor leaders 
said the docks shipyards and 10 coal mines were occupied by 
strikers pap said eight mines were affected 
the strikes which began with a walkout at the july manifesto 
mine have idled at least 100000 workers at more than 20 
enterprises 
strikes in gdansk closed the last key division of polands 
busiest waterfront tons of highgrade export coal sat in rail cars 
at the bulkloading terminal idle since monday 
riot police sealed off strikebound enterprises including the

school lunches are improving but many still 
contain too much fat at least partly because the agriculture 
department is ignoring its own dietary recommendations a nutrition 
group said today 
the school lunch program is run more as an agriculture support 
program rather than as a nutrition program said ellen haas 
executive director of public voice for food and health policy 
she said the department issued dietary guidelines in 1980 but 
has done little to see that they are followed in the 37 billion 
national school lunch program serving some 27 million children 
many of the foods provided to schools under the commodity 
purchase program compound the problem because they are high in fat 
haas said 
public voice released a list of traditional menus heavy on fried 
food mashed potatoes and sweet deserts and compared that to some 
school districts that are serving healthfully modified menus 
that include baked chicken breasts raw vegetables fresh fruit 
lowfat milk and salad dressings and homemade whole wheat baked 
goods 
singled out for particular praise was the denver school 
districts main course of baked potato topped with chili a 
healthful variation on the chilitopped hot dog favored by other 
districts 
haas said we just dont buy the idea that kids wont eat 
healthy foods and said the trick is to teach them good eating 
habits when theyre in the lower grades without access to fast 
food at lunchtime 
our young children are a captive audience we have an 
opportunity here she said were trying to build healthy 
eating behavior 
the department firmly supports the idea that school lunches 
should be consistent with the dietary guidelines said usdas 
suzanne s harris deputy assistant secretary for food and consumer 
services 
however scientific evidence does not support setting absolute 
daily intake levels of sugar fat or sodium for children she 
said in a statement nutrition strategies warranted for the 
general adult population may actually be harmful to children 
particularly lowincome children during periods of growth and 
development 
she said arbitrary decisions to reduce fat may significantly 
reduce calorie content diets very low in fat must be compensated 
with large amounts of carbohydrate often requiring more food than a 
child can eat 
public voice made a number of recommendations among them 
the agriculture department should set specific limits on the 
amounts of fat sodium and sugar permitted in school lunches the 
department says there is no scientific consensus on such levels for 
children but public voice disagrees 
the department should separate the lunch program from the 
commodity program and seek out higherfiber food items for 
distribution to schools 
the department should establish a national food service 
management institute to train and help districts serve better 
quality lunches the department said it has authorized 50000 to 
study the feasibility of setting up such a program in mississippi 
a report to congress is due this fall 
the department should reinstitute a ban on the sale of snack 
foods on school grounds currently sales are banned only in 
cafeterias or during meal periods the department citing court 
cases says congress would have to pass a specific law if more 
stringent federal controls are desired

gov michael dukakis did the right thing when he 
vetoed a clearly unconstitutional 1977 massachusetts law 
imposing criminal penalties on teachers who failed to lead their 
classes in the pledge of allegiance state attorney general james 
shannon said today 
but deborah steelman domestic policy director for george bushs 
republican presidential campaign said criminal penalties are 
not the issue whats at issue here was leadership 
shannon a supporter of dukakis democratic presidential bid 
said on abcs good morning america that the legislation 
required criminal penalties against teachers who refused to lead 
their classes in the pledge even if their own religious 
convictions said they shouldnt do that 
in vetoing the bill dukakis obeyed an advisory opinion from the 
massachusetts supreme court that the legislation was 
unconstitutional the states governors have been given about 25 
advisory opinions by the high court on legislation in recent years 
shannon said 
never once with all those different governors has any 
governor signed into law in massachusetts a bill which our states 
highest court said was unconstitutional he said 
since he took an oath of office to uphold the constitution he 
had an opinion from our states highest court that that law was 
unconstitutional and he did the only thing that he could do under 
the circumstances shannon said of dukakis 
on the same program steelman said dukakis was not bound by the 
courts advice 
if he wanted to test this issue all he had to do was sign the 
bill into law and press his case to the national supreme court 
whats at issue here is leadership whether youve got a 
candidate who will stand up for the majority of americans beliefs 
or whether youve got a candidate who wont even stand up for his 
own beliefs 
the veto was overriden by the legislature and the law went on 
the books but it has never been enforced and its constitutionality 
has not been challenged 
the court said the bill was unconstitutional because the state 
cannot force citizens to take an oath that may controvert their 
religious beliefs

democrat michael dukakis today called criminal reagan 
administration dealings with panama strongman manuel antonio 
noriega while republican vice presidential candidate dan quayle 
prepared for a new round of questions about his military and 
personal life 
for years while general noriega of panama was actively 
involved in the drug business we were actively in business with 
general noreiga dukakis said in cleveland that my friends 
is criminal 
he chided president reagan for refusing to seek the help of 
latin and central american leaders to curb drug trafficking and 
said if elected he would use more foreign aid to assist those 
countries in eradicating drug crops and protecting public officials 
whose lives are endangered by drug cartels 
how can we ask our kids to say no to drugs here at home when 
we have an administration thats been in bed with general 
noriega dukakis asked 
quayle scheduled a late afternoon news conference after several 
days of avoiding reporters questions about his entry into the 
national guard during the height of the vietnam war and his 
relationship with a female lobbyist 
wednesday night quayle countered questions about his military 
record with thrusts against dukakis defense policies he called it 
one of the worst false impressions that dukakis supported a 
strong defense 
but democratic running mate lloyd bentsen came to dukakis 
defense today the simple truth is this gov dukakis is a 
veteran a patriot and an advocate of american strength and 
steadiness bentsen said in remarks prepared for the veterans of 
foreign wars convention in chicago he can be trusted as a 
defender of american security and as a champion of american 
values 
bentsen also bragged of his own record as a world war ii bomber 
pilot in a contrast to his gop rivals stint in the guard 
i have been there and i yield to no person or party in my 
passion for freedom he said 
the counterchanges occurred against the backdrop of wrangling 
over when dukakis and vice president george bush would debate and 
polls showing that bushs postconvention lead was narrowing 
quayle fared well in one of those surveys which showed support 
for his selection as the republican vice presidential nominee and 
his service record during the vietnam war 
quayle saying i can take the heat told an audience of 
1000 current and former national guard members in st louis he was 
proud of his guard service quayle has been dogged since his 
nomination last week with allegations that he pulled strings to get 
into the guard and avoid duty in vietnam he kept the media at bay 
wednesday and did not answer questions 
dukakis touring the industrial states of michigan ohio and 
pennsylvania after picking up the endorsement of the aflcio 
leadership in washington took aim at the reagan administrations 
claims to seven years of growth and prosperity 
conceding that more americans are working today than at any time 
in history he said average family income has remained stagnant 
ive met too many people who have accepted jobs over the last 
eight years that pay a lot less than their old jobs he said in 
grand rapids mich ive met too many couples who are working 
harder at two jobs just to stay in place 
the aflcio has 14 million members and president lane kirkland 
said wednesday the endorsement should be worth a net of 25 million 
votes for dukakis 
dukakis repeatedly criticized by republicans as being soft on 
defense was assaulted on that front wednesday by quayle and reagan 
one of the worst false impressions michael dukakis has put 
forward is the idea that he stands for a strong national defense 
quayle told the guard audience maybe he sincerely believes that 
but he stands for the opposite and that position has been clouded 
over by the distractions of the last few days 
in los angeles reagan told a rally that quayle a member of the 
senate armed services committee has more experience dealing with 
national security affairs than the head of the other ticket 
reagan also praised bush as a man of action accustomed to 
command 
the vice presidency doesnt fit easily on such a man reagan 
said but george bush is also a patriot and so he made it fit 
bush jumped on dukakis on wednesday for vetoing a 1977 
massachusetts bill that would have required teachers to lead 
children in saying the pledge 
i would have signed that bill and let the supreme court 
wrestle with the constitutional question bush said in a joint 
appearance with reagan 
courts have ruled such laws to be unconstitutional 
if the vice president is saying hed sign an unconstitutional 
bill then in my judgment hes not fit to hold the office 
dukakis said tuesday 
two polls wednesday indicated that the surge bush received 
during last weeks republican national convention already was 
dissipating an nbcwall street journal survey put the vice 
presidents margin as 4439 while a harris survey pegged it at 
4947 both leads were within the margin of error of three 
percentage points indicating the race is a dead heat 
in the nbcjournal poll 64 percent said quayles military 
record should not be an issue and 27 percent said it should also 
42 percent of registered voters approved of quayle as the gop vice 
presidential nominee 27 percent disapproved and 30 percent were 
not sure 
the two campaigns sparred over the timing of campaign debates 
for the fall with dukakis aide paul brountas saying it was 
inexcusable for bush to decline dates of sept 8 and 14 
established by organizations interested in staging the 
confrontations bush campaign chief james baker said it is 
unlikely that a debate can occur prior to sept 20 
aides to the two candidates are expected to open facetoface 
negotiations on debates next week in washington 
the nbcjournal poll was conducted saturday through monday among 
1762 registered voters the harris poll friday through monday 
among 1310 likely voters

jailed black leader nelson 
mandela may be moved soon from the hospital where he has been 
treated for tuberculosis a cabinet minister indicated today 
information minister stoffel van der merwe declined to say 
whether mandela would go back to pollsmoor prison where he has 
been serving a life sentence for plotting an antigovernment 
sabotage campaign 
the african national congress leader jailed since 1962 was 
moved from pollsmoor to nearby tygerberg hospital on aug 12 
doctors say he is expected to recover fully after a recuperation 
period of about five months 
hospitals are for people that are in need of immediate 
treatment van der merwe said if he is not in need of 
immediate treatment then it becomes logical to move him somewhere 
else whether inside pollsmoor or outside pollsmoor is another 
question 
asked if mandela was still in need of immediate care van der 
merwe replied not as immediate as before 
the government has said it is seriously considering the 
possibility of freeing mandela whom many blacks consider their 
leader some officials have suggested that mandela after he is 
discharged from tygerberg hospital would be moved to a private 
clinic and kept there under custody while the government continues 
to assess the consequences of his possible relesase 
about 60 black women from an antiapartheid organization came to 
tygerberg today with flowers for mandela they left the flowers at 
a reception desk then left the hospital dancing and chanting 
promandela slogans 
the african national congress is the major guerrilla group 
fighting the whitedominated government and its system of apartheid 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate districts schools and health services

about 3000 evacuated residents spent a second 
day away from their homes today awaiting the results of soil and 
water tests to see whether a pcb fire caused longterm 
contamination of their community 
we dont know if we and our homes have been contaminated 
said louis charbonneau one of 150 frustrated evacuees from 
suburban st basilelegrand being sheltered in a local school 
my wife is pregnant what tells us that her pregnancy wont be 
affected 
the first test results were to be made public later today but 
there was no guarantee the residents would be allowed back into 
their homes most were staying with friends and relatives 
the fire burned overnight tuesday at a depot storing 23400 
gallons of oil tainted with pcbs or polychlorinated biphenyls the 
flames sent a toxic black cloud over a 55 square mile area no one 
was seriously injured but at least 50 were treated for lung and 
skin irritation 
quebec agriculture minister michel page estimated that 400 cows 
could have been contaminated as well as hundreds of acres of 
farmland 
authorities sealed off the normally tranquil suburb 15 miles 
east of montreal and told residents not to eat fruit or vegetables 
from their gardens drink tap water or use backyard pools until 
tests were completed 
pcbs are suspected of causing cancer and production of the 
chemical is banned but supplies formerly used to cool 
hydroelectric transformers are stored at depots throughout the 
province which has no facility capable of neutralizing or 
destroying the chemicals 
some of the 3000 residents who were whisked from their homes 
hired a lawyer on wednesday to give legal clout to their anger over 
the presence of potentially deadly chemicals in their neighborhood 
clearly theyre looking at a terribly serious type of damage 
from the health economic commercial points of view said 
montreal lawyer irwin liebman 
dr gaetan carrier of de maisonneuverosemont hospital in 
montreal said exposure to pcbs could cause cancers liver 
disorders skin rashes birth defects and spontaneous abortions 
quebec premier robert bourassa and environment minister clifford 
lincoln flew to st basile on wednesday to face hostile residents 
who have lobbied for years to have the pcb dump removed 
bourassa said the incident was serious but not dramatic and 
promised compensation to the victims 
but residents were not mollified get that damned stuff out of 
here shouted charbonneau to cheers and applause from the crowd 
you have turned our town into the garbage can of the province 
quebec fire commissioner cyrille delage directing an inquiry 
into the fire said the warehouses fire and burglar alarm didnt 
work 
but he said the depots owner north central dynamics inc had 
conformed with safety regulations introduced by his department in 
1985 for storing pcbs 
residents have charged however that the lack of a fence 
sprinkler system and security guard made the site a time bomb 
lincoln said he intends to go after the company whose major 
shareholder is former environment canada employee marc levy 
no cause of the fire has been determined but officials were 
considering the possibility of arson because of the manner in which 
the warehouse exploded and blazed 
only about 5720 gallons of the pcbcontaminated oil burned 
leaving the problem of how to dispose of the remainder officials 
said

a musical spoof of sen dan quayles 
national guard service has been banned from the radio station where 
it first aired the station manager said today 
the parody i spent the war in indiana was ruled offlimits 
by wfbqs manager chris wheat after a close vote by listeners on 
whether to continue playing the song 
the spoof cowritten by station disc jockey tom griswold and 
local song writer rickey ridell first aired monday it was pulled 
by wheat the next day after listener complaints wheat then asked 
listeners to vote on whether they wanted to keep hearing it 
the song spoofs quayles alleged use of family influence to get 
into the guard in 1969 while others were sent to vietnam 
the final tally of the 24hour callin vote was 5182 votes for 
the station to continue playing it and 4676 votes against playing 
it 
wheat said the 500vote margin was inconclusive and he feared 
the station would alienate half its listeners if the song continued 
quayle has not been accused of being a draft dodger wheat 
said there has been no proof of that there was enough in the 
song that we felt it was in our best interest to discontinue it 
wheat said he believes griswold and his sidekick disc jockey 
bob kevoian understand that we wanted to protect the radio 
station as a whole and that it wasnt going to be a yesno 
blackorwhite vote the vote was close and it led me to believe 
that to continue playing it would be a detriment to the station 
griswold said he was considering releasing the song on an 
inexpensive cassette with proceeds from sales going to the vietnam 
veterans of america organization

smugglers used stolen or falsified export documents 
to ship more than 120000 skins of a protected species of alligator 
into japan in the past seven months a wildlife protection 
organization said thursday 
traffic japan the wildlife trade monitoring group of the world 
wide fund for nature said the smugglers shipped south american 
caiman skins by a complex route involving at least seven south 
american and asian countries 
at least 46 tons of the skins from more than 120000 alligators 
entered japan in the first seven months of this year through 
thailand alone the group said 
it said it believed the skins were part of a larger shipment 
that was loaded onto asianbound ships off the coast of uruguay at 
the end of last year 
the declared customs value of the skins was about 32 million 
but retail value would be four to five times more spokeswoman 
cecila song said the skins are used in japan mainly for belts and 
watchbands 
permits are required for exporting south american caiman skins 
under the convention on international trade in endangered species 
an international treaty regulating trade in protected plants and 
animals ms song said 
japanese officials allowed the shipments to enter the country 
without proper verification of the export documents the group said 
it said an eightmonth investigation revealed a serious lapse of 
treaty administration in thailand and japan 
the group said it began its investigation when japanese customs 
data showed a sudden increase in imports of alligator skins from 
thailand 
it said thai authorities confirmed that stolen thai documents 
were used for a shipment of 15000 caiman skins to japan and that 
the government of colombia disputed documents issued in singapore 
that identified colombia as the source of 35000 more skins 
an estimated 200000 caiman skins many poached in brazil were 
loaded on ships off uruguay in 1987 after japan initially refused 
to allow their entry because of insufficient documentation the 
skins were taken to south korea and taiwan which are not members 
of the convention and to singapore the group said 
but because japan was likely to scrutinize imports of skins from 
those countries they were moved to thailand which is a member of 
the convention the group said 
it said japans ministry of international trade and industry 
responded to evidence of illegal caiman trade by beginning a new 
voluntary check system on all imports of the skins ministry 
officials were not available thursday night for comment

three new opinion polls have found narrow leads 
for george bush in the presidential race although voters preferred 
the democratic vice presidential nominee to bushs own running 
mate sen dan quayle 
bushs leads five points in one poll released wednesday two 
points in two others fell within their margins of sampling error 
the race was 44 percent to 39 percent in an nbc newswall street 
journal poll 4947 in a harris survey 4846 in an abc 
newswashington post poll 
the polls showed increases in bushs popularity after the 
republican national convention in new orleans last week his 
opponent michael dukakis had led by as many as 18 points after 
the democratic convention 
however some pollsters have suggested that bushs 
postconvention rebound was cut short by attention on questions of 
whether quayle used his wealthy familys influence to avoid the 
draft during the vietnam war 
pollster louis harris said he believed the issue had blunted 
and badly eroded bushs boost but jeff alderman pollster for 
abc news said he had not seen statistical evidence that quayle had 
damaged bushs standing and 64 percent in the nbcjournal poll 
said quayles military record should not be an issue in the 
campaign 
in harris poll sen lloyd bentsen dukakis running mate 
outpolled quayle by 5740 when voters were asked their preference 
for vice president alone fiftytwo percent rated bushs choice of 
quayle as only fair or poor compared with 44 percent who 
said excellent or pretty good 
quayle fared better in another measure used in the nbcjournal 
poll fortythree percent approved of him as the gop vice 
presidential nominee while 27 percent disapproved and 30 percent 
said they were not sure 
the nbcjournal poll was conducted saturday through monday among 
1762 registered voters the harris poll friday through monday 
among 1310 likely voters both had error margins of plus or minus 
three points 
the abcpost poll was conducted aug 17 through tuesday among 
1123 likely voters with a margin of error of plus or minus four 
points 
earlier this week bush led by six points in a cbs news poll 
conducted friday through monday and four points in a gallup poll 
done the same time those spreads also fell within the threepoint 
margins of sampling error 
another gallup poll done on the last day of the convention 
thursday and on friday found bush leading by nine points 
slightly beyond the fourpoint error margin of that survey

a judge today spared maria desillers a jail 
sentence for contempt of court ruling she could not be ordered to 
surrender records and items bought with donations for her late son 
ronnies liver transplant 
dade circuit judge francis christie said surrendering the items 
would tend to incriminate her in parallel criminal 
investigations 
ms desillers only smiled slightly as the judge made the 
annoncement 
im very happy people have forgotten what ronnie went 
through she said outside the courtroom 
ronnie 7 died in april 1987 while awaiting a fourth transplant 
at childrens hospital of pittsburgh 
im just gratified said her attorney roy black who had 
repeatedly raised the issue of selfincrimination during the 
twoday contempt hearing 
michael dribin the attorney for the courtappointed curator 
refused to comment on the ruling 
the hearing was to determine if ms desillers should be jailed 
for her failure to turn over financial records and surrender 
jewelry clothes furniture and other items she bought with some of 
the 690000 donated for her sons unsuccessful operations 
as the hearing ended however it was ms desillers boyfriend 
jose castillo who was taken into custody by metrodade police 
castillo had been sitting supportively behnd ms desillers during 
the proceedings 
police spokesman victor fernandez said castillo had pawned a 
stolen computer at the same shop he also pawned items allegedly 
bought by ms desillers with donations 
earlier during the hearing diana munez told the court she gave 
maria desillers 900 in cash for her personal use 
i imagined she would have some need i put it in purse said 
munez one of six witnesses who said their contributions were for 
both ronnie and his mother 
another witness maria garcia said she gave 50 for ronnie and 
gave other cash to his mother for whatever she needed 
in closing arguments black said his client who is also under 
criminal investigation has a right against selfincrimination 
the court i know has the power to put her in jail and a lot 
of people would applaud black said i just ask the court to 
exercise its discretion and common sense 
but dribin said the matter was clear 
whats at issue is the integrity of the legal system dribin 
said ms desillers was the custodian of those funds she has a 
resonsibility to account for them 
lawyers handling the estate of the boy are trying to show 
shes a greedy uncaring person and thats not so black said 
christie had ruled that the thousands of donations for ronnie 
belong in a trust to pay the boys outstanding medical bills or to 
help sick needy children 
the judge had repeatedly ordered ms desillers to give to 
courtappointed estate curator karen gievers the financial records 
and items allegedly bought with about 200000 in donations 
ms desillers this month surrendered her bmw car but nothing 
else and ms gievers has asked the judge to hold her in contempt 
ronnies plight was widely publicized after more than 4000 
gathered for him by schoolmates was stolen from a classroom closet 
and donations began pouring in from around the world 
among donations received were 1000 from president reagan and 
200000 from miami beach industrialist victor posner 
ms desillers gave childrens hospital a deposit but has refused 
to pay the remaining 262000 medical bill claiming that her son 
received improper care

defense lawyers today asked the navy to 
dismiss a derelictionofduty charge against a lieutenant who 
sought a courtmartial in an effort to clear his name in the 
training death of a rescueschool recruit 
the military judge cmdr newell d krogmann made no immediate 
decision on that request 
he did however grant a defense motion for vice adm nr 
thunman who convened the courtmartial to be called as a witness 
to answer questions about whether he might be biased against lt 
thomas a torchia 32 of princeton ill 
the trial was then recessed while lawyers met with the judge to 
discuss procedural matters 
in asking for the courtmartial torchia put his navy career on 
the line since he was offered unspecified nonjudicial punishment 
that would have been less severe than what he faces if convicted at 
the courtmartial 
testimony at a june investigative hearing indicated airman 
recruit lee mirecki 19 of appleton wis was literally scared to 
death when navy rescue swimmer instructors allegedly pushed him 
back into a pool and held his head underwater after he had panicked 
and climbed out during a drill 
mirecki had a phobia about being pulled under water which 
triggered heart failure followed by drowning at pensacola naval air 
station a pathologist testified 
torchia 32 was formerly in charge of the navy rescue swimmer 
school 
a guilty verdict could bring him up to three months of 
confinement loss of pay and a formal reprimand that could made 
advancement in the navy extremely difficult 
but by opting for a trial he has an opportunity to exonerate 
himself 
the navy accuses torchia of negligently failing to ensure that 
mirecki was permitted to drop out of the voluntary course during a 
dangerous training exercise although he knew the recruit had tried 
to drop out and was afraid of the water 
torchia was in his office overlooking the pool talking on the 
telephone at the time of mireckis death witnesses said 
he is one of two navy men facing courtsmartial as a result of 
mireckis death scheduled for trial monday is petty officer 2nd 
class michael w combe 26 charged with the more serious counts of 
involuntary manslaughter battery and conspiracy to commit battery 
combe is accused of holding mirecki underwater if convicted he 
could be dishonorably discharged and sentenced to prison for more 
than three years he was denied the option of accepting less severe 
nonjudicial punishment 
four other instructors all petty officers accepted 
nonjudicial punishment that included reductions in rank for two of 
them and fines 
mirecki died during a drill known as sharks and daisies in 
which instructors playing the role of panicked aircrash 
survivors would randomly grab trainees in head holds 
students were supposed to pull the instructors under to break 
their grip then put them in rescue holds and tow them to the side 
of the pool 
after mirecki was forced back into the pool combe put a head 
hold on him according to investigative testimony witnesses 
differed on whether mirecki collapsed while in the instructors 
grasp or extricated himself and collapsed while towing combe

a tropical depression blamed for 
three deaths in puerto rico began moving over the dominican 
republic and haiti today with more flooding expected forecasters 
said 
the depression was centered about 35 miles westsouthwest of 
santo domingo and was packing winds of 35 mph with stormforce 
gusts according to a 6 am edt advisory by the national hurricane 
center in miami 
the movement over land is the only thing thats keeping this 
from strengthening into a tropical storm said forecaster bob 
case 
the depression moving toward the westnorthwest at 15 mph was 
expected to trigger rainfall totals of 5 to 10 inches in the 
dominican republic where flashflood warnings were in effect 
flashflood warnings remained in effect for puerto rico where 
66 inches of rain were reported over the past 24 hours 
two men and a 12yearold boy were killed in puerto rico in two

1000 miles westnorthwest of the cape verde islands off west 
africa it was moving west at about 17 mph and had sustained winds 
of 35 mph 
as far north as it is now the chances of it getting here are 
pretty slim case said 
depressions are upgraded to tropical storms when their sustained 
winds reach 39 mph and to hurricanes when winds hit 74 mph 
there have been two tropical storms so far in the 1988 atlantic 
ocean hurricane season but neither reached hurricane strength the 
season runs from june 1 to nov 30

the soviet union has taken the first step toward a 
paid foster care program changing a system that for years has 
relied on orphanages as the only official means of supporting 
children without parents 
the communist party newspaper pravda reported thursday on a 
decree from the council of ministers tht laid the groundwork for a 
foster program but was vague on its details 
pravda said that under the program foster parents would be 
recruited to move into newly constructed childrens towns 
where they would be responsible for the rearing of up to 10 
children 
in such childrens settlements apartment houses a school a 
sports center and gardens should be included such settlements will 
be built with local climatic and social conditions taken into 
consideration pravda said 
but the article did not say how much foster parents would be 
compensated give guidelines on who would be considered a foster 
parent or under what circumstances the person would qualify for 
financial support 
over the years some soviets voluntarily have taken parentless 
children into their homes but have received no compensation from 
the state 
if support was forthcoming it usually was in the form of an 
offer of food rationing coupons from the soviet childrens fund a 
charitable organization that was formed only recently 
the decree said foster parents should be given priority 
consideration in booking stateprovided vacation lodging and will 
remain at full pension if they are elderly or retired 
foster parents have to be supported by their respective 
offices and organizations they have to be given places at rest 
houses and santoriums the article said 
for years public discussions on parentless children centered on 
those who were orphaned but lately the official media has 
acknowledged that some children are homeless because of abusive or 
alcoholic parents or an unwed mother unwilling to bear the stigma 
or responsiblity of single parenthood 
officials said three years ago that 300000 children were being 
reared in state orphanages and most were placed there by single 
mothers 
in recent years the media has published reports detailing 
corruption in some orphanages where childrens food is sold on the 
black market and they are improperly clothed and housed 
the council of ministers said authorities will build 30 
childrens towns which appear similar in concept to cluster homes 
in the west and 150 to 200 children will be housed there

republican vice presidential candidate dan 
quayle said today he was tired of talking about the controversy 
surrounding his military record saying ive answered questions 
for seven days now 
the indiana senator said he thought the public also had heard 
enough on the issue 
the american people want to talk about the future i believe 
that theyre getting a little sick and tired of going back twenty 
years he told reporters en route to the missouri state fair 
after avoiding reporters for days quayle made himself available 
several times today and scheduled a late afternoon news conference 
on wednesday quayle depicted himself as an expert on defense 
matters during a speech before a supportive national guard group 
and said he wont run away from the dispute over his own 
military record 
speaking to a uniformed crowd of 1000 current and former guard 
members the republican vice presidential nominee sought to answer 
allegations that he pulled strings to get into the guard and avoid 
duty in vietnam 
i was not seeking special treatment i wasnt looking for 
favors quayle said he said when he joined the guard in 1969 
i had no reason to be ashamed of my service 
and you know what im sure as hell not ashamed of it now 
quayle said as his audience cheered 
quayles speech came after a day in which he was carefully 
shielded from reporters aides acknowledged that they were trying 
to shift the focus away from questions about quayles own military 
record and personal life as he opened his first solo campaign trip 
david prosperi quayles press secretary said the speech was 
intended to deal with the guard question and then go beyond to 
talk about defense and other issues the campaign wanted to stress 
quayle sprinkled his speech with sarcastic remarks about my 
newfound friends in the news media 
i did in fact eat graham crackers as a youngster was very 
partial to superman and dennis the menace comic books and 
traded valentine cards with a beautiful secondgrader named penny 
who lived across the street quayle said in a mock tellall 
moment with the audience 
he said however that the scrutiny is a consequence of his vice 
presidential candidacy and he is prepared to confront that 
its not fun but i knew what i was getting into and i can 
tell you i can take the heat quayle said 
in his speech quayle said he believed democratic presidential 
nominee michael dukakis is enjoying this firestorm because its 
helped distract people from the issues of this campaign 
he attacked dukakis for an antidefense attitude for 
opposing such weapons systems as the strategic defense initiative 
and the mx missile 
one of the worst false impressions michael dukakis has put 
forward is the idea that he stands for a strong national defense 
quayle said maybe he sincerely believes that but he stands for 
the opposite and that position has been clouded over by the 
distractions of the last few days 
quayle had a goodnatured encounter at the lexington ky 
airport with his democratic counterpart sen lloyd bentsen of 
texas who had just warned southern state legislators not to risk 
youthful indiscretion in someone like quayle who might someday 
ascend to the presidency 
quayle ignored reporters questions seeking a response to 
bentsens remarks 
bentsen had noted quayles abrupt aboutface earlier this week 
in which he told a veterans of foreign wars convention that 
youthful indiscretion was to blame for his vote last month 
against elevating the veterans administration to a cabinetlevel 
department

ronald reagan will have been out of office 
for over two years and 80 years old when a library housing his 
papers and recalling his time in office opens on a cactuscovered 
hillside northwest of here if all goes according to plan 
officials originally hoped to make it the first presidential 
library to open while the president it honors was still in office 
but those intentions were scuttled by years of controversy and 
delay 
nonetheless plans are moving now 
the city council of simi valley which must provide water and 
sewer service to the site on a cactuscovered hillside northwest of 
los angeles gave its approval this week 
everything is chugging along pretty nicely said ann rock a 
city council member it looks like were going to go ahead on 
it 
ventura county which must grant a conditional use permit for 
construction will hold an environmental hearing aug 31 
we dont anticipate or see any snail darter incident although 
anything can happen said carl morehouse a staff planner for the 
ventura county government 
the library will be reached by a winding road that will rise 
from an altitude of about 920 feet to 1190 feet above sea level 
the site commands a spectacular view of the countryside and on a 
clear day the peaks of the offshore channel islands in the 
distance 
it will be the ninth presidential library in the national 
archives system and the first west of the rockies the others are 
for herbert hoover at west branch iowa franklin d roosevelt at 
hyde park ny harry s truman in independence mo dwight d 
eisenhower at abilene kan john f kennedy in boston lyndon b 
johnson in austin texas gerald r ford in ann arbor mich and 
jimmy carter in atlanta 
officials of the ronald reagan presidential foundation are 
aiming at breaking ground this fall possibly in september opening 
date is tentatively scheduled for 1991 
plans to have reagans presidential library open while he was 
still in the white house were snagged in a controversy over the 
site 
efforts to locate the library on the campus of stanford 
university in palo alto fell through in april 1987 ran into stiff 
opposition from faculty and city landowners 
fundraising also did not go as rapidly as hoped and not all of 
the currently estimated cost of 45 million has been raised 
officials wont say how much they still need 
even in its new location the project aroused some controversy 
particularly since the part of the 100acre site on which the 
building will stand lies within a greenbelt maintained by a 
decadeold nonbinding agreement among the communities of simi 
valley moorpark and thousand oaks 
the real estate development firm of blakeleyswartz which 
donated the land originally announced plans to build a 300room 
hotel and conference center on 540 acres adjacent to the library 
site 
officials of the three communities told the county they did not 
want the library used as means for further landuse concessions 
on any property within the greenbelt 
so plans for the hotel and conference center have been dropped 
in addition to the switch to a southern california site there 
have been some changes in design 
when the library was to be built at stanford a separate public 
affairs institute was planned now the project has been scaled down 
to just the library with some rooms for conferences and work space 
for reagan when he visits 
the basic missionstyle building designed by architects hugh 
stubbins and associates for the stanford site has been retained for 
the new location an arched colonnade that had been designed to 
harmonize with other stanford buildings was dropped in favor of 
straight columns and wooden beams more typical of mission 
architecture

western european nations must be 
prepared to participate in a joint spy satellite program because of 
increasing work load of american spacecraft an advisory report 
said thursday 
the confidential report by a group of dutch defense experts was 
presented to defense minister willem van eekelen and foreign 
minister hans van den broek 
its main recommendation reflects the netherlands increasing 
efforts to bolster military cooperation in western europe along 
with the regions economic cooperation 
a major result of such cooperation would be a closer involvement 
of france in the defense of western europe although france is a 
member of the atlantic alliance it does not take part in natos 
integrated military command 
a truly joint spy satellite program would be important for a 
number of reasons and the strengthening of the european pillar 
within nato would be one of them a source within the 
netherlands defense establishment told the associated press in a 
thursday interview he spoke in exchange for anonymity 
france italy and spain are developing the helios espionage 
satellite which costs more than 1 billion and is scheduled to be 
launched in 1992 
its far too late for other european nato member nations to 
get a foot in the door of the helios project that began in 1986 
said the dutch source who is familiar with the contents of the 
advisory report 
the report recommended the dutch government participate in 
helios successor believed to become operational somewhere in the 
first decade of the next century according to the source 
at present the dutch armed forces as well as those of most 
other allies are dependent on those american satellite photos that 
the us government allows to be dissiminated the source said 
but we forecast that the work load of the american spy 
satellites will increase sharply in the coming years what with the 
verification work emanating from the inf treaty and in the near 
future possibly a start agreement said the source 
he was referring to the recentlyratified intermediaterange 
nuclear force treaty between the united states and the soviet 
union which eliminates all medium and shorterrange nuclear 
missiles 
in geneva the superpowers are currently engaged in negotiations 
on sharp reductions in their strategic nuclear arsenals talks 
known under their acronym start 
it would be a good thing if the european allies were not too 
dependent on the americans in their intelligencegathering from 
space and launched their joint satellite in the future the 
source said 
and were especially looking at france for such cooperation 
because the french lead in space expertise according to the source 
the reports recommendations which have not yet been adopted as 
official government policy marked another step on the long road 
toward closer european military cooperation a concept strongly 
favored by the dutch 
last year the netherlands lobbied for the formation of a 
western european naval presence in the persian gulf arguing that 
europe has a vital interest in keeping open the areas oil shipping 
lanes 
at the time the dutch were chairing the western european union 
an informal sevennation defense forum including france the 
efforts led to the dispatch of a joint dutchbelgian minesweeping 
force which operated under the umbrella of british warships in the 
gulf

general motors corp on thursday began 
recalling more than 600000 1983 oldsmobiles and buicks to replace 
an emissions control component that may have quit working 
the environmental protection agency said a defective thermal 
vacuum switch causes the cars to exceed federal standards on 
emission of gasoline vapors and carbon monoxide 
gm said the switch which allows fuel vapor to be burned by the 
engine fails because rubber compounds used in its construction 
deteriorate after years of contact with gasoline 
the defective switch has no effect on the operation of the car 
gm said 
the automaker said installation of the new switch would take 
less than one hour the epa estimated the time of repair at 20 
minutes 
the agency said 613582 vehicles all with 5liter engines are 
involved in the recall they are the 1983 oldsmobile cutlass 
supreme cutlass cruiser delta 88 ninetyeight toronado and

democratic vice presidential candidate lloyd 
bentsen booed repeatedly told veterans today that michael dukakis 
can be trusted to maintain the nations defense 
i have been in the crosshairs of the enemies of freedom the 
67yearold former world war ii bomber pilot told a veterans of 
foreign wars convention i have been there and i yield to no 
person or party in my passion for freedom 
republicans bentsen said have behaved as if the flag were a 
partisan and not a personal virtue 
the reagan administration has relied on extreme partisanship 
and overheated campaign rhetoric instead of a patient bipartisan 
approach to national security issues he said in a speech text 
released prior to delivery 
the simple truth is this gov dukakis is a veteran a 
patriot and an advocate of american strength and steadiness 
bentsen said he can be trusted as a defender of american 
security and as a champion of american values 
bentsen was well received personally receiving standing 
ovations when he arrived and when he left but he was interrupted 
by boos four times three times when he mentioned dukakis once 
when he referred to former president carter 
stopped by booing after he said that carter had begun the 
defense buildup he told the crowd pretty hard for some of you 
to accept that 
after the speech bentsen said he thought there had been some 
organized opposition to the speech republicans he said were 
desperate to find an issue 
bentsen cited dukakis emphasis on improving nonnuclear 
weapons maintaining a nuclear deterrent support of the stealth 
bomber and a new submarinelaunched missile dukakis he said 
would manage military spending more effectively 
while praising his running mate bentsen blasted both vice 
president george bush and sen dan quayle rind for supporting 
cuts in veterans health care programs 
while avoiding direct criticism of quayle for serving in the 
national guard during the vietnam war bentsens highlighting of 
his own military record was an indirect swipe 
i think that the breadth of experience that ive had and the 
tests that ive undergone some of the things that happened to me 
early on in combat make you grow up pretty fast the texas 
senator said wednesday in a speech to the southern legislative 
conference a group of state legislators he said included many 
reagan democrats 
he suggested that quayle lacked the maturity needed to lead the 
country a requirement of someone who would be vice president 
bentsens speech today to the veterans of foreign wars 
convention in chicago is three days after vice president george 
bush and quayle addressed the group one of the objectives of 
bentsens speech was to contest the gop contention that the 
democrats are weak on defense campaign aides said 
his speech was drafted with the help of dukakis speechwriters so 
it would be in harmony with an address the massachusetts governor 
plans to deliver in early september before the american legion 
more conservative than dukakis on defense issues bentsen has 
supported aid to the nicaraguan contra rebels the mx missile and 
the b1 bomber dukakis opposes those policies but bentsen has 
been trying to highlight areas where the two men agree such as 
strengthening conventional forces and more effective management of 
the pentagon 
after the vfw speech and a luncheon in chicago bentsen was 
scheduled to attend a veterans celebration at a county fair in 
trenton tenn 
in stepping up his criticism of quayle bentsen has begun citing 
the indiana senators voting record on veterans bills 
among those is quayles vote against creating a cabinetlevel 
veterans department a position quayle reversed before the vfw 
earlier this week with the explanation that his earlier position 
was youthful indiscretion 
a youthful indiscretion my friends that vote occurred only 
five weeks ago bentsen said i dont think america can risk 
youthful indiscretion in someone who could become our president at 
any moment 
bentsen spent wednesday night in milwaukee where he took a boat 
ride up the milwaukee river and visited a sausage factory store 
bentsen had planned to complete a fourday campaign swing 
friday but it has been extended to allow bentsen a day in texas at 
weeks end at the same time bush is campaigning there both men 
claim texas as their home state

dozens of townspeople many wearing peace 
on earth buttons turned out today to greet a soviet delegation 
from dickson siberia outside president reagans boyhood home 
we are carrying with us warmest greetings from all the 
residents of soviet dickson said visiting mayor nikolai t 
kartamyshev speaking through an interpreter from the porch of the 
house in this small northern illinois city we are enthusiastic 
because of your warm attitude and generous attitude towards us 
kartamyshev said he sensed a general feeling of comradeship 
mayor james e dixon of the illinois city who worked to make 
the weeklong goodwill summit a reality said its been a long 
difficult road making this connection but were glad we made it 
he also said the soviets were suffering from jet lag after a 
missed airline connection in new york and their arrival in illinois 
on wednesday 
but were not tired said soviet interpreter nikolai s 
vishnevsky of moscow 
the delegation then entered the reagan home for a private tour 
its interesting because hes the president and this is where 
he spent his childhood kartamyshev had said earlier we 
connect reagan with the positive changes in the relations between 
our countries 
vishnevsky said the dicksondixon summit beginning today marks 
the first time a delegation from a small town in the soviet union 
has traveled to its sister city in the united states 
the people of dickson are interested in almost everything 
about life in america because we have very scarce information 
about your country and your people and the information we have is 
almost entirely about politics he said 
first on the agenda today for kardamyshev vishnevsky and 
journalist boris s ivanov was a private tour of reagans boyhood 
home with mayor dixon greatgreatgreatgrandson of the towns 
founder 
the twostory frame house on the south side is where ronald 
dutch reagan son of a shoe salesman and a dress maker lived 
from 1920 until he left for college in 1928 
born in nearby tampico reagan moved to dixon with his family 
when he was 9 and it was here that he began to show an interest in 
drama politics and athletics 
we want to give them a feeling for the community where the 
president came from dixon said we want to show them what kind 
of community impacted on his personality and ultimately on his 
presidency 
storefront signs proclaim peace on earth written in english 
and russian and buildings display flags of the united states and 
the soviet union 
dixon officials also hoped to impress the soviets with their 7 
miles of petunialined streets scenic rock river setting and the 
friendly hardworking peaceloving residents in the town of 
15700 
not everything has gone smoothly ivanov dryly noted that the 
visitors had to wait in line two hours in new york before getting 
their passports and visas checked and missed a flight to chicago 
its beautiful here he said but your bureaucracy is much 
worse than ours 
dickson siberia is a city of 5000 on the taimyr peninsula in 
extreme northern siberia above the arctic circle and boasts of 
being the northernmost community in the soviet union 
the city a staging area for early arctic explorers is named

the pilot of the socalled third plane 
connected to the 1986 collision of an aeromexico airliner and a 
private plane over suburban cerritos was dismissed as a defendant 
in lawsuits filed by victims families 
roland paul furman of buena park did not contribute to the 
collision by making a radio call to an air traffic controller us 
district judge david v kenyon ruled wednesday 
documents prepared by furmans attorney stephen l nelson said 
furmans plane was 10 miles from the collision when he communicated 
with controller walter white 
nelson said white became aware of furmans plane on his radar 
eight to 20 seconds after the airliner and the singleengine piper 
archer collided on aug 31 1986 eightytwo people were killed 
including everyone aboard the two planes and some people on the 
ground 
nelson said furman had been named in at least 25 lawsuits 
the claims against furman are based on the theory that his 
presence in the los angeles terminal control area distracted white 
from aeromexico and the piper archer somehow contributed to the 
cause but undisputed facts in the case undercut this 
theory kenyon wrote

authorities said today they have 
arrested a former us soldier and charged him with espionage for 
leading an international spy ring that sold military secrets to the 
soviet union over the past 10 years 
chief federal prosecutor kurt rebmann said the charges against 
former army sgt clyde lee conrad involved an especially grave 
case of supplying american and nato defense secrets to the 
soviets through the spy ring 
the most recent delivery took place last month in vienna 
rebmann said 
we cant exclude the possibility that millions of dollars are 
involved in the case said alexander prechtel a spokesman for 
rebmann he said it was too soon to say exacly what damage was done 
to nato 
the us state department said in a statement in washington 
we understand that there has been an apprehension by west german 
authorities but do not consider it appropriate to comment at this 
time 
but fbi spokesman milt ahlerich said this is a very 
significant matter the interest to this country is acute it is a 
matter of intense interest to the fbi 
authorities in sweden said today they have detained two 
hungarianborn brothers who confessed to working for the hungarian 
secret service and who apparently were members of an international 
spy ring 
svenolof hakansson chief prosecutor of the goteborg district 
said the men both physicians who immigrated in the 1960s were 
detained on tuesday with radios and coded messages 
we have worked in cooperation with german police because it 
was very important to arrest these people at the same time so they 
could not warn each other said torsten bjorkhede chief of the 
swedish security police 
prechtel said the arrested swedes were suspected of being part 
of the same ring which he said was based in west germany and used 
couriers from sweden 
hakansson said the suspected spies had traveled several times to 
west germany 
prechtel said in a telephone interview that he couldnt rule 
out the possibility the charge of espionage against conrad might be 
raised to treason the spokesman said conrad was the head of 
the ring 
prechtel said conrad was from ohio but he could not provide the 
hometown 
the statement came after the new york times reported today that 
swedish and west german authorities had arrested eight people 
involved in a spy ring that supplied secret military documents to 
the soviets for at least 10 years 
prechtel speaking from his office in the city of karlsruhe 
confirmed virtually all of the times report on the case 
he confirmed that documents concerning north atlantic treaty 
organization defense plans for europe were believed stolen as well 
as the us army contingency plans for a ground war in europe 
against the soviet union 
but he emphasized that officials were still conducting indepth 
investigations to determine exactly what was missing 
prechtel said that while several people had been taken into 
custody or arrested he could not confirm that the number was eight 
the ring was based in west germany while couriers were based in 
neutral sweden the spokesman also confirmed 
rebmann said conrad sold secret documents to a soviet bloc 
secret service 
conrad has been sent to investigative detention following his 
appearance before a special panel of the west german supreme court 
rebmanns office said 
rebmanns statement said that conrad had worked for the us 
military for 20 years before his discharge in 1985 it said he was 
born in 1947 but did not give his hometown in the united states 
principals in the newly uncovered ring which operated through a 
germanhungarian connection caused a major security loss to the 
united states according to the times report later confirmed by 
rebmann 
the report said investigators believe the spy ring provided 
american west german and nato secrets to the hungarian 
intelligence agency the hungarians then shared the secrets with 
the soviet union officials told the times 
the times said the network was uncovered by west german and us 
officials including agents from the fbi and the army the army has 
about 250000 military personnel in west germany at more than 200 
installations 
rebmanns written statement said the charge against conrad was 
compelling suspicion of espionage activities in an especially 
grave case 
the statement said that in the seven years before his 1985 
discharge conrad had access to military defense plans at a us 
base in the west german city of bad kreuznach 
the accused is under compelling suspicion of having delivered 
these documents to a soviet bloc secret service by means of a 
command officer and couriers living abroad in return for high 
payment the statement said

dictator who had stolen the election

this town of 27000 people that is a landmark of the civil rights 
movement after the council split 33 on whether to accept 
tuesdays vote 
smithermans main challenger city councilman cleophus mann who 
is seeking to become selmas first black mayor said one precinct 
did not open on time tuesday and that there were other 
irregularities 
you stole it mann shouted at the meeting 
we might as well have been in panama he said we sit 
around and let a dictator run things 
returns showed smitherman receiving 3752 votes in tuesdays 
threeway nonpartisan election mann received 2769 votes coy 
darby a white challenger received 453 votes 
if the results are upheld smitherman would not face a runoff 
election because he received more than 50 percent of the vote 
after the meeting mann nearly came to blows with city attorney 
henry pitts and one campaign aide and another man were arrested on 
charges of disorderly conduct 
a second council meeting wednesday afternoon was boycotted by 
the councils three black members without a quorum no action

mayor and the year when voting rights demonstrations first brought 
national attention to the city

television film of the beatings shocked the nation two weeks 
later a second much larger march left selma with the support of 
the federal government

election results 
arrested after wednesdays council clash were the rev ernest 
swift sr 42 one of manns campaign workers and byron douglas 
smith 21 pitts said both men shouted at him and threatened him

muhammad ali the boxer who 
dubbed himself the greatest is receiving bloodcleansing 
treatments from a doctor he calls the greatest in the world 
the 46yearold former heavyweight champion walked into a 
hospital waiting room wednesday throwing jabs in the air minutes 
after undergoing an eighthour blood treatment to relieve slurred 
speech and tremors that have plagued him in recent years 
the doctor blames alis condition on household pesticide 
poisoning and not blows to the head 
i feel like i can fight heavyweight champ mike tyson ali 
said in a hoarse voice slightly above a whisper at hilton head 
hospital 
ali referred questions to his physician rajko medenica an 
immunologist who specializes in cancer and blood disorders 
ali underwent plasmapheresis during which his plasma was 
removed and replaced with an artificial product prepared by 
medenica plasma is the fluid in which other components of the 
blood circulate in the body 
although ali has been diagnosed as having parkinsonian syndrome 
possibly brought on by blows to the head during his boxing career 
medenica disagrees 
calling it the muhammad ali syndrome he blamed household 
pesticide poisoning which probably affected him so severely 
because of his rapid metabolism when he was in peak physical 
condition 
ali likely will return for treatments every three months or so 
medenica said 
my goal is to remove the circulating toxins by the end of the 
year he should be much better he said 
although ali had trouble speaking he moved with ease and 
appeared to be in good spirits ali called medenica the greatest 
doctor in the world 
hes got methods ive never seen before he said

members of the antiapartheid 
progressive federal party walked out of parliament on thursday to 
protest a government manuever aimed at pushing through 
controversial legislation 
one of the bills would strengthen enforcement of the group areas 
act which mandates racially segregated residential areas another 
would give authorities more powers to evict black squatters 
president pw bothas national party holds an overwhelming 
majority in parliaments white chamber and is able to gain support 
for most legislation from the majority parties in the two smaller 
chambers one for asians and one for people of mixedrace 
the two nonwhite chambers however have refused to consider 
the current bills insisting instead on total repeal of the group 
areas act 
the black majority is excluded from parliament and has no vote 
in national affairs 
the leader of the white chamber fw de klerk announced 
thursday that parliamentary rules would be suspended so the six 
pending bills could be dealt with solely by the white legislators 
progressive federal members said the rule change made a farce of 
the parliamentary process 
you are doing it to pass laws which are repugnant to the vast 
majority of people in south africa said the partys whip john 
malcomness if you put them to a referendum of all the people of 
south africa they will be massively rejected 
the farright conservative party which favors a strengthening 
of apartheid laws joined the progressive federal party in 
condemning the rule change which was approved on a 11635 vote 
last week botha said 80 percent of south africas whites and 70 
percent of asian and mixedrace voters would endorse residential 
segregation in a referendum the rev allan hendrickse leader of 
the mixedrace chamber has dared botha to arrange such an election 
the proposed amendment to the group areas act would sharply 
increase penalties for violators and would negate a current court 
ruling that violators could be evicted only if alternative housing 
were available 
information minister stoffel van der merwe said the act was 
virtually unenforceable at present and needed amendment to give 
people a sense of security 
in the united states he said wealthy people could buy their 
way into neighborhoods with de facto segregation 
we only want to create the same option for people in south 
africa he said noting that the government has proposed allowing 
some multiracial neighborhoods for people who desire them

the city council has voted to let police arrest 
and search people who look or act like drug dealers regardless of 
whether the people are seen making drug deals 
the ordinance approved wednesday also says such loiterers may 
be fined 500 if they are known drug dealers or pass money 
packages or written material to passersby in an area known for 
drug sales 
civil libertarians questioned the ordinance which says someone 
may be arrested who loiters in a public place in a manner and 
under circumstances manifesting the purpose of selling any illegal 
controlled substance 
a known drug dealer is defined as someone who has been convicted 
of drug charges within the last year 
councilman al gonzalez said he proposed the ordinance at the 
request of lou caudell first assistant police chief 
this allows uniformed police officers to get actively involved 
in the war on drugs said police lt doug kowalski 
but joe cook president of the dallas chapter of the american 
civil liberties union said he expected the group to challenge the 
ordinance because it treads on due process and civil rights 
cook said such an ordinance could be used to harass political 
activities and could increase tension between police and the citys 
minority communities 
councilwoman diane ragsdale initially cast the only vote in 
opposition to the ordinance saying she feared the rights of 
innocent people could be trampled 
but she later reversed her vote saying she would seek 
assurances from police chief mack vines that the ordinance would 
not be abused

the first direct peace talks between their countries since the 
persian gulf war began eight years ago the talks were mediated by 
the head of the united nations 
iranian foreign minister ali akbar velayati and his iraqi 
counterpart tariq aziz sat at separate tables facing each other 
across a spacious room secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
faced them from a third table 
the meeting was suspended after 2 hours un spokesman 
francois giuliani told reporters afterward the iranian and iraqi 
delegations moved to separate rooms and un officials shuttled 
between the two groups and reported to the secretarygeneral who 
remained in the room where the direct talks were held 
they are consulting giuliani told reporters it is not a 
bad sign nor a good sign its a normal process of consultation 
he said when asked by reporters if there was a problem with the 
talks please dont interpret this as a sign that things are 
going well or badly they are going normally 
earlier giuliani told reporters the talks would continue through 
sunday 
western diplomatic sources meanwhile said the 
secretarygeneral was considering naming a threeman panel to 
determine which side started the war the sources speaking on 
condition of anonymity said one representative could be from iran 
one from iraq and one from the international court of justice 
the direct talks were held in the art decostyle council chamber 
of the palais de nations the two foreign ministers and their aides 
entered separately from the right and left sides the ministers did 
not exchange greetings 
reporters were present briefly and watched the beginning of the 
session on closedcircuit television as reporters left aziz 
lighted a cigar 
your excellencies i warmly welcome you perez de cuellar 
said in english as he led the meeting the iraqi delegation of 15 
was seated to his left and the iranian delegation of 13 was to his 
right in a triangular setup of long widely separated tables 
the un chief said he hoped our discussions would be 
businesslike constructive and indeed productive 
the council chamber overlooks lake geneva and is decorated with 
gold leaf and sepia ink murals of human progress and abolition of 
war 
the peace process was expected to be long and troublesome the 
issues are numerous from disputed border locations to prisoners 
of war and the bitterness between the persian and the arab sides 
runs deep 
since a unsupervised ceasefire began six days ago both 
sides have traded charges of truce violations and questioned their 
adversarys sincerity and will for peace but no serious fighting 
has been reported 
earlier today aziz and velayati met separately with perez de 
cuellar both ministers were accompanied by their delegations and 
ignored questions shouted at them from about 100 reporters pressing 
against crowd control barriers in the main entrance of the building 
perez de cuellar said he expects direct talks between iraq and 
iran to last months but some diplomats believe the peace process 
could drag on for years 
arriving in geneva today velayati said the talks should 
arrive at a just comprehensive honorable and durable settlement 
of all outstanding issues between iran and iraq 
iran accepted the un ceasefire resolution july 18 after a 
string of battlefield defeats iraq had agreed to the resolution 
shortly after the security council passed it in july 1987 
the agenda for the iraniraq talks could include troop 
withdrawal to international borders resolution of a border 
dispute repatriation of prisoners of war reparations freedom of 
navigation in the disputed shatt alarab waterway and the gulf and 
other issues 
iran also is insisting on the creation of an impartial body to 
determine which side started the war it has said that iraq must be 
branded the aggressor if there is to be lasting peace 
iraq invaded iran in september 1980 after border skirmishes 
any ruling on guilt in the war would affect the question of 
reparations official iranian assessments have put the cost of war 
damage at 350 billion iraq has not given an estimate

defense contractor trw inc pleaded guilty 
today to fraudulently overcharging the government up to 11 million 
for military aircraft and m1 tank parts and agreed to pay 3 
million in fines 
trw deeply regrets that the events occurred and has created 
programs approved by the defense department to prevent them from 
happening again said trw vice president william lawrence 
lawrence who entered the plea on three counts on behalf of the 
company said trw has paid a separate 3 million to be applied as 
an advance payment on restitution to the defense department the 
amount of restitution trw owes is to be decided in a pending civil 
case 
the company estimated that it inflated costs by 3 million to 
11 million government officials have declined to comment on those 
figures 
trw also paid a combined criminal fine and penalty of 3 
million one of the largest ever assessed against a defense 
contractor for procurement fraud said us attorney patrick m 
mclaughlin in cleveland 
in connection with the case two former trw employees have 
pleaded guilty to defrauding the government and one former 
employee faces trial sept 6 the government said 
trw was charged with conspiring between 1973 and 1984 to falsely 
inflate labor expenses for the manufacture of aircraft engine 
parts a conspiracy to inflate labor costs on compressor fan blades 
for the m1 tank took place between 1980 and 1984 mclaughlin said 
the third count charges that trw conspired to charge the defense 
department for operations and labor that were not performed in 
connection with the manufacture of blades for the j79 aircraft 
engine 
the three counts detail a longstanding course of conduct 
by trw employees to alter backdate and destroy documents to 
conceal the falsely inflated labor costs the government said in 
a news release 
the guilty pleas conclude a federal grand jury investigation 
that began in 1984 when trw voluntarily disclosed that its 
employees had engaged in questionable conduct mclaughlin said

result is that school cafeterias will do without for at least five 
weeks officials said 
its going to cause a riot leonard smackum director of 
food service for the baltimore school system warned the board of 
estimates on wednesday pizza is our most popular item 
the board voted to toss out bids on 760000 slices of cheese 
pizza and readvertise the contract after spending nearly an hour 
listening to two vendors argue over whose bid was lower 
on a 31 vote the board decided the bidding process made it 
difficult to determine which of the two bids 219000 or 229000 
was actually the lowest 
the dispute arose when nardone brothers baking co of 
pennsylvania said it would add twotenths of an ounce of cheese on 
each slice beyond the 2 ounces required by the contract thus 
providing tastier pizza 
the extra cheese would be free to the city as long as the 
federal government continued to provide free cheese through a 
surplus program said a spokesman for nardone 
but the rival supplier said the federal program could end this 
year raising the cost of the pizza 
the start of the school year may be saved for pupils however 
the board of estimates approved contracts with suppliers of 
mexicanstyle pizza and frenchbread pizza

un military observers scrambled on 
thursday to assemble the iraniraq ceasefire despite 
communications snags suspicious hosts and uncertainty about the 
location of minefields 
all of the 350 observers drawn from 24 countries were in place 
by thursday un spokesman saleem fahmawi said communications 
personnel were expected to establish a radio network very soon 
he said 
fahmawi said that since the ceasefire took effect aug 20 
there have been just minor incidents which have been fully 
resolved 
but diplomats and other sources said that mixups over 
transportation passports communications and protocol meant that 
some observers were not in place on aug 20 
those who were frequently found themselves with inadequate 
communications poor maps and uncertainty about where the 
minefields were as they patrolled in temperatures often exceeding 
110 degrees 
diplomats and un officials said they rapidly are overcoming 
the snags the hastily assembled force sent to countries unfamiliar 
with un procedures had been expected to face 
theyre no more than the growing pains of a new mission in two 
countries which have absolutely no experience with this type of 
thing said col john annand the canadian deputy commander of 
the un iraniraq military observer group 
iran and iraq both deeply suspicious of outsiders and 
distrustful of each other found hundreds of foreign soldiers some 
armed landing at their airports with their own communications 
equipment 
us c5a galaxy transport planes ferried canadian 
communications troops to natos incirlik base in turkey the jets 
flew on to iraq but shipments to iran were transferred to canadian 
c130 transports 
the delays caused by the transfers were compounded when iran 
initially demanded 48 hours notice and a complete list of men and 
equipment on each flight diplomats said 
iran also objected to the assault rifles carried by un support 
troops 
although un troops normally need no passports diplomats said 
tehran demanded them forcing consular officials to scramble to 
issue hundreds of new documents 
as a result diplomats said operations in iran have been about 
two days behind those in iraq forcing the delay of some operations 
in iraq 
efforts to set up a un communications network were complicated 
by confusion over frequencies iraq approved one set iran another 
now officials are trying to get them to agree on a single set so 
observers on both sides can talk to each other 
diplomats and un personnel said they rely heavily on the host 
armies to help out during the initial ceasefire stages 
observers in the central sector said they sleep and eat in iraqi 
officers quarters and depend on iraqi guides and translators they 
said cooperation was good 
observers are using handheld uhf radios to report to command 
centers these relay the messages by telephone to sector 
headquarters which use iraqi army lines to reach the central 
headquarters in baghdad 
within a few days diplomats said the communications teams 
should have a un network carrying communications from the front 
to un headquarters in new york 
the observer teams have little idea where the border is one of 
their main tasks is to make sure that both armies withdraw to the 
prewar frontier 
thats likely to be most difficult in the north where the 
iranians have long infiltrated into the kurdistan mountains to 
fight alongside tehranbacked kurdish guerrillas the iraqis are 
still battling the rebels in the region 
the 730mile border has been in dispute for decades and will 
have to be ironed out in the peace talks in geneva 
the iranians consider the southern border to be the median line 
of the shatt alarab waterway under a 1975 agreement 
but president saddam hussein of iraq tore up that treaty days 
before the war erupted in september 1980 and is likely to claim 
sovereignty over the whole waterway iraqs only outlet to the 
persian gulf 
with only 350 men the observers cannot spot every incident but 
they will check reports of violations and significant troop 
movements along the front which ranges from rugged mountains in 
the north through ravinecut hills in the center to marshes and 
desert in the south 
mines are the biggest problem said capt arne ophus a 
norwegian observer we have to be careful 
the guides who accompany the observers in their airconditioned 
land cruisers dont know where all the minefields are because many 
were planted by iranians

hyatt hotels corp on thursday announced that 
it had dropped its ban on cornrow hairstyles and initiated a 
program to encourage more minorities to enter the hotel and resort 
management industry 
the changes stem from complaints by several hyatt employees 
across the country including one in washington that prohibiting 
the tightly braided hairstyle discriminated against blacks who 
consider cornrows part of their ethnic heritage 
officials of the district of columbia human rights office said 
at a news conference with hyatt executives that because of the 
policy change it has decided not file a complaint against the chain 
they hyatt officials exhibited a spirit of cooperation like 
no other weve seen said maudine cooper director of the office 
there were policies against cornrows but hyatt has since 
eliminated that policy 
hyatt said that as part of the settlement with the city it was 
creating a nationwide college scholarship program designed to 
attract minorities to hotel and resort management 
under the plan selected students at 20 historically black 
colleges and universities who have completed their sophomore or 
junior years will have the opportunity to participate in a 10week 
paid summer training plan 
we hope to give students a realistic understanding of the 
hotel business and to allow for student development through 
responsible and accountable assignments said tom perry an 
assistant vice president for personnel with hyatt students who 
perform to expectation will be extended an offer to join hyatt as a 
management trainee upon graduation 
just 24 percent of the 10000 students enrolled last year in 
college hotel management programs were black perry noted 
the district government could have fined hyatt if coopers 
office had found evidence of discrimination 
the settlement does not affect complaints already filed by hyatt 
employees over the hotel chains former ban on cornrows cooper 
said jimmy lee solomon jr a hyatt attorney said four complaints 
are pending nationwide 
solomon would not discuss details of any of the cases but he 
said the hotel had made some generous settlement offers

authorities on thursday released burmas 
top dissident and nearly 1700 antigovernment protesters and 
hundreds of thousands more rallied to demand immediate democracy 
rejecting the presidents proposal to consider multiparty rule 
dissident aung gyi left insein jail quickly organized a rally 
of about 200000 people and demanded an interim government be 
formed to lead the nation to democracy 
on wednesday president maung maung bowed to three days of mass 
protests against oneparty rule and called for a referendum on 
multiparty democracy the leader the nations third in five weeks 
lifted martial law imposed aug 3 in rangoon withdrew troops 
from the city center and lifted curfews throughout the country 
but to the people in the streets thursday the moves clearly 
were insufficient 
about 400000 people marched through the streets of the capital 
demanding the government give the people democracy immediately 
witnesses said diplomats earlier said up to 1 million people 
marched in the city wednesday 
antigovernment demonstrators controlled victoria point the 
southernmost town in burma and student leaders claimed similar 
takeovers were occurring throughout the country 
about 300 workers merchants and students marched through 
victoria point and one student said maung maungs promise of 
democracy was a political trick 
aung gyi addressed a hastily arranged rally at padonma ground 
where public stage shows are held it is near his home in the 
sanchaung area of the capital 
we have complete trust in president maung maung and chairman 
of the council of peoples justices tin aung hein he said both 
men are civilians in the militarydominated government 
but aung gyi added i demand maung maung and tin aung hein 
form an interim government immediately to avoid anarchy and 
bloodshed in the country 
we agree the crowd shouted 
aung gyi a former army brigadier was a close associate of 
former strongman ne win but they split over differences in 
economic policy 
ne win led the 1962 coup that toppled the elected government he 
began oneparty rule and imposed rigid socialist and isolationist 
policies that turned one of southeast asias wealthiest nations 
into one of its poorest 
when ne win 77 resigned last month as chairman of the 11 
millionmember party he cited his age and took indirect 
responsibility for violent riots in march and june 
he said the rioting showed the lack of trust and confidence in 
the government and called for a referendum on multiparty rule 
sein lwin a former army general widely hated for crushing 
dissent succeeded ne win on july 27 and moved quickly against his 
opposition he resigned aug 12 after at leat 112 people were 
killed when troops fired into crowds of antigovernment 
demonstrators 
aung gyi 70 recently wrote a series of letters decrying 
economic and political decay under the ruling burma socialist 
program party and specifically mentioned sein lwin 
aung gyi this reporter and eight others were arrested on july 
2930 
sein lwin was succeeded aug 19 by maung maung who had been 
attorney general 
after his detention aung gyis name became a rallying cry of 
some of the hundreds of thousands of people who took to the streets 
to condemn sein lwin and later to demand that maung maung move 
toward multiparty democracy 
earlier thursday heading home from insein jail people shouted 
for democracy without any official hindrance for the first time in 
26 years 
the atmosphere was festive the sea of people and hornhonking 
vehicles and the absence of police and soldiers snarled traffic in 
the city center and made movement difficult 
many people wore red headbands and the national flag was flying 
upside down both symbols of defiance 
government ministries were open but nearly empty with no senior 
officials at their desks and the few junior employees on hand doing 
little work some local government offices were deserted after they 
had been ransacked by mobs 
banners on buildings and vehicles including some government 
cars called for peaceful protest to bring about an immediate end 
to oneparty rule 
no newspapers were available because workers at all six 
staterun dailies struck wednesday to demand democracy and press 
freedom 
staterun radio rangoon said 1683 protesters were released 
thursday from insein jail it said all others arrested nationwide 
since aug 3 in connection with the rioting would be freed except 
those accused of serious crimes 
those freed thursday included 442 students 78 government 
employees and 27 buddhist monks the release brought to more than 
2500 the number of people freed but it was not known how many 
remain in jail 
maung maung said wednesday he would ask the party at an 
emergency congress soon to consider a referendum on multiparty 
rule which could lead to general elections radio rangoon said the 
meeting would be sept 12 
he said if the party refuses he and the 13 other members of the 
central executive committee would resign from the party 
in another development thursday gen bo mya head of one of 
burmas most powerful rebel groups the karens said a democratic 
government in rangoon would be only a first step towards ending the 
40yearold civil war 
he said in bangkok thailand that his 17000 guerrillas and 
other rebel groups were ordered to step up attacks against the 
government

court officials on thursday postponed a 
decision on whether to dismiss weapons charges against syndicated 
columnist carl t rowan who has been accused of using an 
unregistered handgun to wound a teenage trespasser at his home 
a district of columbia superior court hearing commissioner roy 
t ellis agreed to put off until sept 12 a hearing on dismissing 
charges to give prosecutors time to study the matter city 
attorneys said they would file papers within a week opposing 
rowans request that the charges be dropped 
rowans attorney raoul l carroll asked last week that the 
charges be dismissed saying he had evidence that rowan and his 
son carl jr had been told they didnt have to register the 
weapon used in the june 14 shooting 
the columnist who has written in favor of gun control has been 
charged with one count each of possessing an unregistered gun and 
carrying ammunition for it each misdemeanor charge carries a 
possible penalty of one year in prison and a 1000 fine 
a local ordnance enacted in 1976 requires that all handguns be 
registered 
but rowan and his son a former fbi agent who owned the 
22caliber pistol contend they had been told the weapon did not 
need to be registered because law enforcement personnel were exempt 
that statement was supported by a memo written aug 11 from city 
corporation counsel frederick d cooke to police chief maurice t 
turner indicating that some police officers have erred in enforcing 
the gun registration law 
it has come to my attention that some officers in the mpd 
metropolitan police department have interpreted the provision so 
as to exempt from registration firearms owned by mpd officers or 
other law enforcement officers cooke wrote turner 
i understand further that when an officer ceases to be an mpd 
or other law enforcement officer this exempt status is not 
revoked and the former officer is not required to surrender the 
weapon cooke continued 
i do not agree with the premise that law enforcement 
officers are exempt from registration of any nondepartment weapons 
they may own 
the law should be amended to make clear that law enforcement 
officers are not exempt from the citys stringent handgun law 
cooke added 
carroll who submitted the memo in his dismissal motion said it 
substantiates the claims of innocence his client has already made 
beverly burke a spokeswoman for the corporation counsel 
refused to comment on the memo and refused to outline how the city 
will counter rowans request

new jerseys system of paying for public 
education is unconstitutional and discriminates against poor urban 
districts an administrative law judge ruled thursday 
there are unmet educational needs in poor urban districts and 
vast program and expenditure disparities between propertyrich 
suburban and propertypoor urban school districts judge steven 
l lefelt said 
the ruling comes after nearly two decades of legal and 
legislative battles and once again throws into question the way 
the state funds public schools it could force the state to spend 
millions of dollars more each year on education 
i do not believe that poor urban districts even with better 
management practices and the expulsion of politics could raise 
sufficient funds to address all of the disparities and unmet 
needs that i believe must be addressed under our constitution 
lefelt said 
his ruling capped a sevenyear legal battle over a lawsuit 
brought on behalf of 20 schoolage children in camden irvington 
east orange and jersey city 
the suit charged that the state funding system leaves poorer 
districts with far less money than their surburban counterparts and 
creates disparities in the quality of education 
education commissioner saul cooperman has 45 days in which to 
accept modify or reject lefelts ruling 
lawyers for the state and the group that filed the suit the 
newarkbased education law center predict the case eventually will 
go to the state supreme court 
although lefelts ruling is a major victory for the law group 
the judge did not agree with the groups contention that new 
jerseys funding system is intentionally discriminatory instead 
he said it is motivated by cost efficiency and not race 
lefelt said the legislature must revamp the system so poor 
districts receive more money to improve schools 
his decision came more than 15 years after the supreme court 
first ruled that new jerseys former system of funding education 
with its heavy reliance on property taxes discriminated against 
poorer districts 
the legislature then enacted a school funding formula and 
passed a state income tax in 1976 to pay for it

the state department on thursday praised the 
lifting of restrictions on civil rights in chile and expressed hope 
that the action will lead to additional steps that will allow the 
full and free expression of popular will 
the move wednesday by chiles military leaders was the first 
time since they took power in 1973 that the state of emergency had 
been lifted 
the announcement came less than a week before the expected 
selection by the countrys fourman junta of president augusto 
pinochet as the sole candidate in a presidential referendum later 
this year 
successive us administrations have been hostile to pinochets 
rule and thursdays statement by state department spokeswoman 
phyllis oakley was one of the few positive comments about chiles 
leadership in 15 years 
the us government has stated on repeated occasions that the 
continuation of states of exception which limits basic civil rights 
is incompatible with democratic electoral processes mrs oakley 
said 
she said the termination of the states of exception is a 
positive step which we applaud 
we firmly hope that this decision by the chilean government 
signals a lasting guarantee of the civil rights of the chilean 
poeple she added we also hope that by ending the states of 
exception the chilean government is indicating a sincere desire to 
take further steps to allow the full and free expression of popular 
will

panamanian ambassador juan b sosa a leader 
of forces opposed to panamas military leader manuel antonio 
noriega said thursday a combination of factors has led to a 
dramatic deterioration of noriegas public support 
noriegas government is weaker by the day the regime is 
fighting for its survival sosa told a news conference he called 
six months to the day after panamas upheaval began with the failed 
attempt to oust noriega as commander of panamas defense forces 
sosa continues to serve as panamas ambassador to the united 
states sharing the us position that president eric arturo 
delvalle is the legitimate authority in panama delvalle was ousted 
the day after his abortive attempt to fire noriega 
sosa who retains control over panamas embassy despite the 
noriega governments attempt to replace him said public opposition 
to noriega was evident earlier this month when hundreds of 
thousands of panamanians turned out for the funeral of former 
president arnulfo arias 
as a further sign of what he called the dramatic deterioration 
of the regime sosa said there has been a wave of strikes 
recently widespread antigovernment demonstrations by high school 
students and loss of diplomatic support in latin america 
noriega has responded by imposing strict curbs on independent 
news media sosa said 
we do not think that we are in a paralysis we know we are 
making progress we know that noriega is today more weakened than 
he was three months ago and definitely more weakened than he was 
six months ago sosa said 
sosa suggested that democratic presidential candidate michael 
dukakis was being misleading earlier thursday when he said the 
reagan administration had engaged in criminal dealings with 
noriega ignoring the military leaders alleged involvement in drug 
trafficking noriega has been indicted on drug charges by two 
federal grand juries in florida 
based on what he has read sosa said past mistakes by the 
united states concerning panama date back to 1972 and have been 
committed by every administration since then 
insisting that it would be improper to dwell on the past sosa 
said as long as the administration is constructive positive and 
supportive of our efforts that is what we want 
sosa alluding to the series of economic sanctions the 
administration has imposed against panama said he is grateful for 
the us contribution to the antinoriega cause 
among other measures the united states has imposed a series of 
economic sanctions against panama

burundis leader said thursday his 
soldiers killed civilians in reprisals for the massacres of rival 
tribesmen and he said the death toll from the ethnic war could 
rise above 5000 
the leader maj pierre buyoya was quoted on staterun radio 
burundi monitored in neighboring rwanda more than 41000 
burundians have fled to rwanda to escape fighting between the 
majority hutu and the minority tutsi who control burundis 
government and military 
the government said monday that 5000 people were killed but 
buyoya said some bodies may not have been counted the government 
said its initial figure came from gravediggers sent to bury the 
dead 
buyoya said the soldiers who killed hutu civilians were not 
acting under government orders but started the slaughter after 
discovering the bodies of tutsi tribesmen 
many of the hutu refugees fleeing to rwanda arrived with 
bayonet knife and bullet wounds as well as stories of soldiers 
killing hutu on sight until thursday the burundi government 
denied those allegations 
the trouble began aug 14 when the hutu attacked tutsi in two 
communities in northern burundi hacking hundreds to death with 
machetes and burning people alive in huts refugees said 
buyoya blamed the trouble on exiled hutu he said had crossed 
from tanzania 
but refugees blamed most of the deaths on burundis 
tutsidominated army 
the soldiers were rounding up hutus and shooting them one 
refugee said they are collecting them into groups taking them 
inside houses closing the doors and windows and then shooting 
reverin ndururutse 32 said his 5yearold nephew and his 
3yearold son were the only survivors of a family of 15 herded 
into a house by soldiers who opened fire he said the adults threw 
themselves on top of the two children 
in washington the state department said hutu civilians not the 
army probably initiated the violence spokeswoman phyllis oakley 
said its a tragic situation and said the united states was 
giving emergency aid to the refugees in rwanda 
rwanda appealed for international aid for the sudden influx of 
refugees who still are arriving at an average of 2000 per day 
according to the un high commissioner for refugees office in 
rwanda 
rwanda is the most densely populated nation in africa and the 
refugees are severely straining the impoverished countrys 
resources 
burundi has asked the refugees to return home and promised to 
help them resettle 
in an appeal to diplomatic missions thursday burundi asked for 
international aid to help rehabilitate the 100000 people it said 
were affected by the slaughter 
the government said it would need enough tents blankets 
cooking utensils food and other supplies to aid the affected 
population for three months according to a western diplomat in 
burundis capital bujumbura 
it just said it had taken stock of what was needed but did 
not state amounts said the diplomat who spoke on condition of 
anonymity in a telephone interview 
the note did not explain how the government arrived at the 
100000 figure or the threemonth time frame said the diplomat 
buyoya said wednesday his government was trying to restore order 
and promised that those found guilty of involvement in the 
slaughter would be punished radio burundi reported in a broadcast 
monitored in nairobi 
he appealed to those who lost their relatives to refrain from 
acts of violence and revenge such behavior may reverse our aim of 
forging ahead in developing burundi 
buyoya who seized power in a bloodless coup sept 3 1987 said 
the victims of the fighting belonged to all tribes according 
to the broadcast 
buyoya said his government would try as soon as possible to lift 
a 7 pm to 5 am curfew the government also has restricted 
travel between towns and banned meetings of more than five people 
rwanda and burundi former belgium colonies each are about the 
size of maryland about 61 million people are crammed into rwanda 
while 5 million live in burundi africas second most densely 
populated country 
the short stocky hutu comprise about 84 percent of the 
population in both nations and the tall lanky tutsi 15 percent 
but the hutu have ruled in rwanda since 1959 when they overthrew 
the former tutsidominated government and killed an estimated 
100000 people 
in burundi the tutsi have held onto power the most serious 
threat to tutsi rule was in 1972 when the hutu attempted a coup 
killing hundreds of tutsi before the rebellion was crushed 
the government retaliated by slaughtering between 100000 and 
300000 hutu incuding most of the tribes intelligentsia 
according to human rights groups

the 18 foreign hostages held in lebanon 
will be freed soon a leading beirut newspaper reported thursday 
anglican church envoy terry waite will be the first one 
released the daily assafir said the countdown has begun it 
said in a oneparagraph report attributed to unidentified western 
diplomatic sources in moslem west beirut 
the leftist newspaper based in west beirut has good 
connections with moslem groups that may have information on the 
hostages most of whom are believed held by proiranian shiite 
moslem zealots 
rumors of an impending release of hostages have been frequent 
around the middle east since iran and iraq agreed to a ceasefire 
and peace talks 
however the proiranian group believed to hold most of the 
hostages issued a statement last week denying those reports 
the release of anglican church envoy terry waite will be the 
first step to freeing the hostages the paper said without saying 
when that would happen 
waite 48 envoy of the archbishop of canterbury the most rev 
robert runcie disappeared jan 20 1987 after leaving his west 
beirut hotel to negotiate the release of american hostages held by 
the proiranian islamic jihad or islamic holy war 
an anonymous caller purporting to speak for islamic jihad told a 
news agency in beirut last week that waite was alive and we might

showed good intentions 
however islamic jihad had not claimed waites abduction it 
also had insisted in the past that it would communicate only in 
writing and accompanied by a photograph of one of the hostages to 
prove the messages authenticity

such a statement to a western news agency insisting that no

thirsty man said the statement 
anderson 40 of lorain ohio is chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press he is the longestheld 
hostage kidnapped on march 16 1985

government figures showed thursday that the 
economy surging through a stiff drag caused by the drought grew 
at the surprisingly brisk annual pace of 33 percent in the second 
quarter but inflation hit a sixyear peak of 51 percent 
the commerce department said that the gain in the gross national 
product the total output of goods and services would have soared 
beyond the 33 percent clip had it not been for a 
largerthanexpected 95 billion loss in farm production without 
that impact of the drought gnp growth from april through june 
would have hit a 43 percent annual pace it said 
the 51 percent inflation rate compared with just 17 percent 
in the first quarter sparked new worries that the federal reserve 
will be forced to step up its antiinflation campaign by sending 
interest rates even higher to quell the heatup 
the economy is growing much too fast said robert dederick 
chief economist of the northern trust co of chicago it is nice 
to grow fast at the early stages of an expansion when you have an 
lot of unemployment but at this stage we just cant afford it 
the 33 percent second quarter growth represented an upward 
revision from a month ago when the government estimated the gnp 
expanded at a 31 percent during the spring gnp growth in the 
first three months of the year was 34 percent 
strength in both quarters came from big improvements in the 
trade deficit which shrank at an annual rate of 189 billion in 
the spring the best performance in eight years 
business investment shot up 163 percent in the second quarter 
the biggest increase in a year as companies boosted capital 
spending plans to meet increased export demands government and 
consumer spending was up as well in the second quarter 
but the demand strength helped trigger a sharp jump in prices 
after rising at an annual rate of 17 percent in the first quarter 
the gnp deflators 51 percent showing in the second quarter was 
the worst since the third quarter of 1982 
the big jump in the gnp deflator which reflects changes in 
buying patterns as well as prices was attributed to higher costs 
for clothing food and gasoline 
it is no surprise that inflation is rising said allen 
sinai chief economist of the boston co we are seeing classic 
demandpull inflation where too many dollars are chasing too few 
goods 
but even economists who fear rising inflation and 
credittightening by the fed will topple the country into a new 
recession are not predicting a downturn until mid1989 at the 
earliest 
growth in the current julyseptember quarter will likely be even 
stronger than the spring quarter promising a robust economy 
through the nov 8 presidential election analysts said and many 
economists believe the country will be able to escape a slump next 
year as well 
we are not calling for a recession because we dont think that 
inflation is going to get so high that the fed will have to tighten 
that severely said david berson chief economic forecaster for 
the federal national mortgage association 
he predicted that the gnp would expand at a 4 percent rate this 
year the best showing since 1984 he said growth would slow to 
just half that pace in 1989 as the higher interest rates ripple 
through the economy 
the higher rates have already begun to pinch the housing 
industry sales of existing singlefamily homes fell 5 percent in 
july to an annual rate of 363 million units the national 
association of realtors blamed recent increases in mortgage rates 
for the first sales decline in six months 
in another report the commerce department said that aftertax 
profits by corporations surged 115 percent in the second quarter 
to an annual rate of 1666 billion it was the best showing for 
profits in five years but economists warned that profits are 
likely to be squeezed beginning in the second half of the year from 
rising labor costs 
the government estimated that the drought will reduce farm 
output by 143 billion in 1988 shaving about onehalf percentage 
point from growth for the full year the impact in the second 
quarter dropped production at an annual rate of 95 billion and 
the government said the impact would be even more severe in the 
third and fourth quarters of the year 
analysts said this reduction while slowing growth will worsen 
inflationary pressures as well because it reflects a drop in output 
rather than a reduction in demand 
the various changes left the gnp after adjusting for inflation 
at an annual rate of 399 trillion in the second quarter

iran and iraq on thursday opened the first 
facetoface negotiations on ending their 8yearold war and the 
mediator un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar voiced 
hope they would embark on a path of peace 
perez de cuellar welcomed the delegations headed by iranian 
foreign minister ali akbar velayati and his iraqi counterpart 
tariq aziz and they sat at long rectangular tables positioned 
left and right of the un team in a triangular fashion 
your presence clearly indicates your governments are quite 
prepared to pursue the path of peace he said adding that he 
hoped the talks would be businesslike constructive and indeed 
productive 
the atmosphere in the ornate un hall was sober aziz smiled 
and nodded at the iranians when the two delegations entered the 
chamber but there was no reaction 
the delegates numbered 13 on the iranian side and 15 on the 
iraqi side perez de cuellar was flanked by five aides 
the meeting began about 20 minutes late as journalists were 
told to leave the chamber so that the private talks could start 
aziz lit a cigar and began puffing on it 
un spokesman francois giuliani said the meeting was conducted 
in english arabic and farsi 
after about 2 hours the delegations moved into different 
rooms where un representatives consulted with them separately 
giuliani said he could not provide further details and added it 
is not a bad sign nor a good sign its a normal process of 
consultation 
it was a good discussion perez de cuellar said thursday 
night as he announced the talks had ended for the day and would 
resume friday we covered many points and the two parties want to 
consult with their covernments 
giuliani said the round of talks was expected to continue 
through sunday at least but he did not know exactly when it would 
end or when perez de cuellar would leave geneva 
a truce that took effect aug 20 appeared to be holding saeem 
fahmawi a spokesman for the 350 united nations observers 
patrolling the 733mile iraqiran warfront said in baghdad that 
there have been no major violations 
hashemi rafsanjani irans parliament speaker and acting 
commander of the countrys armed forces charged on thursday 
however that iraq was obstructing peace efforts to end the 
conflict tehran radio reported 
rafsanjani said iran will keep its forces along the front line 
so that iraq is forced to accept peace 
before their facetoface meeting thursday aziz and velayati 
held separate talks with perez de cuellar the iraqi for about 50 
minutes and the iranian for 75 minutes both ignored questions 
shouted by reporters waiting at the main entrance of the building 
the two delegations include political representatives legal 
experts army representatives and officials of relief societies 
the talks are the first step toward implementing un resolution 
598 which was adopted by the security council more than one year 
ago it calls on iran and iraq to cooperate with the 
secretarygeneral in achieving a comprehensive just and 
honorable settlement of all outstanding issues 
implementation of the ceasefire resolution involves a wide 
range of issues including settlement of border disputes and 
establishment of a commission to determine which side started the 
war 
diplomats have said that iran and iraq are divided over the 
agenda of peace talks iran is seeking strict adherence to 
resolution 598 while iraq wants to introduce other issues like 
navigation rights in the disputed border the shattalarab 
waterway 
repatriation of pows is also expected to be a thorny issue 
perez de cuellar has said there are more than 80000 pows in total 
many of the prisoners on both sides are expected to refuse 
repatriation because they have publicly supported the detaining 
country 
the allswiss international committee of the red cross which is 
expected to organize the repatriation has said it will require a 
mandate from both sides allowing it access to every prisoner to 
make sure he agrees to repatriation 
un sources said the un chief was considering appointing 
former swiss president kurt furgler as his representative to 
mediate the talks the multilingual furgler who made swiss history 
as successful mediator in a dispute between two swiss language 
groups served on the federal cabinet until last year 
if the negotiations are still under way in midseptember they 
might move to un headquarters in new york because perez de 
cuellar must preside at the opening of the general assembly on 
sept 20 said un spokeswoman nadia younes 
the exiled main iraqi opposition group the tehranbased supreme 
council of the islamic revolution in iraq said peace was 
impossible unless it can join the talks

starting line by giving tax breaks to businesses that locate in 
urban and rural enterprise zones 
in a campaign appearance filled with hispanic overtones bush 
said he would revive the faltering oil industry create a better 
climate for small business fight against federal gun control and 
provide jobs for the states large minority population 
standing on the historic san antonio riverfront in a 
sweatdrenched guayaberra a latinostyle cotton shirt bush touted 
the reagan administration record of 17 million new jobs but did 
not repeat his own pledge to create 30 million new jobs some of 
bushs own advisers said that promise was a bit hyperbolic 
i want to help these minorities who havent really had a shot 
at the starting line he said pledging to do that by creating 
tax breaks for businesses that locate in rural and urban areas 
as he was leaving san antonio reporters asked bush if he 
thought the cntroversy over running mate dan quayle was behind him 
yes i do he said there does seem to be forward motion 
its something in the air 
it smells like victory bush added 
bush a new england native who has made texas his adopted home 
state made repeated mention of the fact that 40 years ago he and 
his wife barbara chose to move here 
i knew that texas was where i wanted to raise our family and 
where we wanted to go out and make a living he told the rally 
his voice rising bush continued i was drawn to this state by 
two things texas was a place of big opportunity a cando place 
and it was strong in the traditional values family faith and 
peace and patriotism i keep those values uppermost in my mind 
he said 
bush also said he would put some incentive back into the 
energy business and decrease dependence on foreign oil and he 
said he would cut the capital gains tax and keep congress from 
strangling small business with regulation 
bush arrived at the rally of a few hundred supporters after 
taking a tour by tourist barge for about a mile down the river he 
was serenaded by mariachi guitar players the rally closed with a 
mariachi version of hail to the chief and a song that has 
become one of the republican theme songs this year la bamba 
bush compared opponent michael dukakis to former president jimmy 
carter saying voters did not want to return to the malaise 
that occurred the last time a governor came out of nowhere and 
became president of the united states 
we need proven tested leadership he said 
he continued his criticsm of dukakis veto of a massachussetts 
measure that would have required teachers to lead their classes in 
the pledge of allegiance 
i think its time he let the pledge of allegiance out on 
furlough bush said referring to the fact that courts have 
upheld the dukakis point of view bush said he would appoint judges 
who would interpret the constitution not legislate 
bush made the remarks during a fourday swing through texas a 
state where his campaign is focusing with increasing intensity 
since the democrats named texas sen lloyd bentsen to their ticket 
im proud to be back in my home state of texas he said 
bush flew to san antonio from houston where he maintains an 
official address at the posh houstonian hotel 
bushs roots in texas go back to the 1940s when he and his wife 
barbara moved here and bush began his career in the oil business 
eventually he started his own company and then was elected to 
congress from texas

the value of us agricultural exports is 
expected to jump 22 percent to a fouryear high of 34 billion this 
fiscal year up from 279 billion in 198687 the agriculture 
department said thursday 
in terms of actual quantity shipments were forecast at 146 
million metric tons in the year that will end sept 30 up 13 
percent from last year 
both the value and quantity estimates were up from the previous 
usda forecasts on may 26 of 335 billion and 1455 million tons 
although the report cited no figures for subsequent years it 
said export values may increase in 198889 due to higher prices but 
the volume of shipments may decline 
the report said the rise in estimates since may stemmed from 
largerthanexpected exports of animal products slightly larger 
subsidized wheat exports and higher corn prices due to the drought 
noting that 198788 exports are now expected to be up 61 
billion and 168 million tons the report said this largely 
reflects reduced competitor supplies higher prices for grains 
oilseeds and cotton and increased us export competitiveness 
helped by a lowervalued dollar and the export enhancement program 
or eep 
under eep selected countries including the soviet union and 
china can get wheat and other designated commodities subsidized 
by the us government 
the new forecast showed the value of grain exports at 122 
billion up from 118 billion expected in may and 198687 
shipments worth 933 billion 
oilseeds mainly soybeans were forecast at 76 billion down 
slightly from 77 billion indicated three months ago but that was 
up from 647 billion last year 
exports of livestock products this year were raised to 47 
billion from the may forecast of 45 billion in 198687 those 
were valued at 396 billion 
other major categories included horticultural products 37 
billion this year the same as indicated in may but up from 315 
billion in 198687 cotton export values were shown at 22 
billion the same as the earlier forecast last years cotton

the government reported thursday 
the commerce department said that aftertax profits rose to an 
annual rate of 1666 billion in the second quarter 
the increase which followed a 25 percent rise in the first

companies public utilities and manufacturers of durable goods 
items expected to last three or more years the report said 
manufacturers of nondurable goods had weaker profits in the 
second quarter except for petroleum companies which enjoyed an 
increase

military president augusto pinochets 
decision to lift all states of emergency helps meet opposition 
conditions for fair play in an october presidential referendum 
but other measures being urged by critics have yet to be 
adopted and the critics say doubts persist that the vote will 
enjoy legitimacy 
we still have to wait and see patrico aylwin president of 
the centrist christian democratic party told foreign reporters 
gen pinochet on wednesday signed decrees to end all states of 
emergency for the first time since he seized power in a 1973 coup 
the decrees take effect upon publication in the official bulletin 
expected this week 
his rightwing government plans a referendum on a single 
presidential nominee to be picked by military commanders including 
pinochet at a meeting set for next tuesday pinochet who is also 
the army commander is expected to be nominated 
no exact date has been announced for the yesorno ballot but 
pinochet said it will be in early october if a majority vote yes 
the nominee will be president until 1997 if most voters reject 
him open elections will be held in 1990 with pinochet remaining 
in place until then 
opposition parties and the local roman catholic church set four 
basic conditions for a fair ballot high voter registration an end 
to the states of emergency equal access to the mass media and a 
vote free of fraud and intimidation 
by midaugust more than 7 million of chiles 8 million eligible 
voters had registered thus resolving the first condition 
the second condition was met at least formally by wednesdays 
decrees under the emergency states the right to assembly and 
freedom of the press could be restricted and the government could 
jail and expel leftist critics 
with the lifting of the measures opposition groups can stage 
rallies without government authorization its impossible to 
image conducting a campaign without the right to gather publicly 
aylwin said 
he said the opposition would wait and see if the government is 
sincere about its vows to respect civil liberties 
ricardo lagos a prominent socialist in a 16party opposition 
coalition said thursday im left with the sensation that this 
is a cosmetic operation 
monica madariaga a former justice minister under pinochet who 
now is critical of his government said the president has placed 
the country under a state of observation and could declare a new 
state of emergency if the opposition failed to behave 
on tuesday navy commander jose merino warned that even stronger 
emergency measures could be adopted if public disturbances occurred 
but roman catholic church leaders expressed confidence in the 
governments good faith cardinal juan francisco fresno said in a 
written statement that he received news of the measure with 
satisfaction and asks all catholics to intensify their prayers for 
the welfare of the country 
still pending is the question of access to television and the 
press television which is tightly controlled by the state and 
the biggest newspapers have provided little space to the 
opposition political groups campaigning for a no vote complain 
that their advertisements are rejected but there is intensive 
progovernment propaganda 
under these conditions the plebiscite loses legitimacy 
lagos said in a recent interview 
election laws drawn up by the government guarantee each side 15 
minutes of free television time each day in september from 1045 
pm to 1115 pm opposition leaders say the hour is too late for 
many people and that this still fails to compensate for hundreds of 
progovernment ads broadcast and published during the past year 
there is an immense abuse and fraud by the government in 
access to television said andres zaldivar a christian democrat 
he said that because of unfair conditions if the government 
declares a victory in the ballot the immense majority of chileans 
are not going to believe it and the entire world is not going to 
believe it 
but he and other opposition leaders virtually discount the 
possibility of a fraudulent count on the night of the ballot they 
said election laws authorizing the presence of independent monitors 
at polling places will make any attempt at direct fraud too obvious 
the opposition coalition progovernment parties and a 
churchsponsored group each has established a network of thousands 
of monitors to provide parallel vote counts

officials declared a state of emergency thursday 
at two brooklyn psychiatric hospitals saying patients were 
squeezed into overcrowded rooms and forced to sleep in shifts on 
cots in hallways 
the action allows the state to begin moving patients to less 
crowded facilities without permission of family or guardians said 
steve osborn a spokesman for state mental health commissioner 
richard c surles 
there is no patient privacy no ability to accommodate 
patients who are not able to be admitted as inpatients right 
away said the citys mental health chief dr sara kellermann 
who had urged surles to declare the emergency 
as a result they end up eating with trays on their laps end 
up sleeping on very rudimentary cots and they are literally 
sleeping in hallways in fourhour shifts she said hospital 
employees would wake patients up after a few hours to allow others 
to lay down she said 
though officials were aware of overcrowding at psychiatric 
facilities in new york city they said they did not realize the 
magnitude of the problem until they conducted an inperson 
investigation 
the cityrun kings county hospital has 160 beds for mental 
health patients and a current population of 195 according to 
osborn 
matters are worse at nighboring kingsboro state psychiatric 
center where there are 566 beds and 736 patients osborn said it 
was not unusual to see six patients squeezed into a room intended 
for four 
kellermann said she was extremely distressed at the conditions 
she found in one case she said psychiatric patients were placed 
in an open atriumstyle emergency room sometimes for days 
waiting for a bed 
state officials denied a request to tour the facility osborn 
cited patient confidentiality 
the transfer of about 240 patients from the two centers to 
facilities outside new york city should start within a few days 
osborn said 
in addition to overcrowding the state cited kings county for 
patient idleness lack of privacy and building safety code 
deficiencies

a tropical depression churned over 
the dominican republic thursday after dumping heavy rains on puerto 
rico where it killed three people and left 485 homeless 
the depression with maximum winds of 35 mph struck land in the 
dominican republic after passing 150 miles south of puerto rico 
according to the national weather service in san juan 
a 6 pm edt advisory from the national hurricane center in 
miami said the depression was centered over the dominican republic 
about 75 miles north of portauprince capital of neighboring 
haiti it said the weather system was headed westnorthwest at 15 
mph and expected to move along the northern coast of cuba for the 
next 12 to 24 hours 
the system was not expected to grow much stronger unless its 
center moved well north of cuba forecasters said 
the depression dropped 66 inches of rain on puerto rico in 24 
hours before moving westward to nearby dominican republic 
forecasters said thursday 
two men and a 12yearold boy were killed in puerto rico in two 
separate incidents wednesday night when trees crushed their cars as 
they were driving along rural roads police said 
state secretary sila calderon declared a state of emergency and 
national guard units mobilized to rescue families trapped by 
swollen rivers in mayaguez on the western side of puerto rico 
civil defense authorities ordered hundreds of residents in 
lowlying areas to abandon their homes 
more than 100 homes around the island were seriously damaged by 
flooding including two that were destroyed according to civil 
defense officials they also reported 67 flooded areas 33 
mudslides 18 overflowed rivers eight damaged highways and three 
damaged bridges 
nora perez ruiz 22 fled to an emergency shelter with her two 
brothers and mother from her home near mayaguez 
she said she had worried about flooding since the last major 
floods hit the area in 1975 ive been nervous and occasionally 
havent been able to sleep thinking about when a flood would 
come she said thursday 
the state of emergency was lifted thursday and public schools 
reopened after a daylong closure but 485 people in 10 towns were 
still being sheltered in schools housing projects and a sports 
center civil defense authorities said 
the depression was expected to trigger rainfalls of 510 inches 
in the dominican republican where flash flood warnings were in 
effect 
mark zimmer a forecaster for the national hurricane center in 
miami said the depression would weaken as it passed over 
hispaniola the island shared by the dominican republic and haiti 
however he said it could intensify into a tropical storm when 
it moves back out to sea he said that would probably happen friday 
right now its too early to say whether its going to become 
a hurricane zimmer added 
depressions are upgraded to tropical storms when their maximum 
sustained winds reach 39 mph and to hurricanes when maxium 
sustained winds hit 74 mph 
two tropical storms have developed so far in the atlantic ocean 
during this years hurricane season but neither reached hurricane 
strength the season runs from june 1 to nov 30 
meanwhile a second depression that formed near the cape verde 
islands off west africa died thursday in the distant atlantic ocean 
about 1550 miles from bermuda forecasters said

two sports agents charged with racketeering and 
extortion in their dealings with college athletes pleaded innocent 
thursday and a defense lawyer said they would fight the allegations 
new yorkbased agents norby walters 56 and lloyd bloom 29 
entered their pleas before us district judge george marovich who 
released the defendants on their own recognizance and set trial for 
feb 27 
we will defend this case extremely vigorously you can count 
on that said walters attorney robert gold 
walters and bloom refused to discuss the casein every movie 
ive ever seen they say anything you say can and will be used 
against you so im not saying anything walters said 
walters and bloom were indicted wednesday on charges of 
racketeering mail fraud wire fraud and extortion 
they are accused of using money and gifts to entice dozens of 
players into signed agreements some of them postdated allowing 
the agents to represent them in professional contract negotiations 
the national collegiate athletic association prohibits college 
players from signing representation contracts or taking money while 
still eligible to compete 
if the players tried to back out of the deals they were warned 
that walters and bloom had friends who would visit them and break 
their legs said us attorney anton r valukas an imprisoned mob 
figure was named as an unindicted coconspirator 
the indictment said walters who heads world sports amp 
entertainment in new york also used threats to sign acts in the 
music business including the jackson five 
prosecutors said walters and bloom induced the athletes to 
defraud their schools by accepting cash and signing contracts in 
violation of ncaa rules and then signing affidavits saying they 
had not broken any ncaa rules 
if convicted the two each would face up to 70 years in prison 
and 2 million in fines 
valukas said 43 college athletes who signed with walters and 
bloom avoided prosecution by signing pretrial agreements to 
perform community service and to reimburse portions of their 
scholarships to their universities 
edward bozik athletic director at the university of pittsburgh 
said he was gratified by the indictments 
this sends a strong message to the student athletes that they 
can be held accountable if they are involved in a fraud he said 
three of the 43 athletes attended pitt 
the indictment named reputed organized crime figure michael 
franzese as an unindicted coconspirator alleging that walters and 
bloom used his reputation to coerce athletes into signing 
contracts franzese is serving a 10year federal prison term in 
california for racketeering and tax violations 
the indictment says franzese was a silent partner in walters 
firm and financed efforts by the two agents to sign college 
athletes the chicago tribune citing unidentified sources said 
prosecutors obtained franzeses cooperation in the 18month 
investigation 
in a related case californiabased sports agent dave lueddeke 
37 also was charged wednesday along with cris carter a 
22yearold wide receiver with the national football leagues 
philadelphia eagles

remaining was charged with obstruction of justice and mail fraud 
lueddeke was charged with perjury and obstruction of justice

a federal jury thursday began deliberating 
the fate of 20 reputed organized crime figures in what is believed 
to be the nations longest federal criminal trial 
the jury in the 21monthold trial faced a vast array of 
materials including more than 40000 pages of transcripts the 
testimony of 89 witnesses and 850 exhibits 
the 12member panel which retired for the night and was to 
return friday morning made its first request within 10 minutes of 
entering the jury room seeking copies of the indictment and 
transcripts of opening arguments 
attorneys then began arguing about what portions of the opening 
arguments should be excised only to have the jury send out another 
note two hours later canceling the request 
meanwhile the indictment question was resolved when it was 
learned that the jury already had a copy of it along with a 
roomful of exhibits but didnt know it was there 
the jury must decide 77 separate charges basing its 
deliberations on the complex instructions it received wednesday 
from us district judge harold a ackerman 
the trial has exhausted participants and backed up the federal 
courts in new jersey 
one prosecutor became a father twice an attorney who had been 
commuting from florida died of cancer touching off a dispute over 
his replacement that went all the way to the us supreme court 
one witness was on the stand for four months 
my marriage began and ended during this trial said defense 
attorney maria noto the attention that i chose to devote to it 
rather than to my new husband had a great deal to do with it 
its a monster ms noto said its an amorphous 
uncontrollable confused monster 
jury selection began nov 20 1986 when the first of 1200 
people were screened for the panel and opening arguments began in 
march 1987 
since then one defendant briefly attended court in a hospital 
bed until his moaning interfered another passed out 
a third acting as his own attorney and given to telling jokes 
to the jury crossexamined his cousin who on the stand 
apologized for once shooting the defendant five times in the head 
the case began in august 1985 with the unsealing of a 
racketeering indictment naming anthony tumac accetturo of 
hollywood fla who authorities say is a captain in the lucchese 
crime family and the other defendants 
accetturo allegedly controlled the powerful new jersey faction 
of the family which authorities say ran loansharking illegal 
gambling drugdealing and fraudulent credit card operations across 
the state 
the government charges the group operated out of a newark 
luncheonette called the holeinthewall where pictures of 
legendary gangsters al capone meyer lansky and charles lucky 
luciano hung 
key witnesses many of whom were criminals and onetime 
associates of the defendants testified about the groups reputed 
mob traditions kisses of respect and tribute payments for the 
boss sit downs meetings held to resolve disputes and visits 
to mob hangouts by luxuryhotel manicurists to do the nails of 
defendants 
defense attorneys said the witnesses their imaginations fired 
by movies and television shows had manufactured the scenes 
during a month of summations they urged the jury to disregard 
testimony from criminals confessed liars and drugusers many 
cooperating with the government in exchange for leniency and 
financial support 
that support the defense says exceeds 300000 just part of 
the millions of dollars invested in the case by the government 
courtappointed attorneys have received an estimated 3 million 
then there are the 175000 paid to jurors the salaries of three 
prosecutors the fbi case agent judge and extra us marshals for 
security and copying costs for a mountain of documents 
us attorney samuel a alito jr who started his job after the 
trial began says the expense is worth it although he acknowledges 
concerns about the trials length 
we will do everything we can to keep future trials at 
reasonable lengths he said 
according to the administrative office of the courts in 
washington the trial has exceeded what previously was thought the 
longest federal criminal proceeding the pizza connection case 
which ended in march 1987 after 17 months the jury convicted 18 
men for participating in a heroin ring that used pizzerias as 
fronts 
ackerman said the newark trial has been stressful 
because of its length ive been rationing my strength he 
said calling the jurys patience absolutely astonishing two 
jurors were dismissed and replaced by alternates early in the 
trial while a third was excused just last month after she told the 
judge the trial was making me crazy 
defense attorney robert l brown has the unusual problem of 
handling his clients interests as well as those of the city of 
orange of which he was elected mayor this spring 
it has caused a lot of late nights at city hall he said

cuba is using a lethal mixture of sovietsupplied 
mustard gas and nerve gases to flush out south africanbacked 
angolan rebels from their strongholds in remote areas janes 
defense weekly reported thursday 
prof aubin heyndrickx head of toxicology at the university of 
ghent in belgium and a united nations expert on biological and 
chemical warfare was quoted as saying his evidence that cuba is 
using the gasses is based on environmental samples taken from the 
angolan battle zone in april 
janes defense weekly is an authoritative publication dealing 
with military matters worldwide 
soil leaf and water samples showed clear traces of mustard gas 
and nerve gases heyndrickx was quoted as saying 
the attack must have taken place in march or april heyndrickx 
was quoted as saying because the nerve gases are extremely 
volatile and would not remain in the environment for longer than a 
few weeks 
the professor was quoted as saying he couldnt tell exactly 
which nerve gas was used although he knows it is one of the three 
neurotoxins soman tabun or sarin 
the report came as us mediators were working on a compromise 
timetable for a withdrawal of 50000 cuban troops from angola at 
talks in the congo south africa has promised to pull out its 
troops from angola by sept 1 and grant independence to southwest 
africa also known as namibia on condition the cubans leave 
heyndrickx was quoted as saying he is convinced the cubans are 
continuing to uses gases in angola to help win the war against 
rebels of the national union for the total independence of angola 
unita 
im sure the cubans will go ahead with this this is the new 
military tactic janes quoted him as saying 
the unita rebels backed by south africa and the united states 
have been fighting since 1975 to force the cuban and sovietbacked 
angolan government to share power the rebel group controls large 
portions of southern angola 
the professor was quoted as saying he has gas detection kits 
captured from cuban soldiers which are designed to measure whether 
levels of poison in the atmosphere are toxic for man 
a university of ghent team examined patients in unita field 
hospitals and found evidence of nerve gas attacks in 1986 and 1984 
but none of those victims showed any trace of mustard gas he was 
quoted as saying

republican vice presidential nominee dan 
quayle countering suggestions that he is not mature enough to be 
president said thursday he is qualified if that situation 
arises 
as for his youth the 41yearold indiana senator said im 
very close to the same age as jack kennedy was when he was elected 
not vice president but president 
quayle also said he had answered questions about his military 
record and that the american public is getting a little bit 
sick of hearing about the issue 
ive answered questions for seven days now quayle told 
reporters as he arrived in colmbia mo were going to talk about 
the future were going to talk about jobs were going to talk 
about other issues that the american people are interested in 
the indiana senator scheduled a series of stops in missouri 
ending with an appearance in sedalia at the state fair 
a scheduled news conference there was canceled at the last 
minute along with another event because of what aides said were 
time constraints quayle took questions from farmers at the state 
fair but told them i wont take any questions about the indiana 
national guard 
most of the farmers questions centered on medicare reform 
drought relief legislation and the newlysigned trade bill which 
quayle opposed in the senate debate but described thursday as a 
good first step to send a message that we are serious about trade 
apart from the canceled news conference quayle allowed 
reporters to question him thursday in an apparent shift in campaign 
strategy quayle had stayed away from the press on wednesday so 
attention would focus on his speech to a group of national 
guardsmen said stuart spencer quayles campaign chairman 
quayle was asked about remarks wednesday by sen lloyd bentsen 
his democratic counterpart suggesting that quayle was not mature 
enough for a job that was a heartbeat away from the presidency 
i am qualified if that situation arises quayle said 
adding that he felt he had special expertise in national defense 
and security issues 
he told reporters in boonville that he did not regret his vote 
against establishing a veterans administration cabinet post but he 
said he was a team player and would support the new cabinet 
post since bush favored it 
quayle had indicated monday to a veterans of foreign wars 
convention that his vote might someday be viewed as a youthful 
indiscretion but thursday he insisted he did not regret the vote 
i still believe my vote was correct he said 
quayles aides insisted that the controversy over whether he 
pulled strings to enter the national guard during the vietnam war 
had faded especially after a rousing reception from the guardsmen 
wednesday night 
we think the issue is behind us he said we want to keep 
it behind us 
spencer said bushs pollster robert teeter was doing regional 
polling to see if the american public agreed 
quayle was greeted in columbia by a contingent of supporters 
although some in the crowd chanted quayles a chicken some 
negative signs were sprinkled among the proquayle signs reading 
sissy rich boy dump quayle andwar wimp

two parties forming prime minister yitzhak 
shamirs rightist likud bloc formally merged thursday into a single 
party that will take part in november general elections 
the union was a formality because the two parties have fielded a 
joint list of candidates for parliament since 1965 but some 
political observers said it constituted a final victory for the 
rightwing views of the herut movement over the more moderate 
liberal party 
the union of herut and the liberal party also put an end to any 
hopes nursed by the leftleaning labor party that the liberals 
might bolt the likud and form a coalition with labor 
herut has 28 seats in the present parliament and the liberals 
13 the likud and labor share power in the current coalition 
government but elections polls indicate a slight advantage for the 
new party called the likudnational liberal movement and its 
rightwing allies over the leftist parties headed by labor 
before the official union leaders of herut and the liberals 
signed a covenant stating that israel had an indisputable right to 
all of the land of israel including the occupied territories 
former prime minister menachem begin who founded the herut 
movement in 1948 and was architect of the 1965 partnership with the 
liberal party sent a letter of congratulations to the participants 
three thousand likud supporters attended the signing ceremony 
where shamir delivered a speech attacking his labor party rivals 
shamir charged that labor blamed israel instead of the arabs for 
the palestinian uprising that began last dec 8 and the failure to 
reach a peace settlement 
i thought we had gotten rid of this cursed guilt complex a 
long time ago shamir said

flamboyant defense attorney percy foreman who 
bartered a guilty plea for the life of the man who assassinated the 
rev martin luther king jr died thursday at the age of 86 
foreman died of cardiac arrest said methodist hospital 
spokeswoman brenda koch family members did not wish to release 
further details she said 
foreman once estimated he had tried 1500 death penalty cases 
but of his clients only one a restaurateur named steve mitchell 
was executed mitchell was convicted in 1952 of shooting his wife 
and foreman who consistently opposed the death penalty said later 
mitchell deserved to die 
you cant win em all foreman said of the case but later 
confided he blamed himself 
he persuaded james earl ray to plead guilty to the 1968 slaying 
of king the nobel prizewinning civil rights leader in exchange 
for a 99year sentence ray charged later that foreman pressured 
him into the plea by saying the odds were 99 percent certain he 
would go to the electric chair if he faced a jury in tennessee 
ray contended he only purchased the rifle used in the memphis 
assassination and gave it to a man named raoul he charged 
foreman failed to investigate two mysterious louisiana men who he 
contended would have helped his case 
but foreman testified before a us house assassinations 
committee in 1978 that ray admitted to him he faked the story of a 
conspiracy and thought the killing would make a hero to the white 
race 
his style his technique his manner of handling himself 
before the jury had a dramatic effect on my career not only mine 
but many other men and women in the state who practice law said 
houstons other famous attorney richard racehorse haynes who 
used to skip law school classes to watch foreman in court 
i think his loss is a major loss in the quality of law hes 
gone but will not be forgotten i believe he will be the yardstick 
from which we will judge the other lawyers haynes said 
foreman was born june 21 1902 in a log cabin near the east 
texas town of coldspring his first job was as a shoeshine boy in 
polk county where his father was sheriff 
he began studying law after world war i and kept the 5 bill he 
received as the fee for his first legal case drawing up a lease 
on a fiveacre orchard 
foreman reacted in character april 30 1982 when a woman whose 
divorce he had handled was arrested and charged with trying to hire 
someone to kill him 
im too busy to die foreman growled when asked for comment 
he built a practice based on unswerving loyalty to clients 
they may not always be right but they are never wrong he once 
said 
in a murder case you should never allow the defendant to be 
tried he explained try someone else the husband the lover 
the police or if the case has social implications society 
generally but never the defendant

opposition legislators on thursday stormed 
out of a session to certify a new national house of deputies and 
accused the governing party of blocking inquiries into charges of 
voting fraud 
we have to seek new ways of protest because the official 
party is legitimizing fraud more and more every day alfredo 
noyola of the opposition national action party said 
the opposition parties who had left before dawn thursday after 
a nightlong debate returned to the chamber when a new session 
began thursday afternoon and the lengthy wrangling resumed 
the house of deputies is sitting in as an electoral college to 
certify the deputies elected in july 6 nationwide balloting 
press sections were open at the new session thursday afternoon 
but public galleries were closed because opposition sympathizers 
had been chanting whistling and sometimes throwing coins and 
other objects 
the july 6 elections were tainted by widespread accusations that 
the governing institutional revolutionary party or pri won by 
tampering with voter registration rolls packing ballot boxes and 
destroying ballots for opposition candidates 
since then opposition leaders have accused the pri of bullying 
and steamroller tactics to speed up vote certification especially 
in the house that chamber must also certify the presidential 
election by the dec 1 inauguration day of presidentelect carlos 
salinas de gortari 
the two major opposition candidates have barnstormed the nation 
urging mexicans to reject the election results 
after a heated nightlong debate all 227 opposition deputies 
walked out of the congress building early thursday temporarily 
paralyzing the 500member electoral college the body must finish 
its work in time to seat a new house by sept 1 
on that date both the house and the senate are to meet in joint 
session to hear outgoing president miguel de la madrids 
stateoftheunion address 
the senate sitting as a second electoral college continued 
hearings normally thursday to certify the election for its 
64member body 
the pri had not lost a presidential election since it was 
founded in 1929 
but the july 6 balloting marked the first time the pri won the 
presidency with less than 70 percent of the votes cast returns 
this time gave salinas victory and a single sixyear term by 5036 
percent of the vote 
cuauhtemoc cardenas a former pri leader that broke away to head 
the leftist national democratic front coalition came in second 
with 311 percent manuel j clouthier of the conservative national 
action party came in third with 17 percent 
for the first time also the pri lost its complete domination of 
the senate four opposition senators already have been certified 
for their posts 
by law the deputies and senatorselect sit as separate 
electoral colleges to certify their own elections and then the 
500member house sits as an electoral college to certify the 
presidential election 
both cardenas and clouthier have been claiming the election was 
fraudulent and accusing the government of denying the electoral 
colleges access to documents from about half the 55000 polling 
stations nationwide to conceal irregularities the de la madrid 
administration has denied the charge 
the pri members are denying us a voice and are turning down 
all requests by the opposition that fraud be investigated in 
their hurry to conclude the house electoral college process 
noyola said thursday in a telephone interview 
guillermo jimenez morales leader of the pri delegates to the 
house electoral college denied the charge in a newspaper interview 
in any case the attitude adopted by the opposition shows 
clearly that we are living within a democratic framework and a free 
world and each one can do what he wants with his freedom he 
told the newspaper excelsior 
the house had voted unanimously to close the public galleries 
minutes before the opposition members walked out college spokesman 
pedro pablo trevino said 
the decision was taken because several deputies were not only 
grossly insulted by sympathizers from opposition groups but many 
had coins and other objects tossed at them he said

too many school lunches rate a c grade 
because of their high fat content a consumer nutrition group said 
thursday urging cafeterias to serve healthfully modified meals 
such as chili atop baked potatoes instead of hot dogs 
ellen haas executive director of public voice for food and 
health policy said her group spotted encouraging trends toward 
fresh fruit and vegetables in a survey of school menus 
but she said the main courses served in school cafeterias far 
too often are fried foods and other dishes high in saturated fat 
our young children are a captive audience we have an 
opportunity here haas said weve got to establish lifestyles 
that have healthy eating habits 
the denverbased american school food service association called 
the report shallow and said school lunch is again getting a 
bad rap 
the 37 billion school lunch program serving some 27 million 
children is run by the agriculture department surplus commodities 
purchased by usda account for 20 percent of the foods used in the 
program 
therein lies the root of the problem according to public voice 
because the commodities are often high in fat sugar or sodium 
congress has compounded the problem by bowing to the milk 
producers lobby and requiring that schools serve whole milk with 
lowfat milk optional it said 
public voice recommended among other things that usda set 
limits on the amount of fat sodium and sugar permitted in school 
lunches and distribute healthier commodities to schools 
but suzanne s harris deputy assistant secretary of agriculture 
for food and consumer services said in a statement that it would 
be irresponsible to let commodities purchased by the government 
as required by law go unused 
furthermore she said the scientific community does not 
support setting absolute levels for sugar fat or sodium at this 
time because current recommendations regarding children are 
controversial 
nutrition strategies warranted for the general adult 
population may actually be harmful to children particularly 
lowincome children during periods of growth and development 
harris said 
pat bayer executive director of the american school food 
service association said the public voice report offers a 
shallow view of research that is an overreaction to calls by 
the surgeon general to reduce fat intake the association 
represents 65000 school nutritionists and school lunch directors 
i think that it is patently ridiculous to blame school lunch 
for obese america ms bayer said the fact is that school 
lunches are often the healthiest and most balanced meals some 
children receive all day 
we just think school lunch is again getting a bad rap she 
said 
however haas said the national science foundation the national 
institutes of health and the american heart association agree that 
fat should not constitute more than 30 percent of a childs daily 
caloric intake and she said the average school lunch contains 39 
percent fat 
public voice listed several examples of traditional menus heavy 
on fried chicken and fish mashed and fried potatoes and sweet 
prepared deserts the group compared those with healthfully 
modified menus adopted by some school districts 
for example in kennesaw ga students got baked chicken 
breasts with lemon and garlic steamed broccoli and carrots a 
homemade whole wheat roll and fresh fruit and in denver one meal 
was a baked potato topped with chili accompanied by raw broccoli 
and carrots and sweet potato pie 
we hear complaints that students wont eat this stuff haas 
said we just dont buy that 
some school districts won praise for serving lowfat milk and 
homemade lowfat salad dressings buying the ingredients themselves 
to substitute for higherfat commodities from usda 
haas urged the department to help keep nutritious meals 
affordable by adapting the commodities program to more closely meet 
usdas own 1980 dietary guidelines for example she said it could 
offer schools whole potatoes and plain chicken rather than potato 
rounds and breaded chicken ready for frying 
public voice also recommended that 
usda establish a national food service management institute to 
train and help school systems serve higherquality lunches harris 
replied that the department has authorized 50000 to study the 
feasibility of setting up such a program in mississippi a report 
to congress is due this fall 
the department reinstitute a ban on the sale of snack foods on 
school grounds sales now are banned only in cafeterias or during 
meal periods harris citing court cases said congress would have 
to pass a specific law if more stringent federal controls are 
desired

homelessness of parkers ashes which have resided for years in a 
new york office file cabinet

she died in 1967 she left her estate to the rev martin luther 
king jr and on his death to the national association for the 
advancement of colored people

archrivals was described as her own worst enemy not while im 
around ms parker retorted they dont make them like that 
anymore

harry robinson dean of the howard university school of 
architecture and planning 
the architecture school provided the design and a minorityowned 
construction company will do the work robinson said hooks said he

the evening before the gardens dedication a onewoman show 
about parkers life written by and starring laurel ollstein will 
premiere at the arena playhouse in baltimore the play is titled

democratic vice presidential candidate lloyd 
bentsen a decorated world war ii bomber pilot was booed by 
veterans on thursday when he said michael dukakis and the democrats 
could be trusted with the nations defense 
the simple truth is this gov dukakis is a veteran a 
patriot and an advocate of american strength and steadiness 
bentsen told the veterans of foreign wars convention in chicago 
he can be trusted as a defender of american security and as a 
champion of american values 
while president reagan has been a strong advocate for the 
military he has purchased military strength at the expense of 
national solvency bentsen said warning of the threat of the 
huge national budget and trade deficits 
bentsen himself was warmly received by the crowd and got a 
standing ovation but in trying to make the case for dukakis on 
defense he was interrupted four times by boos or jeers once when 
he mentioned former president carters name 
at one point when bentsen talked about dukakis bringing 
fiscal responsibility and management competence to our national 
defense programs the vfws national commander earl l stock 
jr had to stand and quiet the crowd bentsen then asked for the 
courtesy to debate and received applause 
the booing of dukakis appeared to be led by the massachusetts 
delegation to the convention 
jim reynolds of florida a retired veteran who said he was once 
the democratic chairman in saugus mass said dukakis was 
antiveteran and had appointed a nonveteran to head the state 
soldiers home 
the dukakis campaign staff brought out john halachi the state 
commissioner of veterans affairs to respond to the event and gave 
reporters papers on the governors positions on veterans issues 
halachi a vietnam veteran said the massachusetts delegation 
included a vice chairman of veterans for bush he said the 
criticisms of dukakis were untrue and that former gov edward king 
had appointed the nonveteran 
bentsen told reporters he had been prepared for some flak 
i had a tough assignment and i fulfilled it and i think i 
really gave them something to think about he said obviously 
some of them didnt want to hear it 
bentsen in his speech said the republicans were circulating 
scurrilous charges bush and quayle spoke before the vfw 
convention on monday 
at times im afraid our republican friends have behaved as 
if the flag were a partisan and not a personal virtue he said 
he received applause when he asserted my friends if i 
believe that there was a thread of truth in that garish tapestry of 
partisan blame i would not have joined mike dukakis on the 
democratic ticket 
bentsen wore his american legion cap as he delivered the address 
i have been in the crosshairs of the enemies of freedom 
said the 67yearold former bomber pilot i have been there and 
i yield to no person or party in my passion for freedom 
bentsen cited dukakis emphasis on improving nonnuclear 
weapons maintaining a nuclear deterrent and support of the 
stealth bomber the cruise missile and a new submarinelaunched 
missile 
while praising his running mate bentsen blasted both vice 
president george bush and sen dan quayle rind for supporting 
cuts in veterans health care programs 
each time the reaganbush administration proposed cuts the 
democrats fought them off he said 
from chicago bentsen went to an event to honor veterans at the 
gibson county fair in northwest tennessee among them about 20 
world war i veterans about the age of bentsens father a flier in 
the great war 
in a talk there bentsen said reagan rejected a military 
spending bill because of partisan politics 
the reason he vetoed it was because george bush came in with 
his pollsters and said they wanted to be able to charge the 
democrats with weakness on defense said bentsen 
some of the participants were angry with bentsens appearance 
i took my vacation to help my daddy do this said leanne 
hutchison we were told no politicians would be here that this 
wouldnt be a political thing 
this has turned into a political party said brenda davis as 
she helped prepare the military staple sos creamed chipped 
beef on toast

more than two and a half years after the 
challenger exploded relatives of the crew turned the astronauts 
dream of teaching children about space into reality thursday with 
the opening of the first challenger center 
the center at houstons museum of natural science paid for with 
a 150000 private grant will give students an opportunity to make 
a simulated space flight complete with a mission control center and 
scientific experiments 
we knew we couldnt launch a satellite discovery will do that 
for us but we could continue scientific and education objectives 
of that mission said june scobee widow of challenger commander 
dick scobee and chairman of the board of the challenger center 
the challenger center mission began with the challenger crew 
the idea to continue it was a mission by the families she said 
accompanied at the opening by relatives of other crew members 
this is a milestone event said david j barram vice 
president of corporate affairs for apple computer inc which 
donated computers to the center the center and its educational 
innovations are giant steps down new pathways to knowledge for our 
children and for us 
mrs scobee and the other challenger relatives conceived the 
center as a memorial to the deceased crew and their educational 
mission the challenger carried christa mcauliffe a concord nh 
high school teacher who was to have conducted the first classroom 
experiments from space 
the houston center is expected to serve as a model for dozens of 
similar centers or mission sites planned for science museums 
throughout the country 
the planned hub of the network will be the challenger center 
spacelife station a 15 million facility to be built in 
washington 
throughout the summer 580 houstonarea students have been 
training at the houston mission site which can accommodate 30 
students at a time 
its confusing its very complicated to memorize 
everything said 10yearold lindsay kemp who sat in as captain 
of mission control during thursdays simulated flight somewhere 
between earth and mars but im very interested in space and am 
learning things 
the flight simulator is named 2061 simulator and is designed 
to give children the impression they are on a mission in that year 
kerry joels director of educational facilities for challenger 
center said that year is significant because it will mark the 
100th anniversary of spaceflight the 75th anniversary of the 
challenger and the next visit to earths solar system of halleys 
comet 
museums in 31 cities and five foreign countries have expressed 
interest in participating in the program with boston atlanta 
charlotte nc chicago st louis alamagordo nm seattle 
portland ore and san diego already taking part in planning

president george vassiliou of cyprus said thursday 
that his first meeting ever with turkish cypriot leader rauf 
denktash generated goodwill but there is still a huge gap 
between our positions 
we did not make an effort to narrow or to widen this gap what 
we concetrated on was to get to know each other and agree on the 
procedure for future intensive negotiations he told the 
associated press in an interview 
the fact that we did agree on the procedure so quickly is a 
good omen later an anonymous bomb threat delayed vassilious 
return to cyprus but a search of the olympic airways boeing 737 
proved the call to be a hoax said the commander of the geneva 
airport security force maj roland troyon 
un secretary general javier perez de cuellar invited vassiliou 
and denktash to geneva in an effort to break the nearly 3yearold 
deadlock in negotiations for the reunification of the east 
mediterranean island 
in ankara an announcement by the foreign ministry expressed 
turkeys pleasure that the two cypriot leaders decided to start 
intercommunal negotiations to seek a settlement 
cyprus has been unofficially partitioned since a turkish 
invasion in 1974 following an athensbacked coup by supporters of 
union with greece 
the un chief said wednesday that after conferring with him 
the two men agreed to embark on intensive negotiations in the 
islands capital nicosia on sept 15 they will meet him again in 
new york about six weeks later to review any progress achieved 
vassiliou was elected president last february as a nonparty 
independent candidate with support from both the left and right 
four previous toplevel meetings since the turkish invasion 
between denktash and thenpresident spyros kyprianou and 
kyprianous predecessor the late archbishop makarios all failed 
to achieve progress 
the two sides have agreed on a settlement based on establishing 
a bizonal federation to reunify the island and dissolve the 
breakaway turkish cypriot state established in north cyprus in nov 
1983 and recognized only by turkey 
they disagree over constitutional arrangements and the 
implementation of un resolutions on cyprus ignored by turkey 
these demand withdrawal of the estimated 30000 turkish 
occupation troops and 50000 settlers from turkey brought to north 
cyprus and the return of 200000 expelled greek cypriot refugees 
to their homes there 
denktash reiterated in geneva his rejection of the troop 
withdrawal before the dissolution of the internationally recognized 
cyprus government and the establishment of a joint greek and 
turkishcypriot interim administration 
but denktash indicated there were better prospects of a 
settlement in talks with vassiliou who has stated repeatedly he 
wants to settle the problem before the end of his first year in 
office 
this is the sort of man i wanted and i found him he is the 
type i can negotiate seriously with denktash said

maria desillers need not give up financial records 
of donations for her dying sons liver transplants a judge ruled 
thursday dismissing contempt motions that could have landed her in 
jail 
forcing ms desillers to give the records and items allegedly 
bought with some of the 690000 in donations to the 
courtappointed curator of her son ronnies estate would tend to 
incriminate her said dade county probate judge francis christie 
im very happy said ms desillers who while awaiting the 
ruling gave her age as 33 the same as christ when he was 
crucified 
during the twoday contempt hearing her attorney roy black 
argued that ms desillers had a fifth amendment right against 
selfincrimination because prosecutors in dade and broward counties 
are investigating her for possible criminal violations 
lawyers for curator karen gievers had no immediate comment on 
the ruling but later received an emergency hearing friday before 
christie on their request to seize disputed properties and to 
strike ms desillers 150000 claim on her sons estate said 
another of ms desillers lawyers frank johnson 
ms desillers received massive publicity last year after the 
theft of 4000 that her 7yearold sons classmates had raised for 
the boys liver transplant 
donations poured in including 1000 from president reagan and 
200000 from miami beach industrialist victor posner ronnie died 
in april 1987 while awaiting a fourth transplant at childrens 
hospital in pittsburgh 
ms desillers handling of the money came under question when 
the hospital sued for the 262000 balance of the boys bill she 
refuses to pay claiming ronnie received improper care a charge 
the hospital vehemently denies 
shortly before the ruling thursday ms desillers former 
fiance jose castillo was handcuffed and whisked away as he 
stepped out of the courtroom where he been accompanying ms 
desillers 
metrodade detective barry garafola said castillo pawned two ibm 
computers monitors and printers worth 4000 one of the computer 
sets had been stolen in march and the other has not been traced 
the detective said 
as he was led away castillo called the charge ridiculous 
his bail was set at 1000 per count on a charge of grand theft and 
another of dealing in stolen property 
detectives said they could not say if ms desillers was 
involved ms desillers was devastated by the arrest said 
johnson 
ms gievers a lawyer was appointed by the court in march to 
oversee ronnies estate after the charges arose that the money 
might have been misspent by ms desillers 
ms gievers said ms desillers apparently spent some 200000 of 
donations improperly including 13500 for a used bmw and 11000 
for jewelry the curator had sought the records to confirm her 
findings 
christie froze the estate assets which are to be used for 
outstanding bills or to help other needy sick childrenhe also 
repeatedly ordered ms desillers to give up financial records and 
to hand over purchases allegedly made with the donations 
when she refused ms gievers sought the contempt of court 
citations punishable by fines or jail time christie declined to 
elaborate on his brief order thursday rejecting that request 
black portrayed his client as an unfairly maligned and generous 
woman who handled the publicity money and her only childs death 
as best she could he also said that some of the donations were 
meant for ms desillers personal use 
im not saying people gave it for maria to buy jewelry but 
if she bought a pickup truck for 20000 which is what they cost 
today nobody would have criticized her he told the judge 
youd think this was lifestyles of the rich and famous this 
is not a woman who deserves to be humiliated black said

marilyn quayle says the controversy over her 
husbands service in the national guard was created by bored 
biased journalists who have gone too far 
mrs quayle made her comments in an interview wednesday with 
barbara walters for the abc news program 2020 set to air 
friday night 
asked why she thought people are reacting so strongly to the 
question of whether dan quayle pulled strings to enter the national 
guard at the height of the vietnam war mrs quayle replied i 
dont think people are i think its a total creation of the 
media 
mrs quayle said it had crossed her mind that journalists 
are out to get the republican vicepresidential nominee 
i cant substantiate that she said i think part of it is 
just the fact that there were so many members of the media down in 
new orleans with nothing to do and they decided they would find a 
story and they looked wherever they thought they could and dug 
something up 
she said the race is extraordinarily important to our 
country 
and when you deal in rumors and innuendo instead of dealing 
with the issues that are important to the continuation of the 
success of our country not only is that an insult to every voter 
in this nation but its not fair to the voters she said 
theyve the media gone too far 
mrs quayle said her husband may attract more scrutiny from some 
members of the media because of his conservative views 
i just have the feeling that there is in a great deal of the 
media a bias not only towards republicans but especially towards 
conservative republicans she said and its come out many 
times over its something we deal with all the time

france and suriname signed an accord 
thursday paving the way for voluntary repatriation of about 10000 
surinamese refugees who fled into french guiana to escape fighting 
between rebels and the army 
this is a significant step to solve this grave human suffering 
and is cause to be hopeful said gaston le paudert the french 
charge daffaires in paramaribo

the agreement did not specify how or when the refugees will be 
repatriated it said however that as a first step the refugees 
will receive special identification cards 
also signing the pact were the un high commissioner for 
refugees george gordonlennox who drafted the text and 
surinames foreign affairs minister edwin sedoc

rebel leader ronny brunswijk has led a guerrilla war since 1986 
against the army in suriname a former dutch colony in northeast 
south america brunswijk refused to stop the insurgency in the tiny 
country despite the election last november of civilian president 
ramsewak shankar who replaced junta leader and present army 
commander desi bouterse 
under the accord the refugees must return voluntarily and 
france which now pays about 15 million a month to house and feed 
them cannot evict the refugees from french guiana

a decision on whether to deploy a full or 
partial star wars defense system must await more research into its 
capabilities and costs republican george bush said in a published 
interview 
we dont know yet which system is going to be the most 
effective so my view is full funding of the research and then make 
the deployment decision when you have all the cards on the table 
bush said in an interview published in fridays editions of the new 
york times 
the vice president in an apparent softening of earlier promises 
to deploy the strategic defense initiative as soon as feasible 
indicated that cost would be a factor in determining whether to 
deploy it president reagan has advanced sdi an antimissile 
system using new spacebased technologies as a shield against 
nuclear missiles which could make those weapons obsolete 
i dont think we yet know what the price tag will be bush 
said if you went to a full deployment of a full strategic 
defense it would be very expensive what i want to do is to 
continue reserach at the levels of funding essentially that we 
have requested 
the reagan administration has asked for more than 4 billion for 
sdi research this year 
bush also said that he recently has become interested in the 
concept of a limited system not a full shield but a partial 
deployment 
if i can get convinced by the experts that that would be a 
guardian a safeguard against a weapon accidentally fired or 
weapons in the hands of some terrorist state then id be 
interested in this partial deployment he said 
at this juncture i am not prepared to endorse it but im not 
prepared to totally reject it bush added 
the times said the interview was conducted as bush flew to 
houston after a rally in los angeles on wednesday 
in bushs speech accepting the republican nomination for 
president last week he said he would continue our policy of 
peace through strength and added i will modernize and 
preserve our technological edge and that includes strategic 
defense 
a passage in the republican party platform reads we are 
committed to rapid and certain deployment of sdi as technologies 
permit

un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar

months but some diplomats believe the peace process could drag on 
for years 
perez de cuellar planned separate meetings with the foreign

in this staunchly republican town 
that vice president george bush calls his summer home bumper 
stickers are urging residents to save kennebunkport vote 
democratic 88 
while bush is enjoying a surge in popularity in postgop 
convention polls the stickers appearing on dozens of cars and 
trucks in this coastal resort community reflect the oftheard 
grumbling that bushs presidential candidacy is ruining the tourist 
trade and the town 
a bush presidency would make this place so busy it would be 
unbearable says resident jason wentworth already its full of 
people streaming in to see his house 
wentworth a member of the york county democratic party has 
printed and sold more than 750 of the antibush bumper stickers in 
the past couple of months 
he says they are intended to help save kennebunkport from the 
tourist traffic chaos threatened by a bush presidency as much as 
they are meant to be a political statement 
when bush effectively clinched the gop nomination with primary 
victories last march the 2900 yearround residents looked forward 
to a busy summer tourist season because of bushs occasional 
presence here 
the crowds indeed are big but they dont stay and they 
hardly spend any money 
instead many of the tourists visit for only an hour or two 
driving past the bush estate on picturesque walkers point 
stopping to snap a photo and then motoring back to interstate 95 
a lot of people come up to see where he lives says mary 
drake owner of a downtown gift shop they dont come to shop 
nearly every hotel inn and guesthouse in kennebunkport has 
vacancies stores report declining sales and many businesses say 
fewer tourist dollars are being spent than in any year in recent 
memory 
ask how business has been this summer and the usual response 
is dont ask or its so so slow hopes for a profitable 
season have been cast aside like undersized lobsters which are 
this towns other big moneymaker 
its been really really slow compared to the last couple of 
years said julie brown as she surveyed the empty strudel shop 
restaurant 
when he bush is in town for a couple days its real busy 
but then it slows down she said 
matthew treadwell who works at the indian whale watch a tour 
boat company less than two miles from bushs home says thereve 
been only two soldout cruises so far this summer even with 
excellent weather and numerous whale sightings last year at this 
time the figure was 20 
at mabels lobster claw restaurant where bush frequently dines 
when he is visiting mabel hanson bemoans the slow season but is 
reluctant to blame the vice president 
i dont think it has anything to do with mr bush but were 
having a terrible summer she says 
why everybodys got their own opinion says susan savell 
executive director of the kennebunkkennebunkport chamber of 
commerce some say its a sign of bad economic times others say 
its been too hot too cold too rainy 
but privately many locals complain that bushs presence has 
scared away tourists who fear nightmarish crowds and traffic jams 
people are afraid to come up but its not like that at all 
its just dead said gerda towne owner of two downtown stores 
bushs seaside compound situated at the end of a rocky 
peninsula in southern maine has become the major tourist 
attraction in town 
traffic is nearly always heavy near his home motorists park 
next to noparking signs lining the twisting twolane road and 
clamber onto the shore to take pictures 
kennebunkport police lt robert sullivan confirms that traffic 
has been heavier around the bush estate this summer but he says 
traffic became a serious problem about a decade ago he wouldnt 
blame bush for that 
wentworth says many republicans have bought his antibush bumper 
stickers to show their concern for the future of kennebunkport in 
the event of a bush presidency 
the town was never meant to handle the kind of traffic thats 
already coming in wentworth said i feel that much of that is 
due to him and hes not even president yet

kathy a teenager who feels unloved and 
unwanted after growing up in a series of foster homes sums up the 
circular problem of foster care more succinctly than an army of 
experts 
i would tell the people that want to put their kids in foster 
care that they shouldnt do it because they shouldnt have brung 
their kids into the world if they cant take care of em 
as described in abcs documentary crimes against children 
failure of foster care airing tuesday an overburdened 
bureaucracy is forced to make extremely delicate choices try to 
keep the family together and risk further neglect abuse even the 
ultimate horror of a childs death or break up the family and 
consign the child to a life of shuffling among foster homes where 
abuse is not unknown 
abc previously examined the issue of foster care in 1979s 
nobodys children since then reports of child abuse have 
skyrocketed and there are more unwed mothers and povertystricken 
families putting even more pressure on the system 
the documentary uses praiseworthy restraint the stories of 
abused children wrecked families and frustrated social workers 
need no embellishment the reporter is rebecca chase av westin is 
executive producer ray nunn senior producer 
take the story of jesse a neglected houston infant who was 
placed in a loving foster home but returned to his mother and her 
new husband an alcoholic with a history of child abuse after 
they underwent counseling 
not long afterwards before a social worker could get the 
obviously battered 2yearold out of the home he was admitted to 
the hospital in a coma jesses former foster mother sharon 
wilkens recalled visiting him at the hospital in hopes he could 
hear her we told him that we loved him and that he hadnt done 
anything wrong and that we were very sorry we thought his new 
parents were going to be able to love him too and that jesus would 
be waiting to meet him 
jesse never came out of the coma 
on the other side are families torn asunder by hard times and 
put back together only after years of struggling through red tape 
bright articulate 12yearold boyd was not abused his mother 
voluntarily gave up her children when she was hospitalized and 
couldnt care for them 
my worst fear is never seeing my mother again boyd says 
the foster care people are trying to tell my mother that shes 
not good enough right now shes good enough for me anytime 
it took five years for boyds mother to get her children back 
boyd accompanied by his mother testified before a congressional 
committee investigating foster care 
some foster parents seriously abuse the children they are 
supposed to care for one chicago child was tortured to death by 
her foster parents after her case was lost in a bureaucratic maze 
and the couple moved her illegally to north carolina 
there are also stories of social workers strapped by lack of 
resources jackie gillard of chicago must enter dangerous 
neighborhoods trying to track down many of the dozens of families 
she oversees 90 percent of whom do not have telephones she 
complains that her agency gets attention only when one of its 
failures makes the news 
the documentary concludes with more uplifting stories most of 
them based on successful local programs educating foster parents 
keeping families together in times of trouble and helping grown 
foster children adjust to life on their own 
most documentaries on social problems end with calls for more 
money and obviously money for more workers to ease caseloads 
would help enormously but this is one problem that only human 
caring will eventually solve 
as chase concludes the need for community involvement has 
never been greater the system desperately needs more foster 
parents adoptive parents court advocates and just friends how 
else are we going to put real caring into foster care

bankruptcy court officials predict the 
drought will force hundreds of midwestern farmers who might 
otherwise have survived financially to abandon their fields after 
the coming harvest 
after a sharp drop in bankruptcy cases in the first half of 
1988 courts throughout the farm belt expect a surge in bankruptcy 
petition filings in the next six months even with help from the 
huge federal drought assistance bill according to officials in 
iowa south dakota and wisconsin 
the figures looked so promising but with whats happened this 
summer were not going to bump along with this low figure said 
ann manley chief clerk of the us bankruptcy court in madison 
michael duff an assistant to the us department of 
agricultures assistant secretary for economics said farm 
bankruptcies linked to the drought would increase nationwide later 
this year stunting an economic upturn in the farm economy that 
began in late 1987 
last year debts were actually less than receipts and land 
values stabilized but historically anytime you have a drought the 
numbers go up and down duff said there were probably a number 
of farmers on the line having a makeorbreakyou year and they 
probably will go bankrupt or quit 
we dont have any way of knowing how many but it will be a 
national kind of problem duff said 
the madison court which handles bankruptcy petitions involving 
individuals businesses and farms for 44 of wisconsin 72 counties 
received 154 petitions from farmers the first seven months of the 
year that compared with 293 for the same period last year 
since 1985 farm bankruptcies have made up 13 percent to 16 
percent of total cases in the madison district there were 420 in 
1985 511 in 1986 and 448 last year 
ill predict filings will more than double by the end of the 
year ms manley said well be around 400 again 
barbara everly chief clerk of the us bankruptcy court in 
cedar rapids iowa said she expected a 20 percent increase in 
bankruptcies this winter 
youre not only talking about farms but it may be the final 
blow for implement dealers and service stations and the convenience 
stores in those small farm communities that have been on the 
edge said everly 
as in wisconsin everly said farm bankruptcies in iowa so far 
this year have fallen well below previous levels she said climbing 
land values in the state and an improving farm economy had eased 
financial woes 
but now with crops stunted or wiped out and many farmers still 
owing the costs of seed and fertilizer i expect that lenders are 
getting terribly terribly jumpy she said 
ed jesse a university of wisconsin agriculture economist 
called the drought a major setback to an agriculture economy 
that began improving late last year 
a lot of them are just going to have to call it quits jesse 
said 
in south dakota farm bankruptcies were down by almost 78 
percent the first seven months of the year 
pat naylor deputy clerk for the us bankruptcy court in sioux 
falls sd said 61 farm petitions had been filed through july 
compared to 311 for the same period a year ago 
south dakota was among the early states hardest hit by the 
drought 
however judge irvin hoyt of the us bankruptcy court in 
pierre sd said the number of farm bankruptcies would depend on 
the eligibility and timing of federal drought aid to farmers 
president reagan signed the 39 billion drought assistance bill 
aug 11 and the government hopes to begin taking applications by 
oct 1 under the law aid to farmers who lose more than 35 percent 
of their expected harvest will cover 65 percent of that lost 
income for farmers who suffer crop losses of more than 75 percent 
the aid would equal 90 percent of the lost income 
until we know exactly when aid will be available 
particularly for those in bankruptcy who must modify their plans 
we wont know whats going to happen with filings hoyt said 
farmers generally file chapter 11 petitions which grant 
protection from creditors and create a plan for debt payment or 
chapter 12 petitions which were created in 1986 in the family farm 
act 
chapter 12 petitions generally resemble chapter 11 petitions 
but proponents say they give the debtor stronger control over the 
payment schedule and use a trustee generally an attorney to 
administer it 
chapter 11 and 12 debt payment plans can be modified to fit 
unexpected economic troubles and even allow payments to be 
temporarily suspended but the huge financial losses anticipated in 
the drought may require payments to be reduced or suspended for so 
long that creditors might urge liquidation said mark bromley a 
lancaster attorney who handles farm bankruptcies 
creditors would have a strong argument that the normal 
bankruptcy plan simply wont work bromley said 
my greatest concern would be for the people already in 
bankruptcy in some cases payment plans may have to be modified to 
drastically reduce or suspend payments for a year bromley said 
bromley and hoyt also said that next springs operational costs 
for feed fertilizer and other items may be too high for some under 
present plans and reduced income 
buying at higher costs will throw those plans and cash flows 
back into court for modifications bromley said 
bromley said hes had relatively few consultations with farmers 
about financial problems this summer 
i think the reason is its so hard out there so beyond the 
experience of most farmers that they want to wait and see where 
things fall he said

census figures show that living in rural 
america away from city clamor is not quite as attractive as it once 
was but agriculture department experts say the countryside could 
beckon again when times improve 
during the 1970s it seemed to many demographers including 
calvin l beale of the usdas economic research service that rural 
living was on a roll that people flocking from the cities were 
turning the tide of decades of migration from farms and small towns 
but the human tide weakened in the early 1980s as the economy 
faltered farmland values plummeted and rural employment suffered 
quickly says beale the exceptional rural and smalltown growth 
of the previous decade ended 
a study of metro and nonmetro counties shows that 
during the years of the population turnaround americans once again 
began heading for the cities 
the federal government says a metro area is one having a city of 
at least 50000 as a nucleus and adjacent communities that have a 
high degree of economic and social integration with that city 
beale said that in the 198083 period the nonmetro population 
increased at the rate of 083 percent a year which once again 
trailed the metro gain of 11 percent annually moreover there 
were 720 nonmetro counties with population declines half again as 
many as in the low levels of the 1970s 
even so the rural population balance looked pretty good by 
comparison with the 1950s and 1960s when huge waves of people 
moved from farms and small towns to the cities 
and then the situation worsened 
from 1983 to 1986 despite a recovery in the national economy 
the ability of rural areas to attract or retain people rapidly 
deteriorated beale said the annual nonmetro population increase 
dropped to 042 percent per year only half as high as the 198083 
rate while the annual metro population increase rose slightly to 
112 percent 
it is this science of numbers decimals and fractions that makes 
the lives of demographers exciting and shifts in where people live 
can translate into huge meanings for the nation as a whole as 
economies of small towns counties and cities gain or lose 
beales analysis is in the current issue of rdp or rural 
development perspectives a periodical issued three times a year by 
the departments economic research service 
in his assessment beale said that the very low growth of 
nonmetro population in the 198386 period was the most striking 
feature of post1980 trends 
during that time 1306 counties or 55 percent of all nonmetro 
counties in the country lost residents between 1983 and 1986 
the average loss per county was not large but the incidence 
of loss was as widespread as when farm consolidation was at its 
peak in the 1960s when 53 percent of the nonmetro counties lost 
population and in the 1950s 54 percent beale said 
but there are bright spots too counties known as retirement 
havens continue to attract new residents not just older people but 
younger workers who provide services and goods to the retired 
population 
these counties grew annually by more than 178 percent from 1980 
to 1986 more than double the national rate beale said 
also nonmetro counties with a fourth or more of their 
residents commuting to jobs in metro areas grew by 113 percent a 
year a bit faster than the national growth rate although a sharp 
decline from their 192 percent gains in the 1970s 
after mid1983 nonmetro counties with any growth at all were 
a rarity throughout the great plains corn belt and central and 
northern appalachia beale said in iowa the quintessential 
farm state 84 of 88 nonmetro counties lost population from 1983 
to 1986 as outmovement more than offset any excess of births over 
debts 
beale said lower birth rates also help prompt the population 
decline in rural areas during the 1950s and 1960s the nonmetro 
birth rate was considerably higher than the more recent rate in 
the 1960s it averaged more than 20 births per 1000 people with 
the death rate at less than 10 per 1000 
in 198086 the rural birth rate was 156 per 1000 people a 
decline of about a fourth from the 1960s while the death rate was 
about the same at 96 per 1000 
but beale said the worst may be over for nonmetro areas in 
terms of economically related population declines farm income 
supported heavily by federal subsidies was at an alltime high in 
1987 debts have declined somewhat exports have improved 
commodity surpluses have declined and 1988 cash income is expected 
to be second only to last years 
these positive factors do not presage an increase in the farm 
population for there is no need for additional farmers he said 
but if the improved conditions are sustained they should lead to 
resumed local investment and spending and greater retention of 
population in farm counties

the unassuming green building in this 
citys produce district looks like a warehouse and like a 
warehouse its filled with row after row of boxes and cans of food 
but mary garvey sees it differently 
this is a laboratory she says were creating a new 
industry 
garvey 31 is president of grocery express a company that 
delivers just about anything you can find on a supermarket shelf to 
people who cant or dont want to shop and who are glad to pay a 
little extra for convenience 
people have less and less time and that trend is not 
reversing garvey said in a recent interview 
about 5000 people in the city and the northern san francisco 
peninsula save time by ordering groceries from garveys 7yearold 
company and having them delivered for a flat fee of 425 prices 
are about 15 percent higher than at large supermarkets and about 
the same as at a corner grocery garvey said 
forty percent of her patrons are businesses elderly and 
homebound people but the rest are twoincome couples professional 
singles or families with young children 
these are people who have no time but lots of demands on their 
time she said 
katherine craven a writer and homemaker first called grocery 
express 6 years ago when she was pregnant and didnt want to climb 
stairs to her secondfloor victorian flat with bags of groceries 
for me its been a great thing and particularly in the winter 
or if someone is sick its just a godsend said craven 
customers order from among several hundred items in grocery 
express catalog a 128page guide that includes fresh flowers 
restaurant meals and food gift baskets as well as fresh meat and 
produce and canned and packaged goods 
each item has a number which grocery express clerks punch into 
a computer noting whether customers want their chicken boned or 
bananas barely ripe customers also can file orders through their 
home computers 
orders are put together in the companys 18000squarefoot 
warehouse and delivered in one of seven vans 
garvey who has an economics degree from stanford university 
learned about business from her familys company garvey 
industries a wichita kanbased concern dealing in oil and gas 
grain and real estate 
grocery delivery while not a new idea has not been a very 
profitable one over the past 15 years other entrepreneurs have 
started companies like grocery express but failed garvey said 
grocery express nearly became one of those failures after an 
enthusiastic beginning garvey was an original investor but it was 
her former husband michael meagher and friend john coghlan who 
were the real founders she said garvey became more involved in 
the business and took it over two years later 
in 1984 the companys sales had leveled off at about 2 
million but the firm had yet to turn a profit grocery express 
raised its prices but lost customers and even more money 
the next year it came close to shutting down but garvey who 
describes herself as eternally optimistic was sure she could turn 
the company around 
i was just certain this is a business people need she said 
i looked at it from a different point of view long term and 
was willing to spend the additional time and money 
since 1985 garvey has put between 15 million and 2 million 
into the firm reduced prices and used direct mail and radio ads to 
regain former customers and win new ones 
in 1986 sales rose to 23 million with a loss of 330000 and 
last year sales increased to 27 million while the companys loss 
shrank to 75000 
garvey expects to turn a profit this year shes also planning 
to expand her delivery area and is considering opening another 
warehouse 
of her companys future she said its going to be 
interesting to see

a small new jersey company and the local arm 
of international pharmaceutical giant f hoffmannla roche hope to 
profit from the fight against drug abuse through their disposable 
drug testing kits 
the kits are aimed at law enforcement agencies and businesses 
that engaged in onthespot drug testing but can be hampered by 
the time consuming process of having to send samples off to a lab 
for analysis 
drug screening systems inc of blackwood is marketing a system 
called instascreen that it says is as easy to use a brewing a cup 
of coffee which is where the idea originated 
while making a cup of coffee in a mr coffee machine we said 
hey why not do something like this and that was it said 
raymond f akers jr a founder of drug screening systems 
quite honestly it was one of those ah hah things he 
said in an interview 
to use the companys device a urine sample is poured through a 
diskshaped filter that collects detectable amounts concentration 
of any illegal narcotics the filter is chemically treated to hold 
any drug traces and turns the color red if drugs are present 
drug screenings device likely will face competition from the 
number of similar tests being created by other companies one such 
competitor is hoffmannla roche inc of nutley an unit of the 
swiss pharmaceutical giant f hoffmannla roche amp co 
hoffmannla roche plans to put its ontrak system on the market 
in october said albert seidner director of drug abuse marketing 
for hoffmannla roche subsidiary roche diagnostic systems 
ontrak costs about 2 per test for a specific drug urine is 
placed on a channeled slide and a chemical is added to detect drug 
traces the tests come in packages of 40 or 100 and are being tried 
by criminal justice agencies said seidner 
patents have been issued for the hoffmannla roche product he 
said they have been approved for instascreen said akers patent 
lawyer carl spivak of philadelphia but not yet issued 
instascreen kits which cost about 5 contain gloves two 
collection cups strainer chemical disk and vials it also 
includes a bottle for sending positive samples to a lab for 
confirmation 
onsite tests reduce the chance of a mixup because the samples 
do not have to be sent to a lab also the tester does not have to 
wait the usual days or weeks for the sample to be returned 
instascreen and ontrak also are immune to befuddlement by 
vinegar or salt condiments commonly used to mask the presence of 
drugs 
salt flicked from under a fingernail or vinegar added from a 
hidden vial prevents most immunoassay tests from working akers 
said in such tests antibodies bind with the drug chemicals to 
register a positive result but salt and vinegar interfere with the 
reaction 
however instascreen uses chemicals and not antibodies to 
identify a drug presence akers said 
hoffmannla roches test although it is an immunoassay is a 
type that is not defeated by salt or vinegar said seidner 
akers founded drug screening with his father raymond f akers 
sr in march 1987 the company went public in may with a 3 million 
stock offering drug screening will report its first fiscal year 
earnings in several weeks and expects a profit on a projected 3 
million in sales said akers

sales of domesticallyproduced cars slipped 185 
percent in midaugust compared with the same period last year but 
analysts said buyer incentives a year ago colored the latest 
figures 
usmade truck sales fell 18 percent during the aug 1120 
period making for a 132 percent overall decline in sales of 
vehicles from us factories automakers reported wednesday 
the companies reported selling 298580 cars and trucks during 
the period this year compared with 343845 vehicles during the 
same time last year there were nine selling days in both periods 
incentives were just coming in last year and there are no new 
incentive programs right now said david healy an auto industry 
analyst with drexel burnham lambert inc in new york 
healy said the numbers were misleading because of the 
incentives and that they sales are very strong 
arvid jouppi an analyst in detroit disagreed with the strength 
of the sales 
the simple story is its going to take incentives and an early 
influx of 1989 models to get the sales moving up again he said 
car makers have scheduled their 1989model introductions through 
the coming month ford motor co unveiled its 1989 lineup on 
wednesday 
i would say that there is every indication that the industry 
has to do one of two things get into a very intense 
shareofmarket war or they have got to simply come up with 
innovative new incentives jouppi said 
general motors corp showed the largest decline in the 10day 
sales a 303 percent decline to 88394 cars from 126887 during 
the period last year 
fords sales fell 10 percent to 60184 cars from 66907 cars 
last year and chrysler corp sales fell 08 percent to 25985 this 
month from 26200 during the period last august

market share rose to 316 percent from 286 percent and chryslers 
share moved up to 136 percent from 112 percent

midaugust of this year compared with 7563 cars in the same period 
last year a 224 percent increase

ford motor cos 1989 model thunderbirds 
and cougars could help the nations no 2 automaker cut further 
into sales of industry leader general motors corp according to 
one analyst 
ford has been on a hot streak recently and i wouldnt be 
surprised if the new thunderbird and cougar allows them to eat some 
more of general motors lunch as far as market share is 
concerned said david healy of drexel burnham lambert inc 
ford on wednesday unveiled the redesigned thunderbird and cougar 
and said it hopes to sell about 16 million cars and 16 million 
trucks in 1989 a 67 percent increase over this years projected 3 
million total sales 
overall the industry is forecasting a drop from expected sales 
of 104 million cars this year 
at a news conference held to coincide with an auto dealer 
convention in neighboring boston ford executives said the company 
is targeting sales of about 130000 each for the new mercury cougar 
and ford thunderbird which underwent broad design changes in a 
fiveyear multimilliondollar development effort 
tenday us automotive sales figures released wednesday gave 
ford a 31 percent market share compared with 28 percent last year 
at this time while gm slipped from 54 percent to 45 percent 
gms share has been slipping and i wouldnt be surprised if 
these new models keep that trend going healy said 
ford executives said the company will increase production 
capacity at some plants to meet higher demand for 1989 the sales 
targets for the new thunderbird and cougar mark a 30 percent 
increase over this year the company said both cars would be priced 
under 20000 
were convinced at ford that the economy is going to remain as 
good as it is today said ross h roberts general manager of 
fords lincolnmercury division we see nothing on the horizon 
none of those black clouds you frequently hear about that says 
business is going to be bad 
the new cougar is two inches shorter than current models the 
wheelbase is nine inches longer and the car sits lower to the 
ground roberts said the 113inch wheelbase adds 10 cubic feet to 
the passenger compartment it has just six carryover parts from 
this year including the name and crest 
the 1989 model thunderbird which led fords move to aerodynamic 
styling five years ago has a nineinch longer wheelbase than this 
years model low profile headlamps and larger wheels and brakes 
some of the new cougars and thunderbirds will be equipped with a 
standard 38liter v6 engine 
these vehicles are going to come on strong with higher 
performance engines said thomas ogrady of integrated automotive 
resources a market researcher in wayne pa 
ford earned 166 billion in the second quarter of 1988 setting 
an industry earnings record for the second straight threemonth 
period in the first quarter ford earned 1623 billion 
aside from the cougar and thunderbird other new ford lines 
showed few if any changes for 1989 the 50th anniversary of the 
mercury name 
production of thunderbird and cougar is to begin in october the 
cars will be on introduced to the public dec 26 both late starts 
for a new model year which officially begins oct 1 
lincolnmercury is targeting total sales of 717000 cars next 
year a 7 percent market share of a projected 1025 million car 
sales that would be an increase of 03 percentage points over this 
year and give the division its best year since 1978

rp scherer corps management said it plans 
to seek a review of the election of two directors who represent a 
group that favors selling the pharmaceutical capsule maker 
dissident shareholders led by the company founders daughter 
karla scherer fink elected the new directors to the 11member 
scherer board according to proxy voting results announced 
wednesday 
the vote which took place at the companys aug 17 annual 
meeting left directors who back management and oppose selling 
scherer with a 65 edge on the board compared with 85 before the 
vote the dissidents said 
scherer chief executive officer peter fink karla finks 
estranged husband said acknowledged the election of dissident 
candidate frederick frank to the board but said the results of 
close voting in the seat apparently won by dissident theodore 
souris who unseated incumbent peter dow would be reviewed 
theodore won 3019449 votes to dows 2670876 
karla fink and her shareholders committee disputed the need for 
a review spokeswoman beth lyons said the election is final and 
official she said that is the certified count from the 
inspectors 
but peter fink said the company would insist on a complete 
review of proxy cards voted for souris and dow 
in a statement to employees following the meeting he said 
perhaps the most important fact for you to remember is that 
regardless of the outcome of the election we have received no 
offers to buy the company 
furthermore even if mrs finks nominees for directors are 
both seated she would still not have enough support on the board 
of directors to gain approval for her proposed sale of the 
company fink said 
karla fink has said she would try to convince additional 
directors of the wisdom of putting the company up for sale and 
launch another proxy fight at next years annual meeting to try to 
elect additional directors backing her position 
scherer chairman wilber mack adjourned the meeting until 10 am 
sept 1 saying results of the review would be announced then 
karla fink and board member john scherer the son of company 
founder john s scherer disputed macks authority to adjourn and 
stated they were accepting the voting results as announced 
scherer with 2800 employees is a leading maker of soft 
gelatin capsules for drugs vitamin supplements and similar 
products it had record sales of 2907 million and earnings of 
151 million for its fiscal year ending march 31

french industrialist bernard tapie 
wants to take over donnay sa the belgian tennis racket maker that 
went bankrupt last week officials said thursday 
tapie is welcome but if another serious candidate presents a 
more credible more interesting offer he will have priority 
said jacques hardy a union spokesman 
the daily le soir reported tapie 43 has already reached a 
tentative takeover accord under which 150 of the 350 jobs would 
be saved 
in recent years tapie has bought a range of failing firms and 
made them profitable becoming something of a symbol of french 
entrepreneurial spirit 
donnay the worlds number one racket maker a decade ago was 
declared bankrupt last friday by a belgian court after failing to 
reach agreement with creditors on new funds and a restructuring of 
its debt 
hours later damaco international of hong kong became the first 
takeover candidate 
donnay based in couvin near the french border is 
majorityowned by the donnay family it reached its peak when bjorn 
borg advertised its rackets but began to lose money after the 
swedish tennis ace retired in 1981 
donnay has debts of 14 billion belgium francs 35 million in 
1987 its revenue was 116 billion francs 29 million down a 
third from 1986 and posted a loss of 80 million francs 2 
million 
early in the decade donnay made over 15 million rackets a year 
and had a staff of 600 after borg retired its output of tennis 
rackets fell by 50 percent and its staff was cut to 350 
officials said this was because donnay ignored the trend for 
rackets made of synthetic products and failed to sign a new tennis 
star to advertise its product

farmers insurance group inc has agreed to a 
52 billion cash acquisition by batus inc ending an acrimonious 
eightmonth takeover battle 
the agreement at a price 3 per share higher than batus last 
publicly announced bid was revealed wednesday night by the chairmen 
of los angelesbased farmers and batus the louisville kybased 
tobacco and retailing company 
the agreement for a friendly merger at 75 a share would give 
batus british parent bat industries plc a foothold in the us 
financial services industry 
the two sides began discussing a friendly buyout late last week 
when batus offered 72 per share an increase of 9 per share over 
its previous best offer 
stock of farmers the seventhlargest property and casualty 
insurer dipped 50 cents to 6925 a share in active 
overthecounter trading wednesday the agreement was announced 
hours after the market closed 
in reaching its unanimous decision farmers board of 
directors considered the concerns regarding this combination which 
have been raised during regulatory hearings and has been satisfied 
that these concerns will be adequately addressed in the merger of 
the two companies said leo e denlea jr chairman and chief 
executive officer of farmers group inc 
we firmly believe that farmers and batus can work with the 
insurance regulators to give the assurances necessary to enable 
this merger to be accomplished to the benefit of all parties 
denlea added 
farmers resistance to batus included suggestions that the 
company had suppressed research pointing to the dangers of smoking 
farmers also persuaded a number of state and national lawmakers to 
attack the british parent firm because it has operations in 
racially segregated south africa 
but the merger talks which began last wednesday were strictly 
business said patrick sheehy chairman of both bat and batus 
i think often things that are said in court are much more 
acrimonious than ones true feelings sheehy said in an 
interview when it came to sitting down and talking we both 
decided we were going to do it in a spirit of trust and good will 
sheehy said farmers was pursued because it was found to be the 
us insurer most like bats british insurance business 
attractions included similar lines of insurance and a 
companyoperated network of 14000 agents 
sheehy said negotiations were complicated by farmers structure 
the farmers group is made up of three policyholderowned insurance 
exchanges and a companyowned life insurance business 
farmers has 684 million common shares outstanding 
batus promised that farmers operations would be essentially 
unchanged under the new ownership and farmers suggested it would 
drop its fierce resistance to batus in hearings before insurance 
regulators in several states 
a joint announcement said that batus farmers farmers insurance 
exchange fire insurance exchange and truck insurance exchange the 
reciprocal insurance exchanges managed by farmers have agreed to 
provisions that would assure that the exchanges and their 
policyholders would not be adversely affected in the merger 
batus began pursuing farmers in january with a friendly offer of 
60 a share that was spurned by farmers management 
farmers resisted the buyout in hearings before insurance 
regulators in nine states where the merger needed approval 
the company claimed that batus which owns the maker of kool and 
viceroy cigarettes was unlikely to continue farmers emphasis on 
nonsmoker insurance discounts batus has vowed to continue the 
discounts 
the merger won the approval of insurance regulators in arizona 
and was given conditional approval in ohio and illinois idaho 
washington and oregon have rejected the deal and decisions or 
hearings are pending in texas and kansas 
california regulators rejected the merger but that decision was 
overturned by a state court

chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson said the interest rate 
hike was necessary and that interest rates would remain at current

reductions from the independent union of flight attendants over 
three years as part of its plan for financial recovery 
the unions counterproposal involved smaller wage cuts ms 
schneider said

the flight attendants contract expires on aug 31 under 
federal labor rules the union could strike at the end of a 30day 
coolingoff period following the declaration of an impasse by 
the mediator 
margaret brennan the unions president issued a statement

the dow jones average of 30 industrials which climbed 3734

trading

every 1000 in face value while its yield jumped to 947 percent 
from 940 percent 
analysts said the increase in european rates stirred speculation 
that us rates could also be headed higher that hurt stocks 
because higher rates could cut corporate profits and make 
government notes and bonds more attractive 
the us governments announcement today that it had revised its 
estimate of secondquarter economic growth upward to 33 percent

a survey revealed that 95 percent of 
americas business travelers received no training on how to 
efficiently and effectively travel 
in addition 72 percent of the corporate travel planners said 
their companies did not provide formal training or orientation 
about business travel for their employees according to the survey 
commissioned by the nonprofit marriott business travel institute 
brian tierney executive director of the institute said 
american business spends more than 66 billion annually on business 
travel and 32 billion on training as a whole but not on 
travelling 
he said many business travelers are not properly prepared for 
the rigors of travel and become frustrated as soon as they pack 
their bags 
this frustration leads to a tired hassled traveler whose 
ability to be productive and to conduct business on the road can 
be seriously affected he said 
those frustrations can come from wasted time at airports hotels 
and car rental agencies untrained travelers often do not request 
advanced boarding passes for their flights dont know that they 
can ask for rental car express reservation and fail to use express 
or video checkout at hotels 
by understanding these and other basic ins and outs of 
business travel which can be communicated in employee training 
programs business travelers can improve their efficiency and 
effectiveness and find the rigors of travel less stressful 
tierney said 
the mbti was established earlier this year to research observe 
monitor and report issues trends and developments that have an 
impact on present day business travel 
in the survey the mbti asked 75 business travelers if they had 
received any formal training or orientation from their employers 
before they took their first business trip those who had not 
received training then were asked about benefits they would have 
received if formal training had been offered 
the benefits mentioned most were reductions in stress and cost 
better use of time greater productivity and more enjoyment 
the corporate travel managers questioned agreed with the 
benefits and added that a welltrained traveler projects a more 
professional image

consumer prices continue to ease under a 
tough government antiinflation program with prices rising 07 
percent in the first half of august the central bank of mexico 
announced wednesday night 
it predicted smaller increases in consumer prices for the 
remainder of the month once sales taxes are reduced and other 
measures taken under the governments economic solidarity pact 
the central bank attributed most of the rise in the consumer 
price index to residual effects of price hikes for meat and 
services in the final days of july 
without this influence the index would have remained 
practically stable the bank said in a statement 
prices for fruits fresh vegetables sugar personal items and 
electric appliances actually fell between aug 115 while rents 
at two percent and clothing at 12 percent led price gains 
the bank forecast even lower inflation for the rest of august 
because of reductions in the value added tax for basic goods and 
medicines that went into effect aug 18 
the government enacted its economic solidarity pact in december 
as inflation was reaching a record 1592 percent for all of 1987 
a freeze on the peso currency exchange rate the federal minimum 
wage and prices for governmentregulated goods and services forms 
the centerpiece of the program 
under the pact inflation reached 433 percent for the first 
seven months of 1988 while the annual rate since july 1987 was 
1223 percent 
on aug 14 the government announced modifications to the pact 
and extended it to nov 30 president miguel de la madrids last 
day in office 
while maintaining the freezing of wages official prices and the 
peso exchange rate the government said it would reduce sales taxes 
from six to zero percent on processed foods and medicines by sept 
1 
it also ordered retailers to reduce prices for their goods an 
average of 3 percent compared to prices in effect between july 7 
and august 7 
on saturday commerce department inspectors closed several 
mexico city pharmacies for failing to abide by the new price 
guidelines 
commerce secretary hector hernandez cervantes said wednesday the 
government will launch a national media campaign reminding 
consumers that savings from the sales tax reductions must be 
reflected in prices at the cash register the ads will urge 
consumers to report suspected violations to authorities 
the government also plans to publish lists of retailers prices 
for thousands of consumer items to compel compliance with the pact 
hernandez cervantes said

the economy expanded at a brisk annual rate of 
33 percent from april through june in spite of a severe shock from 
the drought that seared much of the country the government 
reported today 
the gross national product the broadest measure of economic 
health expanded at essentially the same rate as in the first 
quarter when the gnp rose at an annual rate of 34 percent 
but inflation in the second quarter the commerce department 
said was accelerating at its fastest pace in almost six years 
the economy is growing much too fast and if it isnt reigned 
in quickly it is surely going to mean that inflation will be much 
more pronounced said robert dederick chief economist for 
northern trust co of chicago 
it is nice to grow fast in the early stages of an expansion 
when you have a lot of unemployemnt but at this stage we just 
cant afford it he said 
the robust 33 percent growth rate occurred despite the fact 
that the impact of the drought on farm production shaved a full 
percentage point from second quarter growth the government said 
today 
without the drought the gnp would have shot up at a 43 percent 
annual rate in the apriljune period 
the government estimated that the drought will reduce farm 
output by 143 billion in 1988 shaving about 04 percentage point 
from growth for the full year 
even with the troubles in the farm belt however the economy 
continued to show its resiliency propelled by a sharp turnaround 
in the countrys trade deficit and strong growth in business 
investment and consumer spending 
but inflation accelerated as well with a gnp price index that 
measures a changing market basket of goods rising at an annual rate 
of 51 percent the fastest increase since a 58 percent rise in 
the third quarter of 1982 
the big surge in inflation which followed an increase of 17 
percent in the first quarter was blamed on higher consumer prices 
for clothing food and gasoline 
the burst of inflation served to emphasize the problems facing 
the expansion which has already lasted a peacetime record of 69 
months 
with growth so robust the economy is beginning to see rising 
inflationary pressures from tight labor markets and demand 
outstripping production 
the federal reserve since march has been pushing interest rates 
higher to dampen demand but many economists are worried that 
unless growth slows in the coming quarters the central bank will 
have to clamp down even harder and risk pushing the country into a 
recession in 1989 
in good news for republican presidential chances however 
economists see no likelihood that economic growth will slow 
appreciably before the nov 8 election 
many analysts believe the economy in the current quarter may be 
expanding at an even faster rate than in the spring 
the reagan administration has already boosted its economic 
growth projection for the full year to 35 percent which would be 
the best performance since 1984 
todays gnp estimate of 33 percent for the second quarter 
represented an upward revision from a month ago when the 
government put gnp growth at a lower 31 percent during the quarter 
the improvement came from higher spending by the federal 
goverment consumers and businesses than previously estimated 
the trade deficit shrank at an annual rate of 189 billion in 
the second quarter the best showing since 1980 
this coupled with a 27 percent rise in consumer spending and a 
sharp 179 percent advance in business investment provided much of 
the economys strength during the quarter 
this strength was offset somewhat by the drought originally 
the government had estimated that the drought reduced gnp growth by 
onehalf percentage point in the second quarter with farm losses 
mounting however the government has doubled the adverse impact 
saying that farm losses totaled 95 billion at an annual rate in 
the second quarter analysts estimated that figure would rise even 
higher in the third and fourth quarters 
the various changes left the gnp after adjusting for inflation 
at an annual rate of 399 trillion in the second quarter 
in other good news the government said today that aftertax 
corporate profits shot up 115 percent in the second quarter 
following a 25 percent rise in the first quarter the performance 
was the best showing since a 145 percent rise in the second 
quarter of 1983 
many private economists believe that the administrations growth 
estimate for the entire year is too low 
the monthly survey of 51 top economists by blue chip economic 
indicators a financial newsletter put the consensus estimate of 
gnp growth for this year at 38 percent 
the economy has shown surprising strength this year in the wake 
of last octobers stock market collapse many analysts were 
forecasting a recession this year 
however growth has stayed at strong levels propelled by a big 
turnaround in the us trade deficit which has boosted the fortunes 
of american manufacturing companies 
consumer spending and business investment to expand production 
facilities also have contributed to the strength this year 
this rapid growth has helped push unemployment down to 14year 
lows but the rapid growth also has begun to push up against supply 
restraints because of tight labor markets and high operating rates 
in many industries 
this often translates into rising inflationary pressures as 
workers demand higher wages and businesses boost prices 
to fight the inflationary pressures the federal reserve since 
late march has been boosting interest rates to dampen demand 
earlier this month it hiked its discount rate onehalf percentage 
point to 65 percent 
this credit tightening many economists believe will slow 
growth starting in the fourth quarter and extending into next year 
some analysts are worried that if inflationary pressures 
continue to increase and the fed is forced to clamp down further 
the risks of a substantial slowdown and possibly even a recession 
will rise for 1989

west germanys central bank raised a key interest rate today to 
35 percent from 3 percent because of the stronger dollar and 
central banks in several western european countries quickly 
followed 
the action marked the latest in a round of higher interest rates 
worldwide and came a few weeks after the us federal reserve 
tightened credit in the united states by pushing interest rates 
higher 
the us currency slumped in response to the action today by the 
west german bundesbank and other european banks the dollar was 
quoted at around 18660 west german marks at midmorning in new 
york down sharply from 18820 marks late wednesday 
in britain the bank of england signaled a full percentage point 
increase in the british commercial banks base lending rate to 12 
percent following a government report on the countrys trade 
deficit in july 
the report showed the july trade gap soared 72 percent to a 
record 265 billion pounds or about 45 billion 
the central banks of switzerland austria and the netherlands 
announced interest rate hikes shortly after the bundesbank move 
in tokyo however a senior bank of japan official said there is 
absolutely no need to consider an adjustment in japans monetary 
policy just because the bundesbank and the bank of england raised 
their base rates 
the higher west german discount rate goes into effect on friday 
the bundesbank said in a statement the discount rate is the 
interest the bundesbank charges on loans to other banks 
the bundesbank was selling dollars in the open market shortly 
after making its announcement according to currency dealers in 
frankfurt west germany 
karl otto poehl president of the bundesbank cited the weakness 
of the west german mark against the dollar as a reason for lifting 
the key rate which makes markdenominated investments more 
attractive 
todays step is an important signal which will be understood 
by the foreignexchange and capital markets poehl said it 
should lead to stabilization of the currency and capital markets 
and the first reactions should show this is the case 
following the bundesbank action the dollar slid to 18640 marks 
at the frankfurt currency exchange in early afternoon 
earlier the us currency had fallen to an official frankfurt 
fixing of 18764 marks from wednesdays official level of 18960 
marks 
poehl told reporters that the dollars strength against the mark 
endangered efforts to adjust trade imbalances between the worlds 
major trading partners 
he also said the bundesbank will continue to do everything to 
stem the decline of the mark against the dollar 
the bundesbank president also said the discount rate increase 
was aimed at curbing west german inflation and bringing the 
countrys abovetarget money supply growth back into the proper 
range 
the bundesbank has adjusted domestic interest rates upwards 
three times in the past eight weeks

americas economy and corporate profits expanded briskly this 
spring the government said today but the news was overshadowed by 
higher inflation rising interest rates slumping financial markets 
and a slowdown in home sales 
the commerce department said the gross national product the 
broadest measure of economic health rose at an annual rate of 33 
percent from april through june despite severe shock from the 
drought that seared much of the country the gnp rate of expansion 
was unchanged from the first quarter 
without the drought the gnp would have shot up at a 43 percent 
annual rate in the apriljune period 
the government also said aftertax corporate profits shot up 
115 percent in the second quarter following a 25 percent rise in 
the first quarter the performance was the best since a 145 
percent rise in the 1983 second quarter 
but apriljune inflation as measured by a gnp price index rose 
at an annual rate of 51 percent the fastest increase since a 58 
percent rise in the third quarter of 1982 the department said the 
surge was blamed on higher prices for clothes food and fuel 
further obscuring the gnp and corporate profit news was that key 
west european nations raised interest rates today blaming the move 
on the stronger us dollar and consequent weakness in their own 
currencies the increases signaled another round of higher interest 
rates worldwide 
those developments helped incite a selloff in the bond market a 
sensitive barometer of interest rates and the economy the 
treasurys key 30year issue fell nearly 750 per 1000 in face 
amount and its yield rose to 946 percent from 939 percent late 
wednesday 
on wall street where traders were recalling the stock market 
peak a year ago today prices slid as well the dow jones 
industrial average was down about 18 points to the 2008 level by 
late morning 
rising interest rates also played a key role in a 5 percent drop 
in existing singlefamily home sales last month a real estate 
trade group said today the national association of realtors said 
the decline was partly the result of higher mortgage costs 
the developments came a day after the government reported 
americas trade deficit shrank 15 percent in the apriljune 
quarter which heartened republicans fighting to retain the white 
house but didnt impress the financial markets 
the difference between what the united states spends and sells 
abroad narrowed to a deficit of 299 billion in the second 
quarter compared with a 352 billion deficit in the first quarter 
many economists regard the trade deficit as one of the most 
visible weaknesses in the economy reflecting a relentless 
addiction to cheap imports and consequent difficulty for domestic 
companies trying to compete democrats have attempted to make the 
trade deficit an issue in the presidential campaign 
but the improvement reported wednesday suggested us 
manufacturers were making strong gains in selling abroad some 
economists are predicting the trade deficit will drop by nearly 25 
percent for the entire year marking the first annual improvement 
since president reagan took office 
republicans are hoping voters will focus on the improvement 
which already has shown up in the commerce departments monthly 
merchandise trade reports 
in other economic news major automakers said wednesday that 
midaugust sales of usmade cars and trucks fell by 132 percent 
from the same period a year earlier when sales were inflated by 
buyers taking advantage of dealer incentives

a federal judge today denied motions for a 
new trial for a maryland entrepreneur the former president of the 
sevenup co and a soft drink bottler who had been convicted of 
price fixing 
morton m lapides 57 chairman of the board of alleghany 
beverage corp of cheverly md and james j harford former 
president of midatlantic cocacola bottling of silver spring md 
and the alleghany bottling co were convicted following a sixweek 
trial in april and may 
lapides and harford face a maximum three years in prison 
alleghany faces a maximum 1 million fine us district judge 
robert g doumar was expected to impose sentences today 
i am very concerned with restitution to the public doumar 
said people who believe money is the answer to any crime because 
they are a corporation should think differently when they enter 
this court 
at the time of his conviction harford was the president of 
sevenup but resigned that post three days after the conviction 
harfords conviction was the result of actions while heading the 
cocacola bottling firm and did not involve sevenup 
the convictions were part of an ongoing justice department 
probe of the soft drink industry which has resulted in 11 grand 
jury investigations in eight other states 
lapides and harford were convicted of rigging the wholesale 
price of their respective products in 1983 and 1984 alleghany 
beverage was the parent company of alleghany pepsicola bottling 
co until 1985 when lapides sold the subsidiary for 160 million 
during the trial the defense contended that neither man knew of 
the scheme and that if the allegations were true then it was the 
work of lower level employees who made decisions without their 
bosses knowledge 
federal prosecutors argued that the two bottlers reached an 
accord to halt the previous bitter competition by fixing the 
wholesale price of their products sold to schools motels hotels 
and other commercial buyers in maryland and virgina 
midatlantic pleaded guilty to earlier similar indictments and 
agreed to pay 2 million in fines for price rigging in virginia and 
washington dc markets 
in march both bottling firms also agreed to rebate 45000 to 
virginia to be distributed to school districts for overcharges on 
their soft drink purchases the agreement drawn up by attorney 
general mary sue terry called for midatlantic to pay 30000 and 
alleghany 15000 
prior to the april conviction several other soft drink 
executives have been found guilty or pleaded guilty to a variety of 
charges 
in february 1987 armand s gravely a former richmond division 
manager for alleghany was convicted of price fixing and 
obstruction of justice he was sentenced to four months in jail and 
fined 15000 
edward l wynns a midatlantic vice president pleaded guilty 
in may 1987 to charges he lied to the grand jury investigating the 
price fixing 
the former president of alleghany bottling james p sheridan of 
timonium md was given a 3year sentence with all but 120 days 
suspended and fined 45000 in august 1987 after pleading guilty 
to price fixing 
a third executive indicted along with lapides and harford odis 
r allen a midatlantic vice president pleaded guilty to price 
fixing in march

more than 120000 skins of a protected species of 
alligator were smuggled into japan during the past seven months 
using stolen or falsified export documents a wildlife protection 
organization said thursday 
traffic japan the wildlife trade monitoring group of the world 
wide fund for nature said the south american caiman skins were 
shipped by a complex route involving at least seven south american 
and asian countries before they arrived in japan 
at least 46 tons of the skins from more than 120000 
alligators entered japan in the first seven months of this year 
through thailand alone the group said it said it believed the 
skins were part of a larger shipment that was loaded onto 
asiabound ships off the coast of uruguay at the end of last year 
the declared customs value of the skins was about 427 million 
yen about 32 million but retail value would be four to five 
times more spokeswoman cecila song said the skins are used in 
japan mainly for belts and watchbands 
permits are required for the export of south american caiman 
skins under the regulations of the convention on international 
trade in endangered species cites an international treaty 
regulating trade in protected plants and animals song said 
japanese officials allowed the shipments to enter the country 
without proper verification of the export documents the group said 
in a statement 
traffics 8month investigation has revealed a serious lapse 
of cites administration in thailand and japan and has uncovered a 
long paper trail of illegal cites documents and other ploys 
involving thailand colombia chile venezuela and singapore to 
mask the illegal origins of the poached skins the statement said 
it said japans ministry of international trade and industry had 
responded to evidence of illegal caiman trade by instituting a new 
voluntary check system on all imports of the skins 
but unless they come up with a system involving legal 
penalties we dont think there will be any improvement especially 
with the high profits involved song said 
ministry officials were not available thursday night for comment

a federal appeals court has ruled that cnw corp 
may sell 208 miles of railroad without giving labor unions a voice 
in the sale 
the decision by the 7th us circuit court of appeals affirms an 
earlier us district court ruling 
the decision also bars a threatened strike against cnws chicago 
amp north western transportation co railroad by unions opposed to 
the proposed track sale 
the railway labor executives association had filed a motion to 
stop the railroad from closing the sale to frvr corp a subsidiary 
of chicagobased itel corp 
the association said wednesday it was considering appealing the 
circuit court decision to the us supreme court 
the labor group citing the railway labor act had argued that 
the railroad was obligated to negotiate over the effects of the 
sale on its employees because it will result in changed pay 
seniority and working conditions 
cnw contended the labor issues involved constitute a minor 
dispute that should be resolved in binding arbitration 
we are free to sell branch lines to regional line operators 
said company spokesman james foote after the ruling the decision 
means the unions cant strike over the sale because its a minor 
dispute 
the section of track which runs from milwaukee to green bay 
wis will be called the fox river valley railroad after the sale 
to frvr is complete foote said 
chicagobased cnw is the holding company for the railroad a 
leading midwest freight hauler that also operates area commuter 
trains used by 41000 people 
the sale of the line is not related to a contract dispute over 
train crew size that caused a brief strike at campnw earlier this 
month the walkout was halted by congress which extended a 
coolingoff period until sept 9

the pentagon said today it believes the soviet 
unions jet fighter program has benefitted from the diversion of 
french milling equipment in a case of illegal exporting that rivals 
the wrongdoing by japans toshiba corp 
fred hoffman a pentagon spokesman said a french concern by the 
name of forest line is under investigation by authorities in france 
and the united states 
the investigation involves the alleged diversion of dozens of 
very sophisticated milling machines to military users in the soviet 
union hoffman added 
we believe the machines were used in the soviet mig jet 
fighter program 
hoffman was asked about the investigation after another top 
pentagon official stephen d bryen told a group of pentagon 
reporters wednesday that us authorities have been deeply involved 
in investigating a serious technology diversion case 
bryen the deputy undersecretary of defense for trade security 
policy refused at the time to identify the company under 
investigation he said only that american investigators were 
receiving splendid cooperation in the matter that some 
individuals already had been charged and other arrests would 
follow and that he hoped to make more information available in a 
few months 
other government sources then disclosed wednesday the 
investigation concerned a french company known as forest line that 
once went by the name of ratierforest and that information was 
subsequently acknowledged by hoffman 
the case involves a french company which is currently 
under investigation by the french government said hoffman the 
company name is forest line 
the other sources who insisted on anonymity said us 
intelligence agents tipped the french early this year about alleged 
forest line sales of heavy milling equipment to the soviet union 
there has been good cooperation said one source we 
shared information with them and they moved quickly 
the french case surfaced last spring but attracted little notice 
then 
french authorities disclosed in april that four people had been 
arrested under antiespionage laws including louis tardy chairman 
of machines francaises lourdes and jeanpaul chamouton president 
of forest line 
machines francaises lourdes now bankrupt was the parent 
company of forest line which specialized in manufacturing heavy 
tool equipment 
no trials have been held and the status of the cases is unclear 
the toshiba scandal came to a head earlier this year when the 
toshiba machine co a majorityowned subsidiary was found guilty 
in a japanese court of illegally trading hightech items with the 
soviet union the firm was convicted of selling sophisticated 
milling machines to the soviet union in the early 1980s the 
machines can be used to fashion quiet submarine propellers 
us military experts claim the toshiba sale has complicated 
dramatically the task of locating russian subs 
bryen while never naming the company now under investigation 
drew attention to the matter wednesday when asked if the pentagon 
had become involved in any other major export probes since toshiba 
theres even a bigger one but its different bryen 
replied its a different kind of case because first of all 
weve had splendid cooperation on it theres more much more 
involved than the toshiba case 
its certainly serious and its in a different field its in 
the aerospace area he said its under investigation and there 
have already been some equivalent of us indictments on the case 
in another country theres going to be some others 
but im going to be real cagey on this because i dont want to 
spring it yet but i think in the next few months we should be 
prepared to describe it in more detail 
asked if any american citizens were known to be involved he 
replied not that i know of at the moment 
the toshiba incident helped lead to enactment of new trade 
legislation and sanctions against that company in the united states 
as well as a japanese government overhaul of export licensing 
procedures 
last fall when revelations about the toshiba case were 
surfacing a norwegian police investigation found that several 
european companies including forest line had conspired to 
divert sensitive technology to the soviets dating back to the 1970s 
the us sources said wednesday however that the current 
investigation involved equipment sales that continued at least 
through 1986 and possibly 1987 long after the last toshiba 
transaction 
thats what makes it serious one source said 
the forest line equipment said to include huge milling 
machinery that can be used to fabricate aircraft fuselages and jet 
engine turbine blades was allegedly sold to the soviets after 
corporate executives submitted fraudulent applications for export 
licenses the sources said 
bryen told reporters the reagan administration has made great 
strides in clamping down on the exports of sensitive military 
technology to the east bloc and in convincing us allies to do the 
same

if the thought of giving an afterdinner speech 
makes you nervous singing in a foreign language for prospective 
clients might cause you to lose your appetite 
honolulu attorney wallace fujiyama did not like the idea but 
after socializing with japanese clients he realized american 
business skills were not enough to assure success in tokyo 
he spoke japanese but he says he needed to learn to sing it 
if youre going to succeed as a businessman you have to do 
business the way they do it and in japan everybody sings says 
fujiyama everybody from the ordinary salary worker to the 
corporate presidents and executives 
the songfests usually begin after a business meeting or social 
gathering he says when the companys executives take their turn 
at the microphone singing popular japanese tunes after they are 
finished their guests such as fujiyama are invited to give it a 
go 
for you to refuse is a great insult but to sing badly is even 
worse he says 
so fujiyama began to practice first by singing along in his car 
with karaoke tapes which are highquality instrumental 
versions of popular songs later one of his japanese clients gave 
him with an elaborate sound system for his downtown honolulu 
office complete with laser disk two tape players and an oversized 
video screen so he could watch his technique 
a star was not quite born but fujiyama swears he is improving 
i still dont want to sing out in public but ive gotten 
better i can carry a tune now he says 
fujiyama cannot explain the cultural differences that cause 
japanese young and old to sing at home along with variety shows 
which flash the lyrics on the television screen and at 
karaoke bars with professional equipment light shows and 
audiences while americans tend to sing in their cars with the 
windows rolled up and are relieved when they manage happy 
birthday without embarrassing themselves 
but bill feltz who specializes in japanese culture at the 
eastwest center here has some ideas 
japanese as in many countries are not as ashamed of singing 
as we are in the united states says feltz who as an 
ethnomusicologist studies music of asian cultures there youre 
not expected to sing like bruce springsteen or beverly sills 
in many asian cultures feltz says people have a common 
repertoire and sing songs they learned as children for their entire 
lives in the united states he said more emphasis is put on the 
quality so elementary school students who once belted out my 
country tis of thee with abandon learn to be selfconscious 
and clam up as they grow older 
thats what happened to adrian mangiboyat 32 who left his job 
as a reporter for the pacific business news here to teach english 
in a japanese village 
i guess i sang at school as a little kid but i outgrew that 
i never sang along with the radio in the shower nothing like 
that he says but when i applied for the job in japan they 
said singing was an integral part of japanese culture and i knew i 
was in trouble 
mangiboyat earned the teaching position in a program sponsored 
by the japanese government but before he departed for 
yabukimachi a small town 100 miles north of tokyo he enrolled at 
the university of hawaii 
in a nineweek course called voice training for the tone 
deaf mangiboyat and other wouldbe warblers spent two hours a 
week learning scales pitch and simple songs their homework 
included taking the stage at a local karaoke bar popular with 
japanese tourists 
the japanese officials said being able to sing will give me an 
edge with my students and the other villagers it will show them 
that i really tried to learn about their culture 
fujiyama agrees 
by asking you to sing with them theyre saying lets be 
friends

west germanys central bank 
raised a key interest rate thursday to defend the value of its 
currency and fend off inflation leading a round of rate hikes in 
europe 
the bundesbank raised its discount rate which it charges on 
loans to other banks by half a percentage point to 35 percent 
karl otto poehl president of the bundesbank cited the weakness 
of the mark against the us dollar as a main reason for lifting 
the discount rate 
the higher discount rate should cause other interest rates to 
rise that would support the exchange value of the mark by making 
markdenominated investments more attractive 
the dollar eased more than a pfennig to level around 18650 
marks soon after the bundesbanks announcement 
france great britain switzerland the netherlands and austria 
followed the bundesbanks lead and raised rates 
todays step is an important signal which will be understood 
by the foreign exchange and capital markets poehl said 
poehl told reporters that the dollars strength against the mark 
endangered efforts to adjust trade imbalances between the worlds 
major trading partners 
he also said the bundesbank will continue to do everything to 
stem the decline of the mark against the dollar 
poehl also said the discount rate increase was aimed at curbing 
inflation and bringing the countrys abovetarget money supply 
growth back into the proper range the marks weakness has 
contributed to inflation by raising import prices 
the bundesbank decided to keep its lombard rate steady at 5 
percent and indicated no change in its rate on securities 
repurchase agreements 
the bundesbank has adjusted german interest rates upwards three 
times in the past eight weeks it raised the lombard rate to 5 
percent from 45 percent on july 28 following a hike in the 
discount rate to 3 percent from 25 percent on june 30

29 billion in may 
britains four leading commercial banks barclays bank plc 
midland bank plc lloyds bank plc and national westminster bank plc 
quickly responded to the bank of englands signal 
many market watchers had anticipated an increase of only half a 
percentage point in the base lending rate 
it was the eighth increase in the benchmark rate since early 
june when the rate stood at a 10year low of 75 percent and it 
brought the base lending rate to its highest level since january 
1986 the previous hikes were halfpoint increases with the most 
recent coming on aug 8 
the import figures confirm that the economy has been growing 
too fast we have to slow it down and that means higher interest 
rates chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson said 
spurred by britains strong consumer spending imports jumped 13 
percent across the board to 943 billion pounds or about 16 
billion in july while exports fell 09 percent to 678 billion 
pounds or 115 billion 
the government is determined to do whatever is necessary to 
keep inflation under control lawson said in a british 
broadcasting corp radio interview the economy as a whole is 
doing extremely well he added 
the fullpoint interestrate hike was viewed as a major 
additional tightening of monetary policy to help reduce the growing 
inflationary pressures in the economy prime minister margaret 
thatcher has repeatedly said that reducing such pressures is her 
top economic priority 
inflation in britain increased to an annual rate of 48 percent 
in july from 46 percent in june 
a spate of recent economic reports has confirmed 
fasterthanexpected growth in the british economy 
on tuesday for example the goverment reported that britains 
inflationadjusted gross domestic product measured by the output 
of goods and services rose 13 percent in the second quarter from 
the first the markets had expected a rise of only 1 percent 
recent weakness in the pound exacerbated by the latest trade 
report has given the thatcher government room to increase interest 
rates without pushing the pound dangerously high which would hurt 
british exports even more 
we now have a genuine balanceofpayments crisis these 
figures are appalling said john shepperd director of the london 
investment firm warburg securities referring to the july trade 
report 
the latest trade deficit compared with a 102 billion pound or 
17 billion gap in july 1987 
britains currentaccount deficit jumped to 215 billion pounds 
in july up from a revised deficit of 104 billion pounds in june 
and a deficit of 323 million pounds in july 1987 
the current account includes invisible trade such as 
services foreign investment earnings and official transfer 
payments which was estimated to be in surplus by 500 million 
pounds in july

its not often that a compact car with a 
fourcylinder engine can offer a decent sportycar ride but the 
1988 pontiac grand am se is no typical fourcylinder compact 
for starters the standard 2liter fuelinjected engine is 
turbocharged and can produce 165 horspower pontiac adds it can go 
from 0 to 60 in a brisk eight seconds 
the grand am ses standard suspension package includes goodyear 
eagle gt4 allseason radial tires and stabilizer bars that make 
for a firm stable ride 
inside theres a sporty feel with the thick leatherwrapped 
steering wheel contoured front bucket seats molded to hold your 
body in place and turbo boost gauge set amid a sporty driver area 
outside the grand am se is one of the prettiest of general 
motors corps cars with bumpers and front side and rear skirts 
that match the body so theres no gaudy chrome 
in fact the styling which debuted in the 1985 model year 
helps explain why the grand am is the pontiac divisions volume 
leader 
from the buyers perspective it has snazzy styling said 
pontiac spokesman reggie harris exterior styling and cost are the 
two main reasons cited by buyers he added 
the lowestpriced grand am is 10269 including 400 for 
shipping harris said but the se test car totaled just under 
15000 
that 1000015000 price range encompasses many of the grand 
ams competitors such as the buick skylark and dodge lancer which 
start around 10400 and the honda prelude which starts around 
13600 
harris noted the grand am which comes in three versions the 
grand am the le and the se is particularly adept at luring young 
buyers 
median age of buyers is 32 with 63 percent under age 35 harris 
said fortyeven percent are male 55 percent are married and 38 
percent have college education median income is 40000 annually 
the test car an se was fun to drive the suspension and 
engine linked to a threespeed automatic transmission offered 
somewhat of a musclecar ride complete with throaty rumble from 
under the hood during hard accelerations 
handling was admirable even at high speeds there was no roll 
no sway 
the trunk was roomy and the rear seats split and folded down 
for more storage space 
there were nice touches inside for driver and passengers map 
lights were available in front and rear 
front visors had slits in the material to slip paper maps 
etc and netting on the back of the front seats offered spots for 
newspapers magazines for rearseat passengers 
controls for the amfm stereo and cassette player as well as 
ventilation were conveniently located at the front of the center 
console 
fit and finish inside and out was excellent 
i noticed a few problems too at 5foot4 i found it difficult 
to put the seat belt into its latch alongside the driver seat once 
i had the seat moved up to where i could touch the pedals 
comfortably 
the seat belt latch was jammed between the driver seat and the 
center console storage area it was also difficult to unlatch the 
belt without first moving the driver seat back a ways for the same 
reason 
the grand am has a cruise control system found in many other gm 
cars that is mounted on the turn signal stalk as with the other gm 
cars i sometimes discovered the lever in the on position even when 
the cruise wasnt actuated 
still its unsettling to glance down and see it on 
rear seating for three might be snug 
the car also gulped down the gasoline fuel economy is rated at 
20 miles per gallon in the city and 27 mpg on the highway but in 
my demanding cityhighway driving i didnt get 20 
lastly the center console had yellow spots that would light up 
to indicate what gear the automatic transmission was in but in 
bright sunlight it was murder trying to see what gear the shifter 
had settled in 
consumer reports says the 1986 grand am with fourcylinder 
engine the latest model it has information for had an average 
record for trouble up from worsehanaverage for the 1985 model 
still 1988 looks to be the best year for grand am yet with 
projections of 220000 sales compared with 216065 in the 1987 
model year and 190994 in the 1986 model year 
were in great shape for that car line harris said noting 
sales have been on target 
he said even mary kay the cosmetics company has ordered a 
fleet of 5000 grand ams for its employees but he quickly added 
they wont be pink

wellpositioned to get a good share of those orders 
both gpa rolls ltd of shannon ireland and delta air lines of 
atlanta have said they may be interested in ordering large numbers 
of boeing planes possibly this year 
with the possible order of up to 50 757s pending with gpa 
rolls a delta order and another possible 75 jets which could be 
used in the navys longrange antisubmarine warfare patrol 
aircraft program boeing could keep going like gangbusters said 
paul nisbet an aerospace analyst with prudentialbache securities 
inc in new york 
chris longridge vice president of sales at boeing commercial

is the highest in the industry longridge said 
presently at its renton wash plant boeing is turning out 14 
737s and four 757s every month the production of 757s will 
increase to five a month next february longridge said 
at boeings everett plant five 767s are being produced a month

grain and soybean futures prices ended mixed to 
slightly higher thursday on the chicago board of trade 
analysts described the day as featureless because few signs 
of confirmation could be found for a pair of rumors that strongly 
influenced trading one day earlier 
soybeans were pressured at the opening as speculation that china 
was planning a big soyoil purchase under the us export bonus 
program failed to gain support there was some firming up late 
however as the beans closed mostly higher 
wheat climbed across the board on talk of increased export bonus 
business despite the fact that reports wednesday of a completed 
oneyear extension of the grain accord between the soviets and the 
united states appear to have been premature 
on the close wheat was 2 cents to 4 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in september at 393 a bushel corn was 4 
cents lower to 1 cents higher with september at 281 a bushel 
oats were 1 cent lower to cent higher with september at 254 
and soybeans were 5 cents lower to 6 cents higher with september 
at 835 a bushel

farmers insurance group incs agreement to 
be bought by batus inc for 52 billion ends a bitter eightmonth 
battle that included unusual skirmishing over the evils of smoking 
and investment in south africa 
spokesmen for the los angeles insurer and the louisville ky 
tobacco and retailing conglomerate couldnt say thursday just how 
many lawsuits and administrative proceedings have been spawned by 
their fight 
but the merger deal which was announced late wednesday calls 
for the companies to cooperate in unraveling the tangle and 
cooperating in pressing for approval of the purchase by insurance 
regulators in various states 
farmers agreed to be bought by batus for 75 a share 3 a share 
higher than batus highest previous publicly announced offer and 
12 more a share than batus has been offering stockholders on the 
market 
no date has been set for a needed vote on the merger by 
shareholders of farmers the nations thirdlargest home and auto 
insurer and seventhbiggest property and casualty insurer 
batus the american subsidiary of bat industries plc of britain 
owns brown amp williamson tobacco corp maker of kool viceroy and 
other brands appleton papers and retailiers including saks fifth 
avenue and marshall fields 
the deal requires the approval of insurance regulators in nine 
of the states where farmers does business and hearings before 
those regulators were the forum for the most acrimonious 
accusations in the takover battle 
farmers representatives maintained that batus as a tobacco 
producer would end nonsmoker discounts for farmers policy 
holders when batus vowed to continue the discounts farmers 
suggested ownership by batus would prevent it from crusading 
against smoking as strongly as it has in the past 
farmers also lined up numerous local state and national elected 
officials to blast batus british parent bat industries plc for 
maintaining businesses in racially segregated south africa 
after the deal was cut batus chairman patrick sheehy said the 
earlier acrimony hadnt effected the weeklong negotiations 
i think often things that are said in court are much more 
acrimonious than ones true feelings sheehy said in an interview 
one or the other of the companies has challenged or threatened 
to challenge the seven state regulatory decisions issued to date 
some in court and some in appeals to the regulators 
by dropping various lawsuits and jointly appealing regulators 
decisions the companies said officials believe they can clear the 
regulatory path to a merger as early as the end of the year 
the merger won the approval of insurance regulators in arizona 
and was given conditional approval in ohio and illinois idaho 
washington and oregon have rejected the deal and decisions or 
hearings are pending in texas and kansas 
california regulators rejected the merger but that decision was 
overturned by a state court

insilco corp said thursday it accepted a 
11 billion buyout offer from two texas oilmen tossing aside a 
previous takeover agreement with a managementled group 
under the latest arrangement inr holdings inc headed by cyril 
wagner jr and jack e brown of midland texas will pay 3175 in 
cash for each of insilcos outstanding 256 million shares 
including debt the deal has an indicated value of about 11 
billion insilco said in a statement 
in active trading on the new york stock exchange insilco closed 
up 112 a share thursday to 3112 
two weeks ago insilco agreed to a managementled leveraged 
buyout with first boston corp but insilcos board said thursday 
that it had withdrawn its support of the 29ashare offer which 
valued the company at about 950 million 
dissenting shareholders last week filed lawsuits against 
insilco charging that managements offer was too low 
in a leveraged buyout a company is acquired largely through 
borrowed funds that are repaid through the target companys profits 
or asset sales 
anaylysts had said higher bids would increase the chance a buyer 
would have to sell at least some divisions of insilco to finance 
the purchase 
once a leading silver operation known as international silver 
co insilco restructured itself into an industrial holding company 
and producer of specialty consumer and high technology products 
several subsidiaries have wide brandname recognition including 
rolodex desktop equipment red devil paints and taylor school 
yearbooks 
insilco reported a flat overall earnings for the first half of 
1988 217 million or 102 a share vs 215 million or 102 
a year ago but its profit from ongoing operations increased about 
11 percent and sales rose almost 21 percent 
wagner and brown are engaged in the exploration and production 
of oil and natural gas the operation of gas pipelines real estate 
development and other businesses 
earlier this year the pair launched a hostile tender offer for 
usg corp a chicagobased building products concern but wagner 
and brown terminated their offer in june a month after they lost a 
bid for six seats on usgs board in a heated proxy contest 
to finance the insilco acquisition inr holdings said it has 
obtained commitments totaling 980 million from wagner brown and 
merrill lynch amp co 
the deal received the unanimous endorsement of a special 
committee of outside directors insilco said inr holdings will 
begin a cash tender offer within five business days of the 
execution of a definitive merger agreement

in the latest round of higher interest rates worldwide the 
central banks of britain west germany and several other european 
countries hiked their key rates thursday 
the actions rekindled fears of a global interestrate spiral and 
unnerved financial markets on wall street the dow jones average 
of 30 industrial stocks up 3734 points on wednesday dropped 
1582 to 201085 
the european interestrate hikes also had the intended effect of 
knocking the dollar lower especially against the west german mark 
the us currency was quoted at around 18645 marks in late 
afternoon trading in new york down sharply from 18820 marks late 
wednesday 
some analysts believe the rate hikes by west germanys 
bundesbank the bank of england and other european central banks 
could prompt another sharp tightening of credit in the united 
states where the federal reserve pushed rates higher only a few 
weeks ago 
theres some danger that we could get an increase in the 
feds discount rate said robert brusca chief economist for 
investment firm nikko securities co international inc the 
dollar is really looking like its made a turn for the worse 
other experts however deem it unlikely that the fed would take 
such dramatic action again to raise rates so close to the 
presidential election in november instead they expect the central 
bank to nudge rates gently higher by using its routine operations 
in the money markets even if inflationary pressures heat up and 
the dollar slumps 
the farther we get along on this process of leapfrogging 
interest rates the more reluctance starts to grow said hugh 
johnson a senior vice president of first albany corp in some 
ways its like a poker game and everyone starts raising the ante 
and some people start dropping out 
in a surprise move aug 9 the us central bank announced a 
halfpercentage point increase in its discount rate to combat 
inflation that put the fee the fed charges member banks for 
shortterm loans at 65 percent its highest level in more than two 
years 
it was the first rise in the key rate since september 1987 the 
month preceding the stock market crash and sparked a halfpoint 
increase in the us prime lending rate to 10 percent 
after the fed increase many market watchers believed it was 
only a matter of time before the united states major trading 
partners responded in kind 
we had been more or less anticipating a european rate rise 
said david redding an international economist for bankers trust 
co its more of a catchup on the part of the foreigners 
the bank of england signaled a full percentage point increase in 
the british commercial banks base lending rate to 12 percent 
following a government report on the countrys trade deficit in 
july 
the report showed britains july trade gap soared 72 percent to 
a record 265 billion pounds or about 45 billion british 
chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson said the rate was boosted 
to keep inflation under control 
the bundesbank raised its discount rate to 35 percent from 3 
percent citing the dollars recent strength against the mark the 
central banks of france switzerland the netherlands and austria 
quickly followed suit with rate hikes 
in tokyo however a senior bank of japan official said there is 
absolutely no need to consider an adjustment in japans monetary 
policy just because the bundesbank and the bank of england raised 
their base rates 
while the increases may have been foreseen experts did find 
surprising the ferocity of the west germans verbal attack on the 
dollar 
bundesbank president karl otto poehl said the bank will 
continue to do everything to stem the decline of the mark against 
the dollar 
poehls strident remarks seemed to overreach the february 1987 
louvre agreement on the value of the dollar informally adopted 
by the major industrial countries redding suggested 
it makes you wonder about the coordination he said he 
noted contrasting statements recently by us officials indicating 
that the dollar could rise a bit more before its advance would need

the stock market retreated in sluggish trading 
thursday as concerns about rising interest rates resurfaced on the 
first anniversary of the alltime peak in the dow jones industrial 
average 
peoples attitudes are not as positive as they were a year 
ago said jack garry manager of institutional trading at the 
brokerage butcher amp singer inc in philadelphia 
a round of interest rate increases overseas and a new us 
economic report that contained an upward revision in one measure of 
inflation for the second quarter were cited by analysts as reason 
for the price slide 
they said the combination stirred worries that us interest 
rates could be headed higher making returns on treasury securities 
more competitive with those expected from stocks 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials which climbed 3734 on 
wednesday lost 1582 to close at 201085 one year ago the 
markets bestknown barometer had closed at 272242 its record

off 2631 points at 2 pm before recovering some lost ground in 
the last two hours of the session 
before the us stock market opened the west german central 
bank raised a key lending rate and banks in several other european 
countries followed suit 
also in advance of the opening the commerce department revised 
upward its estimate of secondquarter economic growth to 33 
percent from 31 percent and simultaneously boosted its estimate 
of an inflation measure tied to the gross national product to show 
a rise of 51 percent up from 41 percent 
analysts said the combination of european rate hikes and the 
revised inflation estimate stirred speculation that us rates 
could be headed higher investors expect that if the economy 
continues to expand rapidly and inflation rises the federal 
reserve may encourage higher interest rates 
prices in the us bond market slipped thursday nudging rates 
up 
the 30year treasury bond for instance lost about 5 for every 
1000 in face value while its yield rose to 945 percent from 
940 percent wednesday 
lawrence r helfand manager of retail sales at rodman amp renshaw 
inc in chicago said the rising rates were offering some stiff 
competition for the stock market 
he noted that yields on oneyear treasury bills are above 82 
percent and are proving attractive for investors looking for a 
haven for their money in a volatile financial climate 
we wont make much headway until there is a sign that higher 
interest rates have begun to slow the economy he said 
butcher amp singers garry said he expects trading to remain 
sluggish until after the labor day holiday we are in a drifting

petroleum futures prices fell broadly thursday plunging sharply 
at times amid reports of overproduction by opec and renewed 
saberrattling between member nations iran and iraq 
instead of fighting on the battlefield they seem to want to 
fight in the press said jim ritterbusch vice president of 
trading and research for carson petroleum co in suburban chicago 
and all that posturing just makes people nervous 
in other markets copper futures prices extended recent gains as 
demand remained strong platinum joined gold and silver in a 
precious metal decline cocoa futures continued plunging and grain 
futures prices were mixed while soybeans were mostly higher 
petroleum futures came under pressure at the opening and moved 
steadily lower as the market absorbed its first blow when a report 
pegged production by members of the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries at between 19 million and 20 million barrels 
a second blow came later in the day as iranian oil minister 
khazempour ardbelli was quoted as saying his nation would refuse 
any attempt to allot iraq to the same 236 million barrelperday 
share of opec production granted iran 
iraq has been outside opec production quotas since 1986 when it 
claimed the economic drain of the persian gulf war with iran 
necessitated the extra production iraqs current output is 
estimated at 26 million barrels per day 
iran calls iraq obstructionist and it makes some people 
edgy said ritterbusch 
crude oil prices on the new york mercantile exchange settled 34 
to 41 cents lower with the contract for delivery in october at 
1531 per barrel heating oil was 117 cents to 130 cents lower 
with september at 4245 cents a gallon and unleaded gasoline was 1 
cent to 110 cents lower with september at 4644 cents a gallon 
copper futures meanwhile were 55 cent to 165 cents higher at 
the new york commodity exchange with august at 10235 cents a 
pound 
but the precious metals which made some gains wednesday 
retrenched thursday 
platinum futures on the new york mercantile exchange slipped 
350 to 620 with october at 54770 a troy ounce at the new 
york commodity exchange gold dropped 2 to 220 with august at 
43280 a troy ounce silver lost 74 cents to 77 cents with 
august at 6708 cents a troy ounce 
cocoa futures took another beating as traders already unnerved 
by the size of the worldwide surplus left the market after rumors 
that the ivory coast the worlds leading producer was back 
selling after a long absence 
people who held long positions just bailed out because they 
arent seeing any turnaround said arthur stevenson of 
prudentialbache securities inc in new york the ivory coast 
rumors if true would be very very negative 
cocoa futures settled 33 to 45 lower on the new york coffee 
sugar and cocoa exchange with september at 1303 per ton 
grain futures prices were mixed while soybeans were mostly 
higher at the chicago board of trade 
on the close wheat was 2 cents to 4 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in september at 393 a bushel corn was 4 
cents lower to 2 cents higher with september at 280 a bushel

bond prices slumped thursday after a round of 
interest rate hikes overseas and a government report that inflation 
accelerated during the second quarter 
the treasurys bellwether 30year bond fell 1732 point or 
about 530 for every 1000 in face amount 
its yield which moves inversely to its price and is an 
indicator of interest rate trends rose to 945 percent from 940 
percent late wednesday 
the central banks of britain west germany and several other 
european countries raised key interest rates thursday in response 
to the dollars recent strength 
the coordinated steps pushed the dollar downward and set a 
negative tone as trading opened in the bond market said elizabeth 
g reiners vice president for money market research at the 
investment firm dean witter reynolds inc 
the federal reserve recently raised its discount rate the 
interest it charges its member banks and traders feared the 
overseas rate hikes might prompt the fed to increase the rate 
again that would force bond prices lower 
the bond market was dealt a bigger blow however when the 
commerce department issued its revised gross national product 
figures for the second quarter 
the department said the economy expanded at a robust annual rate 
of 33 percent from april through june despite the severe impact of 
the drought on farm production that was up from an earlier 
estimate of 31 percent 
what hurt bonds was a gnp price index which rose at an annual 
rate of 51 percent during the quarter the sharpest increase since 
a 58 percent rise in the third quarter of 1982 
the 30year treasury issue fell nearly a point on the news mrs 
reiners said the market has been sensitive to reports about 
inflation because the federal reserve has tightened credit in an 
attempt at keeping inflation in check 
prices recovered however as traders had second thoughts about 
the gnp report mrs reiners said 
most people realize its second quarter data only through 
june she said and with the recent interest rate hikes in this 
country possibly therell be some abatement in the economy 
she said 
in the secondary market for treasury securities prices of 
shortterm government issues were point to 732 point lower 
intermediate maturities ranged 932 point to point lower and 
20year issues were 1332 point lower according to figures 
provided by telerate inc a financial information service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman daily treasury bond index which measures 
price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with maturities 
of a year or longer fell 266 to 112307 
corporate bonds also were down moodys investment grade 
corporate bond index which measures price movements on 80 
corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer was down 
060 to 28151 
municipal bonds slipped as well the bond buyer municipal bond 
index slipped 732 point to 88 1632 while its yield rose to 816 
percent from late wednesdays 814 percent

751 percent sixmonth bills were up 3 basis points to a 
discounted rate of 748 percent to yield 787 percent and oneyear 
bills rose 4 basis points to a discounted rate of 771 percent and 
a yield of 827 percent 
a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point the yield 
is the annualized return on an investment in a treasury bill the 
discounted rate is the interest rate the market uses to price bills

a prominent maryland entrepreneur and the 
former president of the sevenup co each were sentenced to the 
maximum three years in prison and fined 100000 thursday for their 
part in a pricefixing conspiracy 
morton m lapides 57 chairman of the board of alleghany 
beverage corp of cheverly md and james j harford former 
president of midatlantic cocacola bottling of silver spring md 
were convicted in may following a sixweek trial 
us district judge robert g doumar suspended all but 179 days 
of lapides sentence and all but six months of harfords sentence 
doumar also placed both men on three years probation after the 
completion of their sentence with each required to perform 
community service during that period 
harford has appealed his conviction and lapides is expected to 
do so 
the federal jury had found that harford alleghany bottling and 
lapides as head of alleghany bottlings parent company conspired 
to fix the wholesale price of coke and pepsicola products 
sentencing for the corporation will continue friday and doumar 
said proceedings could take several days 
when convicted harford was the president of sevenup but 
resigned that post three days later harfords conviction was the 
result of actions while heading the cocacola bottling firm and did 
not involve sevenup 
the convictions were part of an ongoing justice department 
probe of the soft drink industry which has resulted in 11 grand 
jury investigations in eight other states 
lapides and harford were convicted of rigging the wholesale 
price of their respective products in 1983 and 1984 alleghany 
beverage was the parent company of alleghany pepsicola bottling 
co until 1985 when lapides sold the subsidiary for 160 million 
during the trial the defense contended neither man knew of the 
scheme and that if the allegations were true it was the work of 
lower level employees who made decisions without their bosses 
knowledge 
federal prosecutors argued the two bottlers reached an accord to 
halt the previous bitter competition by fixing the wholesale price 
of their products sold to schools motels hotels and other 
commercial buyers in maryland and virginia 
midatlantic pleaded guilty to earlier similar indictments and 
agreed to pay 2 million in fines for price rigging in virginia and 
washington dc markets 
in march both bottling firms also agreed to rebate 45000 to 
virginia to be distributed to school districts for overcharges on 
their soft drink purchases the agreement drawn up by attorney 
general mary sue terry called for midatlantic to pay 30000 and 
alleghany 15000 
assistant us attorney david c jordan had argued harford be 
given the maximum sentence because he is the highest culpable 
official at midatlantic 
we should not allow this case with such tremendous damage to 
the public to be a source of cynicism to the public by giving 
harford a light sentence he said 
during the hearing doumar said he had received numerous letters 
from friends relatives and business associates on harfords 
outstanding achievements in the community 
in his sentencing the judge commended harford for his work in 
the community and for his persistent urging of cocacola to become 
more involved 
your company did a lot of good for the community through your 
urgings but you were being charitible to the public with money you 
took from the public he said 
prior to the conviction several other soft drink executives 
have been found guilty or pleaded guilty to a variety of charges 
in february 1987 armand s gravely a former richmond division 
manager for alleghany was convicted of price fixing and 
obstruction of justice he was sentenced to four months in jail and 
fined 15000 
edward l wynns a midatlantic vice president pleaded guilty 
in may 1987 to charges he lied to the grand jury investigating the 
price fixing 
the former president of alleghany bottling james p sheridan of 
timonium md was given a 3year sentence with all but 120 days 
suspended and fined 45000 in august 1987 after pleading guilty 
to price fixing 
a third executive indicted along with lapides and harford odis 
r allen a midatlantic vice president pleaded guilty to price 
fixing in march

sales of existing singlefamily homes jolted 
by rising mortgage rates dropped 5 percent in july the first 
decline since january a real estate trade group said thursday 
the national association of realtors said that sales of existing 
homes dropped to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 363 million 
units last month following a 64 percent increase in june 
the decline was the first since a 48 percent drop in january 
with analysts blaming the setback on rising mortgage rates 
fixedrate mortgages climbed to a nationwide average of 105 
percent at the end of july and have risen even faster in august 
topping 1071 percent last week 
john tuccillo chief economist for the realtors said even with 
the july drop in demand sales were still at the second highest 
monthly level of the past year 
even with the recent and prospective increases in interest 
rates sales in 1988 will almost certainly be higher than we 
anticipated at the beginning of the year he said 
the median price of a home rose from june to july by 1400 to 
91600 up 37 percent from a year ago when the median sales 
price for an existing home was 88300 
for the first time in a decade the midwest led in 
yearoveryear price changes with an increase of 7 percent to a 
median price of 70600 the northeast remained the highestpriced 
region of the country with a median price of 146700 last month 
up just 06 percent from a year ago 
the median price in the west was 123500 last month 42 
percent higher than a year ago while the median price in the south 
of 85600 was 57 percent higher than a year ago 
tuccillo said that the big jump in home prices in the midwest 
reflected a rebound in the regions rust belt industries because of 
the boom in manufacturing caused by rising export sales he said 
the smaller price increase for the northeast reflected some 
softening in demand after two years of strong sales 
all regions of the country except the west suffered sales 
declines in july 
the sharpest decline occurred in the south where sales were 
down 7 percent in july to an annual rate of 132 million units in 
the northeast sales dropped 68 percent to an annual rate of 
690000 units while sales in the midwest fell by 51 percent in 
july compared to june but were 44 percent higher than a year ago 
the west saw sales rise 32 percent to an annual rate of 690000 
units in july

recent rains have michigan tree 
growers dreaming of a green christmas 
the drought killed more than 10 million seedlings in michigan 
but the rains should help keep christmas tree prices about the same 
as last year said melvin koelling a forestry professor at 
michigan state university 
from the consumer standpoint i dont expect a change in 
quality quantity or price this year koelling said thursday 
retailers shouldnt use the drought as justification for price 
increases 
koelling said michigan is the nations biggest producer of 
christmas trees followed by oregon and wisconsin michigan 
produced 55 million christmas trees in 1987 and should be at or 
above that level this year depending on demand 
millions of trees have been spared from drought damage since 
rains began in midjuly koelling said 
those rains came exactly when they had to come koelling 
said we would have lost a significant number of large trees 
without the rains 
many trees up to 6 years old died he said most christmas trees 
are harvested after about 10 years growth 
scotch pines the mainstay of michigans christmas tree crop 
have fared better than fir trees koelling said
