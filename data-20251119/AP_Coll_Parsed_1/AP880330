the company that distributes the salk 
polio vaccine is asking for federal permission to test it against 
aids after california physicians reported the vaccine lessened 
some symptoms of the disease 
connaught laboratories inc of swiftwater filed an 
investigational new drug exemption petition with the food and drug 
administration on march 22 
just two weeks ago connaught stopped shipping the vaccine to 
california doctors who said they had used it to lessen symptoms in 
patients suffering from acquired immune deficiency syndrome the 
company said it did not have fda approval to use the vaccine for 
anything other than the prevention of polio 
west coast doctors complained their patients would be left 
without a treatment that had shown results against the deadly 
disease 
in commenting on the fda petition tuesday connaught vice 
president david j williams expressed doubts about the experiments 
while we know of no demonstrable clinical evidence for ipv 
other than the prevention of polio the theoretical possibility has 
been raised by certain researchers and as such warrants that the 
company sponsor a study to determine if the vaccine has any 
potential in the treatment of aids he said 
a california doctor said the old polio vaccine has relieved some 
cancer lesions herpes infections swollen lymph nodes and fatigue 
among aids sufferers 
dr allen allen said statistics on more than 50 patients have 
shown the vaccine produces clinical benefits after six weeks 
the halt in shipments forced him to delay a study he had planned 
he said 
the drug exemption petition requests authorization of a random 
placebocontrolled study at lacolive view medical center in 
sylmar calif directed by dr glenn mathisen chief of the 
centers infectious disease section and clinical research attending 
physician at the ucla aids clinical research center

food poisoning possibly from fresh turkey 
fixed for lunch wednesday sent at least 75 ellijay elementary 
school pupils to an overflowing hospital wednesday night 
north georgia medical center administrator john downs said 24 
pupils mostly kindergartners through second graders and one 
teacher were admitted for treatment of stomach cramps and 
dehydration brought on by vomiting other pupils were being treated 
and sent home 
its not a serious thing it just requires monitoring he 
said most are on intravenous feeding to replace the fluids they 
lost were listing it as gastritis due to food poisoning 
downs said the 50bed hospital already had about 40 patients 
when the schoolchildren started coming in wednesday afternoon 
weve got them in the chapel and various treatment rooms he 
said we havent had to use the halls yet but we have beds 
available for that if we need it 
if more pupils come in and are admitted he added well 
probably have to send some to other hospitals 
gilmer county school superintendent j homer hefner said the 
food poisoning apparently hit two classes the hardest and also 
struck some children from a few other classes at the 619pupil 
school 
lunch wednesday was fresh turkey and dressing green beans and 
potatoes 
downs said doctors suspected the turkey caused the illness the 
turkey that remained after the meal was finished would be tested at 
a medical laboratory thursday he said 
i talked to the luncheon person and reviewed how they thawed 
and prepared the turkey and i saw nothing wrong with how they did 
it hefner said adding that he has asked the state department of 
educations food services division to help with his investigation 
into the problem

the origins of the oscar a golden symbol of 
artistic triumph are more down to earth than many of the glitzy 
stars who take home the greatly cherished statuette 
far from the studios sun and sea of the california west coast 
is a cluster of brick buildings in a residentialindustrial 
neighborhood of chicago under a cloak of security this is where 
the trophy manufacturer rs owens amp co creates the academy award 
prize 
winning the oscar contract may not compare with winning the 
oscar itself however it was a coup for owens seven years ago and 
remains a source of company pride the statuettes used to be made 
by dodge inc at a small manufacturing plant in crystal lake 
ill some 25 miles northwest of chicago 
with 300 employees owens makes about 95 percent of the most 
prestigious awards in the country including the television 
industrys emmys advertisings clios the super bowl trophy and 
the miss america awards but oscar tops them all 
most people dont know the names of awards in other fields much 
less what they look like said bernice estka who handles the oscar 
account for owens 
oscar you know she said 
each model of the muscular knight who holds a sword and stands 
impassively on a reel of film is hand cast from a single steel 
mold 
oscar was designed by cedric gibbons then head of the mgm 
studios art department he sketched the prototype on a table cloth 
in 1927 sculptor george stanley transformed the sketch into the 
coveted statuette 
the trophy was named oscar by longtime academy employee margaret 
herrick who took one look at the statuette and declared that it 
reminded her of her uncle oscar estka said 
the design has remained unchanged since 1927 and the mold 
which was turned over to owens with the contract is kept in a 
vault 
neither owens nor the academy of motion pictures arts amp 
sciences whose members votes decide the winners would reveal the 
price tag on oscar 
i like to say that they are worth a million dollars to the 
people who receive them said owen r siegel founder and chief 
executive officer of the trophy company once you have got an 
oscar youve made it 
if we say it only costs a certain amount to make what does 
that do to the image said patrick stockstill the academy 
historian who will hand the oscars to presenters at the 60th annual 
awards presentation on april 11 
it is the most famous award and the most prestigious it 
thrusts a person into the limelight and brings additional cash into 
their pockets 
the oscars value as a symbol far exceeds the cost of the pewter 
form and electroplating of copper nickel silver and gold estka 
said however from 194347 because of war rationing the 
statuettes were made of plaster they were later replaced 
early each year nine or 10 owens employees set aside the work 
of the moment such as little league trophies or bowling prizes to 
make the oscars each 13inch 8pound statuette takes about five 
man hours to craft estka said 
the awards are handcrafted in the 100000 squarefoot facility 
with cinderblock walls whose concrete floors often are shrewn with 
metal shavings 
the academy usually needs about 100 oscars but this years 
order was for 150 because of the academy is celebrating its 60th 
anniversary estka said 
the oscars are locked in a separate room each night as each 
statuette is finished it is packed in plastic foam when all are 
ready theyre put in a sealed truck for the trip to los angeles 
we dont have an elaborate secret route but only a few people 
actually know when they leave or how they go to los angeles said 
scott siegel president of the company 
once in a secret los angeles warehouse the oscars wait in 
muffled silence for the night they make dreams come true

david hare a leading british playwright has 
remarked that when prime minister margaret thatcher came to office 
nearly nine years ago the usually vibrant challenging british 
theater fell silent 
a lot of writers stopped writing because they didnt know how 
to deal with her arrival said the author of plenty and other 
works now people are really beginning to get to grips 
today secure in her third term of office mrs thatchers 
imprint on britain is indelible nowhere more so than in the arts 
where disaffection is being turned into the stuff of provocative 
films and plays 
the topicality itself is nothing new as angry young 
playwrights such as john osborne and arnold wesker and such 
filmmakers as karel reisz and john schlesinger were demonstrating 
30 years ago 
but no postwar government conservative or labor has come 
under such concerted artistic attack as mrsthatchers and few 
serious works today fail to address themselves somehow to the 
phenomenon of thatcherism most often from an angry leftwing 
viewpoint 
emasculated politically by the march of thatcherite capitalism 
the left has dug in on stage and screen to attack her bourgeois 
probusiness values 
so sustained is the onslaught that a backlash is being felt from 
artists who ordinarily would stay out of the political crossfire 
id much rather have a frank disinterest in culture than a 
phony and deliberate one novelist peter ackroyd recently said 
and i find the patronizing snobbery of those who despise mrs 
thatcher and her supporters very unpleasant indeed 
in a recent sunday times article rightwing historian norman 
stone of oxford university said the growing tendency was to run 
down mrs thatcher to assume that capitalism is parasitism that 
the established order in this country is imperialist racist 
profiteering 
earlier critic francis king had asked in the conservative 
sunday telegraph why is there so much stage left and yearned 
for a play to counter the vicious denigration of poor old mrs 
thatcher which he saw proliferating in theater 
many of the works have a common message under mrs thatcher 
britain is becoming a greedy society heartless to the poor 
hostile to free speech in thrall equally to nuclear weapons and 
america under president reagan 
works both new and old are being mobilized against thatcherism 
in alan ayckbourns a small family business the upstanding 
hero falls into a spiral of corruption in which vanishing paper 
clips become a metaphor for vanishing morals olwen wymark has 
adapted emile zolas 1880 novel nana for the london stage 
because she says it matches her sense of britain today 
both dramatists acknowledge the antithatcherite message i 
couldnt have written that play 10 years ago ayckbourn 48 said 
in an interview the disease of greed much more deeply 
permeates the society now than it once did 
the americanborn wymark says she chose nana because the 
book is about the kind of tendencies thatcher has been able to nail 
to the mast i feel very strongly that the urge towards greed 
is being fostered the sense of communal responsibility is drying 
up 
hanif kureishi the anglopakistani screenwriter of two 
lowbudget hit movies sammy and rosie get laid and my 
beautiful laundrette says he and director stephen frears want 
their movies to shoot bullets at thatcherism and everything it 
stands for 
because things are so terrible in this country we have to be 
able to look at whats going on and discuss it publicly kureishi 
said in an interview 
sammy and rosie opens with images of a riottorn 
rubbishstrewn london and the voice of mrs thatcher promising to 
tackle the problems of the inner cities 
other works share kureishis view david hares wetherby and 
derek jarmans the last of england on screen karim alrawis 
a colder climate and kay adsheads thatchers women on 
stage 
on television various drama series consistently portray the 
government as authoritarian secrecyobsessed even murderous 
spitting image a satirical program uses rubber dolls to 
portray mrs thatcher and her ministers as hitlers nazis 
more benignly john mortimer in paradise postponed has 
pointed up the irony of postwar britain the traditional 
workingclass vote has swung to mrs thatcher the selfmade 
grocers daughter because she rather than the ideological left 
embodies bluecollar aspirations 
mortimer a committed laborite gently mourns the loss of an 
older dreamier more compassionate britain other playwrights 
such as caryl churchill in serious money tony marchant in 
speculators vilify the londons financial district as a nest 
of greed fraud and raw ambition 
director christine edzards sixhour film version of charles 
dickens novel little dorrit draws parallels between the 
victorian virtues and vices and mrs thatchers britain its 
juxtaposition of obscene wealth and tragic destitution she says 
makes it the dickens novel very much closest to today 
however some critics feel the point is being stretched 
reviewing nick darkes 1983 play the crimes of vautrin which 
used an honore de balzac work to indict a society glutted by 
materialism critic victoria radin complained in the observer 
newspaper it is a gray day when balzac can be bleakly molded to 
symbolize the dread face of thatcherite britain 
but mrs thatcher does have defenders powerful figures in the 
arts such as painter francis bacon and novelists kingsley amis and 
anthony powell who argue that the resentment is largely 
intellectual snobbery toward her bourgeois background 
historian stone wonders why there are not more films such as a 
room with a view and chariots of fire which extol traditional 
british virtues 
but hanif kureishi feels the truths of england today take 
precedence over goldenhued images of its past there are 
actually so few films that show life in great britain at all that 
we have to make films about life as it is there are so many 
stories to be told and weve got to get on with it

a twoyear international study of more than 
17000 heart patients showed that aspirin and the clotdissolving 
drug streptokinase taken together after the onset of chest pains 
reduce deaths among heart attack victims 
the second international study on infarct survival involving 
patients in 400 hospitals in 16 countries is billed as the largest 
heart attack treatment study ever it was presented tuesday at the 
annual meeting of the american college of cardiology 
the study showed that a chewed aspirin tablet or administration 
of the drug streptokinase or sk improved the survival rate the 
rate improved more however when the two were taken together 
mortality among heart attack victims given the combination was 
78 percent after five weeks compared with 128 percent for 
patients given a placebo 
drs rory collins and peter sleight and researcher richard peto 
all of the university of oxford england said the improvements 
were evident across the range of patients including highrisk 
cases involving stroke or patients older than 70 
the importance of the study they said lies more in the size of 
the sample than in what was done they said other studies were too 
small to give a true picture of the effects of the drugs 
the median age of the patients was just over 60 years and 23 
percent were women the study was funded by the british heart 
foundation and one maker of sk a drug company donated the aspirin 
peto said the study was done in hospitals in medically 
sophisticated countries but an aspirin tablet will work in rural 
china 
sleight said the combination of drugs significantly reduced the 
likelihood of a second heart attack while the patient was 
hospitalized and reduced the likelihood of a stroke by about 
onethird 
of 17189 patients in the survey 534 given placebos for both 
aspirin and sk died within five weeks of those given aspirin but a 
placebo in place of sk 447 died of patients given sk and an 
aspirin placebo 420 died of patients given both medications 327 
died the choice of treatment was made at random 
collins said some doctors were uncomfortable giving a placebo 
but he said doctors were asked to expose a patient to a possible 
placebo only if they were uncertain of treatment for an individual 
case they were not asked to reject other treatments if they were 
obviously called for he said 
the sooner the drugs were administered the better the results 
the researchers said but they reported significant improvement 
even when the drugs were administered 24 hours after the onset of 
pains 
it has been established that aspirin is of value in preventing 
heart attacks and for patients who have recovered from one sleight 
said 
this plugs the gap in the middle he said saying the tests 
show it can help for patients who have just suffered an attack 
for patients with a history of heart problems chewing an 
aspirin would be a very reasonable thing to do while waiting 
for help he said 
peto likened sk to a household drain cleaner that is 
administered once to dissolve obstructions in the blood flow to the 
heart 
it was developed in the 1950s and inadequately tested on 
small samples for years peto said its wider use as a heart attack 
treatment began stirring renewed interest several years ago 
it has just recently lost its patent protection and thus can be 
made by anybody he said the lack of a patent lowers the cost to 
about 200 per dose a tenth of the cost of similar competitive 
drugs

the latest round of unsponsored negotiations on 
an afghan peace settlement entered a fifth week wednesday with the 
parties still split on the question of when outside military aid to 
the warring sides would be halted 
a report in the new york times meanwhile said reagan 
administration officials had received indications that the soviet 
union would consider allowing aid to the rebels to continue after 
soviet troops begin withdrawing from afghanistan 
this issue of continued aid to the two sides is the last 
obstacle to a comprehensive settlement designed to end more than 
eight years of fighting in afghanistan us and pakistani 
officials have said 
washington has said it will not guarantee a settlement unless 
the soviet union agrees to stop funding the kabul government at the 
same time the united states stops aid to the guerrillas fighting 
the government moscow has refused to agree to such a cutoff 
the times citing unidentified senior us officials said the 
administration now is considering an arrangement under which 
pakistan would sign the accord but the united states and the soviet 
union would have a separate understanding on aid to the insurgents 
the new position was discussed by telephone wednesday by 
president reagan and the president of pakistan mohammed zia 
ulhaq the newspaper said 
the soviet union intervened in afghanistan in 1979 and about 
115000 soviet troops are believed to be helping the promoscow 
government there 
no formal meetings were scheduled between the un mediator 
diego cordovez and the afghan or pakistani delegations wednesday 
but cordovez met separately with the special soviet envoy nikolay 
kozyrev and with us deputy assistant secretary of state robert 
peck both of whom have been following the indirect talks between 
pakistan and afghanistan since the latest round started march 2 
peck told reporters as he entered his meeting that he was 
convinced that the soviets want to withdraw and want an 
agreement and we will stay here until we get an agreement 
he said reagan is not going to be easily satisfied and that 
an eventual accord will have to ensure the withdrawal of soviet 
troops selfdetermination of the afghan people return of refugees 
and nonalignment of afghanistan 
kozyrev reiterated the soviets opposition to a symmetrical 
cutoff we would like to see the us as guarantors but they 
refuse insisting on the cutoff he told reporters its 
impossible 
peck in his first ontherecord remarks to reporters since he 
arrived said a soviet statement tuesday that the united states 
could eventually be dropped as a guarantor might be an attempt to 
split the united states and pakistan 
but he said the united states and pakistan see eyetoeye on 
the cutoff the objective concept of symmetry and the reality of a 
balanced agreement all of which are essential for both pakistan 
and the united states 
the soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov said 
tuesday that ultimately we can do without the american 
guarantee of an accord if pakistan would sign an agreement 
pledging not to interfere in afghanistans affairs that would mean 
an end to us military aid being channeled to guerrillas through 
pakistan he said 
the parties in the afghan talks were expected to continue 
informal consultations on thursday

cigarette exports are expected to rise sharply 
this year largely because of rising demand in some asian 
countries according to an agriculture department analysis 
in all cigarette exports are forecast to be up 10 percent to 
110 billion pieces in 1988 the departments foreign 
agricultural service reported 
recent efforts to lower trade barriers in japan taiwan and 
now south korea are having a major impact on us cigarette 
trade the report said sales have yet to reach their full 
potential in far east markets with sizable gains expected in 
1988 
much of the increase will be in japan which last year was the 
largest single foreign market for us cigarettes surpassing the 
longstanding leader belgiumluxembourg 
south korea on the other hand has the greatest untapped 
potential for rapid growth as a us cigarette customer 
depending on the outcome of a us trade complaint the report said 
overall us cigarette sales to europe are expected to increase 
slightly this year 
the growing popularity of us blends of tobacco is a strong 
stimulus to further sales of cigarettes in spain and the 
netherlands is expected to absorb more cigarettes due to 
reexport demand from neighboring countries the report said 
reexports are also contributing to the expected rise in sales to 
belgiumluxembourg 
gains also are expected in turkey jordan cyprus and south 
africa due to the increasing popularity of us cigarettes whereas 
slight decreases will occur in morocco and tunisia the report 
said in the western hemisphere increased shipments to central 
and south american countries will more than offset decline in sales 
to canada 
exports of unprocessed tobacco are expected to increase 4 
percent to 203000 metric tons this year with larger shipments to 
indonesia hong kong and taiwan due to the accelerating trend 
towards consumption of americanblend cigarettes in the far east 
the report said 
but in western europe imports of us leaf may drop due to 
declining cigarette use 
the exceptions will be spain and italy where the falling 
dollar lower us prices and a continued preference for us 
blends will stimulate us leaf sales the report said in 
spain higher prices for darktype cigarettes will encourage 
consumers to substitute american blends thus increasing us leaf 
sales

the agriculture department has reversed a 
2monthold policy decision and will allow farmers to extend price 
support loans for some oldcrop corn and sorghum for a year longer 
than their normal maturity dates 
the oneyear extensions were approved for 1984crop corn and 
sorghum held in the farmerowned reserve program and for 1985 and 
1986 corn and sorghum under price support loan no extensions will 
be allowed for 1983 and older corn and sorghum loans 
agriculture secretary richard e lyng said tuesday the 
announcement on 1985 and 1986 corn and sorghum loans reversed a 
previous decision announced on jan 29 
the change was made to alleviate grain movement problems due 
to a rail car shortage grain congestion at some country 
elevators and other logistical problems he said 
but the agriculture department will reserve the right to call 
at any time the 1985 and 1986 crop loans lyng said grain in the 
farmerowned reserve program can remain until prices rise enough to 
trigger its release 
the loans are extended to farmers by the departments commodity 
credit corp which uses the grain as collateral if prices rise 
significantly farmers usually repay the loans and sell or use the 
grain as they choose 
but farmers have the option of not repaying the loans in which 
case ccc takes over the grain when the loans mature or come due 
by extending the loans farmers continue to own the grain and 
retain their ccc options 
parts of the jan 29 order still stand including the decision 
not to extend loans on 1987crop wheat feed grains and soybeans 
also loans that already had been extended on 1985 and 1986 wheat 
feed grains and soybeans will not be extended further when those 
mature 
the reversal was announced here by usda and by lyng himself at 
the governors agriculture conference in kearney neb

the government has agreed to investigate a 
complaint that south koreas ban of highquality us beef and veal 
is in violation of international trade practices 
the american meat institute filed the complaint on feb 16 under 
section 301 of the trade act of 1974 alleging that south koreas 
may 1985 ban on imports of us beef was unjustifiable and 
unreasonable 
manly molpus president of the trade association said the 
office of the us trade representative accepted the complaint on 
tuesday 
acceptance by the office has sent a clear signal to korea that 
this counrtry is not going to continue to tolerate unfair trade 
practices against our beef molpus said 
we hope the korean government will be reasonable and move 
quickly to lift the ban which has no justifiable basis 
trade representative clayton yeutter said in a statement that he 
accepted the industrys petition following extensive 
consultations with korea for nearly three years aimed at achieving 
market access for us highquality beef 
prior to the 1985 ban south korea was the fourth largest 
overseas market for us meat averaging about 5 million worth of 
imports annually 
yeutter said the door is still open to south korea for resolving 
the issue through negotiations but if those efforts fail the 
united states could retailiate against south korea for violating 
its obligations under gatt the general agreement on tariffs and 
trade he said

president reagan says former national security 
aides oliver north and john poindexter are not being presumed 
innocent on conspiracy theft and fraud charges in the irancontra 
scandal 
someplace along the line many of us have forgotten that you 
are innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt 
reagan told a group of regional reporters on tuesday 
what has happened i think in the case is its just everyone 
is accepting guilt on the basis of accusation 
north poindexter and arms dealers richard v secord and albert 
a hakim pleaded innocent last week to charges that they defrauded 
the government of more than 17 million by diverting profits from 
the iran arms sales to the nicaraguan contra rebels 
although he once again spoke out on behalf of his indicted 
former aides reagan backed away somewhat on tuesday from his 
assertion last week that north is still an american hero reagan 
said he was referring to the marines wartime record 
i think i was too short in my remark when i answered the 
question reagan said 
i should have augmented that and said why and that is look 
at the record and at the honors and the medals that have been 
awarded him for bravery in combat reagan said and i have to 
say those were heroic actions and he is a valid hero 
north who has announced he will retire from the marine corps in 
may received a silver star and two purple hearts in the vietnam 
war he said after his indictment that he might attempt to subpoena 
the highestranking government officials to testify in his 
defense 
reagan declined to say on tuesday whether he would testify on 
norths behalf

a senate committee wants to add 159 billion 
worth of water projects to an already huge backlogged construction 
agenda that is being squeezed by budget deficits 
the environment and public works committee voted unanimously 
tuesday to authorize the building of 16 new army corps of engineers 
projects from florida to california with illinois receiving the 
two costliest 
the panels bill is the first water projects authorization 
measure to begin moving on capitol hill since 1986 when congress 
and the reagan administration agreed on a massive package of 
proposed construction 
the 1986 legislation authorized more than 200 projects around 
the country at a cost of between 10 billion and 15 billion 
depending upon the final scope of the flood control navigation and 
environmental restoration work 
the 1986 law also forced localities to begin paying a portion of 
a projects cost a proposal that had deadlocked the waterprojects 
pipeline and had resulted in no new authorizations in the previous 
16 years 
committee chairman quentin burdick dnd said the new 
proposal contains no rollbacks in the costsharing requirements 
and he insisted that the plan is noncontroversial 
he and sen daniel patrick moynihan dny said they hoped the 
committees action would be the start of a regular twoyear cycle 
of new authorizations for the corps 
once a project is authorized its backers have to go to the 
administration and the house and senate appropriations committees 
in an effort to obtain construction money if the money is not 
forthcoming within five years a project automatically loses its 
authorization 
sen george mitchell dmaine said obtaining construction money 
for a project is becoming difficult because of the huge number of 
already authorized projects competing for limited money in times of 
big budget deficits 
the 1988 bills costliest project at an estimated 775 million 
would be a new lock and dam on the lower ohio river near olmsted 
half the cost would be paid by all taxpayers and half would come 
from fees and taxes paid by inland waterway users 
the second most costly project would be a new phase of the 
chicagoland underflow plan the flood control program for the 
chicago metropolitan area estimated total cost would be 419 
million 
other projects that would be authorized by the senate bill and 
their estimated total costs are 
fort pierce harbor florida navigation improvement 6742000 
nassau county amelia island florida beach erosion control 
5753000 
port sutton channel florida navigation improvement 
2670000

fork kentucky river 7450000 
mississippi river southeast louisiana and southern 
mississippi enhancement of fish and wildlife resources 
59300000 with the federal government paying the entire cost 
because it is an environmental restoration proect 
wolf and jordan rivers and bayou portage mississippi

the exact federal and local shares of most of the projects will 
not be known until the corps and local interests negotiate under 
the terms of the 1986 law

the house armed services committee has voted 
to make some of the navys most sophisticated technology available 
to japan to help defend western pacific seas against the soviet 
union 
the decision came tuesday as the democraticcontrolled panel 
voted 484 approval of a bill authorizing the pentagon to spend 
299 billion in the fiscal year starting oct 1 
the committee also cut president reagans request for star wars 
antimissile spending and his plan to put multiplewarhead mx 
missiles on western railroads 
by a 466 vote the committee approved the tentative 
administration plans to go ahead and sell japan up to four of the 
navys 12 billion aegisclass destroyers 
an elaborate array of sensors and radars connected with guns and 
missiles makes the aegis the navys most sophisticated system of 
defenses for surface ships 
japan wants to buy the ships as part of the japanese role in 
helping defend vital sea lanes near the soviet union 
some legislators have opposed the move arguing that the aegis 
weapons should remain in the us navy critics have pointed to the 
case of toshiba a japanese company which has admitted helping in 
the illegal sale of sophisticated machinery to the soviet union to 
build quieter soviet submarines 
but pentagon officials say the toshiba case involved a private 
company and they argue that the japanese government has protected 
other us technology 
the committee voted tuesday to approve only 37 billion for the 
strategic defense initiative as star wars is formally known 
reagan had sought 45 billion 
in addition the panel voted to approve 500 million for 
research into putting the mx aboard trains 300 million less than 
reagan had sought at the same time the panel increased reagans 
request for spending on the singlewarhead midgetman missile from 
200 million to 500 million 
the 299 billion figure for total pentagon spending was set last 
december during negotiations between the white house and congress 
over the effort to cut federal budget deficits the agreement 
eliminated the normal congressional fight over how much total money 
should be allocated for the defense department 
the bill is expected to go to the house floor late in april the 
version that eventually passes the house will have to be reconciled 
with the separate senate version of the same measure 
the star wars decision would result in a deep reduction from 
original plans the 37 billion figure would put star wars 
spending next year at about the current level 
pentagon budget plans last year called for seeking 62 billion 
in star wars money for fiscal 1989 but that was trimmed to 45 
billion by defense secretary frank c carlucci as part of a package 
of cuts he ordered in response to the december agreement 
the dispute over the midgetman and the mx involves two nuclear 
weapons at the heart of a 7yearold fight over reagans plans for 
building up americas nuclear arsenal 
congress has approved 50 mx weapons for deployment in landbased 
silos but the pentagon wants 50 more for deployment aboard trains 
meanwhile the pentagon has been lukewarm toward the midgetman a 
weapon that has been a favorite of congressional critics of the mx 
carlucci told congress last month that he thought the midgetman 
should be eliminated but said he had included 200 million at the 
request of congress so the program could be kept alive until 
reagans successor makes a decision next year 
meantime carlucci said 800 million should be spent for 
research into the railbased version of the 10warhead mx 
the committees research and development subcommittee said last 
week that each weapon should be given 500 million and that 
subcommittee decision was ratified tuesday after several 
unsuccessful attempts to change it 
the panel also voted 438 to spend 14 billion for a new 
trident submarine instead of using the money for two more 
aegisclass destroyers that vote reversed a decision last week by 
the seapower subommittee 
the reagan administration has sought three aegis warships for 
next year but the subcommittee increased that to five by killing 
the trident the two extra ships would be deployed in japan under 
us control protecting japanese security while keeping the aegis 
secrets in us hands 
congress has already approved 15 of the giant trident 
missilefiring subs which are the heart of americas nuclear 
deterrent force

labor unions have suffered their first major 
loss in the senate since democrats gained a majority in the 1986 
election as senators refused to guarantee warnings to workers 
facing onthejob exposure to toxic chemicals 
the senates rejection on tuesday of a bill to require notice 
for workers exposed to carcinogens and other job hazards ended a 
string of union victories this congressional session in earlier 
industrylabor showdowns the senate had approved measures to ban 
most uses of lie detector tests and require advance notice of plant 
closings 
sens howard metzenbaum dohio and edward m kennedy dmass 
chief sponsors of the worker notice bill could get only 42 of the 
60 votes needed to cut off an eightday filibuster led by sen 
orrin hatch rutah 
in this one ive lost metzenbaum said afterward but as 
long as workers are kept in the dark about occupational hazards we 
will continue to try to bring them light 
majority leader robert c byrd dwva had indicated earlier 
he would turn the senates attention to other legislation if its 
supporters could not muster at least 55 votes tuesday he did so 
immediately 
opponents of legislation often use a filibuster to continue 
debate indefinitely and effectively defeat a bill that otherwise 
might win senate passage 
unlike an upordown vote on a bill itself that requires a 
simple majority 51 votes if all 100 senators are present 
breaking a filibuster to cut off debate requires 60 votes 
the hazard notice bill which was passed by the house last 
october would have set up a sevenmember panel of scientists in 
the department of health and human services to identify the most 
dangerous carcinogens and other toxins on the job and the groups of 
workers at most risk 
the national institute of occupational safety and heath would 
have been ordered to notify individually up to 300000 of those 
workers a year at an annual cost of 25 million 
employers would have had to pay for medical monitoring of those 
workers at a cost of up to 250 a year for each armed with the 
results from such medical tests workers could file liability suits 
against their employers 
the american cancer society had estimated that metzenbaums bill 
would have reduced cancer deaths by 250000 over the next 10 years 
but business opponents led by the us chamber of commerce and 
the national association of manufacturers claimed that liability 
suits could cost employers 6 billion a year or more 
niosh officials have estimated that one in every four americans 
has been exposed to carcinogens or other potentially disabling 
toxins on the job at some time during their work life most of them 
unaware of it 
for workers exposed to toxic substances the senates action 
is a tragedy said margaret seminario a health and safety 
specialist for the 14millionmember aflcio workers need to 
know its their health at stake 
hatch and other opponents of the legislation argued during more 
than a week of debate that a dozen other government programs 
requiring labels on hazardous substances now provide enough 
warnings 
it is already being done he said union leaders want this 
bill and they do not care what it costs they just want it so 
they can go back to their people and say we have done another 
great thing for the little people of america when they have not 
mary bernhard manager of environmental policy for the chamber 
of commerce said the bill would have misled millions of workers 
into believing that they might some day contract a disease 
she called the vote tuesday a major victory for a wide 
coalition of business groups and a major defeat for organized 
labor 
fifteen democrats most of them from the south sided tuesday 
with hatch on the 5242 vote against ending the filibuster 
effectively killing any chance that the measure will become law 
this year 
theyre a little irritated with kennedy and metzenbaum for 
bringing up all these labor and civil rights bills that force them 
to pick between their constituencies back home said one lobbyist 
who supported the legislation 
others agreed saying the size of the vote virtually precludes 
passage of other unionsought legislation this year with the 
exception of a bill to raise the minimum wage which has been stuck 
at 335 an hour since 1981 
it dealt a very severe blow to the socalled labor agenda 
said barbara beatty a government affairs specialist for associated 
building contractors a trade organization of nonunion 
construction companies 
both the house and senate are expected to pass some form of a 
minimum wage bill within the next month even though president 
reagan has threatened to veto it 
reagan also has threatened to veto the plant closing measure 
which is included in a trade bill that he opposes

argentines may have fallen out with 
the english over the falkland islands but the uppercrust still 
likes the way they talk 
that is evident on the quaintly british campus of st georges 
college in quilmes where argentine children are still being sent to 
learn english with the proper accent and prepare to go on to 
cambridge or oxford 
for as much as 7800 a year in tuition the 330 boys and girls 
who attend the only britishstyle boarding school in argentina are 
assured as fine an education as if they lived in england said 
headmaster graham sims 
ninety instructors from britain teach children aged 3 through 18 
the fundamentals as well as computer programming chemistry 
advanced mathematics and english literature 
english at st georges is the most common classroom language 
although argentinas education ministry requires that bilingual 
schools teach some courses in spanish 
the school operates on british discipline 
we are very strict and that means the boys and girls are not 
allowed any physical contact in school holding hands is out 
sims said in an interview weve all got to lead disciplined 
lives if not we become pretty hopeless human beings 
st georges is in quilmes a city of 100000 people 12 miles 
south of buenos aires once a popular residential area for the 
british who earlier this century built most of argentinas 
railways it is most noted now for a brewery and the school 
dotting the 62acre campus are a chapel rugby fields gardens 
two swimming pools a horseriding academy and dormitories where 
students are required to place their folded clothes and towels on 
racks in the bathrooms 
the only inkling this is not britain is when schoolchildren 
break into spanish after class or when argentinas flag is raised 
each morning outside the administration building 
it really is a little piece of britain in argentina said 
ray mckay counselor at the lincoln school in northern buenos 
aires the only american school in argentina the student body is 
almost all argentines from wealthy families who want their kids to 
speak english 
lincoln has 550 students most of them children of us embassy 
personnel diplomats and businessmen in argentina its schedule 
follows the us system with summer vacation from june through 
august the englishstyle and argentine schools have their vacation 
from january to march the southern hemisphere summer 
st georges founded in 1898 is considered one of the four top 
schools in argentina for learning english 
we offer a 24houraday education experience said peter 
stoyle director of studies at st georges wakeup calls are at 
630 am and lights are out across campus by 10 pm which is the 
normal dining hour in argentina 
student magdalena winter 15 hopes someday to become a diplomat 
most people here believe were getting a very good education 
so we learn to put up with things that maybe we dont always 
like she said 
three other top britishstyle schools st andrews st 
catherines and northlands are in the northern suburbs of buenos 
aires but they do not offer boarding 
st andrews is observing the 150th anniversary of its founding 
by scottish settlers with 1900 students st andrews is the 
largest of the britishtradition schools and oldest of the 
bilingual schools in argentina 
one of its headmasters watson hutton was credited with 
introducing soccer to argentina at the turn of the century 
without him thered be no diego maradona said headmaster 
kevan prior referring to the star of argentinas 1986 world cup 
champions 
st andrews has been coed since 1980 
we have a particular ethos particular spirit something the 
parents of argentine upper middleclass children choose prior 
said 
tuition is 1600 to 2400 a year 
northlands school near st andrews is considered the top girls 
school in argentina headmistress jehane taylor takes pains to 
separate her school from anything british 
this is an argentine school with no funds from england that 
happens to teach english she said 
sensitivities over anything british comes from problems 
regarding the britains falkland islands in the south atlantic off 
argentina the argentines have claimed them since 1833 and here 
they are called the malvinas argentina invaded the falklands in 
april 1982 and were driven off by british forces three months later 
during the falklands these britishstyle schools got lots of 
phone treats some of them obscene said mckay of the american 
school some kids were pulled out by their parents and there were 
some classroom tiffs over the socalled imperialist british 
so its really kind of remarkable now that so many argentines 
send their kids to these schools i suppose its kind of the snob 
thing to do 
st catherines school for girls like st georges offers the 
international baccalaurete program for its 1100 students the 
program allows students to enter colleges in the united states at a 
secondyear level or qualify for advanced study in england 
a st catherines coordinator marie philpotts described the 
school as british to a certain extent tuition ranges from 
1050 to 1600 a year compared to 1000 to 2000 a year at 
northlands 
mrs taylor head of northlands said the tradition of 
argentines sending their children to englishstyle schools goes 
back several generations 
the school founded by a british governess in 1920 gives 985 
students an anglosaxon point of view and a latin point of 
view giving students different ways of looking at knowledge

the supreme court is weighing arguments on the 
constitutionality of ohios gasohol tax credits defended by 
state officials as legitimate incentives but attacked by opponents 
as discriminatory 
herman schwartz an attorney for the new energy co of indiana 
said tuesday that new energy was inevitably excluded from 
selling ethanol in ohio after ohio limited the tax benefits to 
companies in states that provide reciprocal incentives 
its a discriminatory tax on its face schwartz told the 
justices during oral arguments in the case 
gasohol is a blend of 90 percent gasoline and 10 percent 
ethanol which is derived from corn and cereal grain 
most states and the federal government have offered tax credits 
for the production and sale of gasohol which reduces toxic 
emissions from leaded motor vehicle fuels 
initially ohio had offered tax credits for ethanol regardless 
of where it was produced but in 1985 the state legislature 
restricted the credit to those states that give a similar tax 
incentive to ohioproduced ethanol 
that reciprocity feature was challenged by new energy which 
produces ethanol at its south bend ind plant the company was 
shipping about 25 percent of its output to ohio distributors in 
1985 and expected to be able to ship 35 percent eventually 
taxes can have the same effect as an absolute ban said 
schwartz this statute is clearly unconstitutional under the 
commerce clause 
the ohio supreme court upheld the constitutionality of the law 
last year by a vote of 43 saying it did not bar interstate 
commerce 
attorneys for the ohio tax commissioner have argued that the 
provision is intended to encourage the use of ethanol in ohio and 
neighboring states as a substitute for leaded gasoline a major 
source of air pollution 
richard farrin assistant attorney general of ohio told the 
court the provision does not bar the sale of outofstate ethanol 
in ohio and he said it does not interfere with privatemarket 
forces but simply provides an incentive for the production of 
ethanol 
were looking to have a national market that we think is 
essential for the future of the ethanol industry said farrin 
its to encourage indiana and other states to grant ethanol 
credits 
farrin also said the provision was enacted to protect the 
environment create an alternate market for corn and help lessen 
dependence upon foreign oil 
these purposes are legitimate purposes for a state to 
pursue said farrin 
but he was bombarded by questions from the justices 
justice anthony kennedy asked whether the ohio provision did not 
penalize some companies while helping others and justice john paul 
stevens asked why ohio was concerned about clean air in indiana 
the air in indiana comes into ohio farrin replied i 
dont think environmental concerns stop at state lines 
justice antonin scalia asked farrin what is to keep ohio from 
fiddling with markets other than gasohol and justice sandra 
day oconnor said the high court has so far invalidated all such 
reciprocal laws 
find some cases where we have upheld this type of a scheme 
she told farrin 
the court is expected to issue a decision in the case by july

more ultraviolet light suppresses marine 
productivity in the antarctic according to findings of new 
research on the antarctic ozone hole 
sayed elsayed of texas aampm university said tuesday his findings 
could mean the existence of a threat to the krill a tiny 
shrimplike creature on which all antarctic life depends directly 
or indirectly 
if the krill goes the whole ecosystem probably would 
collapse and the whales seals penguins birds and fish would 
disappear he told reporters at a briefing arranged by the world 
resources institute a washington environmental policy research 
institute that has called attention to ozone problems 
the ozone layer high above the earth thins by about half over 
antarctica each spring letting more ultraviolet light reach the 
ground if this happened over the globe as a whole the 
environmental protection agency says each 1 percent decline in 
ozone would mean a 2 percent increase in ultraviolet radiation and 
a 48 percent to 75 percent increase in the most common skin 
cancer 
the krill which are an inch or two long feed on phytoplankton 
which are invisible to the naked eye fish and marine mammals in 
turn feed on the krill 
a 10 percent harvest of the 550 million to 770 million tons of 
protein represented by the krill could equal the entire fish catch 
of the world and several nations are studying use of such a 
protein resource 
elsayed and his students at an island near palmer station 
labeled test tanks of southern ocean water containing 
phytoplankton the grass of the sea with radioactive calcium 
carbonate 
the radioactivity of the plankton after taking up the carbon 
isotope is a measure of photosynthesis the process by which plants 
live deriving energy from sunlight 
samples to which extra ultraviolet had been added showed far 
less radioactivity 1000 counts per minute on a scintillation 
counter as opposed to 15000 counts per minute for the sample from 
which all ultraviolet had been excluded 
the extra ultraviolet was about 65 percent of what was already 
in the light on the day the measurements were made ozone overhead 
was only about 80 percent of normal so the light was already 
presumably enriched in ultraviolet 
ultraviolet reaching the ground in antarctica is not as much as 
it would be elsewhere under the same ozone layer the sun is low in 
the sky and its light travels a long slant distance through the 
ozone 
scientists attribute the antarctic ozone hole and a newly 
discerned average 23 percent yearround ozone decline in northern 
midlatitudes since 1969 to manmade chemicals called 
chlorofluorocarbons major producing nations agreed in montreal 
last year to a 50 percent cut in production by 1998 and last week 
du pont co said it planned to stop manufacture 
lee m thomas administrator of the environmental protection 
agency told reporters tuesday that in light of the midlatitude 
decline he would seek to accelerate the scientific review called 
for by the treaty so that participating nations could consider 
further production cuts when 1990 opens 
but thomas said he would not support bills in the senate 
subject of a hearing today calling for an early 95 percent cut in 
us production 
sayed a biological oceanographer with 25 years of experience in 
the antarctic was supported in his work last fall on anvers island 
near palmer station by the national science foundation

how to shop in a city with horrendous traffic 
boutiques that close for two hours at lunch and sales clerks who 
are imperious or just plain rude maribeth clemente knows and 
helps fellow americans for a fee 
with an investment of less than 9000 she started a business 
called chic promenade last june to counsel visitors and shepherd 
them through the array of stores and shops in the city of light 
ms clemente a 26yearold native of troy ny takes up to 
four people on a tour of six to 12 boutiques in an average day 
with a midafternoon break in a cozy tea room 
clients are met at their hotels in a minibus for the tour which 
costs about 70 each 
some customers might find the service worth every centime just 
for the way ms clemente shields them from salespeople she usually 
chooses shops known for hospitality but when needed steps in to 
act as a buffer 
if the sales people want to be snippy i can take it she 
said i know their racket and understand their mentality 
americans are very sensitive to how theyre treated and a rude 
sales clerk can ruin a fun afternoon 
between stores she is a firstrate tour guide giving 
interesting background on historic neighborhoods french 
celebrities and the boutiques themselves 
on a recent afternoon shoppers learned a bit about french 
chocolateeating habits before visiting the capitals oldest 
chocolatier ms clemente says she does not take commissions from 
the stores she visits 
ms clemente is a graduate in international management of 
simmons college in boston she spent her junior year in paris fell 
in love with it and returned after graduation 
after much time spent as guide and consultant to friends and 
relatives she said it was a logical decision to make a business 
of it 
most of her clients are americans who dont speak french she 
translates explanations given by clerks and does quick conversions 
between francs and dollars she also briefs clients on applying for 
reimbursement of sales taxes paid on items taken out of the country 
most clients seek items that are authentically french such as 
perfumes wines and cookware spending an average of about 300 
each in an afternoon 
each tour is tailored to the interests of the clients and ms 
clemente chooses the shops to be visited from a long list in her 
memory an afternoon could be devoted to antique silver 
tapestries glass clothing or a combination of things 
i dont even think about bargains she said adding that the 
falling dollar means there arent any left 
instead she offers the uniqueness of stores that are not listed 
in tourist shopping guides and carry items you wont find on 
madison avenue

using an air cargo company to train nonunion 
pilots to fly eastern airlines jets in a possible strike against 
that passenger airline violates easterns labor agreement a 
federal judge ruled in blocking the activity 
us district judge barrington d parker issued the preliminary 
injunction pending trial on a lawsuit by the air line pilots 
association the order says eastern must stop training nonunion 
pilots on its planes by orion lift services inc 
in the order handed down late tuesday parker said the training 
program constitutes a unilateral repudiation of the collective 
bargaining agreement eastern has with the pilots union 
the plain language of the agreement requires that eastern 
utilize pilots from the system seniority list to perform any type 
of flying including flight training the judge said 
moreover eastern has failed to offer a reasonable 
interpretation of the contract which would justify its conduct nor 
has it proven that this type of leasing arrangement is justified by 
past practices parker said 
the judge dismissed as completely spurious the companys 
argument it was entitled to engage in strike preparations 
irrespective of the terms of its agreement with alpa 
eastern spokesman robin matell said the miamibased airline 
would not comment on the decision until company officials had an 
opportunity to review it 
orion based in raleigh nc signed a contract earlier this 
year to hire and train 350 to 400 nonunion pilots to fly eastern 
planes in the event alpa honored a possible strike by 13000 
airline employees represented by the international association of 
machinists and aerospace workers 
the agreement called for orion to fly as many as 25 eastern 
planes out of atlanta during a strike the pilots union has not 
indicated whether it would honor a machinists strike 
one aircraft was leased to the company to train nonunion pilots 
in louisville and eastern officials testified that as many as five 
more would be transferred to orion for that purpose 
orion needed to conduct the training on eastern planes to obtain 
federal aviation administration certification to carry passengers 
in the event of a walkout 
the machinists union and eastern are now conducting 
negotiations under the auspices of the national mediation board if 
the board declares an impasse the union could strike following a 
30day cooling off period that is prescribed by the railway labor 
act 
the pilots union has not said whether it would honor a 
machinists strike alpa itself is preparing to begin negotiations 
with eastern to update its contract which will be open for changes 
in june 
parker barred the airline from unilaterally changing its labor 
agreement with the pilots union 
he also enjoined eastern from using any pilots not on the 
unions seniority list as a means of undermining alpas status as 
the exclusive collective bargaining representative for the airline 
pilots employed by eastern 
the decision is the second legal setback for the financially 
troubled airline this month 
on march 10 another federal judge here held the airline in 
contempt of court for taking steps to sell its eastern air shuttle 
to another subsidiary created by the companys parent texas air 
us district judge john h pratt also ordered eastern to pay a 
fine of 10000 for each day it was in contempt of his order after 
april 5 a federal appeals court last week refused to stay the 
contempt order

a group of american experts on the supernatural 
found that the only thing special about chinese reputed to have 
magic powers was their ability to disappear when asked to prove 
their claims 
they failed all the tests said dr paul kurtz chairman of 
the committee for the scientific investigation of claims of the 
paranormal and professor of philosophy at state university of new 
york at buffalo 
kurtz said in particular his sixmember delegation had seen no 
scientific evidence to back up claims from masters of the chinese 
martial art of qigong that they can cure tumors and help 
cripples walk through energy emanating from their fingers 
the americans arrived in china march 21 at the invitation of the 
chinese newspaper science and technology daily to give lectures to 
chinese scientists and academics on how to evaluate paranormal 
activity or psychic phenomena outside the range of the normal 
they have also tried with limited success to test qigong 
masters and chinese clairvoyants one group of masters failed to 
appear for a demonstration of their skills as did two children 
said to be able to read chinese characters in sealed envelopes 
the group did witness one qigong master who said he could make a 
woman shake convulsively even if she was in the next room as 
demanded by the american skeptics the woman did shake kurtz said 
and continued to shake when the master unbeknownst to her was 
ordered by the americans to stop zapping her 
they also tested a clairvoyant who claimed she could diagnose 
body conditions of people in the united states just by reading 
their name on a piece of paper kurtz said his daughter who has 
diabetes was diagnosed as being pregnant 
james randi a wellknown conjurer and expert on the paranormal 
said the clairvoyant failed to realize that his mother had been 
dead for several years 
lin zixin director general and chief editor of the science and 
technology daily said the paper invited the americans to china 
because of growing confusion between science and superstition in 
china 
he said there has been some opposition to the american mission 
some ask why we should bring foreign people to contradict our 
traditional treasures like qigong 
the government gives official support to the study of qigong 
which in its less fantastic forms is an ancient system of 
deepbreathing exercises practiced daily in parks and along roads 
by millions of chinese 
controversy comes in with masters who say that through 
controlled breathing they can channel vital energy to turn on light 
bulbs and radios cure diseases and fry fish they aim for the same 
body points used by acupuncturists with their needles but without 
ever touching the patient 
chinas official media frequently warns that superstition and 
sorcery supposedly squelched when the communists came to power in 
1949 are staging a strong comeback particularly in rural areas 
the media at the same time often prints articles about children 
able to read a newspaper by sitting on it ufo sightings giant 
hairy wild men and loch nessstyle monsters 
masters have held healing rallies attended by 10000 people and 
have made claims carried in the official press that they can cure 
aids from thousands of miles away 
this is serious for our country and modernization lin said 
qigong may have some beneficial effects he said but now 
paranormal activity like esp and psychokinesis are being put under 
the qigong umbrella 
lin said chinas reforms over the last decade which have given 
people more economic freedom are partly responsible for rising 
interest in the supernatural 
ten years ago the state had much stronger controls he said 
he said a survey of 300 educated chinese attending one of 
kurtzs lectures found that half believed in the paranormal 
qian xingsha vice director of the human body information study 
society told the american skeptics that youre not being 
broadminded enough 
they simply dont believe she said in an aside to a 
colleague 
randi who uses his skills as a magician to debunk psychic 
trickery said there were high school explanations to most of 
the feats of qigong masters 
they believe in themselves because theyve never been 
tested he said 
the committee for the scientific investigation of claims of the 
paranormal has offices in 18 countries and puts out a journal 
called skeptical inquirer among committee members are 
astronomer carl sagan psychologist bf skinner and author isaac 
asimov

the white house says sen bob doles 
withdrawal from presidential contention could change president 
reagans proclaimed stance of neutrality in the race for the 
republican nomination 
the presidents position all along has been that he wouldnt 
work for the candidate until there was a clear choice and we had 
presumed all along that would be at the convention presidential 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said tuesday after doles announcement 
this does change things somewhat and the situation could 
change but i havent heard any discussion of it he said 
doles withdrawal leaves only vice president george bush and 
former religious broadcaster pat robertson in the gop field 
even while maintaining his neutrality reagan has consistently 
spoken in glowing terms of bush telling television personality 
david frost in a nov 28 interview for instance that bush has 
been the finest vice president in my memory in this country 
on the other hand he has spoken slightingly of robertson at his 
feb 24 news conference after robertson claimed that his christian 
broadcasting network had known and announced the location of 
american hostages in lebanon reagan said isnt it strange that 
no one in our administration was ever apprised of that if he 
thought he knew he kept it to himself 
at the time of nancy reagans hospitalization for breast cancer 
surgery last year robertson made a remark that the president 
interpreted as criticism of the first lady talking to reporters 
before a scheduled white house meeting of gop presidential 
hopefuls reagan said of the comment ill see if he brings it 
up 
the president eventually canceled the meeting altogether 
reportedly in anger over the robertson remark and it was never 
rescheduled 
despite the apparent contrast in reagans views of the two 
surviving contenders both white house political director frank 
donatelli and his predecessor mitchell e daniels jr said in 
recent interviews that they expected the president to maintain his 
stance of neutrality after doles anticipated withdrawal 
for one reason they said there would be little pressure for 
reagan to enter the fray now since bush is so far ahead that 
robertson is no threat to him robertson has acknowledged bushs 
victory and is a candidate in name only 
stephen hess an expert on presidential politics with the 
brookings institute called the presidents neutrality a modest 
fiction that probably cant do any harm 
everybody knows including george bush and all who are 
interested in being involved in the campaign exactly where 
reagans heart is hess said

congress can save its sweeping trade bill from 
a presidential veto if lawmakers drop a provision requiring advance 
notice of plant closings says the nations top trade negotiator 
my judgment is that it would precipitate a veto if it 
remains us trade representative clayton k yeutter said 
tuesday 
his comment came hours before a housesenate panel voted to 
approve the provision which would require employers to serve 
60day notice of impending plant closings involving 100 or more 
employees 
companies would be required to give notice of any layoff of 50 
or more workers if those being furloughed made up at least one 
third of the work force at the plant 
in layoffs involving 500 or more workers notice would be 
required regardless of whether they represented onethird of the 
work force 
an exemption would be provided for faltering businesses 
violation would carry a penalty of up to 500 a day payable to 
local governments 
the plant closings issue was fiercely debated when the senate 
approved the 1000page trade bill last year and decided to include 
such a provision business groups say it would spawn lawsuits by 
communities trying to save factory jobs the house omitted such a 
plan from its version of the bill 
president reagan said monday in a speech in richmond va that 
the plantclosings provision was one of three that would prompt him 
to veto the trade bill 
the others were mandatory import curbs and disclosure of foreign 
ownership of property in the united states issues lawmakers hope 
to resolve before their spring break next week they have been 
tentatively planning to bring a final product to the floor soon 
after they return 
the plantclosings provision was approved on a voice vote by a 
subcommittee of the housesenate conference committee on the trade 
bill 
its inclusion and resulting concern over a possible veto raised 
the question of whether the subcommittee could be reversed or 
induced to backtrack or as a last resort if it would be possible 
to override a veto 
yeutter held out hope that the plantclosings provision could 
still be erased somehow and said no final conclusions should be 
drawn until the end of the legislative day 
its not over until its over he said 
labor secretary ann mclaughlin also urged that the provision be 
dropped if not i have no recourse but to recommend a veto of 
the trade bill she said 
senate finance committee chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas said 
it was a possibility that the provision could be removed but 
i know of nothing that would indicate that its a certainty 
we have said repeatedly that we want as strong a bill as can 
be enacted into law said bentsen who is vice chairman of the 
overall conference committee but not a member of the plantclosings 
panel 
rep ed jenkins dga leaving a meeting of a different trade 
bill subcommittee said it appeared that sending the measure to the 
president with the plantclosing provision in it would guarantee a 
veto 
based on previous comments from people in the administration 
i would anticipate that it would jenkins said asked if it would 
be possible to override a veto he said i would think that it 
would be unlikely 
the chairman of the plantclosings panel rep augustus f 
hawkins dcalif indicated that he expected the provision to be 
contained in the final product he allowed critics full chance to 
offer amendments but afterward rejected requests for continued 
dialogue 
the dialogue cannot be continued indefinitely hawkins said 
the president said several times including this week that if 
the bill has mandatory notice of plant closings in it hes going 
to veto it said rep steve bartlett rtexas a persistent 
critic of the plantclosings provision now thats not hard for 
anybody to understand

michael dukakis regained some of the 
credibility he needed with his connecticut presidential primary 
victory and now must decide whether to follow the example of 
albert gore jr and directly challenge jesse jacksons 
qualifications for the white house 
with wisconsin looming as a tense tough battle next week and 
new york only two weeks later dukakis democratic dilemma is as 
simple as it is difficult 
he could permit jackson to run virtually unmolested and thus 
risk having his painstakingly constructed effort fall apart at the 
hands of a dynamic campaigner who has never held public office 
or he could confront jackson as he would any other contender 
who obstructed the way to the nomination but simultaneously risk 
alienating the millions of black voters who support the civil 
rights leader and are essential to a democratic victory in the fall 
a loss for the massachusetts governor in nextdoor connecticut 
would have effectively ended his hopes of winning the nomination 
even a close win over jackson might have been seen by party leaders 
as a sign of mortal weakness and sparked a movement to draft mario 
cuomo just in time for the governors home state new york primary 
on april 19 
instead dukakis triumphed in connecticut with 59 percent of the 
vote to 28 percent for jackson a solid win by anybodys reckoning 
even if it was in friendly new england and bought himself the 
time he needs to regroup for wisconsin 
his aides say he will campaign energetically there a response 
to the critics who complained that he seemed to give short shrift 
to michigan dukakis lost by about the same margin there as he won 
by in connecticut 
these aides also say he will set out the differences with 
jackson in wisconsin in a way he hasnt done before 
dukakis no doubt wishes that someone else will do the work for 
him the media the party leaders who fear a debacle if jackson 
heads the democratic ticket in the fall and other politicians are 
all candidates for the heavy lifting 
gore in fact stepped in even before the dimensions of dukakis 
big win and his own poor 7 percent finish were known from 
connecticut 
were not choosing a preacher were choosing a president 
he said in new york during the day 
gore credited jackson with having energized millions of 
voters and having offered ideas on drugs and the economy 
but i part company with him over his opposition to such 
mainstays of our national defense as the f15 and the cruise 
missile he said i categorically reject his notion that 
theres a moral equivalence between israel and the plo and i am 
dismayed by his embrace of plo leader yasser arafat and cuban 
leader fidel castro 
jackson campaigning in east harlem when told of gores remarks 
said the senator should not discriminate against someone because 
they are a preacher a priest or a rabbi 
i assume that he is stimulated by his own status in the 
campaign to attack me i am stimulated to keep hope alive he 
added 
that was jacksons way of saying that gore was attacking him out 
of desperation the tennessee senator three weeks after his strong 
super tuesday showing is still searching for a place to 
demonstrate srtrength in the north he has the added embarrassment 
of having lost eligibility for federal campaign funds at least 
temporarily 
gores attack was unprecedented in the democratic campaign and 
in the curious language of politics an indication of the new 
stature that jackson gained along with his michigan caucus victory 
last weekend 
for months the white candidates have basically let jackson alone 
assuming he posed no threat of winning the nomination even as 
they jabbed and poked at each other 
candidates generally refrain from attacking someone who isnt 
getting in their way in a campaign particularly if he has millions 
of followers whose votes may be needed later 
but when jackson won several super tuesday states followed up 
with a strong second place showing in the illinois primary on march 
15 and scored his stunning victory in michigan last weekend he 
stopped being a sideshow and became part of the main event 
and at dukakis expense 
the governors endorsements the organization the fundraisers 
the solemn whispering by aides of dukakis inevitability all seemed 
on the verge of being washed away in a michigan landslide 
jackson knew exactly how to ridicule the trappings of a campaign 
we dont have no rolls royces and no big stretch limousines on 
the road to the white house he said in connecticut were 
walking but we know the road better 
jackson can outdo dukakis in rhetoric at every turn 
the governor talks of his greek immigrant parents journey to 
success in the new world with genuine feeling heres what jackson 
says to his supporters many of them struggling daily with poverty 
im almost to the top but i came from the bottom i really 
understand

three people died in a fire that heavily damaged 
the cuban consulate on tuesday night consular officials kept 
firefighters away for 15 minutes while they telephoned for 
permission to let them in police said 
the three victims two men and a woman were found in 
different rooms of the top floor of the fourstory 19th century 
mansion on the slopes of mount royal said raymond therrien a fire 
director 
he said he presumed the three whose identities were not 
available were all consular employees and that they died of smoke 
inhalation 
therrien said the fire was believed to have started on the top 
floor where firefighters found unrolled fire hoses the cause of 
the blaze was not known 
consulate officials would not let firefighters battle the fire 
until about 15 minutes after they arrived police said 
theyve got their own security and their own fire people 
working inside police sgt ulrich pilon told reporters at the 
scene when they saw it was out of control they let the 
firefighters in 
pilon said a security guard in a condominium across the street 
had phoned to say he saw smoke coming from the consulates attic 
there were one or two fire trucks there when we arrived 
pilon said after we talked with the consul and she checked with 
her officials in ottawa they let the firemen in the consul 
whose name was not immediately available took up her post a week 
ago 
therrien said about 10 people were removed from the older part 
of the consulate where the fire raged and that the firefighting 
effort was hampered by the consulates barred windows 
the blaze did not reach a recently completed wing of the 
building 
the consulate is across the street from the house of former 
prime minister pierre trudeau and dozens of onlookers stood on his 
lawn to watch the blaze 
the delay by the cubans is similar to an incident in january 
1987 when soviet officials kept firemen waiting for a quarter of an 
hour before letting them fight a blaze that destroyed the soviet 
consulate in montreal 
while firemen waited perched on ladders soviet officials 
hustled boxes of documents out the back door into parked cars 
others inside the building tried to douse the flames with chemical 
extinguishers and buckets of snow

jesse jackson drew about 20 percent of the white 
vote in connecticut but a sizable percentage of democrats said they 
would vote republican in november if jackson were the nominee exit 
polls showed 
in addition jackson lost the support of bluecollar white 
workers in connecticut to michael dukakis the polls by abc news 
and wnbctv said 
jackson has improved his showing with whites but not the 
working class whites hes supposedly been getting said abc poll 
analyst john brennan those have been won decisively by mike 
dukakis 
signs of jacksons weakness in a fall campaign were also evident 
in the survey findings thirtythree percent of democrats told abc 
they would abandon the party and vote for george bush if jackson 
were nominated compared with 13 percent if dukakis were the 
nominee and 24 percent if gore received the nomination 
that third of the democrats whod vote for bush if jackson were 
nominated include a plurality 45 percent of the democrats who 
voted for dukakis 
sixty percent of the democrats including a third of those who 
voted for jackson said they believe dukakis will be the nominee 
wnbc found only 20 percent said they think the country is ready to 
elect a black president 
dukakis won all demographic groups except blacks and abc found 
that 79 percent of democrats said they would support him against 
bush in november just 56 percent said they would support sen 
albert gore jr against bush and only 52 percent of democrats said 
they would back jackson against bush 
still the wnbc poll found some softness in dukakis support 45 
percent of his voters said they wished there were other candidates 
running 
hes swept all groups except blacks said poll chief laurily 
epstein but theres disquieting news in that its not 
enthusiastic support 
abc found that jackson did not draw a much greater share of 
black voters to the process their 8 percent of the total was up 
just 1 point from 1984 and jacksons white supporters were 
primarily welleducated liberals dukakis governor of neighboring 
massachusetts won bluecollar workers by a 2to1 margin 
he jackson is increasing his white vote brennan said 
but given the profile of his white vote its doubtful at this 
point that he is competitive 
brennan noted that jacksons share of the white vote was about 
the same in massachusetts and rhode island and greater in vermont 
early this month before his victory saturday in the michigan 
caucuses the wnbc poll found no evidence of movement to jackson 
after his michigan victory 
theres been a misconception that jackson has made some kind 
of substantial breakthrough with the white vote brennan said 
i dont think thats happened there was no exit polling in the 
michigan caucuses which as is customary for caucuses drew 
relatively few voters 
there also was a hint of potential trouble for bush in the 
general election the 40 percent of republicans who said he not has 
told the full story of the irancontra affair tended to support him 
less strongly among those for whom its an issue its hurting 
him epstein said 
bush still was viewed favorably by 75 percent of the republican 
voters and unfavorably by 18 percent in wbncs poll dukakis was 
viewed favorably by 70 percent of democrats and unfavorably by 10 
percent 
jackson was viewed favorably by about half democrats and 
unfavorably by a third while gores rating was 40 percent 
favorable a quarter unfavorable only one in seven gore supporters 
think he will be the partys nominee 
the wnbc poll included 1700 voters and had a margin of sampling 
error of 3 points abcs poll had 1277 voters and a 5point error 
margin

here is a transcript of sen bob doles 
comments tuesday as he ended his bid for the republican 
presidential nomination 
well i am very honored to be here today and i appreciate all 
my many of my most all of my colleagues being here many from 
the house and my good friend pat moynihan pat appreciate your 
being here too 
and were not going to say anything mean about anybody so you 
its about its going to be a nonpartisan statement not going 
to attack any republicans so in any event 
but nearly five months ago i went home to russell kan to 
declare my candidacy for the highest office the american people can 
bestow 
it was only natural that i should begin my campaign for the 
presidency on main street among those from whom i have always 
drawn my strength and identity 
today here i am bloodied but unbowed as the poet says 
reminding you that there was a special reason this year for those 
of us on the republican side to walk or in my case to run the 
extra mile 
and that reason is the national interest 
the nation is entering a period in which there are great dangers 
and great challenges and i entered this race convinced that to 
solve our problems and realize our potential america requires 
strong leadership 
the kind forged in the crucible of governance 
the kind that is sensitive to how ordinary people live and 
attuned to their extraordinary possibilities 
i ran for my partys nomination because i was determined to lead 
a dialogue on issues that matter issues that i care passionately 
about involving the national defense and fiscal integrity of this 
country profoundly interrelated issues i feared would get lost in 
the shuffle 
i wanted these issues to be a part of a crucial dialogue about 
this countrys future 
it matters if we have this hostile soviet client state the 
sandinistas are building in our own backyard 
it matters if we have this monster deficit looming up like a 
tidal wave in our future 
and it matters how we deal with these issues whether we 
mortgage our future to them or whether we make certain that the 
buck stops here and future generations dont have to pay up 
because of our cowardice 
my campaign has been an appeal for all republicans to recognize 
and celebrate the diversity of america 
no party can govern that is not truly representative of this 
nation of nations 
and no president can succeed who promises confidence but 
withholds compassion 
i seek a party as strong in its commitment to equal rights as to 
its military and economic preeminence for the defense of american 
freedom whether at home or abroad is ultimately indivisible its 
success depends on a house united and leadership with the will to 
win 
now i know and my friends know that i am a fighter and i dont 
like to lose 
and i make no apology for that its simply the way i am 
they also know that i am an optimist 
if i werent i wouldnt be standing here today 
and i have been beaten before and no doubt will again 
but i have never been defeated and never will be so 
my wife elizabeth and my daughter robin are beside me today as 
they have been throughout this campaign 
we have become even closer because of this journey and ill 
always be grateful for their love and support 
bill brock and bob ellsworth and nancy kassebaum and 
countless and hundreds of others my colleagues in the house and 
the senate staff members and members of the dole for president 
committee all across america volunteers both here today and 
across the country have made this campaign a labor of love and my 
thanks seem hardly enough 
more than one and a half million americans have honored me with 
their support in primaries and caucuses and for that i will 
always be humble 
the one thing you learn how to do pretty well in our business is 
to count 
you come to trust your instincts to tell you when its over 
and in my heart i know that time is now 
and so i congratulate george bush and wish him well in 
november because as ive said many many times the bottom line is 
keeping the white house republican thats the bottom line 
so today ive come to the end of one road but the journey is 
far from over 
when people ask me why i ran for president i will say because i 
wanted to make a difference 
and that desire will remain with me for as long as i live 
ronald reagan has made an historic difference for america 
he has set us on a renewed course to renewed prosperity greater 
security and more hope and more opportunity for each and every 
american 
but there is much more work to do 
so i return to the senate as the republican leader eager to 
engage there the issues that confront america and ready to do all 
i can to elect republicans in november and doing all i can for our 
nominee george bush 
thank you very much

midwest bases 
most of the flower flight stops are open 24 hours daily 
yearround mount vernon is open from 6 am to midnight

a cloth diaper importer has offered this 
town a years worth of free diapers to show his appreciation for 
the town fathers refusing to let welfare recipients buy the 
disposable kind 
philip d anderson president of empire trading co ltd of 
syracuse ny said he will supply as many cotton diapers as the 
town needs at no charge 
he said his offer was prompted by a news story about the towns 
feb 16 decision to remove disposable diapers from the list of 
allowable local welfare expenses 
anderson said his company supplies diaper services and 
mailorder houses with chinesemade diapers designed to retain 
their shape after laundering 
the towns policy change has drawn support from 
environmentalists and fiscal conservatives who agree with the 
choice of traditional cloth diapers as an appropriate technology 
that saves taxpayers money 
critics have accused lisbon officials of making a rash decision 
to balance the budget on innocent babies bottoms 
in a letter to the times record in nearby brunswick peggy 
cotton of west bath said the restriction was for a baby whos 
helpless and she suggested that town officials get their 
savings someplace else 
connie a france lisbons welfare director recommended the 
policy because throwaway diapers cost 10 a box while cloth 
diapers even with laundering costs considered are less of a drain 
on the towns welfare budget 
france said it would be up to the selectmen whether to accept 
andersons offer but she added im sure they will 
france said she had no idea how big a diaper demand there was 
over a years time but pending the selectmens decision she would 
order a gross of diapers from anderson 
the welfare director said that while the diaper rules may have 
caused a stir outside lisbon there have been no complaints from 
her clients 
town manager john bubier said lisbon officials have received 
letters and phone calls from across the country in response to the 
diaper policy with about 98 percent of them backing up the 
selectmen 
he said 200 to 300 individuals in this town of 12000 usually 
receive public assistance benefits during the course of a year the 
local welfare budget totals about 35000

monday afternoon near the atlantic exit on interstate 80 
the trooper who pulled the car over had become suspicious and 
asked to look inside the trunk shepard said 
he saw several suitcases one of which appeared to be leaking 
a white powdered substance shepard said the trooper called for 
help and a dog trained to detect narcotics was brought to the 
scene 
the dog indicated there were controlled substances in the 
containers shepard said 
field tests concluded that the suitcases held cocaine and monie 
was arrested along with a woman who had been driving the car and a 
second woman a 2yearold child in the car was turned over 
temporarily to county human services workers 
the two women said they knew nothing about the suitcases in the 
trunk and were later released

oba oba with its brazilian entertainment 
and the black swan dance company with brazilian dance and guest 
dancer fernando bujones opened in new york the same night 
oba oba at broadways ambassador theater looks exactly 
like a show an american would expect to find at a rio de janeiro 
nightclub catering to tourists one would expect to be exhilarated 
and the performance here tuesday night was surprisingly delightful 
costumes dancing and musicians look like mardi gras on stage 
before act 1 ended with a tribute to carmen miranda one already 
had thought of her flamboyance 
oba oba is more than cheerful its 50 or so performers 
exude an infectious spirit of joyfulness 
references to slaves fighting and african religions in act 2 
lead up to athletic and exotic dances strictly entertaining not 
seriously ethnic 
in some dances women wore tops and dance belts backless 
bikinis because their manner wasnt naughty it seemed simply 
another costume 
singing star eliana estevao has a beautiful voice 
a limited engagement for oba oba has been announced 
at the city center the 10yearold black swan dance company 
from sao paulo brazil opened for a week 
guest star fernando bujones is still the exciting dancer with 
dazzling technique he was when seen regularly here in american 
ballet theater 
his partner tuesday in two pas de deux was beguiling petite 
yoko morishita of hiroshima japan 
the program overlong included two folk dance numbers an 
undistinguished pas de deux for ana botafogo and laudiney delgado 
and two unusual character ballets 
in the first ballet who are you vitorio casarim has a 
dalliance in dance with a fiery woman then with a demure one and 
winds up in a clinch with a man in a black cloak we had thought 
until then was a priest 
a more successful dance is based on sartres no exit julio 
lopes choreographs erotic solo dancing and some nudity each one of 
a trio condemned to share a room in hell tries to entice the one he 
or she fancies but that one always yearns for the third party 
even a twitch from the third person can undo the seductive effect 
the first person begins to have on the second

the commander of the communist 
insurgencys army was among seven rebels captured this week the 
military disclosed wednesday 
romulo kintanar the elusive leader of the new peoples army 
was presented at a news conference held wednesday by maj gen 
ramon montano chief of the philippine constabulary at a heavily 
guarded suburban manila military camp 
the seven rebels who were arrested in a series of raids 
tuesday also include communist party secretarygeneral rafael 
baylosis central committee member benjamin de vera and the chief 
of staff and logistics officer of the new peoples army napoleon 
manuel 
of the seven rebels captured only baylosis did not appear at 
the news conference wednesday montano said baylosis had refused to 
be photographed 
the arrest of the rebels was seen as a significant breakthrough 
in the governments 19year battle against the communist insurgency 
president corazon aquino immediately hailed the arrests and 
commended the armed forces chief of staff gen renato de villa 
and other officers 
the arrest of top communist leaders rafael baylosis benjamin 
de vera and several others is happy news for our country mrs 
aquino said in a statement read by press secretary teodoro benigno 
it clearly demonstrates that we have turned the tide and are 
winning the war against the communist insurgency the fact that 
they were arrested on the npas 19th anniversary tuesday attests 
to the admirable performance of our armed forces of the 
philippines i am elated and so is our citizenry 
the statement apparently was prepared before officials realized 
that kintanar was among those arrested in raids tuesday in the 
manila suburb of san juan officials said kintanar initially gave 
authorities a false name 
kintanar had long been wanted by the military 
besides being the alleged head of the 24000strong new peoples 
army he is widely believed to be the organizer of communist urban 
assassination squads called sparrow units because of the swiftness 
of their attacks 
kintanar organized the sparrows which began operations in the 
southern davao city in the early 1980s before moving out to the 
manila area and other urban centers 
military authorities did not mention kintanar when they 
announced the arrests tuesday he apparently used the alias of 
mario asuncion because no person with such a name was among the 
rebels presented to the press wednesday 
the others arrested were kintanars wife gloria manuels wife 
inez and marco palo a member of the communist partys liaison 
committee jailed under deposed president ferdinand marcos palo was 
among 500 political prisoners mrs aquino released soon after 
assuming power on feb 25 1986

american builders are being urged to bid on 
japanese construction projects and test a settlement of the bitter 
dispute over their exclusion from that countrys public works boom 
us trade representative clayton yeutter and japanese deputy 
chief cabinet secretary ichiro ozawa on tuesday jointly announced 
the agreement resolving one of the major trade conflicts between 
the two countries 
ozawa and the us chief negotiator deputy trade representative 
michael smith both urged us firms to try out the new accord 
admitting them to bidding on japanese public works and 
semiofficial construction 
deputy us commerce secretary w allen moore said our side 
feels fairly good about the outcome of these talks but the real 
proof of access will be in the future 
he said commerce secretary c william verity next week plans to 
call heads of major us construction companies to washington and 
urge them to take advantage of what we sincerely believe is a 
real opportunity 
ozawa negotiated as a personal representative of prime minister 
noboru takeshita who he recalled agreed with president reagan in 
january that the construction dispute could be solved amicably 
it is my great pleasure to see a settlement that is amicable 
mutually satisfactory and fruitful ozawa said 
yeutter said he wanted to pay tribute to takeshita and ozawa for 
their efforts the settlement proves that through negotiation the 
two countries can manage difficult bilateral trade disputes he 
said 
officials said the accord provides for us participation in 
construction of the offshore osaka international airport and some 
other projects on which the two governments had basically agreed 
last year 
added to it were procedures for nondiscriminatory bidding on 
other public works projects financed by the japanese central 
government and a third category of local public works as well as 
private projects franchised or approved by the central government 
these include airport terminals which us builders said they 
have been prevented from bidding on despite an edge in experience 
and competitiveness the agreement provides for bidding credit to 
be granted for experience outside japan 
officials said that besides the multibilliondollar osaka 
airport project the agreement covers entry of us builders in the 
bidding on 169 billion worth of other specific projects 
officials said provisions were made for expanding the list and 
the us embassy in tokyo or the japanese foreign ministry can 
request a meeting on the agreement at any time with an overall 
review set for 1990 
moore said the vote in congress last year to bar japanese 
builders from us projects in retaliation for the exclusion of 
us contractors from the japanese market had contributed to 
wednesdays settlement us officials hope the agreement will work 
and that it will not be necessary to extend the us ban he said 
a coauthor of the legislation sen frank murkowski ralaska 
said the pact appears to be workable and he hopes it turns out 
to be more than just a box wrapped with lovely paper and ribbon 
the ultimate success of failure of this agreement will depend 
on the followthrough by our industry and by the government and 
industry in japan he said

capped a 278yen decline over four trading days and temporarily 
touched 12387 yen its lowest level since the first week of 
january

triggered by speculative movements bolstered by almost groundless 
factors

recent market intervention in support of the dollar by japanese and 
us central banks as having been firm 
but many market analysts have said bullish sentiments toward the 
yen remain because of healthly japanese economic fundamentals

democratic presidential contender michael 
dukakis scored a 21 primary victory over jesse jackson in the 
state next door to his own while republicans handed vice president 
george bush an easy victory over bob dole who quit the race before 
the polls closed 
dukakis backers had been worried about jackson who gained 
momentum in his decisive weekend victory over the massachusetts 
governor in the michigan caucuses 
sen christopher j dodd a connecticut democrat who endorsed 
dukakis only last week said there had been a lot of anxious 
moments in the days before the presidential primary but he 
said weve stemmed the tide 
the massachusetts governor got the lift from his neighbors he 
had counted on tuesday besting jackson 58 percent to 28 percent 
according to final unofficial returns sen albert gore jr of 
tennessee lagged with 8 percent 
this sends us back to wisconsin and colorado with a very good 
boost dukakis said looking ahead to next weeks contests 
speaking by a telephone link to connecticut supporters in 
hartford dukakis said it had been a wonderful night and a 
wonderful victory 
youre good neighbors and good friends he said 
dukakis walked away with 36 of the 52 connecticut delegates up 
for grabs and jackson took 16 
in the gop race bush had 70 percent of the vote in the state 
where he grew up to doles 20 percent according to unofficial 
final returns bush took 25 of the 35 delegates at stake while 
dole got the other 10 
a poll released last week before the michigan caucuses 
indicated dukakis was favored by 50 percent of democrats to 16 
percent for jackson while 27 percent were undecided 
jackson had strong showings in connecticuts cities and exit 
polling by wnbctv in new york showed jackson winning the votes of 
one of every five white connecticut democrats 
four years ago by comparison jackson got 5 percent of the 
white vote former hartford mayor thirman l milner jacksons 
connecticut chairman said in 1984 jackson was seen only as a 
black voters candidate 
that is no longer the case milner said he is getting a 
crosssection of connecticut voters i think his campaign is right 
on target 
after the gop returns were in bush called for a good unified 
effort for the fall 
bush turned his attention to the general election before the 
primary results were in since dole dropped out while connecticut 
polls were still open 
the job you all did in connecticut got through to my 
opponents bush said by telephone from wisconsin to about 200 
supporters at a wallingford victory celebration 
former television evangelist pat robertson who ignored 
connecticut said tuesday he couldnt dispute bushs lock on the 
nomination 
unofficial final returns showed dukakis with 139968 votes 
jackson with 68193 and gore with 18542 votes 
in addition former colorado sen gary hart had 5767 votes or 
2 percent sen paul simon of illinois had 3136 votes or 1 
percent former arizona gov bruce babbitt had 2512 votes or 1 
percent rep richard gephardt of missouri had 1018 votes or 1 
percent 
hart babbitt and gephardt have all left the democratic 
presidential race gephardt was the most recent dropout abandoning 
his bid on monday 
one percent or 1924 voters chose the uncommitted line 
the unofficial reurns showed bush with 73020 votes dole with 
21032 robertson with 3415 or 3 percent and rep jack kemp of 
new york with 3375 votes or 3 percent and another 1 percent or 
3200 uncommitted

the senate finance committee has agreed to 
grant a fueltax exemption for farmers and other offtheroad 
diesel users on april 1 and to make corporations foot the bill 
however the future of the proposed relief remained in doubt 
tuesday because the house ways and means committee which must 
originate tax bills has scheduled no action on the diesel 
proposal backers of the legislation are holding out hope that the 
house panel will approve a bill this week before adjourning for 
easter week 
farmers fishermen and others who use diesel for offtheroad 
business purposes traditionally have been exempt from the tax 
which finances highway construction but under a 1987 law aimed at 
preventing cheating they must begin paying the tax on april 1 and 
then apply for a refund when they file their incometax returns 
next year 
the finance committee voted last week to grant these users 
relief from paying the tax at all but because of budget 
restrictions it acted to provide the exemption on oct 1 at the 
direction of the committee sen lloyd bentsen dtexas the 
chairman introduced an amendment tuesday that steps up the relief 
to april 1

columbia court of appeals that said georgetown does not have to 
officially recognize the organizations for that reason the school 
said it will not appeal the order to the supreme court 
officials at the nations oldest catholic university had argued 
that recognizing the groups would violate basic tenets of the 
catholic church and imply endorsement of homosexual practices 
this result has been a long time in coming and it is 
gratifying to have georgetown admit that it was wrong all these 
years said lorri jean who first brought the case as a member of 
a lesbian group at georgetown law school in 1980 theres great 
satisfaction that a battle begun as a firstyear law student has 
finally been won 
bacon also put into effect an appeals court ruling that 
georgetown must also pay attorneys fees for the students which 
are substantially in excess of half a million dollars 
according to attorney richard gross who represented one student 
group

states hoping to get title to abandoned 
shipwrecks of historic significance lying within their waters wont 
get those submerged treasures following a rejection of a house 
proposal strongly opposed by sport divers and some commercial 
salvage operators 
the house defeated the measure on tuesday 263139 which was 
five votes short of the twothirds majority required for passage 
the bill passed the senate by voice vote on dec 19 
rep norman d shumway rcalif complained that under the 
bill there is no legal binding or enforceable way to ensure 
that the sport divers right to dive on these wrecks even for 
purely recreational purposes will be protected by states 
rep e clay shaw jr rfla countered that its passage will 
go a long way toward preserving these archaeological treasures 
although he agreed with shumway that the bill may discourage 
private exploration for undiscovered shipwrecks 
without the bill said rep bruce vento dminn dynamiting and 
other abuses by some reckless treasure hunters would absolutely 
guarantee for future generations that these shipwrecks these 
valuable pieces of history would be lost for all time 
opponents complained that the bill had been brought to the floor 
under parliamentary ground rules usually adopted for abbreviated 
debate on noncontroversial bills with no amendments allowed 
the bills supporters led by rep charles e bennett dfla 
were expected to try to return the measure to the house floor under 
different rules which would allow opponents to introduce amendments 
and would require only a simple majority for passage

amateur detective work by a dealer of rare 
hebrew books who paid 60000 for a counterfeit 15th century 
haggadah the prayer book of passover has led to the arrests of 
two men accused of selling the document 
nobody in the world had this haggadah except the library in 
israel so thats why i bought it says dov berlin a brooklyn 
dealer of rare books 
raphael podde 45 of woodmere and gabriel reguer 49 of 
anaheim calif were arrested tuesday at their homes and indicted 
for allegedly selling or trying to sell counterfeit haggadoth to 
dealers federal prosecutors said 
the haggadah which recounts the story of the deliverance of the 
ancient hebrews from slavery in egypt is read by jews during the 
passover holiday celebration which begins friday evening 
the documents were handwritten until the invention of the 
printing press in the late 1400s scholars believe the haggadah was 
first printed in guadalajara spain in 1482 
the only known edition from that printing is kept at the jewish 
national and university library in jerusalem authorities said 
berlin with a business partner in israel bought what he 
thought was a previously unknown copy of the guadalajara haggadah 
for 60000 
in a telephone interview berlin said podde offered to sell him 
the rare haggadah in the spring of 1986 saying he had inherited it 
from the estate of his father 
berlin said he began to doubt its authenticity a few months 
later after a friend told him that he had just been offered a 
chance to buy a supposedly genuine guadalajara haggadah so he 
went to israel to compare it with the original 
there he discovered differences in markings between the two 
documents and he later contacted the fbi after podde refused to buy 
back the phony haggadah berlin said 
prosecutors said the defendants made the phony haggadoth by 
printing photocopies of the original onto paper made in the late 
15th century 
the only way to tell it was a counterfeit was to go to israel 
to compare it to the original said assistant us attorney jonny 
frank 
the indictment also accuses the defendants of selling three 
pages of the sixleaf counterfeit document to another dealer for 
12000 and unsuccessfully trying to sell two other phony haggadoth 
to two dealers for 90000 and 100000 
podde an italian citizen was identified as an expert printer 
and restorer of ancient hebrew books he and reguer are partners in 
the pardes rimonim press a company that prints and sells limited 
editions of hebrew books 
podde was arrested tuesday morning at his woodmere home which 
also is where the printing company is located reguer was arrested 
tuesday at his home in california 
they were each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit 
wire fraud and three counts of wire fraud each count carries a 
maximum sentence of five years in jail and a 250000 fine

a broken romance not political 
assassination was the motive behind the shotgun killing of an 
indian judicial candidate by a lumbee indian who later committed 
suicide a sheriff says 
another indian sandy gordon chavis 24 was charged with 
firstdegree murder tuesday as an accomplice in the slaying of 
julian pierce a popular 42yearold legal services lawyer who was 
running for superior court judge in racially troubled robeson 
county 
county sheriff hubert stone who had initially called pierces 
killing an assassination said a friend of chavis john anderson 
goins 24 had been having problems with his girlfriend whose 
mother was pierces fiancee 
two warrants were issued last week by the girlfriends mother 
charging goins with trespassing goins felt pierce had something to 
do with it he got mad and he killed him stone said 
goins body with a bullet wound to the head was found in a 
closet at his fathers home tuesday by police who had a murder 
warrant for his arrest stone called the death a suicide 
i can assure the world that there was no political involvement 
in the case stone said at a news conference i think the 
people of robeson county will understand that its just another 
murder 
on the eve of pierces funeral today however some county 
activists said they doubted stones conclusion 
in light of our history here any hasty conclusions to a 
murder in robeson county will always be highly suspect in the 
community said the rev mac legerton director of the center for 
community action in lumberton 
you got a few who believe its the real thing but i dont 
said the rev sd lewis assistant pastor at hilly branch baptist 
church a predominantly black church in lumberton theyre trying 
to pull a coverup on us 
before tuesdays arrest commissioners in the county of 100000 
people in southeastern north carolina had urged the appointment of 
a special prosecutor to investigate pierces killing because of 
fears it was racially linked 
anger at what the indians called corrupt local government and 
entrenched racism in robeson county boiled over feb 1 when two 
lumbees took hostages at the robesonian newspaper in lumberton the 
county seat 
the siege ended when the governor agreed to appoint a task force 
to investigate allegations that law enforcement was biased against 
racial minorities 
indian leaders have also called for a special session of the 
legislature to change a law that would automatically hand the 
judgeship over to pierces election opponent district attorney joe 
freeman britt who is white 
gov jim martin said tuesday he would continue to investigate 
the possibility of a special session he also said he had talked 
with britt about a special prosecutor but the district attorney 
was not prepared to do that 
under state law a special prosecutor could be appointed only if 
britt requested one from attorney general lacy thornburg 
pierce was shot in the chest and side early saturday morning 
gunmen blasted through a broken window in his kitchen door and 
entered the room to shoot him again in the head with a 12gauge 
shotgun stone said 
stone said chavis said in a confession that goins had pulled the 
trigger on the pump shotgun that killed pierce the gun belonged to 
chaviss brother stone said 
chavis accompanied goins who was described as a longtime friend 
of his during the crime stone said 
neither chavis nor goins a security guard in raleigh who had 
recently dropped out of north carolina state university had 
criminal records stone said

contra and sandinista negotiators 
agreed on the ceasefire areas where rebels will begin gathering 
friday and president daniel ortega urged the united states to 
discuss normalizing relations with nicaragua 
the negotiators identified the ceasefire zones tuesday at the 
end of two days of talks in the southern outpost of sapoa but 
failed to resolve other crucial issues including when the contra 
rebels will lay down their arms 
citing the ceasefire accord signed last week by sandinista and 
contra rebel leaders ortega said in a speech tuesday the united 
states should begin negotiating a return to normal relations with 
his leftist government 
we hope president reagan keeps his word he has repeatedly 
said that the day the sandinistas sit down for direct negotiations 
with the contras then the united states government would sit down 
and negotiate with the sandinistas 
we hope he is a man of his word and immediately fulfills his 
word to accept bilateral conversations to deal with security issues 
that concern the united states with respect to nicaragua and with 
nicaragua in respect to the united states ortega said the 
discussions should focus on normalizing relations not the internal 
policies of nicaragua he said 
ortega also urged the us congress not to approve more contra 
aid in violation of last weeks ceasefire agreement in which the 
rebels agreed to accept only humanitarian assistance from neutral 
organizations 
house negotiators later reached agreement in principle on 50 
million in nonmilitary aid to the contras and for children injured 
in the sixyear war 
us aid to the rebels expired feb 29 and contra leaders say 
reagans inability to secure them continued military aid was a 
factor in their decision to sign the accord 
after three days of talks in sapoa last week the contras and 
sandinistas agreed to try to work out a lasting peace during a 
60day ceasefire that is to begin friday the sandinistas also 
promised to restore democracy in nicaragua 
a communique released tuesday night at the end of two days of 
talks in sapoa aimed at hammering out details of the ceasefire 
said the two sides had agreed on the size and location of zones 
where the rebels are to gather 
the truce and zones two in the north two on the caribbean 
coast and one in the south were agreed to only in general terms 
the exact locations of the areas were not immediately disclosed 
army chief of staff maj gen joaquin cuadra the chief 
sandinista negotiator said that issues including what supplies the 
rebels may receive and whether they must lay down their weapons 
remain to be decided when the talks resume in sapoa next week 
under last weeks sapoa accords the main peace talks are to begin 
in managua on april 6 
we are trying to guarantee the physical and moral security of 
our combatants said aristides sanchez head of the rebel 
delegation 
ortega spoke on tuesday at a ceremony honoring antiwar activist 
s brian willson of san francisco as a hero of peace willson 
lost both legs last fall when a train ran over him during a protest 
at a us navy weapons depot in concord calif 
in november reagan said secretary of state george p shultz was 
prepared to meet with the sandinistas once serious negotiations 
on a nicaraguan ceasefire were under waythe united states and 
nicaragua have not held direct talks since 1984 
for years ortegas government refused to meet with the contras 
insisting instead on negotiations with the united states while the 
reagan administration said the sandinistas must first talk with the 
contras 
the sandinistas came to power in a revolution that ousted the 
rightist regime of the late president anastasio somoza in july 
1979 the united states supported the sandinistas initially but in 
1981 began financing the contra insurgency the civil war has 
ravaged the nicaraguan economy created food shortages and 
produced an unpopular military draft

it hardly merits a mention in most 
history books but sweden is celebrating the 350th anniversary of 
its shortlived colonization of the new world and swedes 
contribution to the american way of life 
marking that longago foothold sweden is putting on a traveling 
show of their emigrants contributions that range from the zipper 
and coca cola bottle to ball bearings and monkey wrenches 
the yearlong celebration will begin with a 14city us tour in 
april by king carl xvi gustaf and queen silvia 
swedish settlers disembarked on the shores of the delaware river 
on march 29 1638 18 years after the pilgrims landed farther north 
at plymouth rock mass at its peak new sweden had 500 people 
but within 17 years the swedes lost their colony to the dutch who 
then lost it to the british 
its not much to celebrate we are a peaceful people and even 
then we had no knack for colonial work said historian per sorbom 
of uppsala university 
but its a good excuse to make sweden a little more known in 
the united states and to give sweden an identity said sorbom 
who has organized an exhibition of inventions and innovations by 
swedish emigrants 
sorboms its swedish exhibition will open april 19 in 
chicago and move in the autumn to los angeles 
about 1000 exhibitions music festivals seminars and other 
events are planned in the united states for the celebrations called 
new sweden 88 
they include a display of the swedish crown jewels in washington 
and tributes to raoul wallenberg the swedish diplomat credited 
with saving 100000 hungarian jews from nazi death camps in world 
war ii wallenberg disappeared toward the end of the war and there 
are occasional reports that he is still alive in a soviet labor 
camp after being seized by advancing soviet troops the soviets 
insist he is dead 
though the swedes delaware colony had little impact on american 
history it was the first page of nordic emigration 
in the 19th century before sweden became industrialized 
emigrants fled poor farmlands that could not sustain the growing 
population 
by 1900 1 million people or onequarter of the worlds swedish 
population lived in the united states the number of americans of 
swedish descent has grown to 43 million compared to swedens 
population of 84 million 
among the swedish immigrants are many whose names have been 
virtually forgotten but not their contributions they include 
alexander samuelsson a glassblower from goteborg who emigrated 
in 1883 he won a design contest for a company selling its fizzy 
drink at soda fountains 
coca cola wanted a bottle that would be recognizable even if 
it was broken in the gutter said sorbom and samuelssons design 
is still in use 
justus sjoberg he moved to chicago from goteborg and changed 
his name to seeburg he is credited with inventing the parking 
meter and the jukebox 
gideon sundbach in the early 1900s he patented the modern 
zipper 
ce measurement johansson his gauges for steelmaking 
became an essential element of henry fords assembly line 
sorbon said other displays in his exhibition range from safety 
matches to heart pacemakers to the hasselblad cameras used by 
american astronauts who landed on the moon

former president chun doohwans 
younger brother confessed to stealing a fortune in cash land and 
stocks and will be charged with embezzling at least 93 million 
prosecutors announced today 
senior prosecutor kang wonil said chun kyunghwan broke down 
early today after 20 hours of interrogation and admitted he 
embezzled funds during his seven years as head of the semiofficial 
saemaul new community movement 
kang said chun who at first denied the charges confessed after 
being shown evidence and said he used the money for land and stock 
speculation 
mr chun has largely admitted to most of the charges after 
prosecutors showed him evidence and through crossexamination 
kang said 
kang said formal corruption and embezzlement charges were being 
prepared and chun would be charged today or thursday if convicted 
chun could receive punishments ranging from 10 years imprisonment 
to the death sentence 
prosecutors said chun still denied charges that he peddled 
government influence and diverted funds overseas according to kang 
officials said he also blamed his surbordinates for taking most 
of the funds missing from saemaul a huge nationwide organization 
founded in 1971 to promote urban and rural development 
but kang who has headed the investigation into saemaul said 
there was extensive evidence implicating chun as the key figure in 
massive corruption involving embezzlement influence peddling and 
extorting stocks land and money from businesses 
my investigators have already secured enough evidence to 
incriminate and prosecute chun he said 
prosecutors said chun was implicated in the misappropriation of 
93 million they said investigators were checking evidence chun 
embezzled another 6 million 
the government investigation into corruption within saemaul has 
become a major political scandal about 200 saemaul and government 
officials have been questioned about corruption or covering it up 
to protect former president chun and his family 
five suspects were charged with embezzlement and fraudulent land 
sales tuesday night prosecutors said two of them top saemaul 
officials and brothersinlaw of the younger chun 
one brotherinlaw hwang hungsik tried to commit suicide 
twice tuesday while in custody once trying to jump from a 
fivestory window 
former president chun who has not been implicated in the 
saemaul scandal is on a private tour of the united states and met 
with president reagan at the white house last week 
opposition parties are demanding the former president return to 
south korea immediately to explain his role in the saemaul scandal 
opposition leaders charge the former president must have been 
involved in the affair 
prosecutors say the younger chun who was appointed by his 
brother used his position as saemaul leader to divert government 
and private donations sell influence and pressured businesses to 
make gifts of money land and stocks 
widespread government corruption was long suspected under the 
authoritarian chun regime but criticism of the president and his 
family were not tolerated and the allegations were ignored 
the younger chun resigned as saemaul chief in 1987 after being 
linked to underworld gangsters he fled to japan april 18 when news 
of the government probe surfaced but returned two days later to 
face questioning 
president roh taewoo who took power feb 25 is thought to 
have approved the saemaul probe to discredit the former president 
and end his predecessors attempts to retain power and influence 
within the government 
some chun loyalists were purged from the governing democratic 
justice party earlier this month and roh blocked the former 
presidents attempts to retain substantial power as a government 
adviser 
roh a former general who helped put chun in power with military 
backing in 1980 promised during the presidential election campaign 
to root out and end official corruption

candidate most attuned to our concerns in the south and southwest 
he is the candidate most committed to national security and he

a fiveman crew and johnson space 
center flight controllers are in the middle of a 32hour simulated 
mission to rehearse the real flight scheduled for august 4 
nasas first postchallenger shuttle crew launched tuesday 
on the mission that ends today at 5 pm and almost immediately 
began to confront potential problems it might face during an actual 
flight 
the most severe problem occurred nearly six minutes after the 
909 am liftoff when one of three main engines shut down 
prematurely forcing the crew to simulate an emergency 
aborttoorbit procedure which it did successfully 
later the crew commanded by frederick hauck missed its first 
opportunity about 3 pm to deploy their primary payload 
eventually the rehearsed deployment was delayed a day when 
difficulties developed with the satellites stabilizing gyroscopes 
and a booster 
efforts to troubleshoot onboard problems were hampered even 
more when an orbiting tdrs satellite malfunctioned forcing the 
crew to communicate with mission controllers through a network of 
ground stations rather than the satellite network 
the crew is made up of hauck pilot richard covey and mission 
specialists david hilmers george pinky nelson and mike lounge

into the united states from colombia via normans cay in the 
bahamas from 1978 to 1980 
noriegas name came up after barnes mentioned the panamanian 
strongman in a letter he wrote last month to lehder this whole 
thing has to do with noriegas indictment in the middle district of 
florida he said 
noriega is under indictment on drug smuggling charges in both 
miami and tampa 
after the slaying last year in colombia barnes said he was 
detained and questioned for two days in panama by g2 about the 
killing allegedly carried out by the medellin cartel the 
government alleges lehder is one of the cartels leaders 
the suggestion was that the people i worked for had murdered 
the pilot it was not true barnes said 
merkle said he did not contend lehder was involved in the 
killing merkle said noriegas pilot was killed because he had 
stolen cocaine while flying drugs for both the panamanian leader 
and the medellin cartel 
following his detention barnes was ordered out of the country 
and left aboard his private twinengine plane about an hour over 
the ocean one of his engines went out and then the other started 
failing 
with the jury out of the room merkle said g2 removed the 
backs of the magnetos in his engines and tried to kill him plain 
and simple 
barnes has pleaded guilty to one charge of conspiracy to import 
cocaine and faces a maximum sevenyear sentence 
although barnes testified that he flew some 3000 kilograms for 
lehder in 1978 and 1980 he admitted under crossexamination that 
he was not aware of any of the drug flights listed in the 
indictment under which lehder is being prosecuted 
lehder is charged with conspiracy possession of cocaine with 
intent to distribute importation of cocaine and operating a 
continuing criminal enterprise 
codefendant jack carlton reed 57 of san pedro calif is 
charged only with taking part in a smuggling conspiracy

a man who helped organize a citizens 
revolt against drug dealing in his neighborhood says he and his 
family are being chased out of town by drug traffickers because he 
dared to speak out 
rick hargraves said tuesday he decided to speed up his previous 
plans to move after he was threatened with a pistol outside his 
home this week 
they really dont scare me im worried about my wife and 
kids said hargraves an unemployed mechanic who has owned a 
house on yakimas oncequiet south naches avenue for six years 
the familys plight illustrates the rising frustrations of 
residents on the citys east side who are faced with discarded 
hypodermic syringes on lawns open drug dealing on sidewalks and 
violence in the alleys 
central washington is a drug hotbed with cocaine and heroin 
carried north from mexico by people posing as migrant farmworkers 
officials say the influence of drugs has sent the yakima county 
crime rate particularly murder and burglary skyrocketing 
drugs are a very serious problem over here it far exceeds 
what i thought i would get into when i got here a year ago said 
robert dreisbach head of the us drug enforcement administration 
office in yakima 
the local dea task force in place just over a year has made 99 
arrests many of them upper echelon dealers and suppliers he said 
this used to be a beautiful neighborhood said teresa 
ocampo hargraves neighbor and like him a member of the 
twoweekold south naches cleanup committee now kids go outside 
to play and find syringes and put them in their mouth 
while many committee members have preferred anonymity 
hargraves an unemployed mechanic was outspoken 
he talked with reporters about the committees effort to record 
license plates of suspicious vehicles and the anger of homeowners 
at seeing their values decreasing 
on monday while hargraves and his wife jill were standing 
outside their house talking with a television reporter a vehicle 
pulled up to the curb and the passenger rolled down the window 
hargraves said 
the driver leaned over pointed a gun at them made three sounds 
like shots being fired and then drove away he said police 
arrested two men a short time later but hargraves said things have 
gone too far 
the family purchased a house outside of town about two months 
ago intending to leave the neighborhood as soon as they sold their 
present home mrs hargraves said they hadnt wanted to leave 
before then for fear drug dealers would take over the empty house 
after mondays incident however they decided to move out right 
away and found a friend who was willing to live there 
if she minds her own business theyre not going to bother 
her mrs hargraves said we were fine until we started 
fighting back 
police chief pleas green said hargraves made the mistake of 
becoming a focal point in the antidrug efforts especially through 
media interviews and photographs 
the average citizen is not equipped to fight drug dealers 
dreisbach said 
in this area most of the drug traffickers are armed with 
loaded automatic and semiautomatic weapons he said the 
number of drugrelated homicides and assaults shows they do use 
them periodically

a custody fight over an indian child found eating 
garbage after she was abandoned by her mother pits illinois courts 
against the tribal legal system which her attorney fears will take 
her from her foster parents 
the girl 6yearold eleanor armell has nightmares over the 
possibility of being taken from the custody of her foster family 
the only parents she has ever known said her attorney cook 
county public guardian patrick murphy 
but diane la plante an attorney for the tribe the potawatmis 
said tuesday that the tribal system is where the case belongs 
it is entirely possible the tribal court would rule the girl 
should remain with her foster family she said 
the indian child welfare act of 1978 gives tribal courts 
jurisdiction in custody cases involving indian children its aim is 
to stop the erosion of the american indian family and to protect 
american indian children ms la plante said after juvenile court 
judge claude whitaker delayed ruling on a motion by murphy 
murphy asked the judge tuesday to postpone enforcement of his 
march 18 ruling to transfer the case to the tribal court of the 
potawatami indian reservation in mayetta kan 
murphy sought the delay while he is appealing the ruling but 
whitaker said he would not consider the request until today because 
murphy failed to give ms laplante adequate notice of his motion 
this involves a very real little girl having nightmares 
and getting sick out of fear that she will be taken from her 
foster parents murphy told the judge 
lorraine swett the girls foster mother had planned to testify 
tuesday and wept after whitaker delayed action in the case 
if possible i want her to stay with me ive had her for 
three years shes just like my own mrs swett said outside the 
courtroom 
mrs swett 46 is a menominee indian she and her husband 
paul a us navy officer have four children of their own they 
moved to novato calif from the chicago area a year ago and 
eleanor was allowed to go with them 
i want whats best for eleanor shes been saying she wants to 
stay with me mrs swett said 
eleanor who was not in court was found eating garbage in a 
chicago alley in april 1985 she was suffering from tuberculosis 
and lice and had been abandoned by her natural mother michelle 
pawless murphy contends 
ms laplante said the tribe was slow to become involved because 
murphys office did not notify the tribe of the case as required 
by law but murphy contends ms pawless did not tell his office 
that she was a potawatami until late last year 
the girls father a winnebago indian died in a 1985 car 
accident murphy said 
the winnebagos were the first to seek jurisdiction over the 
case but her mother objected ms pawless relented in october when 
her own tribe moved to take over the case

an exconrail engineer sentenced to five 
years in prison for causing 16 deaths in amtraks worst accident 
might not have been high on marijuana at the time but deserves the 
maximum punishment his judge said 
rick l gates 33 of essex md deserved the sentence for 
causing the indescribable tragedy that killed 16 people jan 4 
1987 near chase md baltimore county circuit judge joseph p 
murphy said tuesday 
he is fortunate that i am powerless to increase the 
sentence murphy said in sentencing gates to five years and a 
1000 fine on one misdemeanor manslaughter count to which gates 
pleaded guilty feb 16 under a plea bargain gates admitted in a 
statement of facts to smoking marijuana on the train and failing to 
make several safety checks that might have prevented him driving 
the three linked engines into the path of the amtrak passenger 
train 
i dont think any fair analysis can really result in the 
conclusion that he was stoned on marijuana at the time murphy 
said but what he did in terms of failure to follow procedures 
was to show us that he didnt give a damn he just didnt care 
in the plea bargain the 16 original misdemeanor charges of 
manslaughter by locomotive were consolidated into a single charge 
the move reduced gates possible prison time from 80 years to five 
years 
i would like you to know i accept full responsibility i will 
never be able to forget said gates who wept along with 
relatives of the dead as excerpts of five victim impact statements 
were read into the record 
the violent death of our daughter ceres is the most terrible 
event experienced by our family dr roger horn wrote our 
hearts were crushed along with hers 
gates was taken into custody immediately after sentencing he 
could be eligible for parole after serving about 18 months said 
sandra oconnor the chief prosecutor and baltimore county states 
attorney 
donna shearer gates public defender said he has not had a 
drink since undergoing treatment and has tried to help other 
alcoholics hes leaning toward becoming an alcoholism 
counselor ms shearer said who asked the judge for a twoyear 
prison term plus mandatory rehabilitation 
ms shearer said she was disappointed in the sentence but 
doubted that an appeal would be filed 
more than 175 people were injured in the crash when gates missed 
a track signal and drove three linked conrail locomotives in front 
of the 660passenger amtrak train traveling about 120 mph 
mrs oconnor said prosecutors decided to accept the plea after 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals ruled against postcrash drug 
testing in january the plea bargain was announced as jury 
selection was scheduled to begin 
blood samples from gates and brakeman edward cromwell tested 
positive for drug use gates was unhurt in the crash and cromwell 
who was granted immunity from prosecution suffered a broken leg 
a national transportation safety board report blamed the 
accident on gates drug use and the absence of automatic emergency 
brakes on conrail engines 
murphy asked by prosecutors that the sentence be used to send 
a message to other transporation workers said no matter what i 
do we are at the mercy of people who will simply not behave 
properly behind the wheel of an automobile or at the stick of an 
airplane 
theres nothing i can do that will deter those people 
evil will always be with us

grabbed by men in a green car and driven to a wooded area where she 
was sexually assaulted according to a report in todays daily 
news citing unidentified law enforcement sources 
police in poughkeepsie investigating that case found that the

officials appealed to workers to end a walkout 
that has shut or crippled factories in a disputed southern region 
but many pledged to stay home until the government bends to their 
demands reports said today 
people are sitting home home home without noise and without 
demonstrations a resident of stepanakert the main city of the 
disputed nagornokarabakh region said in a telephone interview 
today 
a bread factory stores medical institutions and other 
essential services were operating but many factories still were 
shut down said the man who answered the telephone at the official 
newspaper sovietsky karabakh 
people say they are going to stay away until they get a 
decision from the government in their favor said the man who 
said he was not a journalist but refused to give further 
information about himself 
he said he could not estimate the number of people who were 
staying away from work reports in the official press provided 
information about the situation earlier in the week 
constant appeals by authorities to get people to return to work 
received mixed results said reports in the newspapers which in 
recent days have been providing wide coverage to the walkout 
newspaper reports said 120 of about 1500 people showed up for 
work at a shoe factory monday morning an insufficient number to 
run the plant 
were only two or three steps from catastrophe plant 
director vasily atadzhanyan told the labor newspaper trud we 
will pay huge fines for not fulfilling our obligations to our 
customers we say directly not coming to work is sabotage 
officials have warned that workers who stay away from their jobs 
are hurting themselves and will not convince government and 
communist party authorities to take the predominantly armenian 
region away from the azerbaijan republic and annex it to 
neighboring armenia 
instead authorities have unveiled a plan to spend up to 640 
million to improve social and economic conditions in 
nagornokarabakh 
trud said people in stepanakert are grateful for the 
governments efforts but that some still believed it was necessary 
to stay away from work to press their demand to transfer control of 
nagornokarabakh to armenia 
pravda the communist party newspaper said many residents of 
stepanakert also were upset about coverage of the unrest by the 
official press 
the newspaper sovietskaya rossiya said about 100 specialists and 
workers appeared for work at an electricaltechnical factory 
tuesday morning 
yesterday we held yet another meeting and again communists 
voted to go to work plant director b arushanyan said the 
first results however are not great but all the same weve 
started to work and this number will provide an example for 
others 
ninety percent of the workers at a plant manufacturing 
construction materials appeared at work monday morning only to 
walk out en masse the newspaper komsomolskaya pravda said 
sovietsky karabakh published an appeal in todays edition from 
the city communist party urging workers to go back to their jobs 
said the man who answered the telephone at the newspaper he 
declined to read it over the telephone 
a woman who answered the telephone at city communist party 
headquarters refused to answer questions saying she only answered 
to higher party authorities 
about threequarters of nagornokarabakhs people are ethnic 
armenians azerbaijanis who are predominantly moslems and 
armenians who are mostly christians have long been rivals 
armenians began mass protests in february demanding that 
nagornokarabakh be turned over to armenia on feb 28 ethnic 
rioting broke out in the azerbaijani city of sumgait and officials 
said 26 armenians and six azerbaijanis were killed 
official reports said tuesday that a curfew in sumgait had been 
lifted and that the city was returning to normal

a support group for recovering alcoholics 
will look elsewhere for a new home after township officials tacked 
nearly two dozen restrictions on the use of an abandoned 
schoolhouse the group planned to buy 
the parkship township planning commissions specialuse permit 
would have barred more than 35 cars on the site forbade its 
occupants from gathering outside and banned alcoholic beverages and 
mood altering substances 
the support group the holland alano association finds it 
impossible to purchase the ventura school because of the onerous 
and unfair restrictions placed on the use of the premises donald 
hann alano communications secretary read from a statement after 
the associations meeting tuesday 
the rules were imposed monday night by the ottawa county 
townships planning commission on a specialuse permit sought by 
the association which had planned to buy the 59500 building in a 
rural area north of here 
the restrictions were approved after several homeowners voiced 
opposition contending that the presence of the organization would 
destroy the peaceful character of the neighborhood 
hann said the two stipulations that most bothered the 
association were the ones that prohibited members from using the 
four acres on which the schoolhouse sits as well as the one 
limiting cars in the parking lot 
we cannot and we will not turn away people seeking help 
because they happen to arrive in the 36th car said hann whose 
association provides a meeting place for 31 weekly meetings 
totaling from 250 to 300 people 
regarding a restriction against gathering outside hann said 
it is highly unusual that owners of property cant walk about 
their own property and added that under the restrictions 
neighbors would have full use of the grounds which includes soccer 
and softball fields and a playground 
john horsting chairman of the ad hoc committee formed by the 
commission to propose the restrictions said the committees 
decision was a tough one 
the restrictions were very seriously addressed said 
horsting our first responsibility is to the township and to the 
people of the township 
he declined further comment 
hann said the alano association which provides a meeting site 
for six alcohol groups including alcoholics anonymous and alanon 
will bgin searching for a new building immediately its lease on a 
decaying warehouse expires may 1 
if we dont find a place by that time we lock our doors 
hann said we thought an abandoned schoolhouse in the country 
would be ideal for us but i guess we were wrong

a proposal to make the cranberry muffin the 
official state muffin wasnt a halfbaked idea and didnt deserve 
to get jokingly panned by the legislature last weekend elaine 
tabor says 
it was ms tabors class at washington elementary school in 
merrill that initiated the drive last year to give the cranberry 
muffin official status 
the proposal was still pending when assembly speaker thomas 
loftus decided to adjourn the democraticcontrolled assembly late 
friday night before the senate could finish work o the 198889 
state budget 
loftus said his action was in part because the senate was 
spending its time discussing whether the cranberry muffin should be 
the states official muffin 
they the senate sent us the cranberry muffin bill at 1130 
pm and i think we snapped loftus said 
the senators had added a mocking amendment that would have 
established the egg mcmuffin as the official state breakfast and 
the ragamuffin as the states official child muffin 
senators passed that version on a voice vote and shipped it back 
to the assembly the bill died 
but ms tabor said the situation wasnt funny for the children 
in her secondgrade class last year

two black communities are 
claiming victories after lengthy battles against the government 
which had sought to relocate one group and change the political 
status of the other 
in one case an appeals court ruled tuesday that the government 
did not have the authority to incorporate the 120000member black 
community of moutse into a homeland dominated by a different tribe 
also the government said late monday it will not attempt to 
relocate the remaining 8000 residents of oukasie a township 30 
miles west of pretoria 
in the moutse case the fourjudge panel ruled that president 
pw botha exceeded his powers by incorporating the community into 
the kwandebele homeland on jan 1 1986 the court said the action 
was taken for administrative convenience rather than in the 
interest of moutse residents 
most moutse residents belong to the north sotho tribe and they 
argued that their language and culture differed sharply from the 
ndebeles who make up most of kwandebeles 400000 residents 
moutse located northwest of pretoria previously was part of 
the lebowa homeland but the whiteled government excised moutse 
from lebowa when it incorporated the community into kwandebele 
dozens of people were killed in the unrest that followed moutse 
residents staged frequent protests and battled both local police 
and vigilantes from the kwandebele government 
moutse at least for the time being does not belong to any 
homeland it is a 171squaremile region that adjoins kwandebele 
an impoverished undeveloped homeland where many of the workers 
ride buses for up to eight hours a day commuting to and from jobs 
in pretoria 
meanwhile minister of constitutional developlment chris heunis 
told parliament on monday that the government would no longer try 
to relocate oukasie residents to lethlabile 12 miles away 
heunis abolished oukasie by decree in october 1986 but only 
about 5000 of the 13000 residents moved to lethlabile a newly 
established township with some upgraded facilities most oukasie 
residents preferred their old home where they could walk to their 
jobs in the white town of brits 
about 8000 residents have stayed even though the government at 
various times cut off the water supply stopped garbage collection 
tore down the school and halted bus service in an effort to make 
residents leave 
the government also sent in bulldozers to destroy houses of 
people that moved from oukasie the town has been run largely by 
community organizations for the past 18 months 
the governments apartheid policy establishes a racially 
segregated society in which south africas 26 million blacks have 
no vote in national affairs the 5 million whites control the 
economy and maintain separate districts schools and health 
services

secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
expressed concern over the deteriorating situation in israels 
occupied territories and the security council scheduled an urgent 
meeting on the crisis 
the 15member council agreed to hold the meeting today at the 
request of arab nations who said it was necessitated by increasing 
repression of palestinians in the west bank and gaza strip 
today is palestinian land day a traditional day of nationalist 
protest and israel on tuesday sealed off its occupied lands 
territories for at least three days to gird against unrest 
arab foreign ministers and the palestine liberation organization 
also asked perez de cuellar on tuesday to send a new factfinding 
mission to the occupied lands and disseminate un information 
gathered there while journalists are barred 
the un chief later issued a statement expressing acute 
concern about the deteriorating situation in the occupied 
territories and especially the continued killing and wounding of 
unarmed civilians 
he said he was particularly disturbed by recent press reports 
of statements in israel to the effect that the problem in the 
occupied territories will be resolved by force 
he said such a policy can only lead to further violence 
prime minister yitzhak shamir was quoted as saying monday if 
the arabs of israel wont come to their senses reality will be 
harder and laden with impending disaster 
perez de cuellar said a political solution could be found only 
through an international peace conference with the participation of 
the parties directly concerned and the five permanent members of 
the security council the united states the soviet union china 
britain and france 
the security council has repeatedly condemned israels harsh 
measures to put down the protests that began dec 8 in the 
territories taken from jordan and egypt in the 1967 middle east war

naples a 600pound manatee made veterinary 
history and got a clean bill of health when a portable 
electrocardiogram machine and a cellular telephone showed her heart 
to be sound 
tuesday was the first time transtelephonic electrocardiography 
had been attempted on a manatee the use of a cellular phone 
greatly simplified the procedure according to seaquarium spokesman 
walt robshaw 
otherwise we would have to hire a crane put her in a sling 
and take her out of the tank he said 
dr gregory bossart a seaquarium veterinarian lowered the 
water level in the pool rolled naples over on her back and put the 
machine on her chest 
the ekg signal was transmitted to a laboratory in roslyn ny 
by putting the telephone mouthpiece over the machine it took less 
than two minutes with results back in about two hours robshaw 
said 
it took a while to get the results because the lab didnt have 
anything to compare it to robshaw said 
the ekg was conducted because an earlier examination showed 
fluid around naples heart 
whats good news for naples may be even better news for pygmy 
sperm whales 
bossart thinks the process could help discover why the whales 
beach themselves in a study of 18 dead adult whales bossart found 
that all had died from congestive heart failure 
he thinks the new process will enable scientists to examine 
whales while they are still alive 
the portable ekg machine is about the size of a television 
remote control device robshaw said the cellular phone allows the 
unit to be used almost anywhere even a manatee pool at seaquarium

embassy in paris after demonstrations protesting the killing of an 
african national congress spokeswoman no injuries were reported 
in the southern port city of marseille at least six gunshots 
were fired tuesday night at the windows of a building in front of 
the south african consulate the gunmen fled in a car and no 
arrests were made 
the bomb which caused only minor damage exploded about 3 am 
in paris at an office building a few blocks from the south african 
embassy no one immediately claimed responsiblity for the bombing 
the explosion occurred a few hours after police arrested more 
than 80 demonstrators who broke into the south african tourism 
office and protested outside the residence of the south african 
ambassador in paris 
they were protesting the slaying of dulcie september 53 the 
anc representative to france switzerland and luxembourg who was 
found dead tuesday outside the door of her paris office from a 
gunshot to the face 
police sources speaking on condition of anonymity said at the 
time that the killing looked like the work of a professional 
the anc the main guerrilla group fighting white domination in 
south africa blamed pretoria for the killing the south african 
government denied responsiblity and said the attack was related to 
strife within the anc which was banned by south africa in 1960 for 
its antiapartheid activities 
a french foreign ministry spokesman said on tuesday that no 
claim of responsiblity had been received 
in marseille the gunshots were fired at 1115 pm tuesday at 
the windows of a building in front of the south african consulate 
the building was painted with the slogan botha assassin ss 
the slogan was apparently referring to south african president pw 
botha 
in paris 41 protestors were arrested by police tuesday night 
after breaking into the south african tourism office after it had 
closed and smashing the interior two officers and a french 
journalist were slightly injured in the scuffle to eject the 
protesters from the office

residence of the south african ambassador in paris for painting 
antiapartheid slogans on the wall of the building police 
identified the protesters only as young leftists who supported the 
anc and all but four were released overnight 
earlier at least 1000 people marched peacefully in separate 
protests of the killing in paris 
president francois mitterrand said he would ask south africa 
about the attack and reaffirmed his categoric condemnation of the 
regime of racial segregation 
a colleague of ms septembers claimed that the victim had 
requested protection from the interior ministry after receiving 
threats she also said she had been followed for several days 
the interior ministry denied she had requested protection 
we were never called on for the least demand for protection 
a spokeswoman said if she had asked we would have given it to 
her 
at anc headquarters in lusaka zambia spokesman tom sebina 
called the killing part of a deliberate south african campaign to 
assassinate anc members and anc leaders he said ms september 
went to paris in 1983 and was among the ancs most vigorous 
activists 
the anc maintains a worldwide network of about 20 information 
offices including several in europe to lobby for support and 
receive aid 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which south africas 26 million blacks have no vote in 
national affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and

the military today said it captured 
the countrys top rebel fighter and the no 2 man in the communist 
party president corazon aquino said the arrests marked the turning 
point in the battle against communism 
maj gen ramon montano told reporters that romulo kintanar 
commander of the communist new peoples army was among seven rebel 
leaders captured in tuesdays raids he said authorities did not 
immediately realize who kintanar was because he gave a false name 
the governmentrun philippine news agency quoted another 
military official as saying the chairman of the communist party of 
the philippines benito tiamzon had escaped by the time raiders 
arrived at his hideout in suburban quezon city 
but his no 2 man party secretary general rafael baylosis was 
among those arrested 
the agency said tiamzon must have been tipped off by radio 
broadcasts on the arrest of his comrades in two raids at the manila 
suburb of san juan earlier tuesday 
military officials said they believe the rebel leaders had just 
held or were about to convene a central committee plenum they said 
search operations were continuing and they expected more arrests in 
the coming days 
kintanar had long been wanted by the military besides being the 
alleged head of the 24000strong new peoples army he is widely 
believed to be the organizer of communist urban assassination 
squads called sparrow units because of the swiftness of their 
attacks 
the sparrows first began operations in southern davao city in 
the early 1980s before moving out to the manila area and other 
urban centers 
among those arrested with kintanar were baylosis and benjamin de 
vera the central committee member in charge of operations on 
mindanao island the others were new peoples army logistics 
officer napoleon manuel his wife inez kintanars wife gloria and 
marco palo a member of the partys liaison committee 
mrs aquino immediately hailed the arrests as happy news for 
our country and commended the armed forces chief of staff gen 
renato de villa and other officers and enlisted men 
it clearly demonstrates that we have turned the tide and are 
winning the war against the communist insurgency she said in a 
statement read by press secretary teodoro benigno the fact that 
they were arrested on the npas 19th anniversary on tuesday 
attests to the admirable performance of our armed forces of the 
philippines i am elated and so is our citizenry 
montano announced the capture of kintanar when he presented the 
guerrilla leader and other captives to journalists at a suburban 
military camp where they were being held under heavy guard the 
only captive not present was baylosis who montano said refused to 
be photographed 
montano would not let reporters ask the captives any questions 
military officials did not mention the name of kintanar when 
they announced the arrests tuesday identifying one of those 
arrested as mario asuncion apparently the alias kintanar used 
montano told reporters that kintanar admitted his real identity 
when the officer confronted the rebel later officials said the 
captured rebels refused to talk to interrogators and would only 
give their names 
kintanar baylosis and de vera were the fourth fifth and sixth 
central committee members to be captured since mrs aquino came to 
power in february 1986 in a civilianmilitary uprising that ousted 
president ferdinand marcos 
former new peoples army chief rodolfo salas whom kintanar 
replaced was arrested in 1986 while leaving a manila hospital 
following a checkup last year juanito rivera was captured in a 
raid on his mothers house in pampanga province north of the 
capital and in february tomas dominado was among 20 suspected 
rebels nabbed in a series of raids in the capital 
tuesdays arrests came as the military was on a heightened state 
of alert in manila and several other regions in anticipation of 
attacks marking tuesdays 19th anniversary of the new peoples army 
no major rebel attacks were reported tuesday but a japanese 
businessman was shot and killed in a manila suburb by an 
unidentified lone gunman who escaped police said the victim was 
identified as akihiro sato 49 of tsuchiura city in japans 
ibaraki prefecture 
in luzons bulacan province two suspected communist assassins 
shot dead a policeman tuesday while government troops captured a 
guerrilla in bataan province military reports said 
reports of attacks in the countryside often take days to reach 
manila

tipper gore said she still supports 
efforts to establish a voluntary rating system for rock music 
lyrics as about 150 protesters some sporting spiked haircuts and 
punkrock clothing demonstrated against the idea 
mrs gore wife of tennessee sen albert gore a democratic 
presidential contender spoke tuesday night to nearly 400 people at 
the 14th annual national issues forum sponsored by pitzer college 
the protesters including musician jello biafra were 
demonstrating against her efforts to initiate a rating system for 
rock music similar to that used by the movie industry 
mrs gore said she does not support censorship but also said 
she is now more interested in helping the homeless and getting her 
husband elected president 
at times chanting all we are saying is give rock a chance 
and no more censorship the protesters lined two side entrances 
to the beverly wilshire hotel where mrs gore spoke 
some waved signs proclaiming ozzy not albert references to 
heavymetal rock musician ozzy osbourne and to mrs gores husband 
i just dont think any music should be censored by someone 
else said kris wood 20 of burbank 
inside the beverly wilshires grand ballroom mrs gore briefly 
acknowledged the demonstration 
i understand that some people are outside protesting my 
efforts to call attention to violent and explicit song lyrics that 
are being peddled to children thats certainly their privilege 
but i think theyve been misinformed about what my position is or 
possibly they dont care she said 
the author of raising pg kids in an xrated society said she 
favors voluntary truth in packaging by the music industry and 
not censorship 
most of her speech focused on the plight of americas homeless 
however a problem she said her husband would dedicate himself to 
solving if elected president 
she showed a 12minute video titled homeless in america a 
photographic project featuring poems and statements by homeless 
people the tape was produced by several photographers working with 
the national mental health association and families for the 
homeless 
we need a president who understands that homelessness isnt 
just a problem of those who are forced to live on the streets its 
our problem yours and mine she said 
the annual national issues forum dinner sponsored by pitzer one 
of the claremont colleges has in past years featured such keynote 
speakers as former secretary of state henry kissinger and 
communications tycoon ted turner

the thunk of tennis ball machines is 
disturbing the serenity of some residents at this posh resort and 
town officials ended up with the ball in their court 
members of the ordinances rules and standards committee 
pondered the issue tuesday should use of the machines popular 
with partnerless players on the peninsulas private estates and 
membersonly clubs be limited 
i think the people who now have them should be grandfathered 
in mayor yvelyne deedy marix said but im not sure that 
any more should be allowed 
town council chairman nancy douthit lobbed back it seems to 
me that when you begin regulating your neighbors tennis game it 
gets a bit heavy supposing i had a noisy hair dryer should we 
then outlaw hair dryers in palm beach 
three years ago douthit was adamantly opposed to the 
highpitched whining noise made by leafblowers and had the towns 
noise ordinance amended to limit their use 
the ordinance already prohibits the use during the winter 
season when most parttime residents are in town of pile drivers 
jackhammers sandblasters dredges or any engines operated in 
such a manner as to emit odors or noises offensive or disagreeable 
to the inhabitants of the town 
the committee agreed to recommend that the town council vote 
amend the noise ordinance to limit the use of tennis ball machines 
to between 9 am and 530 pm during the winter and 8 am to 6 
pm the rest of the year 
on sundays they would be prohibited yearround

spot freezing can save the sight of many 
premature infants against a disease that causes 2600 babies to 
lose their vision each year say officials at the national eye 
institute 
the technique of using a supercooled probe to treat infants 
threatened with retinopathy of prematurity has been found to be 
effective in about half of the 172 babies treated in clinical 
trials at 23 medical centers dr carl kupfer director of the 
national eye institute announced tuesday 
kupfer said a clinical alert has been mailed to 2300 centers to 
notify doctors that the freezing treatment called cryotherapy is 
effective and safe in the treatment of the eye disease 
retinopathy of prematurity occurs among very low birthweight 
infants born prematurely the disease causes an excessive growth of 
blood vessels in the retina the lightsensitive organ at the back 
of the eye this overgrowth of vessels can cause bleeding 
scarring retinal detachment and blindness 
japanese studies in the 1970s suggested that this overgrowth of 
blood vessels could be halted and the eye allowed to develop 
normally if the sclera the white of the eye is frozen briefly 
clinical studies in the united states began in 1986 officials 
at the eye institute said tuesday that the results will be 
published in the april issue of archives of ophthalmology and in 
the may issue of pediatrics 
of 172 infants with the disease included in the study the 
officials reported a 493 percent reduction in the loss of sight 
for those diseased eyes that were treated in one group of infants 
where both eyes were affected but only one eye was treated the 
study found that 456 percent of the untreated eyes showed an 
unfavorable outcome in comparison to only 241 percent of the 
treated eyes 
the freezing treatment is accomplished by touching the eye 
briefly with a cold probe an instrument with a ballpointlike tip 
that is cooled by a refrigerant to about minus 80 degrees a 
surgeon uses the instrument to freeze pinheadsize patches on the 
eye 
dr earl a palmer associate professor of ophthalmology and 
pediatrics at the oregon health sciences university in portland 
was the chairman of the study 
he said the results should greatly improve the ability of 
doctors to treat rop but he admitted that medical science still 
does not know precisely what causes the disease nor why the freeze 
treatment seems to halt the disease

a new law that forbids bearded firefighters 
to enter burning buildings is worrying fire officials whose 
departments have amish volunteers 
ohio requires firefighters to wear a selfcontained breathing 
apparatus to enter a burning building or an area with harmful fumes 
the apparatus has a face piece that provides clean air from a 
tank the firefighter wears on his back said john wood basic 
training coordinator for the ohio fire marshals office 
on march 1 a new law went into effect that prohibits bearded 
men from wearing the devices because facial hair can prevent a seal 
from forming between the face and the face piece 
most amish men are bearded and wont shave because of their 
religious beliefs there are several amish communities in 
northeastern ohio 
it makes it hard for a lot of volunteer fire departments 
wood said i really dont know what we can tell them to do 
in trumbull countys mesopotamia township half the population 
is amish said fire chief keith williams and three of the 
communitys four daytime firefighters have beards 
the town cant afford to give up its amish firefighters 
williams said tuesday 
i put out a standing order yet if they have a structural fire 
during the day i know theyre going to put the scbas on and go in 
theyre going to disregard my standing order he said 
under normal circumstances thats grounds for disciplinary 
action but on the other hand i cant condemn them for doing what 
theyre supposed to do saving life and property 
wood said communities and firefighters wont be fined for 
violating the law but if a bearded firefighter gets injured 
fighting a fire in which he needed a selfcontained breathing 
apparatus the state will be able to collect half his workers 
compensation pay from the community

the soviet union is establishing a cooperative 
bank that will partially end the governments banking monopoly by 
providing services to a growing group of small privately held 
businesses an official said today 
the bank which is expected to open next year would be operated 
as a cooperative to serve other cooperatives according to an 
interview with viktor arkhipov carried by the official tass news 
agency 
arkhipov first vicechairman of the soviet agriindustrial 
bank said the cooperative bank should be allowed to offer higher 
interests rates to savers than the 2 percent to 3 percent offered 
by staterun banks and to seize the property of borrowers who fail 
to meet payments 
thus the bank will have a vested interest in the high quality 
of the products put out by the cooperative in it finding a ready 
demand he said 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev who is encouraging the 
formation of cooperatives said last week that nearly 14000 of 
them have sprung up since legal restrictions were eased last year 
cooperatives are approved by local authorities and taxed by the 
government but are privately owned each person who works in a 
cooperative venture owns a part of it 
cooperatives have established restaurants make clothing pump 
gas and provide other goods and services to supplement the 
inefficient staterun economy 
tass said the cooperatives had financial returns of almost 350 
million rubles about 560 million by march 
tass said that some soviet economists think a cooperative bank 
is a violation of the state monopoly of financial and credit 
operations introduced in 1918 just after the bolshevik revolution 
but arkhipov told the news agency that under gorbachevs effort 
to restructure the soviet economy the state financial monopoly has 
been restricted to foreign economic activity 
the state monopoly is supposed only to coordinate the 
activities of the financialcrediting institutions and determine 
general financial policy arkhipov said 
the cooperative bank also could finance international contracts 
of cooperatives tass said under a draft of a new law 
cooperatives would have the right to trade independently in foreign 
markets

democrat michael dukakis today thanked connecticut 
voters for the primary victory that gives him momentum heading into 
wisconsin and the next round of presidential contests 
it was a good win for us we won with a big big margin 
dukakis said on nbctvs today show but its not the first 
of my victories ive won in the south ive won in the midwest 
ive won up here in the northeast im just very pleased that 
people who know me best were so supportive 
the massachusetts governor defeated jesse jackson by a 2to1 
margin in neighboring connecticut and regained the lead in 
delegates to the democratic convention 
the latest associated press count put dukakis at 64755 jackson 
at 63455 and uncommitted at 5006 tennessee sen albert gore jr 
had 3648 and illinois sen paul simon 1695 
the message is getting stronger and stronger every week 
this campaign goes on dukakis told his backers tuesday night 
he cited his commitment to job growth education housing 
health care the environment and a strong america that reflects 
our values and our principles 
hands on his hips dukakis also responded to those who have 
minimized his new england victories because of his regional 
advantage 
its as absurd to say this should be discounted as it is to 
say jesses should be because michigan is next to illinois he 
said upon returning to boston late tuesday after an evening in new 
york 
he stuck closely to his chosen themes avoiding any open 
criticism of jackson and refusing to speculate about the vice 
presidency 
this sends us back to wisconsin and colorado with a very good 
boost dukakis said adding that each contest is different and 
that no candidate will win all of the remaining states 
colorados democratic caucus is monday and wisconsins primary 
follows one day later 
i look forward to going back out to wisconsin and colorado 
both of which pick delegates next week with that same strong 
message of economic opportunity and good jobs as someone who not 
only talks about those things but whos done them dukakis said 
underscoring the government experience that he has and jackson 
lacks 
in a written victory statement the dukakis campaign sought to 
draw attention to dukakis vote among bluecollar white voters who 
had helped jackson win in michigan 
tonight connecticut voters across all ideological lines and 
an overwhelming margin of bluecollar voters gave a resounding 
endorsement of the dukakis bid for the presidency the campaign 
statement said 
fielding questions from reporters dukakis predicted that 
neither he nor jackson could hope to collect an outright majority 
of nominating delegates by the time the primary season ends in 
california on june 7 
this is 15 rounds and its going to be a decision not a 
knockout he said i felt from the beginning that the field 
would narrow to two or three and that one candidate would have a 
substantial lead

surprising loss to jackson in the michigan voting four days

officials say they cant be sure it 
was a prankster who planted green dye in a pool where highly 
radioactive nuclear fuel is stored even though it happened on the 
eve of st patricks day 
the 1270megawatt unit 2 reactor at palo verde nuclear 
generating station was not operating on march 16 when the 241000 
gallons of water turned green the plant had been shut down feb 20 
for a threemonth refueling outage 
chemical analysis revealed the cause of the color change green 
dye but officials said it was still speculative to label the 
incident as the work of a prankster 
we dont see any connection between the color change and the 
holiday said don andrews a spokesman for the arizona nuclear 
power project were investigating several possibilities it may 
have been intentionally done then again it may not be 
andrews said monday that plant security officials were 
investigating he said the incident occurred in a 44footdeep 
stainless steellined pool that holds water in which highly 
radioactive fuel rods taken from the unit 2 nuclear reactor are 
stored after use 
the rods are submerged in water that absorbs radioactive 
neutrons and gamma rays andrews said the rods are being stored 
onsite until federal officials build an underground repository for 
permanent disposal 
us nuclear regulatory commission officials said they have 
determined that nothing harmful was added to the pool 
greg cook a spokesman for the nrcs region 5 office in walnut 
creek calif said the commission would deal harshly with anyone 
responsible for the prank at the 93 billion triplereactor plant 
if it turns out that someone was playing a prank that 
individual may need to have his sense of humor recalibrated cook 
said a nuclear power plant is the wrong place to horse around 
since 1984 there have been at least 16 unusual incidents at 
palo verde many involving unresolved mischief or suspected 
sabotage but nrc and palo verde officials said they saw no 
connection between those incidents and the green water

police arrested 160 men and 
women protesting a pending labor bill that would restrict union 
rights a top union official said today 
frank meintjies spokesman for the congress of south african 
trade unions the nations largest labor federation said members 
of three unions were arrested tuesday as they responded to a call 
for lunchtime rallies 
police had said in their daily unrest report they had arrested 
124 men and women in industrial areas for gathering illegally and 
refusing to disperse police gave no further details except to say 
that they had used batons and dogs to disperse one group 
meintjies said those arrested were members of the food and 
allied workers union the paper and allied workers union and the 
national metal workers union they were protesting the governments 
labor relations amendment bill pending before parliament which 
would make unauthorized strikes more difficult and require unions 
to pay employers damages for illegal strikes 
most of the congress of south african trade unions 750000 
members are blacks who have no representation in parliament 
the congress issued a statement tuesday listing incidents of 
what it termed state repression against union affiliates during 
the past mongth including detentions police raids on offices and 
removal of union property and records it has been making similar 
complaints for the past year accusing the government of harassment 
police replied in a statement today saying they do not comment 
on routine police duties such as the visiting of premises 
confiscation of property 
it also said the police do not act against people because 
they belong to certain organizations 
however in the few cases of emergency detainees which have 
reached the courts in the past 21 months the government has often 
listed membership or participation in an organization as its reason 
for keeping people in detention without charge 
one such case is that of zwelakhe sisulu editor of the new 
nation newspaper closed last week answering his appeal to be 
freed or charged with a crime the government said he was being 
held because of his participation in the national education crisis 
committee a lawful organization and because of his journalistic 
activities sisulu denied he was a member of the committee

the american civil liberties union is 
challenging an order that blocked a woman from having an abortion 
because her estranged husband objected to her ending the pregnancy 
the woman has a constitutional right to an abortion that the 
judge should not have interfered with the group said citing the 
supreme court decision legalizing abortion 
the aclu said it would go to court today to ask state judge 
david s young to vacate the restraining order he granted last week 
to michael jon reynolds whose wife jennifer franks reynolds is 
about two months pregnant 
utah is one of four states with laws requiring wives to notify 
husbands of abortion decisions said planned parenthood spokeswoman 
mary carlson however utah is the only state in which the 
notification law hasnt been challenged in court or appealed 
the aclu said if young doesnt change his ruling it will take 
the case to the utah court of appeals 
we feel the order is shocking and a restriction of personal 
liberties said robyn e blumner aclu executive director if the 
order is allowed to stand utah will find itself once again a 
target of national mockery she said 
blumner said the case demonstrates that the state law should be 
repealed 
aclu spokeswoman michele parishpixler said the us supreme 
court has ruled that no one can stop a woman from ending a 
pregnancy in its first trimester its overreaching on the part 
of the judge to issue any type of restraint on the first 
trimester she said 
reynolds who is seeking a divorce and custody of the couples 
10monthold infant as well as the unborn child obtained the 
restraining order because he is morally opposed to abortion said 
his attorney evan hurst 
mrs reynolds was served with the restraining order on the day 
she was leaving home to have the abortion performed 
mrs reynolds attorney julie bryan said the us supreme 
court ruled in the landmark roe vs wade decision that husbands 
have no veto power over their wives abortion decisions 
the high court said that when a husband and wife disagree over 
an abortion the view of only one of the two marriage partners 
can prevail inasmuch as it is the woman who physically bears the 
child and who is the more directly and immediately affected by the 
pregnancy the balance weighs in her favor bryan said 
quoting from the decision 
reynolds attorneys plan to argue that the roe vs wade case 
applies only to the state not to private individuals

orders to us factories for manufactured 
goods fell 08 percent in february the second consecutive monthly 
decline the government reported today 
the commerce department said that orders for durable and 
nondurable goods dropped to a seasonally adjusted 21086 billion 
last month following a 06 percent january decline 
the february drop was the largest since a 14 percent setback in 
august the backtoback declines were the first such since the 
summer of 1986 
but analysts said they were not overly concerned about the 
setbacks contending that manufacturing will still be one of the 
top performing sectors this year 
they said the declines did show that economic growth slowed in 
the first three months of the year as businesses cut back on orders 
in an effort to work down a high level of unsold goods 
but the production cutbacks have been less severe than once 
feared and economists are now much more confident that the country 
will be able to get through this year without a recession 
the february setback included a drop of 11 percent in orders 
for durable goods which fell to a seasonally adjusted 1185 
billion in an advance report last week the government had put the 
decline at a slightly larger 18 percent 
orders for nondurable goods items not expected to last three 
years fell 04 percent in february to 979 billion 
in the major categories defense orders dropped 82 percent to 
84 billion without that decline orders would have fallen 05 
percent last month 
orders in the key category of nonmilitary capital goods fell 
39 percent last month to 334 billion this category is expected 
to provide major strength this year as manufacturers boost spending 
on expansion projects to meet growing export demand for american 
goods 
orders for transportation equipment were one of the few 
categories showing strength last month climbing 35 percent to 30 
billion with the aircraft component showing an even larger 68 
percent increase 
shipments of manufactured goods edged up a slight 01 percent in 
february to 2074 billion

the justice department has refiled a 
massive desegregation suit against alabamas public universities 
alleging that state officials deliberately continued a system of 
separate colleges for blacks and whites 
the refiling of the 21page lawsuit on tuesday was prompted by a 
ruling last year by the 11th us circuit court of appeals in 
atlanta which found that significant errors had been made before 
and during trial in federal court in birmingham in 1985 the case 
was initally filed in 1983 
us district judge uw clemon had ruled that alabama maintains 
vestiges of a dual school system but before he could begin the 
remedy phase of the case his ruling was appealed by the state 
the 11th circuit ruled that clemon alabamas first black 
federal judge should have stepped down because he took part in 
landmark civil rights cases when he was a private attorney 
i would not agree that the case is starting from ground zero 
again nathaniel douglas of the justice departments civil rights 
division said tuesday from washington 
there have been efforts to resolve the case by negotiation 
and we are ready to continue to do that 
the suit filed by douglas and his staff again charges that state 
education officials have perpetuated a racial dual system in 
public higher education 
the justice department said two of alabamas predominantly black 
schools alabama aampm in huntsville and alabama state in montgomery 
operate near predominantly white schools and were intended for 
black students only while whites attended the other institutions 
justice department lawyers said evidence exists of intentions by 
state authorities to maintain the vestiges of the dual school 
system 
federal attorneys cited a 1975 planning document of the alabama 
commission on higher education that said with alabama state and 
alabama aampm to meet the needs of the states negro citizens and 
with the university of alabama and auburn university as major state 
institutions the state seemed relatively well served 
the justice department said state officials continue to allocate 
far greater resources to the major white schools than to the 
predominantly black institutions 
state authorities said the predominantly white and black schools 
in huntsville and montgomery are the result of decadesold patterns 
of preference by students

the reputed leader of the mafia in southern 
california and six associates have pleaded guilty to extortion or 
racketeering charges but they denied being members of an organized 
crime syndicate 
the plea bargains were accepted tuesday by us district judge 
ferdinand fernandez on what was to have been the first day of the 
mens trial 
prosecutors said the guilty pleas meant the government avoided a 
1 million trial that could have lasted four months 
the plea bargains were approved by justice department officials 
in washington after us attorney robert bonner refused to accept 
the length of the negotiated prison terms 
when the federal indictment was announced last may bonner said 
the main body of la cosa nostra in los angeles has been severely 
gutted 
chief defendant peter john milano 62 of westlake village whom 
officials allege controls organized crime on the west coast never 
admitted he was a mafia member neither did any of the other 
defendants 
milano who owns rome vending co pleaded guilty to involvement 
in a criminal enterprise and committing two racketeering acts but 
his attorney donald marks said that could mean any criminal 
group not just the mafia 
milano faces up to a sixyear prison sentence when he and the 
others are sentenced may 16 
milanos brother carmen 58 of tarzana brothers charles caci 
51 and vincent caci 62 both of palm springs rocco zangari 54 
of palm springs stephen cino 51 of las vegas and albert nunez 
57 of camarillo all pleaded guilty to extortion conspiracy 
nunez also pleaded guilty to conspiring to distribute cocaine 
and cino also pleaded guilty to making false statements 
in return prosecutors agreed to drop additional charges against 
the defendants and not institute any civil proceedings that could 
result in lawsuits or property forfeitures 
nunez faces a 10year term cino an 18month sentence vincent 
caci and charles caci face one year and carmen milano faces six 
months under the agreement zangari could receive probation 
the trial of three more defendants was postponed until april 5 
to give their attorneys time to reorganize the trial of an 11th 
defendant was postponed indefinitely because he is ill 
the indictment involved violations of the federal racketeer 
influenced and corrupt organizations statute the los angeles case 
was one of several rico indictments nationwide that stemmed from a 
1982 crackdown on organized crime 
the prosecution was based on hours of secretly recorded tapes 
made in san fernando valley restaurants and parking lots in which 
the defendants allegedly discussed cocaine deals and plans to shake 
down gamblers or bookies 
the indictment followed an undercover fbi investigation during 
which milano allegedly ordered the killing of two suspected 
informants according to the indictment the murders never occurred 
because of tips from informants officials said

two companies have been fined 130000 
each for the improper removal of asbestos during the demolition of 
an old factory a federal prosecutor said today 
the fines were imposed for violations of the clean air act and 
the combined 260000 penalty was the largest ever imposed in the 
nation for violation of the acts asbestos regulations said us 
attorney stanley a twardy jr 
consent decrees between the government and big apple wrecking 
corp of middle village ny and general datacomm industries inc 
of naugatuck were filed tuesday in federal court in new haven 
general datacomm owned the former uniroyal corp shoe plant in 
naugatuck when it was razed about two years ago big apple was the 
demolition contractor 
the federal government charged in a june 27 1986 complaint 
that the two companies failed to provide adequate notification to 
the environmental protection agency before removing asbestos from 
the demolition site the complaint also alleged that the contractor 
failed to wet the asbestos during the removal and disposal process 
after the complaint was filed an injunction was imposed 
requiring the remaining demolition to be completed in compliance 
with federal regulations 
in a state such as connecticut with its constant renovation 
and demolition of aging industrial facilities twardy said it 
is crucial that proper precautions be taken by contractors in order 
to prevent asbestos from being emitted into the air

senate majority leader robert byrd called 
today for the resignation of attorney general edwin meese iii 
calling meese the crown jewel of the sleaze factor in reagan 
administration history 
he ought to get out byrd dwva told reporters the 
country cannot have confidence in the justice department when the 
top law enforcement officer obviously has to spend an inordinate 
amount of his time defending himself 
he should be spending his time fighting the war on drugs 
crime byrd said 
byrd opened his regular morning meeting with reporters by 
saying mr meese has become the crown jewel of the sleaze factor 
in reagan administration history 
byrd said he usually would not call on any official to resign 
who hadnt been indicted for a crime but were talking about the 
top law enforcement officer in this country 
its just cloud after cloud after cloud building in layers 
over his head to the point where all confidence in this agency is 
being seriously eroded byrd said 
the president ought to ask somebody if he doesnt want to ask 
him himself to ask mr meese to step aside step down byrd said 
a republican senator also called today for meese to step aside 
you finally reach a place where there is a cloud of suspicion 
a sufficient cloud of suspicion that i think you owe it to the 
president to remove yourself sen bob packwood of oregon told 
reporters at an informal news conference 
packwood said he did not expect reagan would ask meese for his 
resignation 
the president will clearly not fire a friend packwood said 
the president does not do that to a friend 
deputy attorney general arnold burns assistant attorney general 
william weld and four of their aides abruptly resigned on tuesday 
burns and weld offered little public explanation but told 
associates they were concerned that the nearly yearlong criminal 
probe of meese is hurting the entire justice department according 
to several department sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
i dont really see how he meese can expect to continue to 
lead the department after resignations and circumstances like 
this former attorney general elliot richardson said on the cbs 
show this morning 
this man is the head of the chief legal agency the law 
enforcement agency of the united states government and there comes 
a point at which the mere fact that he is not indicted is 
insufficient said richardson who was attorney general during 
the nixon administration 
i think its just an extraordinary disaster rep barney 
frank dmass said of the resignations the attorney general 
should quit its now clear that he cant run that department 
that were paying a very high price for his stubborness

the national governors association told 
congress today that a salestax advantage held by mailorder 
sellers threatens the future of main street america 
thousands of small retail businesses that support our 
communities and local citizen programs and generate jobs will not 
be able to compete in a market in which mailorder firms have a 
price advantage that is greater than the actual profit margins of 
these community businesses said gov george sinner of north 
dakota 
sinner speaking for his fellow governors urged a house 
judiciary subcommittee to give the states authority to tax 
mailorder sales to outofstate customers 
that authority was wiped out by a 1967 supreme court ruling the 
court held that a state could not require a mailorder seller to 
collect sales tax if the companys only contacts with the state 
were in mailing catalogs and delivering merchandise by mail or 
public package service 
as a result such giant mailorder companies as mainebased ll 
bean can sell by mail to the other 49 states for prices on which no 
taxes are collected the decision does not affect companies such as 
sears which have outlets in every state 
representatives of state and local governments say they are 
losing more than 2 billion in sales taxes each year because of the 
inability to collect on sales by outofstate catalog companies 
television shopping clubs and the like 
a house ways and means subcommittee already has approved a bill 
by rep byron dorgan dnd that would allow states to require 
large outofstate retailers to collect the tax similar bills are 
pending before the judiciary subcommittee on commercial law 
rep jack brooks dtexas a judiciary member said his bill 
would allow a state to require a retailer to collect sales tax only 
if the company regularly solicits sales in that state it would 
apply only to companies whose annual gross receipts exceed 125 
million or whose sales in a state exceed 500000 
william j park president of george w park seed co inc 
greenwood sc opposed the bills he said his companys average 
mail order is 32 which assuming a sales tax averaging 5 percent 
nationwide would generate a 160 tax 
it would be prohibitive to collect the estimated tax of 160 
if the customers did not voluntarily send it we certainly could 
not afford to pay it ourselves park said adding that his 
company averaged an aftertax net return of 35 percent last year 
mayor bob isaac of colorado springs colo speaking for the 
national league of cities said representatives of state and local 
governments are close to agreeing on how to divide revenues from 
mailorder tax collections among affected states cities and 
counties such an agreement is essential he said 
isaac said he does not take lightly a concern expressed by some 
state officials about being ordered by congress to channel some tax 
revenues down to cities and counties but a reading of the supreme 
court salestax decision provides the rationale for concluding 
that such a requirement does not amount to an interference with a 
states prerogative isaac said

the head of the environmental protection 
agency has banned use of the insecticide diazinon on golf courses 
and sod farms because it kills too many birds the agency said 
today 
the decision by administrator lee m thomas overrules an 
administrative law judge who on jan 25 found that the benefits of 
using diazinon outweighed the risks and recommended continued use 
under certain restrictions 
the decision effective on publication in the federal register 
in a few days represents the first time that the use of a 
pesticide has been canceled solely because it killed birds said 
spokesman al heier however the harm to birds was a large part of 
the reasons behind the 1972 ban on ddt 
about 8 million pounds of diazinon are used each year to control 
insects on farms in nurseries and around homes and gardens as well 
as on golf courses and sod farms the two banned uses account for 
about 572000 pounds 
in september 1986 the agency announced intent to cancel golf 
course and sod farm use at the time it said it knew of 60 
instances in 18 states where diazinon was a known or suspected 
cause of largescale bird killings many involved golf courses 
which some species favor as feeding sites 
four hundred ninetyfour companies hold federal licenses to sell 
diazinon products the major manufacturer is cibageigy corp

suzy says revsons a rat 
but why should we care 
well thats entertainment in the world of new york gossip 
new york post columnist suzy it seems is just a little eentsy 
bit miffed over a column by her upstart rival in new york newsday 
james revson 
revson wrote last week that he was a bit heartbroken to find 
that horrors suzy had written about a posh party at the 
metropolitan museum without attending it 
specifically revson wrote suzy ticked off the names of 32 
wellknown people who she wrote had attended the party well 
theres a sad truth here not one of those boldfaced folks showed 
up at the museum none zero zilch 
suzy who actually has two real names aileen mehle wasnt 
pleased 
yes suzy admitted in todays column she used a press release 
to write about the party in advance so she could slip away for a 
little vacation on the beautiful windswept isle of mustique in the 
caribbean it was heaven 
and yes she said its true that some of the people she said 
were at the party never showed up even though they were listed in 
the press release 
and yes she said i should have yanked the whole thing or at 
least the names the release said would attend 
but is suzy contrite not on your life 
i bow in accuracy and meticulousness and decency to no one 
she wrote that is the reason i have survived as a star all these 
long years that and because in my field i am the best and the 
brightest there is 
and dear readers fans and publicityseekers i would like to 
go on record as telling the world that any place revson is i 
will not be do not invite me anywhere if you invite him just call 
it a boycott or even a suzycott 
revsons column made such a splash that even the august times 
took notice printing a story and a picture of revson 
not only did revson show himself to be a rat suzy said today 
he gave himself away as malicious sneaky uglymean 
got it 
more in this space tomorrow we hope

orders to us factories for manufactured goods fell 08 percent 
in february the second consecutive monthly decline the government 
reported today 
the commerce department said orders for durable and nondurable 
goods dropped to a seasonally adjusted 21086 billion last month 
following a 06 percent january decline 
the february drop was the largest since a 14 percent setback in 
august the backtoback declines were the first consecutive drops 
since the summer of 1986 
but analysts said they were not overly concerned about the 
setbacks contending that manufacturing will still be one of the 
top performing sectors this year 
the factory data followed a pair of upbeat economic reports 
released tuesday which combined with a more stable dollar and 
lower interest rates to lift the stock market out of its slump 
the government reported tuesday that its chief economic 
forecasting gauge the index of leading indicators posted a 09 
percent increase in february in a performance which analysts said 
should lay to rest fears of a 1988 recession 
there also was good news on sales of new homes they shot up 
203 percent in february the biggest monthly gain in almost two 
years after falling for three straight months 
the positive economic reports helped spark a broadbased rally 
in stocks the dow jones average of 30 industrials rose 1857 
points to 199834 following steep declines last thursday and 
friday and a slight gain monday 
about 13 stocks rose in value for every six that fell on the new 
york stock exchange with 1015 up 467 down and 482 unchanged 
the dollar surged upward from its lowest point since early 
january jumping to 12526 japanese yen in late new york trading 
from 12384 yen late monday 
interest rates declined meanwhile as bond prices rose the 
treasurys closely watched 30year bond jumped about point or 
875 for every 1000 in face value its yield which moves 
inversely to its price tumbled to 875 percent from 883 percent 
late monday 
weakness in home sales and in the leading indicators in the 
months following the oct 19 stock market crash had raised fears 
that the 5yearold economic recovery was in imminent danger of 
collapsing 
housing is often the first sector to weaken in a new downturn 
and the index of leading indicators is designed to forecast turning 
points in the economy for that reason the february rebounds in 
both were greeted as good news by economists

jesse jackson huddled today with the top ranks 
of washingtons political establishment a summit meeting one 
participant called a bonding of the democratic party with the 
preacherturnedpolitician 
with such party luminaries as clark clifford and john white at 
his side the democratic presidential candidate said the meeting 
was totally positive clifford and white denied there were 
discussions of fears that jackson could drag the partys ticket 
down in the fall 
no not at all said white a former chairman of the 
democratic national committee told reporters after the meeting 
we only see that in the press said california assembly 
speaker willie brown jacksons national campaign chairman maybe 
people dont want to say that in front of us 
jackson said the breakfast session was bringing together 
democrats who have traditional investment in the interests of the 
country and the party and those who are new to the process 
in this instance we bring together old wineskins and new 
wine but the old wineskins are expanding and making room for new 
wine he added using one of his favorite phrases from the 1984 
campaign 
jackson picked up the backing of white 
this meeting is a new maturing of the political process in 
america white said it represents a growingup of america it 
represents a bonding of the democratic party and a bond that 
recognizes no class 
the one negative that came up at the meeting according to 
participants was a question to jackson about his relationship with 
black muslim leader louis farrakhan 
white said jackson quoted jesus about casting the first stone 
and forgiveness and so anybody who hasnt made mistakeslets not 
be casting stones at each other about the past 
farrakhan campaigned with jackson early in the 1984 campaign 
but the tie was cut after the black muslim leader called judaism as 
gutter religion and called adolf hitler a great man 
many of those attending were already jackson supporters 
including former federal budget director bert lance texas 
agriculture commissioner jim hightower and brown 
jacksons campaign manager gerald austin said attendance did 
not indicate they were endorsing jackson but it would give them a 
chance to get to know him 
a lot more people want to talk to jesse jackson now than they 
did a week ago he said in reference to jacksons big win in 
michigan on saturday 
the victory was followed tuesday by an equally big loss in 
connecticut to massachusetts gov michael dukakis 
jackson however hailed connecticut as a victory anyway 
because he got 70000 votes he said that showed his campaign is 
expanding 
he also said he would not react to the sharp criticism leveled 
at him tuesday by rival albert gore jr but instead would let 
the people speak 
in the first harsh attack by a jackson rival gore the senator 
from tennessee said jackson has a complete and total lack of 
experience in the national government he hasnt served a single 
day in the national government or had a single days experience in 
foreign policy 
answering questions in new york gore added i also cannot 
disagree more with jesse jacksons views on many foreign policy 
issues i categorically reject his notion that theres a moral 
equivalence between israel and the plo and i am dismayed by 
his embrace of arafat and castro 
jackson said he was unaware of any organized stop jackson 
movement but that in the face of his success some democrats 
are reacting with a sense of history others are reacting with a 
sense of hysteria 
the most prominent noncandidate new york gov mario cuomo 
said it was wrong to talk of a stop jackson movement 
i reject the suggestion that it somehow presents us with a 
dilemma if jesse jackson wins said cuomo the person who gets 
the most votes should be the candidate and all talk of introducing 
somebody to stop gore to stop dukakis or to stop jackson thats 
all equally wrong 
todays meeting according to white was set up even before the 
michigan contest 
he said jackson had indicated an interest in meeting with the 
party regulars and talking about the parts of the political world 
he might not be familiar with 
ann lewis an adviser to jackson said the original idea was 
to get jesse together with the washington establishment to 
listen to them talk about issues and policies and then to answer 
any questions they might have about him

the nations three largest 
supermarket chains reopened their stores today signaling a major 
rupture in a 10day general strike aimed at toppling strongman gen 
manuel antonio noriega 
the government announced that the nations banks closed since 
march 3 because of a cash shortage brought on by us economic 
sanctions would reopen thursday with limited service 
it announced tight restrictions on withdrawals from savings and 
checking accounts 
the gago rey and super 99 markets in the capital were doing 
brisk business after panamanians rushed to buy food and essentials 
that have been virtually unattainable 
the weakening of the strike came two days after a harsh 
crackdown on leaders of the national civic crusade which is 
leading the antinoriega fight more than 20 crusade directors were 
arrested monday in a raid by soldiers and state security agents 
most were detained overnight then released 
owners of the reopened stores could not be reached for comment 
crusade leaders who vowed to continue the strike until noriega 
left panama have been reluctant to talk since their arrests some 
of those not detained were said to be in hiding 
the roman catholic church tuesday joined opposition leaders in 
calling for noriegas resignation but noriega leader of the 
15000member defense forces and the power behind the civilian 
government said tuesday night he had no intention of stepping down 
here it is not one man who is the problem said noriega 
who blames his problems on what he considers a us slander 
campaign against him this is a matter of dignity and conviction 
involving the entire hemisphere 
in a speech to delegates of a solidarity with panama conference 
in the capital noriega condemned the presence of the us 
helicopter carrier okinawa on the pacific end of the panama canal 
it passed through the canal tuesday on its way to its home port 
san diego 
the us defense department said in washington that the passage 
was routine but noriega called it a threat and an 
aggression there was no immediate indication how long the vessel 
would stay in the area 
noriega claimed the united states had spent more than 100 
million in the effort to topple him but with all the gold in the 
world they have not been able to bring this people or this 
commander or these defense forces to their knees he said 
shaking his fist to wild applause 
delegates from about 25 latin american and caribbean countries 
attended the conference but few represented governments about 400 
spectators were on hand in the convention center 
noriegas forces used a harsh irritant sprayed from water 
cannons tear gas and birdshot to break up a march monday by 10000 
antigovernment protesters many people were beaten with rubber 
hoses and dozens were arrested 
almost all those detained were released by tuesday but carlos 
gonzalez de la lastra a top leader of the opposition national 
civil crusade was still held at a military intelligence center 
early today 
he had not been allowed access to a lawyer or visits by family 
members 
were worried we have been told by sources in the defense 
forces that he has been beaten his wife vilma told the 
associated press 
gonzalez de la lastra apparently was not released with the 
others because he had been out on bond on a previous sedition 
charge 
a church spokesman told a news conference on tuesday that panama 
city archbishop monsignor marcos mcgrath contacted noriega and the 
opposition and the archbishop had a positive impression about 
prospects for mediation 
but the spokesman auxiliary archbishop mons oscar brown said 
theres still a lot to be done and because of that we cannot 
have an excessive optimism 
in a statement the church said a committee of bishops met with 
noriega last week and asked him to separate himself from his 
position as soon as possible the statement said noriega failed 
to respond to the request 
this critical phase of panamas 10monthold political and 
economic crisis began feb 26 when noriega orchestrated the ouster 
of president eric delvalle hours earlier delvalle had tried to 
fire noriega who has been indicted in the united states on 
drugtrafficking charges 
the reagan administration continues to recognize delvalle who 
is in hiding as president it has frozen panamanian government 
funds in us banks denying this country a supply of its official 
currency the us dollar

indian peacekeeping troops killed 11 
tamil rebels captured three others and recovered 17 ak47 
automatic rifles from a hideout in the jungles of north central sri 
lanka officials said today 
sri lankan military officials who cannot be identified under 
briefing rules said the attack late tuesday was in mankulam near 
the district capital of anuradhpura about 105 miles northeast of 
colombo it came after rebels killed 10 sinhalese farmers in the 
region 
the sri lankan government meanwhile announced a ban on all 
meetings opposing elections in four of the islands nine provinces 
the cabinet discussed a report that certain political parties 
were planning to hold meetings exhorting the people not to vote in 
the elections an announcement by the information ministry said 
as this is an undemocratic step and may lead to public unrest 
in those areas it was decided that no permission for such meetings 
should be granted by the police it said 
the elections are scheduled for april 28 and 436 candidates from 
three parties are running for 155 seats sri lanka freedom party 
the largest opposition party is boycotting the polls and demanding 
the government hold general elections 
the attack in north central sri lanka came after suspected tamil 
militants tuesday planted a bomb on a passenger bus in the same 
area killing 10 sinhalese farmers and injuring 15 others 
the haul of ak47 rifles is regarded as the largest single 
haul of the this type of weaponry by the indian troops a 
military official said 
more than 50000 indian troops are in sri lanka to disarm tamil 
militants under a peace accord signed last july the accord grants 
some autonomy to minority tamils living in the north and east but 
it has been opposed both by tamil and sinhalese extremists 
tamils say it does not give enough autonomy while sinhalese 
nationalists claim it grants too many concessions to the tamils 
in another incident sri lankan police today opened fire at a 
mob of more than 2000 people who tried to storm the trincomalee 
police station and a nearby army camp a military official 
reported 
three policemen were seriously injured and many in the mob were 
wounded the official said trincomalee is an important port town 
in the eastern province 
the crowd was demanding the release of all tamil political 
prisoners and withdrawal from the area of sri lankan security 
forces the security forces are protecting sinhalese settlements in 
the east 
more than 135 sinhalese civilians have been killed this month in 
attacks blamed on tamil militants of the liberation tigers of tamil 
eelam the group is the largest and most powerful rebel 
organization 
the government says the rebels are launching these attacks to 
drive out sinhalese and moslems from the eastern province and 
establish complete dominance tamils say the government has 
deliberately settled sinhalese people in the area to upset the 
tamils traditional majority in the area 
tamils who are mainly hindu make up about 18 percent of sri 
lankas 16 million people while the sinhalese who are buddhists 
comprise 75 percent 
tamils say they are discriminated against by the sinhalese who 
control the government and the military

a court reporter for the federal judge who 
sentenced millionaire industrialist victor posner in a tax evasion 
case has been in contact with posners organization for a job the 
judge said in court today 
us district judge eugene p spellman visibly perturbed said 
he first learned of conversations between court reporter mario 
contillo and posner on monday afternoon 
im not saying his conduct was illegal but i feel it was 
reprehensible especially involving a friend of 30 years said 
spellman referring to contillo who the judge said was offered a 
substantial amount to work for posner details of the job were 
not disclosed in court 
posner pleaded no contest sept 29 to evading more than 12 
million in federal taxes by inflating the value of land he donated 
to a bible college as a tax exemption 
posner who had faced up to 40 years in prison in an income tax 
evasion case was ordered to pay more than 4 million in back taxes 
and fines and to give 3 million to help floridas homeless in an 
income tax evasion case 
the miami beach businessman whose holdings include controlling 
interests in royal crown cola and arbys also was sentenced to 
5000 hours in community service over five years 
spellman called us attorney leon kellner assistant us 
attorney neal cartusciello who prosecuted the case and mary 
clark an attorney for posner to a special hearing in his 
courtroom to discuss his findings 
contillo announced last friday that he was giving up his court 
position spellman said spellman said he wanted kellner to to 
evaluate and comment if he wishes on the disclosure 
i dont know all the facts but i felt that as a member of the 
federal judiciary it was incumbent upon me to draw attention to 
this matter so it could be made public as quickly as possible 
the judge said 
when i found out i went through a series of emotions 
distress and outrage that a member of my staff is guilty at the 
very least of impropriety he said 
efforts by the associated press to reach contillo at his office 
or at home by telephone today were unsuccessful renee mottram a 
spokeswoman for posner said that contillo is not employed by 
posner at this time 
spellman said the job conversations took place sometime after 
the feb 12 sentencing of posner 
posners 1986 conviction was set aside because of jury 
irregularities and he entered the no contest plea a month before 
he was to be retried 
spellman said today it was his understanding that the court 
reporter gave the impression the judge condoned his job 
discussions but the judge said i had no knowledge of the 
conversations and i do not condone them 
the judge noted that the 69yearold posner is on probation and 
said i have not taken this up with probation service if they 
feel that mr posner violated his probation they have the means to 
bring it to the courts attention 
i have no reason to believe it was other than an unthinking 
and stupid act 
after the judge left the bench kellner was asked if he intended 
to bring the actions to the attention of a grand jury 
i am hearing this for the first time as you are all i can say 
is we will take a look at it

michael dukakis celebrated his 2to1 connecticut primary 
victory over jesse jackson today as jackson met with democratic 
party elders and dismissed his tuesday loss as merely due to the 
massachusetts governors home field advantage in new england 
george bush with the gop nomination all but in hand called on 
republicans to keep together and get to work bush won 
overwhelmingly in connecticut as he had been expected to do even 
before principal rival bob dole dropped out of the race on primary 
day 
jackson met privately in washington with leaders of the party 
establishment then said afterward in this instance we bring 
together old wineskins and new wine but the old wineskins are 
expanding and making room for new wine 
participants said the meeting was positive all around with no 
discussion of reports that some democrats fear nominating jackson 
would lead to crushing defeat in the general election 
we only see that in the press said california assembly 
speaker willie brown a jackson supporter maybe people dont 
want to say that in front of us 
democrat albert gore jr who finished a distant third in 
connecticut said today while campaigning in wisconsin that he 
expected no backlash from the comments he made tuesday about what 
he said was jacksons complete and total lack of the experience 
needed to be president 
other candidates have been slow to criticize jackson but gore 
said his own comments were really not that different from what 
ive been saying for several months 
dukakis on nbctv said of the connecticut primary we won 
with a big big margin but its not the first of my victories 
but this is a marathon and its going to be all the way to the 
finish line im just very pleased that people who know me best 
were so supportive he said 
jackson who has beaten dukakis in two states in the last two 
weeks michigan and illinois congratulated the massachusetts 
governor but suggested geography and campaign finances played a key 
role 
you did well with your home field advantage said jackson 
who also appeared on the nbc program 
sen paul simon who barely contested connecticut made the same 
point tuesday night we assumed this was dukakis territory he 
said 
with 100 percent of the connecticut precincts reporting dukakis 
had 58 percent to jacksons 28 percent gore trailed with 8 
percent and simon had 1 percent 
that restored dukakis lead in the national delegate race the 
latest ap count put dukakis at 64755 jackson at 63455 and 
uncommitted at 5006 gore had 3648 and simon 1695 
jackson swept the black vote and won about 20 percent of the 
white vote according to television network exit polls his share 
of the white vote was put at 5 percent in 1984 
however primaryday surveys of voters by wnbctv in new york 
suggested only onefifth of the democrats believed the nation was 
ready to elect a black president abc found that onethird of the 
democrats would switch to the republican side if jackson were 
nominated 
only last week dukakis was suggesting he was the inevitable 
democratic nominee now he is saying he expects a long duel with 
jackson 
this is 15 rounds and its going to be a decision not a 
knockout he said tuesday night its going all the way to the 
final round 
some party heavyweights may have come to the same conclusion 
jackson was meeting in washington today with the front rank of the 
democratic establishment to discuss issues and policy 
former party chairman john white who set up the summit 
said it would allow jackson to talk with democratic leaders about 
the parts of the political world he might not be familiar with 
jackson came under fire tuesday from gore in the first serious 
attack on him by a democratic opponent gore said jackson has a 
complete and total lack of experience needed to be president 
were not choosing a preacher were choosing a president 
the tennessee senator said jackson retorted i assume that he is 
stimulated by his own status in the campaign to attack me 
the exchange came as the two were in new york jockeying for 
position in new yorks delegateheavy contest on april 19 gore was 
in wisconsin today making an earlymorning visit to a dairy farm 
where he was to milk cows and do farm chores 
on the republican side doles departure left bush with only a 
nominal opponent former television evangelist pat robertson who 
acknowledged it seems obvious now that george bush will be the 
winner 
as the kansas senator bowed out tuesday he put aside his 
differences with the vice president 
i return to the senate as the republican leader ready to 
do all i can to elect republicans in november and doing all i can 
for our nominee george bush he said bush beat dole by a 
lopsided 7120 margin in connecticut 
if doles delegates now in the uncommitted column go to 
bush the vice president is likely to clinch the delegates needed 
to nominate in the next few weeks 
with the republican nomination a nearly done deal republicans 
were holding the first of three platform hearings today this one 
on foreign policy and defense gop chairman frank fahrenkopf and 
the presidents daughter maureen reagan were among those 
attending 
rep richard gephardt who dropped out of the democratic race on 
monday filed tuesday for reelection to his house seat from 
missouri saying he was somewhat relieved to have life return to a 
more usual pace 
now we can go to the drug store and the movies and be fairly 
normal he said

the senate foreign relations committee by a 
vote of 172 today gave its approval to the historic treaty 
eliminating us and soviet mediumrange nuclear missiles 
the vote sends the treaty to the full senate which is expected 
to vote next month after returning from its easter recess leaders 
of both parties say the treaty will win far more than the 
twothirds margin it needs to be ratified 
but some republicans said today the pact may be in jeopardy 
because of a democraticbacked amendment outlining how the treaty 
can be interpreted by the white house the only dissenting votes 
today were cast by sens jesse helms rnc and larry pressler 
rsd 
the treaty signed dec 8 by president reagan and soviet leader 
mikhail gorbachev requires both sides to desroy within three 
years all nucleartipped missiles with a range of 300 to 3400 
miles it will be the first nuclear arms control pact requiring the 
destruction of weapons 
sen rudy boschwitz rminn said the democratic amendment was 
perhaps unconstitutional and very frankly it may change my 
position with respect to the treaty on the floor but boschwitz 
supported the pact in todays vote 
pressler predicted the amendment will lead to the defeat of 
this treaty because the votes arent there 
but sen claiborne pell dri the panels chairman said 
the amendments importance has been exaggerated and predicted 
its eventual approval by the full senate 
sen paul sarbanes dmd called the pact a very important 
step forward for the united states 
sen alan cranston dcalif agreed in effect this is a 
small step away from the nuclear brink he told his colleagues 
todays vote came a day after the amendment was added a move 
that left some committee republicans angry and threatening to 
oppose the treaty when it comes to the floor 
this has been made partisan unnecessarily in my view sen 
daniel evans rwash said tuesday no one has worked harder for 
this treaty than me but im now going to seriously take a look at 
whether i can vote for it 
evans and other republicans were unhappy about the 
democraticwritten provision which was added to the measure with 
the help of helms 
the provision says no future president can change the us 
interpretation of the treaty without the approval of congress 
either through a new pact or through a separate law 
the measure arises from a longstanding fight between reagan and 
congress over reagans assertion that the executive branch can 
unilaterally change how the us government interprets a treaty 
congressional democrats disagree with that statement which reagan 
has used to justify some tests of his star wars missile defense 
system 
the tests would violate the original interpretation of the 1972 
antiballistic missile treaty 
democrats want assurances that reagan or another president wont 
assert the same right to reinterpret treaties on the 
intermediaterange nuclear forces pact 
sen richard lugar rind said reagan already has agreed not 
to change the us view of the inf treaty and said the proposal 
is a deliberate attempt to embarrass the president 
but sen christopher dodd dconn told lugar those of us on 
this side did not begin this process a reference to reagans 
assertion involving executive branch rights on treaty 
interpretation 
helms said he offered his amendment which he said made minor 
changes in the democraticwritten proposal to make sure the 
democratic measure was constitutional 
but lugar was suspicious i frankly dont know at all what 
this is about im sure something important is going on he said 
but i dont have any idea 
earlier in the day the senate met in a rare secret session to 
talk about intelligence estimates about the size of the soviets 
force of ss20 missiles which will be destroyed under the treaty 
the soviets have admitted to having 650 of the weapons but 
helms and other conservative critics argue that us intelligence 
estimates show that the soviets may possess up to 1000 
administration officials dispute that contention 
the secret session was the senates first since october 1986 it 
was held in the old senate chamber down the capitol hall from the 
current senate meeting place the current chamber was unusable 
because it is laced with electronic cables that could be tapped 
helms said later that his colleagues heard some things they 
hadnt heard before

federal funding aimed at discouraging sexual 
activity by teenagers is valid despite the constitutionally 
troublesome ways some religious groups spent the money the 
reagan administration told the supreme court today 
saying that congress passed the 1981 law in response to grave 
social economic and health costs linked to teenage pregnancies 
solicitor general charles fried said in our view the statute is 
plainly constitutional on its face 
but fried the justice departments highestranking courtroom 
lawyer conceded that some of the millions of dollars spent under 
the law each year may have gone to promote religion 
i do not dispute that there may have been some departures 
from past high court rulings on churchstate relations fried said 
adding that some of those departures are constitutionally 
troublesome 
janet benshoof an american civil liberties union lawyer 
representing those who successfully challenged the law in a lower 
court was asked by justice antonin scalia whether congress was 
empowered to authorize selfrestraint among adolescents 
benshoof replied yes but you cant do it by telling young 
girls to pretend that jesus is their date 
at issue is whether the 1981 law impermissibly promotes religion 
because religious organizations obtain money under it 
the courts decision is expected by july 
urged on by conservative republicans congress allowed religious 
groups to obtain money for programs designed to prevent adolescent 
pregnancy by promoting selfdiscipline and to mitigate problems 
caused by premarital sex and teenage pregnancy 
aclu lawyers representing those who challenged the law said it 
authorizes the use of federal funds to subsidize religious 
indoctrination as a means of opposing premarital sex abortion and 
birth control for teenagers 
a federal judge here agreed and struck down the law last year 
the law officially called the adolescent family life act but 
dubbed the chastity act by its opponents has three general 
program categories care prevention and research 
care services include pregnancy testing maternity 
counseling adoption and referral help 
prevention services are those aimed at discouraging 
adolescent sexual relations and include programs offering 
counseling and family planning 
the law requires programs applying for federal funding to 
describe how in providing services they will involve religious 
and charitable organizations voluntary associations and other 
groups in the private sector 
although finding that the law has a secular or nonreligious 
purpose us district judge charles richey said it has the 
primary effect of advancing religion and fosters an excessive 
entanglement between government and religion 
he noted that the law explicitly permits religious 
organizations to be grantees and envisions a direct role for those 
organizations in the education and counseling components of afla 
grants

after the deaths of milton and matilda two 
musk oxen given to china by the united states in 1972 a georgia 
widow began a oneperson campaign to replace them 
next month helen miller travels to beijing for a ceremony 
marking the success of her efforts and the arrival of two new 
animals 
mrs miller said she learned that just as pandas lingling and 
hsinghsing gifts from china had become popular at the national 
zoo in washington millions of chinese children visited the beijing 
zoo to see the oxen 
so in 1980 after learning that the oxen had died she began a 
letterwriting campaign to the white house the national zoo and 
officials of the us fish and wildlife service 
she felt it was a matter of national honor to replace the 
animals that had been presented when thenpresident richard nixon 
made his historic trip to china as the two nations normalized 
relations 
i dont just think about things she said in a recent 
interview if they are worth thinking about they are worth 
acting on 
musk oxen found only in greenland and arctic regions of north 
america have heavy fur coats and horns that dip down along their 
heads and then up hunted for years they now are protected 
mrs miller eventually learned that the university of alaska had 
a herd of the oxen and went there university officials agreed to 
donate koyuk and tanana a pair flown to china on march 21 
the chinese are very excited about it said mrs miller who 
departs in late april theres going to be a big presentation 
ceremony it took a long time but it was interesting every step of 
the way 
the ceremony in early may will be attended by us officials 
the governor of alaska and the head of the university of alaskas 
school of arctic biology she said 
mrs millers husband gibbs died in 1960 leaving her with 
four children after attending vocational school she got a job as 
a construction estimator 
i like to do things that no one else will do said mrs 
miller 
she has been a contestant on four tv game shows winning a 
brazilian vacation two cars a 65foot mobile home and two furs 
three of her children also have appeared on game shows 
now that the oxen are in china mrs miller has a new project 
but for now its a secret 
you put your heart in it and go to work she saidif you 
believe in something strongly enough then put feet on your 
prayers

police and soldiers were deployed six arabs were killed in the 
first land day protests 12 years ago 
police swept through the offices of a key arab news service and 
ordered it closed for six months 
a supreme court panel denied a foreign press request to allow 
media access to the occupied territories but it ordered the army 
to explain within 30 days why journalists should not be allowed 
free access 
only the territories 65000 jewish settlers were permitted to 
travel freely

senate republican leader bob dole told 
president reagan today im reporting back for duty one day 
after giving up his bid for the gop presidential nomination 
dole met privately with reagan at the white house and didnt 
comment as he left but white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told 
reporters of the comment made to reagan by dole who had campaigned 
as the man who helped steer reagan programs through the senate 
one day earlier dole who for one winter week looked like a 
good bet for the nomination ended his quest for the white house 
as much the victim of his own campaigns shortcomings as of george 
bushs success 
my friends know that i am a fighter i dont like to lose 
the senate republican leader said in bowing to the inevitable 
tuesday i have been beaten before and no doubt will be again 
but i have never been defeated and never will be 
in an adlibbed addition to his prepared speech dole promised 
to do all i can for our nominee george bush 
bush with an insurmountable delegate lead called dole while 
campaigning in wisconsin to thank him for a very generous 
statement he added its been a hardfought campaign and i 
respect the tenacity of bob dole 
only pat robertson remains in the gop race as a stubborn 
challenger to bush robertson conceded it seems obvious that 
bush would be the nominee but said he wont withdraw as a candidate 
dole formally withdrew surrounded by family and friends in the 
senate caucus room scene of watergate and irancontra hearings a 
supportive audience of senate and house colleagues jammed the room 
also present were two former senior aides to the campaign david 
keene and don devine who because of the public manner of their 
firings were reminders of the dole campaigns internal divisions 
and ineptitude 
doles withdrawal must have been painful for a candidate who in 
the glow of his leadoff victory in iowa could see the nomination 
almost within his grasp 
he benefited in that farm state from his rural humble roots in 
neighboring kansas and the contrast with the patrician bush his 
victory in the nations first delegate contest left bush a stunned 
thirdplace finisher behind dole and robertson 
for the next week critics called bush a failed campaigner and 
dole appeared on a winners roll even his own pollster told dole 
that he would likely win new hampshire riding a surge in 
popularity built on his iowa success 
but the dole campaign thinking it could coast across the finish 
line did not answer tough lastminute bush television ads that 
suggested dole would raise taxes 
fiercely and historically opposed to taxes new hampshire voters 
dealt dole a loss from which he could not recover dole later 
described his failure to answer the bush ad as his big mistake 
doles campaign was beset by internal divisions and vacillation 
critics said it was a reflection of dole himself calling him a 
consummate legislator but lacking in an executives ability to 
delegate authority or organize 
after new hampshire doles campaign went into a tailspin it 
seemed to unravel in embarrassingly full view 
campaign manager bill brock in a struggle for control fired 
keene and devine as reporters watched he ordered the two off the 
campaign plane in florida 
doles strategy for winning the white house had been based 
primarily on winning the first two contests and when he fell short 
in new hampshire his candidacy collapsed 
he found himself far behind bush in the southern primaries on 
super tuesday three weeks later unable to focus his energies on 
his best opportunities he lost everywhere in one night bush 
moved halfway to a delegate majority 
dole couldnt turn the race around in illinois and was 
effectively out of the running 
in a metaphor of his sputtering campaign a live 30minute 
television broadcast in illinois planned in 11thhour desperation 
was ruined by an electronic glitch 
dole was always dogged by a reputation for meanness born of his 
hatchetman role as the 1976 vice presidential nominee he was 
unable to shake it this time around 
bitter on the night of his new hampshire loss dole snapped at 
bush during a joint live network television interview for 
lying about his record 
he was frustrated by a feeling he still had to run against 
ronald reagan the man who defeated both dole and bush in the 1980 
gop race bush reagans loyal vice president inherited much of 
the presidents support 
im sort of running against the ghost of ronald reagan dole 
once said 
dole campaigned gamely last week in wisconsin his campaign jet 
and entourage gone but bush had a massive lead in the polls 
by weeks end dole appeared to be weary of waging a campaign 
that was only going through the motions 
one thing you learn how to do pretty well in our business is 
to count he said in withdrawing you come to trust your 
instincts to tell you when its over and in my heart i know the 
time is now

world rice stocks are expected to fall by more than 
30 percent this year to about 35 million tons the un food and 
agriculture organization reported wednesday 
a report by the faos intergovernmental group on rice said the 
change in the world rice market from one of surplus to limited 
supplies and rising prices was due largely to adverse climactic 
conditions 
it also said some countries had adopted measures to reduce 
output 
the fao group warned that another year of falling output could 
cause serious food security problems 
the reduction in rice stocks was described as particularly 
acute in major producing countries in the developing world such 
as china india bangladesh burma indonesia malaysia pakistan 
thailand and sri lanka 
in the united states stocks were forecast to fall by more than 
50 percent to 800000 tons by the end of 1988

the third installment of a fourpart easter 
series strangers no longer concerns with the 
protestantcatholic convergence toward unity dealing with official 
dialogues 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
from across christianitys denominational spectrum reactions to 
a proposal for unity have poured into the headquarters of the world 
council of churches in geneva switzerland 
the response has been tremendous said the rev gunther 
gassman a lutheran and director of the councils faith and order 
commission an inclusive protestantroman catholiceastern orthodox 
unit that is compiling the appraisals 
its a unique thing in the history of the ecumenical 
movement he said in a telephone interview never has there 
been so much interest and discussion of a church document 
throughout the world 
roman catholic protestant and eastern orthodox denominations 
170 of them from around the globe have sent official responses to 
an agreement jointly produced by their thinkers on a reintegrated 
faith 
bem its called standing for the central aspects of 
baptism eucharist celebrating the lords supper and ministry 
sometimes called the lima text it was produced by a 
commission of 120 theologians bible scholars historians clergy 
and lay leaders at a meeting in lima peru in 1982 
we have become increasingly aware of our unity in the body of 
christ they said sadly divided churches have been enabled to 
arrive at substantial theological agreements we believe many 
significant advances are now possible 
to that end bem circulated among the churches for five years 
translated into 35 languages after pondering the denominations 
have now voiced their assessment the broadest ever attained in an 
ecumenical accord 
its a towering achievement said the rev john hotchkin 
ecumenical officer for us catholic bishops it could serve to 
put a new floor under the ecumenical movement its a very 
important landmark 
the vatican also appraised the document generally commending 
the results but asked for further elaborations especially on the 
ministry 
the responses are being distributed to the churches in six 
volumes with the last two still to be compiled a summary will be 
considered by the joint commission at a meeting in august 1989 and 
any clarifications and adaptations will be taken care of before the 
final document is presented to churches by 1991 
then its up to them gassman said our strong hope is 
that they act on it in the next 10 years initiating some form of 
eucharistic sharing many of them are ready to do so now 
bem offers concordant beliefs about key functions of the church 
drawing on common biblical roots and christianitys centuries prior 
to the 1054 schism that separated rome and eastern orthodoxy and 
the 16thcentury protestant break from rome 
the document challenges presentday churches to affirm this 
common early core of faith baptism of infants as well as adults 
is recognized with precedents for each in practices of the early 
church 
regarding the eucharist the approach goes behind the medieval 
catholic doctrine of transubstantiation upholding instead a 
broader concept of christs real presence in celebration of the 
lords supper 
on the ministry bem recommends a threefold tier of bishops 
presbyters and deacons most major churches have all three but 
usually refer to presbyters as pastors priests or ministers some 
protestant bodies avoid the term bishop but have parallel 
overseeing offices under other titles 
the responses have been as varied as the denominations the 
vaticans 40page response wasnt as long as the salvation armys 
70 pages the longest the shortest a half page from the 
presbyterian church of new zealand simply said fine lets go with 
it 
weve made an enormous lot of progress in the churches 
acceptance of each other said the rev john deschner a united 
methodist from southern methodist universitys perkins school of 
theology in dallas who chairs the world council commission a 
trust has developed among protestant catholic and orthodox 
churches that is beyond what wed ever dared hope 
bem culminates the rising pleas for increased acts of mutual 
recognition of members and ministry a kind of unity of mutual 
hospitality welcoming each other in each others denominational 
context acknowledging each other before god 
paving the way for bem has been a swelling profusion of 
dialogues and surprising accords among the denominations 
on national and international levels the bilateral talks have 
gone on 20 years between teams of catholics with lutherans with 
methodists with anglicans with baptists with disciples with 
eastern orthodoxy with presbyterians with pentecostals with 
evangelicals 
at the same time protestant bodies have met with one another 
scrutinizing their respective views seeking closer understanding 
and concurrence 
it has become a vast interconfessional conversation a constant 
toandfro hum of inquiry explanation discovery and often 
surprisingly consensus 
the talks probe the tangle of mutual misconceptions mistaken 
impressions and caricatured images accumulated through centuries of 
alienation from one another 
they seek to clear up where each really stands on many points 
it turns out to be together 
for instance lutherans and anglicans in separate dialogues with 
catholics determined they basically agreed on a key issue of the 
16thcentury protestant reformation that had divided them 
protestants emphasized justification by faith alone that 
salvation comes only through faith in christs forgiving grace and 
asserted that rome claimed the church dispensed grace for earned 
merit 
but it turns out that arguments in the heat of old battle were 
misconstrued on both sides they now agree as the us 
lutherancatholic team put it that our entire hope of 
justification and salvation rests on christ jesus and his 
forgiving grace 
similarly convergent views have been found about the papacy 
itself with anglicans and lutherans agreeing on the benefit of a 
unifying center a presiding bishop of a pastoral rather than 
juridical kind responsible to regular ecumenical councils 
the deluge of dialogue reports have dealt with virtually all 
basic issues of churchmanship spirituality scripture apostolic 
succession conversion worship grace authority the holy spirit 
family mixed marriages salvation and papal primacy usually with 
degrees of agreement 
so much is happening there is so much development that its 
hard to keep up said catholic brother jeffrey gros who heads 
the faith and order office of the us national council of churches 
in a book summarizing a score of such understandings growth 
in agreements lutheran scholar harding meyer and reformed 
scholar lukas vischer say the dialogues constantly point beyond 
themselves so the main aim no longer is just reaching of 
consensus but translation into practice in the living 
fellowship of the churches 
many issues remain unsettled between rome and protestantism on 
such issues as ordination of women which catholicism and orthodoxy 
forbid but anglicans and catholics in new talks are discussing 
it 
different shades of understanding terminology and doctrinal 
nuances also linger as do conflicts on social issues such as 
abortion and divorce along with bureaucratic inertia 
the ecumenical movement is a glacier said lutheran bishop 
herbert w chilstrom head of the newly unified evangelical 
lutheran church in america it moves slowly but it does move

edgar faure the brilliant statesman who died 
wednesday at the age of 79 was hailed by friends and foes alike 
for his political savvy intelligence and wit 
faure occupied every important post in the french government 
except the presidency during a career that spanned four decades 
president francois mitterrand a fellow socialist called faure 
a remarkable man who marked the history of our republic 
jeanmarie le pen presidential candidate from the extremeright 
national front praised faures intelligence and tolerance 
despite our differing conceptions of political action 
the bespectacled balding father figure known to the french 
simply as edgar was best remembered as one of the nations 
most progressive education ministers 
under gen charles de gaulle during the 1968 student uprising 
he masterminded vast reforms that allowed french universities more 
autonomy 
faure was a member of the french academy and wrote books on 
subjects ranging from french oil policy to modern china 
a renaissance man faure even wrote musical scores under the 
pseudonym edgar sanday he published detective novels 
faure was born on aug 18 1908 in the southwestern city of 
beziers where his father an army doctor was stationed he 
graduated from high school at the age of 15 earned his doctorate 
in law at 19 and was a practicing lawyer at 21 
he was fluent in russian and years later would stun a soviet 
trade delegation negotiating without a translator for four hours 
straight stumbling only once over the word corkscrew 
yet he had an oldfashioned sense of honor and once challenged a 
prominent magazine reporter to a duel for having questioned in 
print his motives for reducing taxes on race horses notoriously 
nearsighted he was already waving the pistol when a colleague 
managed to talk him out of it 
faures successful law career was interrupted by world war ii 
in 1942 faure and his wife lucie meyer the elegant publisher of a 
political review fled france for algiers 
after the war he was financial adviser to socialist governments 
led by his close friend pierre mendesfrance 
in 1947 he was elected to public office for the first time 
serving as a deputy for the jura department in eastern france 
from that time on he served in the cabinets of numerous prime 
ministers holding more ministerial appointments than any other 
public official 
faures first wife lucie meyer died in 1977 he is survived by 
his second wife mariejeanne vuez and two daughters burial will

cocke county officials knew they had to 
come up with 345000 quickly to keep public schools open after 
spring break so they decided to sell the countyowned hospital 
the deal negotiated between the county and baptist health 
system which was renting the hospital benefits everyone but 
primarily prevents the nightmare of closing schools county 
executive charles lewis moore said tuesday 
we cant have that he said thats absolutely not 
satisfactory to anyone one concern was that some seniors who have 
scholarships and financial assistance would lose it plus it would 
affect employees and parents 
the 1 million sale was approved 200 by the cocke county 
legislative body on monday night 
the county lawmakers then provided the school system with 
200000 the minimum on which the schools could operate the rest 
of the term and agreed to invest the remainder in an industrial 
park 
the sale includes a 74bed hospital a 56bed nursing home and a 
building housing three doctors offices baptist health system 
based in knoxville had leased the hospital since 1982 and last 
year extended that lease through 1999 
at any point during those 17 years baptist had the option of 
buying the hospital for 158 million or 580000 more than the 
actual sale price 
but county officials say they can get roughly 36 million out 
of the deal in interest on the remaining 800000 plus money saved 
because the deal exempts the county from funding care of indigents 
at the hospital for the next 12 years that had been costing about 
35000 a year 
county officials praised baptist health for coming to the 
countys rescue 
we frankly had not intended to buy right now said robert 
chandler president of baptist health system but they were 
having some financial problems especially with funding the school 
system so we felt we could help by buying now helping the schools 
was our main motivation

although his support of a presidential veto will enhance his 
standing with conservatives it will hinder his efforts to attract 
blacks and other minorities into the republican party 
democrats are sure to exploit the issue once again hes 
perceived to be president reagans puppet 
democrats will take any fallout they can get if the election is 
close the failure of the republican party to attract more blacks 
and minorities because of bushs stance on the veto might be the 
difference

the honolulu advertiser on the ceasefire in nicaragua 
some sort of humanitarian aid for the contras is necessary for 
the period of phasing down and out withdrawing our troops from 
honduras with no arms left behind is necessary 
at some point there must be talks between washington and 
managua on a more normalized relationship 
many will continue to question whether the whole contra 
operation was necessary and worth the cost in terms of bloodshed in 
central america and damage in the us government process 
there may have been better ways to deal with whatever dangers 
the sandinistas pose in the region 
yet it could end up a nolose situation for president reagan if 
the ceasefire and peace process work there is little doubt he 
will say that his tough policy worked and if they fail he can 
blame the congress and others for killing off the contras

the evansville ind courier on preventing teen suicides 
we are shocked and saddened by the three suicides involving 
present and former reitz high school students yet our grief now 
must give way to concern 
there seems no direct connection among the three other than 
what experts call a copycat syndrome one person commits suicide 
another troubled individual learns of it even sees it as an escape 
from despair and the chain reaction begins 
its critical now that those closest to students parents 
school personnel classmates see that the chain is broken 
talk to your children talk to your classmates and if youre 
troubled yourself seek someone who will listen no problem is so 
insurmountable 
so often when we learn of suicide we hear the word 
helplessness no we cant help those who have already taken their 
lives but for others who may be troubled we are not helpless 
especially now that our consciousness has been raised so tragically 
we must be alert we must care we must talk

if the two sides trying to force changes in 
the 1990 census both get their way the results would nearly 
balance one another a population expert said wednesday 
the census bureau is under pressure to exclude illegal aliens 
from its national head count traditionally it counts everyone 
living in the country 
groups which have filed suit to ignore the aliens contend large 
concentrations of them could result in in some states gaining seats 
in the house of representatives at the expense of other states 
meanwhile other groups want the final census totals to be 
increased to account for people who may be overlooked in the census 
most often blacks and hispanics living in urban areas 
at stake are the 435 seats in the house which are distributed 
among the states on the basis of population 
if both sides get their way the only change would be a 
flipflop of one seat from california to georgia said william 
ohare director of policy studies for the independent population 
reference bureau 
ohare told a breakfast briefing for northeast and midwest 
members of congress that he estimates their region will lose 14 
house seats following the 1990 census that would continue a trend 
evident over the last several decades he noted 
using estimates of the number of illegal aliens and undercounted 
minorities he said that deleting the one group and adding in the 
other would make little difference in the long run 
the only change he said would be that california would gain 
five new seats instead of six while georgia would add two rather 
than just one 
thats easy to understand since there are so many 
undocumented aliens in california he commented 
ohares study of potential changes in house seats based on 
1990 projections with no adjustments calls for california to be 
the big gainer adding six house seats followed by florida with a 
gain of four and texas adding three 
expected to pick up one seat each are virginia north carolina 
georgia and arizona 
on the other hand new york would lose three seats states losing 
two apiece would be pennsylvania ohio illinois and michigan 
expected to lose one house seat are massachusetts wisconsin iowa 
kansas west virginia and montana

infection called creutzfeldtjakob disease and both might have 
resulted from onthejob exposure to contaminated tissue doctors 
report 
the cases were reported in separate letters to the editor in 
thursdays new england journal of medicine

human brains 
after she died of creutzfeldtjakob disease doctors discovered 
she had worked with tissue from two people who had also died of the 
disease 11 and 16 years earlier

vice president george bush would have no 
reluctance to criticize jesse jackson if he is the democratic 
nominee a spokesman said today 
bush rejoicing in his clear path to the republican presidential 
nomination is starting to focus on the general election campaign 
including strategy against his eventual democratic opponent 
if jackson is the nominee we will feel very willing to attack 
him on the issues there will be no reticence there will be no 
reluctance bush spokesman pete teeley said aboard air force ii 
jacksons democratic rivals have left jackson alone until 
recently working under the conventional assumption that jackson 
could not win the nomination but as jackson racks up win after 
win sen albert gore jr has expressed a willingness to criticize 
jackson on the issues and his lack of experience in government 
bush assured of the gop nomination will continue to campaign 
hard to guard against complacency teeley said 
it feels great bush declared tuesday giving a thumbsup 
sign to reporters after learning of the withdrawal of sen bob 
dole the same day bush sailed to an overwhelming win in the 
connecticut primary 
meanwhile bush organizers are scurrying to find new ways to 
keep attention focused on the candidate now that he is without a 
major gop rival 
for one thing bush plans to continue to make highprofile 
campaign appearances in states with key primaries including new 
york pennsylvania ohio and california 
the immediate task ahead is unity bush told a gop dinner 
tuesday night after his connecticut victory was announced we 
republicans have no reason for complacency 
he said that republicans now must present their party as a big 
party with big open doors 
the challenges we face will never be met unless we meet them 
together handinhand as brothers and sisters as blacks and 
whites as northerners southerners east and west the wealthy and 
the wanting he said 
he complimented dole for a very gracious statement in 
dropping out of the race i know exactly how he must feel i was 
there eight years ago bush said referring to his unsuccessful 
1980 presidential bid 
not all bush supporters were as jubilant about recent 
developments as were the vice president and his top strategists 
wisconsin gov tommy thompson said that doles exit could hurt 
bushs chances in the fall campaign now that its obvious hes 
going to win the nomination 
i cant see the fact that the vice president doesnt have any 
more opposition is that good for him its good to have a 
primary said thompson a strong bush backer 
thompson who has been accompanying bush in his threeday 
campaign swing in advance of the april 5 wisconsin primary said 
many wisconsin independents and some republicans are now likely to 
vote in the democratic primary 
those individuals who come out of a hotly contested primary 
can use it as a springboard to solidify the party thompson said 
the republican governor who earlier in the week had suggested 
he would vote for democrat jesse jackson were he a democrat 
indicated jackson would be hard for bush to beat in november 
he jackson is a viable candidate hes very exciting i like 
the guy thompson said 
gop officials in wisconsin urged party members who had supported 
dole against crossing over and voting in the democratic primary 
next week 
and top bush aides conceded that lack of a contest could steal 
the spotlight away from their candidate 
were going to have to display some creativity in keeping 
bushs candidacy before the public said bush aide peter teeley 
although bush is running virtually alone for the gop nomination 
it will be at least a couple of weeks before he can gain enough 
delegates for a majority at the gop convention 
assuming he wins every delegate that can be won from now on he 
would cross that threshold on may 3 when ohio indiana and the 
district of columbia hold their primaries but if he picks up 
doles delegates now counted as uncommitted he could go over 
the top as early as april 15 when minnesota holds its gop state 
convention 
bushs sole remaining challenger is former television evangelist 
pat robertson who has but 17 delegates 
bush had said he would keep on campaigning hard right up until 
the time dole announced he was retiring from the race doles exit 
makes the april 5 gop primary moot 
it changes some of the dynamics it removes some of the 
tension bush said of doles withdrawal 
i dont like running against other republicans he added 
bush said he had called dole to congratulate him on a 
hardfought racehe has been a worthy warrier and a tough 
competitor 
bush said that while he intends to continue to campaign in 
key states the schedule will be somewhat lighter and ill have 
more time to flesh out the issue positions

house leaders reached final agreement today on 
a package of 48 million in humanitarian aid to nicaraguas 
contra rebels and to children injured in that countrys long civil 
war 
the proposal had been worked out in negotiations over the last 
two days between house speaker jim wright dtexas minority leader 
robert michel rill and other leaders who gave it their final 
approval today 
agreement sent the measure to a house floor vote later today 
and it was expected to receive a strong bipartisan majority that 
would send the bill to the senate on thursday where easy passage 
also was expected and authorize the first us aid to the rebels 
in a month 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the package was 
being examined by the administration but said it was 
encouraging and moves in the right direction 
it sends a message to the contras that they are not abandoned 
that we do care about them and want to keep them healthy and a 
viable force said rep mickey edwards rokla who participated 
in negotiations to draft the compromise 
and it lets the sandinistas know that its important to the 
united states congress that the talks that take place down there 
take place with good faith and that they move toward 
democratization edwards added 
as part of the deal wright was to send a letter to president 
reagan pledging fair and orderly consideration for any future 
request the administration might make for new military aid if the 
central american peace process breaks down said rep david bonior 
dmich leader of a democratic task force on the contra issue 
but wright would retain control over the precise timing of a 
vote on such an aid package and the rules under which it would come 
before the house bonior said 
a ceasefire verification commission made up of nicaraguan 
cardinal miguel obando y bravo and organization of american states 
secretary general joao baena soares would have substantial say 
in whether new military aid is warranted bonior said 
the package would provide aid to keep the contras together while 
they spend the next 60 days in ceasefire zones during negotiations 
for a longerterm truce 
it would send about 27 million monthly in food clothing 
medicine and shelter to the rebels over the next six months an 
additional 15 million in communications gear subject to approval 
by the ceasefire commission would push the total sixmonth rebel 
aid package to 177 million 
that rate of aid is the same as the rebels were getting prior to 
feb 29 when the last us assistance ran out 
an identical amount would go into a new program to care for 
children injured in the sevenyear civil war bonior said 
the package also would provide 10 million to finance the 
verification commission set up as part of last weeks ceasefire 
agreement to ensure adherence to terms of the ceasefire worked out 
in sapoa nicaragua between the contras and the leftist managua 
government 
the bill would provide additional money for transportation of 
the aid but that amount was not included in the 50 million figure 
the money would be administered by the state departments agency 
for international development bonior said aid would get 25 
million in the bill to cover administrative costs 
one of the most contentious issues in the negotiations was 
whether reagan should be guaranteed the right to a quick 
guaranteed vote in congress if the sandinistas renege on promises 
of amnesty and restoration of civil liberties and hostilities 
break out anew 
republicans wary of promises made by the leftist government 
had insisted such a guarantee was needed as insurance that the 
sandinistas would live up to their end of the bargain 
in a compromise wright drafted a letter to reagan assuring the 
president of a chance to submit a proposal for new military aid if 
the peace process becomes derailed and to have the proposal 
treated fairly 
that means that the measure would be considered by the 
appropriate house committee and could come to the floor for a vote 
but under conditions determined by wright said bonior 
reagan would be urged to get the advice of the verification 
commission before making any such request but would not be forced 
to do so 
any new aid for the contras would have to conform to the 
requirements of the ceasefire reached last week that agreement 
said the contras would receive only humanitarian aid and that the 
aid would be routed through neutral organizations the cia has 
delivered past us aid supplies to the rebels 
in remarks tuesday in managua nicaraguan president daniel 
ortega urged congress not to approve any aid that would conflict 
with the agreement which he defined as allowing provision of 
civilian clothes medicine and food but not uniforms or boots

president reagan put in a plug for the 
superconducting super collider wednesday saying it is more than an 
arcane interest to a few research specialists 
reagan has asked congress for 365 million to begin construction 
of the super collider which would be the worlds largest particle 
accelerator 
the scientific community is divided on the project some 
regarding it as a key to the technological future and others 
saying it would drain needed money from more worthwile research 
i know that some people may question the practical 
applications of the superconducting super collider the president 
told a group of high school science students and others in the 
white house rose garden 
the strange world of subatomic particles they may think will 
never be more than an arcane interest to a few highly specialized 
scientists he said 
but the truth is the practical applications of this new 
technology are already changing the way we live every time someone 
turns on his desk computer makes a phone call or plays a video 
game he is plugging into that mysterious world of quantum physics 
the superconducting super collider is the doorway to that new world 
of quantum change 
the students in the audience were part of a program established 
in 1985 to give top science students from each state a chance to 
work for two weeks in the summer at national laboratories in the 
washington area 
reagan approved construction of the super collider in january 
1987 a site is to be selected next january in either arizona 
colorado illinois michigan new york north carolina tennessee 
or texas 
the projected cost to build the 53milesaround tunnel that 
comprises the super collider is more than 4 billion 
six nobel laureates four of whom were present for wednesdays 
ceremony wrote reagan that the project represents americas 
commitment to the pursuit of excellence in basic scientific 
research 
the letter was signed by were james watson cronin val logsdon 
fitch sheldon lee glashow burton richter samuel cc ting and

democratic presidential hopeful jesse jackson 
and key members of his partys establishment held a summit meeting 
wednesday showing he said that old wineskins are expanding and 
making room for new wine 
jackson huddled for a breakfast meeting with more than two dozen 
wellknown figures in the party afterward they said no one had 
brought up reported party concerns that his nomination could damage 
democratic chances of winning the white house next november 
we only see that in the press said california assembly 
speaker willie brown jacksons national campaign chairman maybe 
people dont want to say that in front of us 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis and jackson are locked in a 
tight race for the lead in national convention delegates after a 
big jackson win in the michigan caucuses last weekend and a dukakis 
victory in the connecticut primary tuesday 
in addition to private concerns about jackson another 
democratic contender sen albert gore jr of tennessee has begun 
strong criticism of jacksons experience and his stands on issues 
i categorically reject his notion that theres a moral 
equivalence between israel and the plo gore said tuesday in new 
york and i am dismayed by his embrace of plo leader yasser 
arafat and cuban president fidel castro 
jackson brushed aside those criticisms and gore sought a 
meeting with jackson late wednesday in washington before jackson 
was to fly to wisconsin to campaign for the primary there next 
tuesday 
after the breakfast meeting former defense secretary clark 
clifford one of the solid figures of the party establishment had 
nothing but praise for jackson 
what he is also doing is bringing a new maturity to the 
american political scene said clifford his candidacy could 
not have occurred 50 years ago 25 years ago or perhaps even 10 
years ago it is an important breakthrough in our constant 
seeking to bring more fairness to our political process 
jackson said the breakfast brought together democrats who have 
traditional investment in the interests of the country and the 
party and those who are new to the process 
in this instance we bring together old wineskins and new 
wine but the old wineskins are expanding and making room for new 
wine he added using an image he used frequently in his 1984 
campaign 
former democratic party chairman john white who put together 
the breakfast is joining the campaign as an informal adviser 
this meeting is a new maturing of the political process in 
america white said it represents a growingup of america it 
represents a bonding of the democratic party and a bond that 
recognizes no class 
participants in the breakfast said one concern about jackson was 
posed to him in a question about his relationship with black muslim 
leader louis farrakhan 
white said jackson quoted jesus about casting the first stone 
and forgiveness and so anybody who hasnt made mistakes lets 
not be casting stones at each other about the past 
farrakhan campaigned with jackson early in the 1984 campaign 
but the tie was cut after the black muslim leader called judaism a 
gutter religion and called adolf hitler a great man

mcdonnell douglas corp became the pentagons 
top research contractor in fiscal 1987 winning awards totaling 
17 billion the defense department said wednesday 
among educational and nonprofit entities the massachusetts 
institute of technology continued to hold down the top ranking 
winning research contracts during the year worth 4076 million 
the johns hopkins university was close behind with awards 
totaling 3549 million 
overall the pentagon increased its spending on research by more 
than 10 percent during fiscal 1987 with awards reaching a grand 
total of 218 billion that compared with 198 billion in fiscal 
1986 
much of last years increase appeared related to work on 
president reagans star wars antimissile system the amount of 
money invested in research on missile and space systems climbed 
from 69 billion in fiscal 1986 to 79 billion in fiscal 1987 
moreover the martin marietta corp a key star wars contractor 
vaulted from fifth place in the fiscal 1986 rankings to second 
place last year with contract awards rising from 6953 million to 
16 billion 
the latest figures are contained in a report prepared annually 
by the pentagon to rank the top 500 companies or nonprofit groups 
performing research development test and evaluation work the 
rankings are based on a review of all contracts totaling 25000 or 
more awarded during the fiscal year that ended last sept 30 
mcdonnell douglas whose overall ranking as the nations largest 
defense contractor was announced just a month ago displaced the 
lockheed missiles amp space co in assuming the top spot for 
research mcdonnell douglas research contracts climbed from 928 
million in fiscal 1986 to 17 billion in fiscal 1987 
because of martin mariettas abrupt rise lockheed fell to 3rd 
place in the research rankings winning contracts in fiscal 1987 
worth 154 billion compared with 148 billion the year before

questions to be asked on the 1990 census has been settled the 
census bureau reported wednesday 
friday is the deadline for the bureau to tell congress the 
questions it intends to ask americans in the national head count 
the issue has been clouded by a disagreement with the white 
house office of management and budget that agency wanted to reduce 
paperwork by deleting some questions and reducing the number of 
people who get the more complex long form 
the two agencies have agreed that all 106 million households in 
the nation will be sent the short form while the more detailed 
long form will go to 177 million census had wanted to sent it to 
nearly 20 million households omb to limit it to 10 million 
short form questions on plumbing facilities and condominiums 
will be switched to the long form as omb suggested but other 
questions will be retained including the cost of uilities 
some things that were asked in the 1980 census will be dropped 
in 1990 these include employment five years earlier marital 
history weeks spent looking for work number of bathrooms air 
conditioning and heating equipment presence of an elevator and

the reagan administration said today it is 
considering new sanctions against panama to force the ouster of 
strongman manuel antonio noriega but it appeared no action was 
imminent 
other sanctions are being actively considered said white 
house spokesman marlin fitzwater however an administration 
official speaking on the condition of anonymity said nothings 
imminent 
on capitol hill meanwhile two republican lawmakers introduced 
legislation that calls on president reagan to renegotiate the 
panama canal treaties to allow us troops to remain in panama past 
the year 2000 
the canal treaties negotiated with panama in 1979 provide for 
the transfer of the canal to panama on dec 31 1999 
the legislation introduced by rep robert walker of pennsylvania 
and new york rep jerry solomon would allow independent us action 
to defend the canal as well as permit us troops to remain in 
panama past the year 2000 
separately sen alfonse m damato rny said today that 
noriegas troops have harassed and beaten canal employees there 
is a continuing pattern of escalation in panamanian actions 
against the canal he said in an interview on abctvs good 
morning america he did not elaborate 
beyond applying new sanctions the administration is raising the 
prospect that the us military may be used to protect the 
estimated 50000 american citizens in panama against possible 
harassment by that countrys security forces 
fitzwater appeared to open the door to that possibility tuesday 
after an incident the previous evening in which panamanian troops 
confiscated the tapes of four us television networks and briefly 
detained several american journalists 
discussing the harassment against americans fitzwater said 
it has always been a principle that we will protect american 
citizens as best we can and while we have said that we dont plan 
to go in militarily its also important to note that there are 
limits 
but when president reagan met with senior advisers tuesday 
afternoon to discuss the panama situation use of military force 
was not discussed according to an administration official who 
asked not to be identified 
the official said other options were discussed for bringing 
pressure to bear on panamanian strongman manuel antonio noriega 
the de facto head of what the united states considers to be an 
illegal government 
it was not clear whether fitzwaters comments represented a 
genuine reevaluation of us policy or were part of the continuing 
war of nerves between the administration and panamas 
militarydominated government 
one major deterrent to military intervention is that any such 
move would generate a hostile reaction throughout latin america 
most delegates attending a conference of latin american 
representatives in venezuela on monday and tuesday called for the 
us to exercise restraint 
in recent days the administration has been weighing the 
possibility of imposing additional sanctions against panama 
us officials who asked not to be identified said reagan 
could invoke the international emergency economic powers act which 
would give him broad discretionary authority to limit private us 
transactions with panama one example would be the suspension of 
all air service between the two countries 
over the past month administration actions have effectively cut 
off the flow of dollars into panama leaving the country near 
insolvency reagan has called on noriega to step down 
there was a new sense of urgency here tuesday over signs of an 
accelerating deterioration of the situation in panama on monday 
thousands of antigovernment demonstrators were routed by 
government forces with the help of shotguns tear gas and water 
cannon witnesses said several people were injured and dozens 
arrested 
later security agents forced their way at gunpoint into the 
offices of four american networks at a local hotel and confiscated 
tapes of the demonstration eight foreign journalists including 
americans were detained for several hours before being released 
shortly before fitzwater spoke ousted panamanian president eric 
arturo delvalle whose authority the united states continues to 
recognize appealed for the creation of a usled international 
force to oust noriega 
delvalle who has spent the past month in hiding made his 
appeal through panamas ambassador juan b sosa who has been 
acting as delvalles representative in washington and has refused 
to relinquish the embassy to a replacement appointed by panamas 
new government 
while criticizing the violence used against panamanian 
demonstrators the focus of the remarks by both fitzwater and state 
department spokesman charles redman was on the harassment of the 
american journalists 
their comments evoked memories of grenada when the united states 
and several friendly caribbean nations sent forces into that 
country five years ago and ousted the leftist government there 
the us rationale was that hundreds of american medical 
students on the island faced potential danger 
fitzwater said we are certainly concerned by this threat to 
americans and find it a very difficult turn of events and one that 
is contrary to assurances that we have received in the past

attorney general edwin meese iii the subject 
of a still widening criminal investigation ought to step down two 
senators said today but president reagan said of meese i have 
every confidence in him 
meese is the crown jewel of the sleaze factor in reagan 
administration history senate majority leader robert byrd told 
reporters and if reagan doesnt want to ask him to quit he should 
find someone else to ask him 
sen bob packwood rore echoed byrd you finally reach a 
place where there is a cloud of suspicion a sufficient cloud of 
suspicion that i think you owe it to the president to remove 
yourself 
but reagan almost in reply told reporters during a ceremony 
honoring young scientists in the white house rose garden hes 
been a friend for over 20 years i have every confidence in him 
im not going to comment any further 
meese has said he wont step down and he repeated that assertion 
as he left his office tuesday night 
meeses future became a subject of speculation and debate in the 
aftermath of the resignations of two top justice department aides 
who acted according to informed sources out of fear of being 
tainted by the attorney generals mounting legal problems the 
sources declined to be identified 
then came a new development with the disclosure that 
independent counsel james mckay has widened his probe by 
subpoenaing payroll records and other documents of the washington 
chapter of the multiple sclerosis society in connection with a 
40000ayear job meeses wife ursula got with the group in 1985 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said today reagan saw no 
need for meese to step aside in light of the resignations of 
associate attorney general arnold burns and william weld head of 
the justice departments criminal division and four of their top 
aides 
another top justice department official solicitor general 
charles fried said the resignations were leading him to reconsider 
his own future at the justice department 
fitzwater said that reagan has not has any discussion with meese 
about the leadership vacuum at justice that i am aware of 
operations will continue at the justice department 
fitzwater said no change that i am aware of is in progress 
the justice department is operating fine people are out there 
doing their job he reagan thinks the justice department is 
operating just fine 
fitzwater also declined to comment on byrds call for meeses 
resignation 
he ought to get out byrd dwva said the country 
cannot have confidence in the justice department when the top law 
enforcement officer obviously has to spend an inordinate amount of 
his time defending himself 
he should be spending his time fighting the war on drugs 
crime byrd said 
byrd opened his regular morning meeting with reporters by 
saying mr meese has become the crown jewel of the sleaze factor 
in reagan administration history 
its just cloud after cloud after cloud building in layers 
over his head to the point where all confidence in this agency is 
being seriously eroded byrd said 
washington attorney james bierbower legal counsel for the 
multiple sclerosis society and a board member said the records 
concerning mrs meeses job were delivered to mckays office on 
monday 
the independent counsel is trying to determine whether longtime 
meese friend e robert wallach used his influence to help get mrs 
meese the job said several sources familiar with the probe 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
sens arlen specter rpa and carl levin dmich demanded 
that meese explain why burns weld and four of their aides abruptly 
quit on tuesday specter a member of the judiciary committee said 
it may be necessary to convene hearings if an explanation is not 
forthcoming 
burns and weld offered little in the way of public explanation 
but they told associates they were concerned that the nearly 
yearlong criminal probe of meese is hurting the entire justice 
department according to several department sources speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
weld who as an assistant attorney general oversees all federal 
criminal investigations told assistants at a final staff meeting 
that the continuing investigation of meese and wallach was casting 
a cloud on the justice department according to several 
department sources 
weld quit as of the close of business tuesday telling his staff 
he didnt want to get in 50 fights and have blood on the 
floor said the sources burns will stay on until april 22 
meese did not learn the two were quitting until burns and weld 
walked into his office tuesday morning and informed him of the 
decision several department sources characterized meese as 
shocked 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater confirmed that burns and 
weld had met with white house chief of staff howard baker a week 
earlier the gentlemen indicated they wanted to resign or they 
were disenchanted and they were advised to talk to the attorney 
general about that thats the proper way to do it the proper 
course of action fitzwater said 
asked if reagan had been told about the conversation fitzwater 
said i dont believe so he said he was not aware of any 
subsequent talks between baker and the two officials 
meese has been under investigation for nearly 11 months by 
mckay the independent counsel who last may 11 began looking into 
meeses involvement with the scandalplagued wedtech corp 
the investigation later expanded to include his involvement in a 
1 billion iraqi pipeline project with the independent counsel 
trying to determine whether meese may have been paid off by wallach 
or others in exchange for helping wedtech or the pipeline project 
regarding the new area in the meese probe wallachs lawyer san 
francisco attorney george walker was quoted in todays post as 
saying wallach played a peripheral role in getting mrs meese 
the job at the ms society 
however bierbower said the idea for hiring mrs meese came from 
the chapters executive director jeanne bradley who was pleased 
with mrs meeses volunteer work 
walker said wallach had suggested the possibility of the 
radio job and bierbower said a foundation run by the family that 
owns the station ended up paying mrs meeses 40000 salary for 
the ms society job she took instead 
one justice department source said weld has frequently expressed 
an interest in returning to massachusetts to seek political office 
and didnt want to be associated with the department because of 
meeses continuing legal problems 
weld a former us attorney in boston who has prosecuted a 
number of important public corruption and whitecollar crime cases 
is widely mentioned as a potential republican gubernatorial 
candidate he also has said he wants to run for the us senate 
the source said

rancho seco nuclear power plant shut 
down for 27 months was restarted today after plant officials 
received final approval from the federal nuclear regulatory 
commission 
an electronically transmitted letter from the nrc approving the 
restart arrived at 653 am said kerry shearer a spokesman for 
the sacramento municipal utility district which owns the plant 25 
miles southeast of sacramento 
the letter was in response to an official approval request sent 
by the authority to washington on tuesday 
authority nuclear chief carl andognini ordered restart of the 
plant at 704 am shearer said starting up the plant will take 
eight to 10 hours 
were obviously very very happy to have come to this point 
after 27 months of effort said shearer 
the plant whose reactor is a twin of the three mile island 
reactor in pennsylvania has been closed since a severe overcooling 
accident in december 1985 
the startup process will be completed later wednesday when 
operators finish diluting the amount of boron in the reactors 
cooling water and withdraw control rods shearer said 
the combination brings the reactor to the point where the 
nuclear chain reaction is selfsustaining he said officials 
call that milestone criticality and plan to operate the reactor 
for 10 to 14 days before beginning to produce electricity 
on tuesday morning operators finished testing repairs made to 
the plants electrical system over the weekend a valve problem and 
excessive vibration in two backup diesel generators were also 
fixed over the weekend 
but opposition to the plant has grown during the long series of 
restart delays a majority of the sacramento city council 
including mayor anne rudin and at least one county supervisor have 
announced support for a june ballot measure calling for the plants 
closure 
a citizensponsored initiative calls for immediate shutdown of 
the plant a competing smudsponsored measure asks voters to 
approve operation of the plant for at least 18 months 
the utility has spent more than 400 million during the past 27 
months to overhaul equipment and management at the plant which has 
generated an average of only 40 percent of the electricity it was 
designed to produce since it was opened in 1975 
michael remy director of the group sponsoring the plant closure 
initiative said the utility was under pressure to restart the 
plant because a major delay could diminish public support for the 
facility

gov evan mechams son lied in his 
testimony on an impeachment allegation that the governor misused 
80000 from his protocol fund by loaning it to his auto 
dealership the companys former bookkeeper told the senate today 
dennis mecham general manager of mecham pontiac said last week 
that the dealership was in very strong financial shape but 
former bookkeeper lee christman testified today that the company 
actually needed hundreds of thousands of dollars when it borrowed 
the 80000 in july 1987 
on tuesday dennis mecham announced that the dealership was 
being sold because of lagging sales blamed on bad publicity that 
has dogged his father since he took office in january 1987 
asked today by defense lawyer jerris leonard whether she 
contacted prosecutors on her own initiative ms christman 
answered yes when i heard dennis lie 
leonard immediately objected and the presiding officer said ms 
christmans answer went beyond what the question sought 
later ms christman told prosecutor william french she was 
upset with dennis mecham because she felt he had blamed her for 
things that were not her fault 
democratic sen jesus chuy higuera then asked if there were 
other instances in which she believed the governor and his son had 
not told the truth 
they were misstating various facts which would lead one to 
believe that the inefficiencies were in the accounting office 
rather than the fact that there was a lack of money ms 
christman said 
french asked ms christman was there an immediate need for 
cash in july 1987 
yes there was she answered she said dennis mecham had 
told her the company needed 497000 in cash flow and that he 
called her to his office and handed her an 80000 check 
did he use the word protocol fund french said yes 
she answered 
ms christman worked for mecham pontiac from november 1986 to 
february 1988 when she said she was asked to resign because 
someone else was hired to handle the computer 
the financial condition of mecham pontiac has been a central 
issue in the charge that mecham miused the protocol fund by loaning 
to 80000 to the dealership the charge is the second of three 
impeachment charges against him 
after the prosecution finished its case with rebuttal testimony 
from ms christman and another witness the senate was expected to 
consider whether to vote on the first two impeachment articles 
even though no testimony has been heard during the monthlong trial 
on the third charge that mecham concealed a 350000 campaign 
loan 
a vote to convict the firstterm republican governor would 
automatically remove him from office 
dennis mecham said tuesday the confusion and questions this 
avalanche of negative publicity has caused has forced my family 
to come to this decision to sell mecham pontiac while the condition 
of the company remains solvent and saleable 
mecham also faces a may 17 recall election spurred in part by 
actions and comments that critics have considered slurs against 
blacks jews homosexuals and the japanese 
oldsmobile dealer kemp biddulph whose dealership is next door 
to mechams in suburban glendale said he hoped to close the 
purchase by may 1 
in the impeachment trial the prosecution claims the dealership 
desperately needed the 80000 loan to meet its payroll in july 
1987 but that the governors protocol fund which was derived from 
inaugural proceeds was public money 
the defense claims however that the dealership was in good 
financial shape at the time of the loan which was intended to 
provide higher interest to the protocol fund defense witnesses 
have insisted the fund was private money 
last week a motion to allow an immediate vote on the first 
impeachment charge that the governor tried to thwart an 
investigation of an alleged death threat by a state official was

president reagan said he sent 3200 
crack us troops because honduras was in trouble but reports of 
border fighting with nicaragua were vague and the americans had 
orders to stay out of it 
reagan said he was supporting an ally and warning the 
sandinistas skeptics in washington and tegucigalpa said the 
purpose was to drum up aid for nicaraguan rebels which congress 
had rejected 
arrival of the first american troops march 17 coincided with 
reports from washington that nicaragua had built up a force of 
4500 troops in the bocay border region 
they said up to 2000 sandinista soldiers with sovietmade 
artillery and aircraft had crossed into the jungles of eastern 
honduras pursuing contra rebels and president jose azcona hoyo 
was asking for help 
highranking honduran military sources said about 4000 
hondurans had surrounded the 2000 nicaraguans but no fighting was 
reported they said honduras was sending more troops to the region 
no casualty figures were reported during the crisis which began 
march 15 and lasted 10 days nicaragua said its soldiers did not 
cross the border 
now that the men of the 82nd airborne division and the 7th light 
infantry division have gone home questions remain about the 
display of american might 
the reagan administration said the soldiers would conduct 
exercises in a show of force designed as a measured response to the 
crisis some of them trained 40 miles from the border and 70 miles 
from where fighting was said to have occurred 
azcona said in a march 18 news conference that he counted on 
support from the united states in case of more sandinista 
aggression his press secretary lisandro quesada then told the 
associated press in an interview this is nothing more than an 
exercise in case honduras enters into war 
gen policarpo paz garcia a former honduran chief of state 
said this week i think the sandinistas did not intend to invade 
honduran territory what happened is that nicaraguan troops were in 
pursuit of the contras and committed the error 
paz who governed in 19791981 before civilian rule was 
restored said the honduran army is prepared to repel any 
aggression i wouldnt have asked the united states for 
soldiers he spoke in a radio interview broadcast tuesday 
according to a survey published wednesday in el heraldo 42 per 
cent of tegucigalpa residents polled agreed with the us decision 
to sent troops and 47 percent opposed it 
as the white parachutes of hundreds of american paratroopers 
filled the sky over palmerola air base march 17 the reagan 
decision was being challenged here and in washington 
it came when the sandinistas and ussupported contra rebels 
had announced plans for direct ceasefire negotiations in nicaragua 
although there were charges that the us troops were sent as a 
ploy to get more contra aid azcona told the ap he asked for help 
because his country was in danger 
on monday he said in a telephone conversation at no time 
were there pressures from the united states that my government ask 
for help with the incursion of sandinista troops in our 
territory 
honduran congressmen said at the time that they were not 
informed of a sandinista incursion and learned through the news 
media that azcona had requested help 
newspapers published editorial cartoons questioning the 
operation 
la prensa depicted uncle sam telling azcona and other leaders 
theres an invasion in honduras while they looked around 
saying where where where 
ruben palma president of the small opposition christian 
democratic party declared the united states is provoking a 
direct confrontation betwen nicaragua and honduras with the 
strategic aim of obtaining aid for the antisandinista 
counterrevolutionaries 
president daniel ortega of nicaragua said the same 
despite denials from managua of an incursion us congressmen 
on a factfinding mission in honduras said they had proof 
a wellinformed source in tegucigalpa said the sandinistas 
pursued about 600 rebels into honduras and nearly captured a contra 
supply depot before two bombing raids by the honduran air force 
drove them back 
the presence of the united states troops was beneficial for 
honduras for our people and for the national security azcona 
said as the first americans left for home monday 
the last of the sandinistas had retreated into honduras by 
thursday of last week the day after ortegas government and contra 
leadership signed a preliminary ceasefire agreement 
azcona expressed support for peace efforts in nicaragua 
were friends of dialogue and peace he said if the 
nicaraguan want to reach an agreement and there are no more shots 
or conflicts in our neighboring country then the hondurans will be 
the first to benefit

the army on wednesday padlocked the arabowned 
palestine press service cutting off a key source of information in 
a campaign to curtail media coverage of arab unrest in the occupied 
territories 
the news service which reports on activities in the west bank 
and gaza stip was ordered closed for six months 
we were just too efficient thats what we got closed down 
for reporter john mellor told the associated press 
in another slap against the media the supreme court rejected a 
foreign press appeal for access to the west bank and gaza strip 
which have been closed since monday but the judges ordered the 
government to explain within 30 days why reporters should not be 
allowed free access to the areas 
the moves indicated the importance israel attaches to curbing 
news coverage prime minister yitzhak shamir and other government 
officials have accused the media of fueling nearly four months of 
violence in the occupied territories 
the army said journalists would be prosecuted if found violating 
the access ban which carries a maximum penalty of five years in 
jail 
lawrence grossman president of nbc news rejected the 
government view that a media presence had aggravated the problems 
there hasnt been a single killing of an arab when the cameras 
are there grossman said in an interview with the jerusalem post 
he added that israel was putting itself in the least favorable 
imaginable position in view of south africas reputation in 
south africa police have the right to close an area to journalists 
at a moments notice 
israeli officials have been particularly sensitive about 
comparisons of israels treatment of palestinians with the 
treatment of blacks in south africa in that country the black 
majority has no voice in national affairs 
the order against the palestine press service signed by west 
bank commander maj gen amram mitzna and taped on the agencys 
door said the closure was necessary for maintaining public 
safety and public order 
army troops ordered agency staffers out of the office and placed 
two large padlocks on the doors in defiance the agency clamped on 
two padlocks of its own 
its a horrible day the army has now made the blackout in the 
occupied territories complete the agencys publisher ibrahim 
kareen told the ap he said four of his staffers have been 
arrested since unrest began dec 8 
the army has arrested more than a dozen arab journalists who 
have acted as interpreters for foreign reporters 
the order the first ever against the 11yearold agency was 
authorized under 1945 emergency regulations imposed by the british 
in preisrael palestine 
kareen said officials told him they were closing the agency in 
part because israel believed it received funding from the palestine 
liberation organization kareen denied plo funding and said the 
real reason for the closure was that his agency provided tips to 
journalists about palestinian deaths or injuries far more quickly 
than the army 
the supreme court heard 2 hours of arguments wednesday on an 
appeal from the foreign press association which sought a reversal 
of mondays order closing the occupied territories until early 
friday 
yisrael leshem an attorney for the association argued the 
closure order was a blow to freedom of the press and set a 
dangerous precedent 
if the army makes this condition now whats to stop them from 
banning coverage of any event leshem said he criticized as 
insufficient pool coverage arrangements offered to journalists who 
went in with an army escort 
a military officer argued the army arrangements actually helped 
reporters by protecting them from demonstrators 
although the closure order remained in effect robert slater 
president of the foreign press association said he considered the 
decision a great victory because the government was required to 
explain its decision 
we werent fighting for five minutes or 10 minutes in the 
territories slater said we were fighting for the principle 
this order sends a clear signal to the army that in the near future 
we should be permitted to enter the territories freely

president corazon aquino and military 
officials claimed a major victory over communist rebels wednesday 
after the capture of the rebel armys leader and the communist 
partys no 2 man 
romulo kintanar commander of the new peoples army and rafael 
baylosis secretarygeneral of the communist party of the 
philippines were captured in raids tuesday along with the rebel 
armys logistics officer and another highranking party member 
officials said 
mrs aquino hailed the arrests as happy news for our country 
and commended armed forces chief of staff gen renato de villa and 
other officers 
it clearly demonstrates that we have turned the tide and are 
winning the war against the communist insurgency she said the 
fact that they were arrested on the npas 19th anniversary attests 
to the admirable performance of our armed forces of the 
philippines i am elated and so is our citizenry 
the 24000strong npa is in its 20th year of a violent struggle 
for power the military was on a heightened state of alert in 
manila in anticipation of rebel attacks marking the anniversary 
kintanar had long been wanted by the military besides heading 
the npa he is widely believed to be the chief organizer of 
communist assassination squads known as sparrow units because 
of the swiftness of their attacks 
the squads have been blamed for killing more than 150 police 
officers and soldiers on manila streets since last year 
the rebels are now demoralized maj gen ramon montano 
philippine constabulary chief declared at a reception for retiring 
military officers 
montano said kintanar initially gave authorities a false name 
and it was not until much later that they realized who he really 
was 
the others arrested with him and baylosis were benjamin de vera 
the central committee member in charge of operations on mindanao 
island npa logistics officer napoleon manuel manuels wife inez 
kintanars wife gloria and marco palo a party liaison officer 
defense secretary fidel v ramos described the arrests as a 
big blow to the communists and attributed their capture to a 
unified and more efficient military 
but brig gen rodolfo biazon manilas military commander 
warned that the rebels were far from paralyzed 
it will disturb some of their programs biazon said but 
to say that this is defeat for the communist movement may not 
entirely be correct because we are fighting an idea and the idea 
is still there 
biazon said he expected more arrests soon 
brig gen honesto isleta a military spokesman said troops 
almost captured party chairman benito tiamzon isleta declined 
to elaborate 
the official philippine news agency said tiamzon had been tipped 
off about the arrests of his comrades in the manila suburb of san 
juan and was gone when troops arrived at his hideout in suburban 
quezon city

the younger brother of former 
president chun doohwan was arrested early thursday on corruption 
and embezzlement charges in connection with a multimilliondollar 
financial scandal prosecutors said 
court sources speaking on condition of anonymity said warrants 
for the arrest of chun kyunghwan and three of his aides and 
associates were issued shortly after midnight 
the warrants were executed later thursday 
thursdays arrests brought to nine the number of suspects in 
custody in the scandal involving the semiofficial saemaul 
development movement 
earlier five suspects including two of chun kyunghwans 
brothersinlaw were jailed tuesday on charges of embezzlement and 
fraudulent land sales 
all nine are either saemaul officials or former leading members 
of the nationwide organization 
prosecutors said the younger chun who led saemaul between 1981 
and 1987 embezzled at least 93 million and built up a fortune in 
land stocks and business interest 
senior prosecutor kang wonil who has headed the investigation 
said wednesday the younger chun would initially face six charges 
including corruption embezzlement tax evasion and violation of 
laws governing special economic and financial crimes 
if convicted chun faces punishments ranging from 10 years in 
prison to the death sentence 
we have enough evidence to incriminate them kang said after 
questioning the four men for more than 36 hours 
chun doohwan who has not been implicated in the scandal is on 
a private tour of the united states he met with president reagan 
at the white house last week 
opposition parties are demanding that he return to seoul 
immediately to explain his role in the scandal opposition leaders 
have charged that the former president was involved in the affair 
saemaul founded in 1971 to promote urban and rural development 
evolved into a powerful organization involved in activities ranging 
from building model communities to promoting urban cleanup 
campaigns 
prosecutors say the younger chun who was appointed to head the 
group by president chun in 1981 used his position to divert 
government and private donations sell influence and pressure 
businesses to make gifts of money land and stocks 
he resigned as saemaul chief in 1987 after being linked to 
organized crime he fled to japan april 18 when news of the 
government probe surfaced but returned two days later to face 
questioning 
during the inquiry about 200 government officials and business 
leaders have been questioned about corruption and a possible 
coverup to protect former president chun and his family none of 
them has been formally implicated 
however prosecution sources said wednesday night that more 
people might be charged 
the chun administration has long been suspected of widespread 
corruption but during its authoritarian administration criticism 
of the president and his family were not tolerated and allegations 
of corruption were routinely ignored 
president roh taewoo who took power feb 25 is thought to 
have supported the saemaul investigation to discredit the former 
president and end his attempts to retain power and influence within 
the government 
some chun royalists were purged from the governing democratic 
justice party earlier this month and roh blocked the former 
presidents attempts to retain substantial power as a government 
adviser 
roh a former general who helped put chun in power with military 
backing in 1980 promised during the presidential election campaign 
last year to root out and end official corruption

orders to us factories for manufactured 
goods fell for the second month in a row in february but analysts 
said the 08 percent decline was not a cause for alarm 
the commerce department said wednesday that orders for durable 
and nondurable goods dropped to a seasonally adjusted 21086 
billion last month following a 06 percent decline in january 
the february setback was the biggest since a 14 percent drop 
last august and marked the first time that factory orders have 
fallen for two consecutive months since the summer of 1986 
economists said the declines showed that businesses did cut back 
on orders in the early part of the year in an effort to trim high 
levels of unsold goods that had built up in the final three months 
of 1987 
while this process will dampen growth economists said it 
appeared that the cutbacks had been moderate and would set the 
stage for faster growth in the months ahead 
the economy is expanding at a moderate pace we are not 
looking for either a boom or a bust said bruce steinberg an 
economist with merrill lynch in new york although we had 
declines in orders in the past two months those declines came off 
a very high level of demand in the fourth quarter 
even with the two months of declines total factory orders were 
83 percent higher than a year earlier reflecting the strong 
growth in manufacturing demand in 1987 analysts also noted that 
the backlog of unfilled orders continued to grow in february 
rising by 08 percent to 4123 billion indicating production will 
have to remain high to fill those orders 
economists expect manufacturing to be one of the major sources 
of strength for the economy this year as american companies 
continue to benefit from a weaker dollar which has made their 
products competitive again on world markets 
this export boom is expected to spur us companies to boost 
their investment spending plans for new plant and equipment 
further adding to overall economic growth 
however the february report said the key category of 
nondefense capital goods fell 39 percent although the sector was 
still 23 percent higher than a year ago this category is 
considered a good gauge of business spending plans on capital 
equipment 
jerry jasinowski chief economist for the national association 
of manufacturers said the weakness in stock prices and fears about 
higher inflation rates may be causing some companies to lower their 
investment spending somewhat 
the february decline in factory orders included a drop of 11 
percent in orders for durable goods these items expected to last 
three or more years fell to a seasonally adjusted 1185 billion

treasury secretary james a baker iii told 
congress on wednesday that he strongly disagrees with proposals to 
forgive some of the third worlds debt now over 1 trillion 
i believe this path leads both debtors and creditors off the 
cliff he said this approach would irreparably politicize the 
debt problem 
forgiveness would distract both debtors and creditors from the 
need to make reforms encourage repudiation of debt and shift the 
risk on bank loans to taxpayers including us taxpayers he added 
i simply cannot endorse such schemes he told the senate 
appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations 
he argued for a us contribution to increase the capital of the 
world bank the largest single source of aid loans to third world 
countries he said pulling out of the world bank or the 
interamerican development bank as some critics have suggested 
would reduce us influence and make it more likely that they would 
act contrary to us interests 
but he said the reagan administration would not ask congress for 
money to bring the united states up to date in the year beginning 
sept 30 on its arrears in payments to the world bank he said west 
germany kuwait and saudi arabia had reduced their contributions 
because of the us shortfalls and he was sorry about that 
he promised that the reagan administration before it leaves 
office will ask that the money be furnished in the 12 months 
following oct 1 1989 
rep david r obey dwis told secretary of state george p 
shultz earlier this month that the arrears should be paid before a 
new contribution is sought obey chairman of the house 
appropriations foreign operations subcommittee predicted there 
will be trouble in congress for the administrations request 
baker said the administration will not ask for new contributions 
to the interamerican development bank until the borrowing 
countries which now control lending give the us government 
greater power over new loans 
during bakers testimony sen don nickles rokla complained 
of the banks internal spending he said it 
recently moved into one of the most expensive new buildings in 
washington at a cost of 225 million 
spent an average of more than 100000 each on separation pay 
for departing employees 
had an average of 35 claims a year on its health insurance for 
each employee 
we agree thats the kind of thing that has to be cleaned up 
baker said but did not confirm nickles figures 
baker clashed with sen daniel k inouye dhawaii chairman of 
the subcommittee over plans to help other countries refinance as 
much as 16 billion owed to the united states for weapons and other 
military aid inouye said regulations proposed by the treassury 
could add as much as two percentage points to borrowers costs 
about 5 billion worth of israels debts would be affected and 
the high cost of refinancing might discourage other countries from 
using the plan inouye said

armenians threatened to continue a general strike 
paralyzing the main city of a disputed southern region until the 
government agreed to make the region part of aremenia newspapers 
reported wednesday 
for the first time an official soviet newspaper komsomolskaya 
pravda used the word strike to describe what was previously 
was referred to as truancy or absenteeism in stepanakert the 
central city of azerbaijans nagornokarabakh region 
the soviet press generally uses the word strike only to 
describe labor unrest in the west but komsomolskaya pravda the 
organ of the youth organization komsomol took advantage of soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachevs drive for openness to break from 
tradition 
the daily also provided the first official confirmation that the 
strike was part of a series of labor protests in stepanakert and 
that the walkout started march 24 not saturday as other newspapers 
have indicated 
all but essential services such as bakeries and dairies some 
public transportation and medical clinics were reported to be shut 
down in stepanakert a city of more than 33000 people the 
government has lost millions of rubles in revenue because of the 
strike newspapers said 
were only two or three steps from catastrophe vasily 
atadzhanyan the director of a shoe factory told komsomolskaya 
pravda we will pay huge fines for not fulfilling our obligations 
to our customers we say directly not coming to work is 
sabotage 
only about 120 of 1500 workers showed up for work monday at the 
shoe factory the newspaper said 
people are sitting home without noise and without 
demonstrations said a man answering the telephone at the 
official newspaper in stepanakert sovietsky karabakh people say 
they are going to stay away until they get a decision from the 
government in their favor 
the communist party newspaper pravda said many stepanakert 
residents were upset that soviet newspapers were not accurately 
reporting the dispute 
we want everyone to know the truth the absences from work 
will continue until our matter is settled pravda quoted one 
resident as saying 
early press coverage claimed that armenians who are mostly 
christian and azerbaijanis who are mostly shiite moslem live 
together in harmony it blamed the unrest in which at least 32 
people have died on a few extremists 
authorities have been meeting with residents to urge them to 
return to their jobs and vowed not to bow to pressure to annex 
predominantly armenian nagornokarabakh to armenia 
instead authorities have unveiled a plan to spend up to 400 
million rubles or 640 million to improve social and economic 
conditions in the aremeniandominated region 
the labor newspaper trud said people in stepanakert were 
grateful for the governments efforts but that some still believed 
it was necessary to stay away from work to press their demand 
the newspaper sovietskaya rossiya said about 100 specialists and 
workers appeared for work at an electricaltechnical factory 
tuesday morning 
ninety percent of the workers at a plant manufacturing 
construction materials appeared at work monday morning only to 
walk out en masse komsomolskaya pravda said 
armenians began mass street rallies and strikes in stepanakert 
on feb 13 the turmoil spread to the capital of the armenian 
republic yerevan on feb 28 ethnic rioting broke out in sumgait 
a industrial city in azerbaijan and officials said 26 armenians 
and six azerbaijanis were killed

a federal law aimed at encouraging chastity 
among teenagers provides money to religious groups that in one 
instance advised young girls to pretend that jesus is their 
date the supreme court was told wednesday 
were not saying that chastity cannot be a secular value but 
it has been misused by religious groups funded under the 1981 
law argued janet benshoof an american civil liberties union 
lawyer 
as a result she contended the law unconstitutionally promotes 
religion 
but the reagan administrations topranked courtroom lawyer 
defended the law 
solicitor general charles fried conceded that there may have 
been some departures from past supreme court rulings on 
churchstate relations by some private organizations carrying out 
the laws purpose but he said such constitutionally 
troublesome spending of federal money has been corrected and 
that the law can be carried out in a constitutionally acceptable 
way 
the law known as the adolescent family life act was passed by 
congress in response to grave social economic and health costs 
of earlyadolescent pregnancy fried said 
he noted that religiously affiliated groups for years have 
participated in government programs dealing with juvenile 
delinquency foster care adoption and drug prevention 
the disputed law sponsored by former sen jeremiah denton 
rala and ushered through congress by fellow conservatives 
provided millions of dollars for three general program categories 
care prevention and research 
care services include pregnancy testing maternity 
counseling adoption and referral help 
prevention services are those aimed at discouraging 
adolescent sexual relations and include programs offering 
counseling and family planning 
the law requires applicants for funding to describe how in 
providing services they will involve religious and charitable 
organizations voluntary associations and other groups in the 
private sector 
the law also allows religiously affiliated organizations to 
receive money for such programs 
a federal judge here struck down the law last year ruling that 
its primary effect is to promote religion and that it fosters an 
excessive entanglement between government and religion 
the administration then asked the supreme court to salvage the 
law the justices are expected to announce their decision by july 
benshoof acknowledged that federal money may be used to cope 
with the problem of teenage pregnancies more than 1 million 
unmarried girls become pregnant each year and about half obtain 
abortions 
but the aclu lawyer added that the 1981 envisions a 
constitutionally suspect union between government and religion 
not once in seven years has the department of health and 
human services questioned the religiousity of any institution 
receiving aid under the law benshoof contended 
when justice antonin scalia asked whether congress could spend 
money to encourage selfrestraint by teenagers benshoof said 
groups receiving the money cant do it by telling young girls to 
pretend that jesus is their date 
the aclu says a virginia organization that received 150000 
under the law offered such advice

wheat farmers should be provided with some 
kind of incentive to sell grain on the open market rather than have 
to forfeit it to the government when price support loans come due 
the national association of wheat growers said wednesday 
frank johannsen association president said wheat farmers 
deserve the same kind of consideration given corn producers who are 
being allowed to keep their grain under federal price support for 
an additional year 
that was a reference to agriculture secretary richard e lyngs 
announcement tuesday that price support loans for some oldcrop 
corn and sorghum will be extended a year longer than their normal 
maturity dates 
johannsen a bayard neb wheat farmers said in a statement 
released here that the association is seeking a way to encourage 
growers to settle their maturing loans by paying them off with 
generic certificates the certificates are issued by usda as 
paymentinkind under crop programs and can be exchanged for 
surplus commodities owned by the departments commondity credit 
corp 
if the price support loans are not repaid a farmer must forfeit 
the grain to the ccc which cancels the debt 
once the ccc takes over the grain it must be moved into 
government storage much of the ccc wheat is currently being sold 
back into the market in weekly auctions 
since current estimates are that it costs the government at 
least 20 cents a bushel to move store catalog and exchange 
forfeited wheat through weekly auctions our proposal wont cost 
anything extra and it will reduce some of the governments 
logistical problems johannsen said it has the added benefit 
of keeping wheat moving in the pipeline of our muchimproved 
market 
besides he said grain farmers have a right to expect 
evenhanded treatment from the department forcing farmers to 
forfeit their loans only broadens the governments role in 
markets

ammunition arab witnesses said

the republican party with frontrunning 
george bush as its likely presidential nominee now that his chief 
rival bob dole is out of the race turned to platform matters and 
focused on foreign policy as it opened hearings wednesday 
at the end of the carter years the united states was weaker 
and soviet relations were strained jeane j kirkpatrick a 
former us ambassador to the united nations told a gop panel at 
the start of the first of three 1988 national platform hearings 
at the end of ronald reagans presidency the united states is 
stronger and relations with the soviets are stronger said mrs 
kirkpatrick 
wednesdays session on foreign policy matters will be followed 
by hearings in kansas city mo on may 31 and los angeles on june 
30 in advance of the gop national convention in new orleans aug 
1518 where a platform will be produced 
the may session will focus on education child care and 
neighborhood development matters while the june hearing will 
concentrate on economic growth 
vice president bush is leading the gop presidential delegate 
race dole a senator from kansas who had been his main challenger 
in the early primaries and caucuses withdrew from the contest on 
tuesday leaving pat robertson still running but far behind bush 
mrs kirkpatrick who provided a foreign policy overview at the 
platform hearing said the most important accomplishment of the 
reagan administration has been to demonstrate through domestic 
and foreign policy the power of freedom 
she said progress has been made during reagans tenure in 
rebuilding american military forces and bringing terrorists to 
justice she added that progress also has been achieved in 
ussoviet relations 
former reagan administration officials thinktank 
representatives and members of congress testified before the 
republican platform committee panel on what they saw as the

an adviser to jesse jackson said wednesday he 
detected the beginnings of an anonymous stop jackson movement 
in the democratic party and a southern party chairman acknowledged 
there is an awful lot of apprehension out there about the 
possibility of jacksons nomination 
democratic establishment leaders gathered here with jackson and 
after that meeting jackson supporter rep mickey leland of texas 
said he understood an effort to stop jackson was afoot 
leland said he did not know who was behind the attempt and said 
he knew of no party leaders joining such a movement but he said it 
did not appear to be confined to southern white democrats 
there is some movement afoot leland said we cant put 
our hands on it we dont know who the leader is but we do 
understand different players of the democratic party have been 
approached 
he named democratic national chairman paul kirk and house 
speaker jim wright as among those approached contacted later kirk 
and a spokesman for wright said no one had talked to them about 
keeping the nomination away from jackson 
i havent talked to anyone and no ones approached me said 
kirk who earlier this week rejected talk of a movement to block 
jackson 
although jackson fell substantially behind michael dukakis in 
connecticuts primary tuesday his 2to1 victory in michigan on 
saturday has forced democratic leaders to confront the possibility 
that jackson could end the primary season as top vote getter and 
perhaps delegate leader 
in recognition of that a group representing the top ranks of 
washingtons oldline democratic establishment including 
presidential adviser clark clifford former party chairman john 
white and onetime mondale aide richard moe met with jackson over 
breakfast at a downtown hotel 
they came away praising jackson and insisting they wouldnt be 
party to any effort to block him 
i dont think there will be at this particular time 
especially from the south a stop jesse jackson movement said 
charles whitehead state democratic party chairman from florida 
after the session 
whitehead acknowledged widespread concern among democrats about 
the prospect of jackson winning the nomination however in the 
wake of michigan some democrats have privately voiced the fear 
that the liberal black jackson could prove an unelectable nominee 
in the fall and damage other democratic candidates 
i would be less than honest with you if i didnt tell you 
there is absolutely an awful lot of apprehension out there among an 
awful lot of democrats about the nomination of jesse jackson 
whitehead said sure there is 
theyre afraid of nominating someone that they consider 
unelectable he said 
but whitehead whose state primary was won by dukakis the 
massachusetts governor said there was that same apprehension 
about nominating an eastern liberal 
youve got a fear there if you nominate an eastern liberal 
youve nominated another walter mondale who lost 49 states as 
the 1984 nominee he said 
most democratic party insiders have said this week that any 
public effort to block jackson would be damaging and alienate 
blacks and other voters the party will need in the fall no matter 
who the nominee is you cant win with him and cant win without 
him one political source said speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
another source close to democratic party politics said concerns 
among party leaders had eased with the connecticut vote following 
two days of gnashing of teeth 
he said a feeling was growing that jackson was strengthening the 
party with new voters and that they should not be discouraged by 
suggestions jackson would be denied the nomination but he 
contended the remaining calender of bigstate primaries decreases 
the likelihood jackson would end up with the most delegates 
fueling talk of a stopjackson effort was a campaign begun this 
week by alabama democratic chairman john baker he suggested in a 
letter to party leaders around the south that they form a group of 
unpledged convention delegates who will commit themselves to the

vice president george bush moving quickly 
to put distance between himself and the controversy surrounding 
attorney general edwin meese iii said wednesday the justice 
department has to be above reproach 
bush said he was troubled by the resignation of top justice 
department officials but im not going to pass judgment on 
whether meese should resign 
the republican presidential candidate in a statement devoid of 
any support for the embattled attorney general said meese must 
make up his own mind on quitting 
bush said meese would not hold the top law enforcement post in a 
bush administration 
campaigning for the first day without a major gop rival bush 
was peppered by reporters with questions on the meese controversy 
two top justice department officials quit on tuesday amid 
reports of meeses mounting legal difficulties 
clearly eager to keep the matter from becoming a campaign issue 
bush told reporters morale in the justice department is very 
important 
it seems to me that the justice department has to be above 
reproachpropriety he said 
speaking for himself bush said i want to hold an ethical 
standard so high that theres no perception of wrongdoing 
asked whether meese would be attorney general in a bush 
administration the vice president said no nor would any other 
member of the reagan cabinet because i want to have a new 
cabinet 
when a reporter suggested that bushs position on whether meese 
should resign remained unclear bush responded thats what i 
intend 
he also said he didnt think the affair would rub off on his 
campaign but suggested im sure my opponents will try to use 
it 
im not going to prejudge mr meese id like to find out a 
little more about what is happening here bush said 
meanwhile bush told a lunchtime rally that it didnt matter to 
him which candidate the democrats finally nominate 
i will take on whoever the democrats put up he said 
as to whether republicans would prefer running against democrat 
jesse jackson rather than michael dukakis bush said i dont 
plan to get in there and finetune whats happening on the 
democratic side 
bush wrapped up three days of campaigning in wisconsin during 
his visit he picked up the endorsement of former rivals rep jack 
kemp and sen bob dole quit the race giving him a virtual lock on 
the gop nomination 
bush aides said the vice president would skip a visit back to 
wisconsin that had been tentatively planned for monday so he can 
focus his attention on consolidating his support and planning 
future campaign appearances 
spokesman pete teeley said dole who withdrew from the gop race 
on tuesday was expected to make campaign appearances on bushs 
behalf but specifics had not been worked out

a french jet fighter crashed and 
exploded wednesday near a nuclear power plant but officials said 
the facility could have withstood the force of the impact if the 
plane had hit it 
the pilot of the mirage jet fighter was killed when his plane 
went down at 920 am about a mile from the isar plant at the 
bavarian village of ohu 
federal and state officials said the concrete domes covering 
west german nuclear plants are strong enough to withstand a direct 
hit from a plummeting airliner so there was no risk of a nuclear 
accident 
there was no danger at the power plant said edith volz a 
spokeswoman for the staterun bavarian utilities in munich the 
complex is protected by heavy concrete walls and the reactors are 
safe from plane crashes 
the mirage burst into flames and exploded on impact spreading 
debris over a wide area police said 
the fighter took off from the strasbourgentzheim air base 
outside of strasbourg france and was on a totally routine 
lowaltitude mission according to a french air force spokesman 
who spoke on condition of anonymity in keeping with defense 
ministry regulations 
the french defense ministry identified the pilot as lt thierry 
millet 26 and said he was not flying unusually low or close to a 
nuclear facility 
france has military forces based in west germany and its 
military aircraft frequently fly training missions over west german 
territory 
antinuclear activists used the incident to renew criticism of 
atomic power plants and of lowlevel military flights that are 
common over bavaria 
opposition social democrats in bavaria said they would bring the 
matter up for debate in the states parliament 
this is proof that the authorities have underestimated the 
dangers posed by military training flights said dietmar franzke 
a social democratic state delegate 
the plant at ohu is an 870megawatt isar i reactor which began 
producing electricity in 1977 isar ii a 1300megawatt reactor 
that is also located in the area is not yet on line officials 
said 
military aircraft are barred from flying over nuclear power 
plants according to alfons metzger a spokesman for the bavarian 
interior ministry 
in bonn defense ministry officials said there were no signs 
indicating the french pilot had failed to adhere to those 
regulations

exiled stage director yuri lyubimov expressed his 
desire to return to the soviet union in an unusual newspaper 
interview that could signal official willingness to allow him to 
come back 
lyubimov was interviewed by the government newspaper izvestia in 
madrid where he viewed four perfomances by moscows taganka 
theater of maxim gorkys mother 
lyubimov 70 founded the taganka theater and over 20 years 
turned it into moscows most popular modern theater with his 
avantgarde productions 
the director struggled constantly with censors in july 1983 he 
was allowed to travel to london to stage fyodor dostoyevskys 
crime and punishment amid speculation authorities did not want 
him to return 
in march 1984 he was thrown out of the communist party and four 
months later his soviet citizenship was revoked 
lyubimov has staged productions around the world since then he 
took israeli citizenship this year and has moved to jerusalem with 
his wife katalin and son peter he is almost never mentioned in 
the official press 
in its article on tuesday izvestia stressed that soviet writers 
and artists have more freedom under mikhail s gorbachevs reforms 
in a possible effort to show the differences between lyubimov and 
authorities have narrowed enough to allow him to return 
lyubimov reiterated his previous statement that he would like to 
return to work in the soviet union if he were guaranteed artistic 
freedom but that he was making no political demands 
we are talking only about the creative side of my life he 
was quoted as saying 
after more than four years abroad in order to once again gain 
strength survive one needs to stand on his native land on which 
he was raised where his fathers and grandfathers lived lyubimov 
said 
even while he has been exiled he told the newspaper he has 
concentrated on staging productions that acquaint the world with 
russian culture 
he praised the more open literature that is being published 
under gorbachevs policy of glasnost and said it is necessary 
to come to see and to work in the theater 
on year ago lyubimov and a group of other exiled scientists and 
artists wrote an open letter expressing their doubts about 
gorbachevs reforms calling the soviet union a gravely sick 
country 
the letter was printed by the weekly moscow news and the 
writers were criticized bitterly in the official media which 
accused them of wishing evil on their native land 
izvestia reported that tagankas current director nikolai 
gubenko who also was present at the interview said the theater 
wants lyubimov to return and see what it is doing after that he 
himself can decide his fate gubenko was quoted as saying 
lyubimov was quoted as saying his meetings in madrid with 
taganka actors he once directed were good and difficult at the 
same time

sen bob dole said wednesday that his failed 
presidential campaign had made serious tactical mistakes but added 
that they werent the main reason for his downfall 
in an interview a day after he quit the presidential race the 
kansas republican expressed some of his frustrations over his 
unsuccessful battle with vice president george bush for the gop 
nomination 
the bottom line is that you cant beat ronald reagan dole 
said i was running against ronald reagan jr in the south 
that was a reference to bushs success in campaigning as 
reagans vice president and logical heir its just this 
promotion idea that you just ought to go up the ladder dole said 
he also said republican party winnertakeall rules in the 
primaries and caucuses contributed to his exit from the campaign 
if delegates were divided proportionally he said id still 
be in the race 
asked the one thing he would do differently in his campaign 
dole replied keep the press off the plane 
he complained that reporters on the campaign plane sit back 
there and they scheme up these little things and the next thing 
theyre in time or newsweek 
dole said he thought he had received some unfair news coverage 
during the campaign for example he singled out the numerous 
stories written about one of his kansas associates dave owen who 
resigned as national finance chairman of the dole campaign in 
january after reports raised questions involving his financial 
dealings 
but apart from all that dole said that his campaign 
organization had blundered particularly in new hampshire and south 
carolina and that those mistakes weakened his candidacy early in 
the nominating process 
for example he did not respond to lastminute new hampshire 
television ads by bush raising questions whether dole cowld 
increase taxes in addition his campaign spent heavily early in 
the nominating process which caused problems in later contests 
south carolina we probably should have bypassed instead of 
getting in there said dole 
bushs win in south carolina he maintained delivered a boost 
to the vice president and helped him sweep the super tuesday 
primaries that followed in the south including north carolina 
missouri and oklahoma states the dole campaign had hoped to win 
now had we won new hampshire we still would have had a tough 
race dole said 
illinois was the next battleground after super tuesday and dole 
said i knew that we werent going to win illinois and i knew 
then it was probably over 
he said many of his friends and advisers urged him to remain in 
the presidential race even when it appeared he had almost no chance 
to win the nomination 
you cant do it unless youve got the money said dole 
the campaign he said would end with a little debt but he 
said he didnt know the exact amount 
overall dole said he was pleased with the fundraising ability 
of his campaign and said he had good organizations in a number of 
states 
but he expressed reservations about the management of the 
campaign saying i think as far as organization im not certain 
whether we had enough direction 
dole did not criticize william brock his campaign chairman who 
directed the operation but said the national political director 
norman watts i dont believe was strong enough

james and suzy are having a tiff and to the 
delight of gossiploving new yorkers theyre having it out in 
public in the columns they write for new york newsday and the new 
york post 
it began last week when james thats james revson newsdays 
new society columnist wrote that he felt cheated and used by 
suzy who wrote in the post about a party she did not attend 
what specifically bothered revson one of the revsons of revlon 
cosmetics fame was that suzy mentioned 32 people who supposedly 
were at the party but only 12 of whom actually showed up 
suzy was on vacation on the sunswept isle of mustique when 
both her column and revsons appeared but by wednesday she was 
back and suzy thats just plain suzy to you aileen mehle to her 
friends was furious 
in a column that combined the tact of joan rivers with the 
politesse of sean penn suzy called revson a liar a rat a 
knownothing a nut a jerk and a snake among 
other things 
to be sure suzy admitted she had written about the party 
thrown by metropolitan museum chairman and new york times 
publisher arthur punch sulzberger in advance she said it was 
the only way she could get out of town for her vacation which was 
heaven 
and yes she said its true that some of the people she said 
were at the party never did show up 
and yes i should have yanked the whole thing or at least the 
names the press release said would attend 
but is she apologizing not a chance 
i bow in accuracy and meticulousness and decency to no one 
she wrote that is the reason i have survived as a star all these 
long years that and because in my field i am the best and the 
brightest there is 
and dear readers fans and publicityseekers i would like to 
go on record as telling the world that any place rat revson is i 
will not be do not invite me anywhere if you invite him just call 
it a boycott or even a suzycott 
the target of the suzycott says he is unimpressed im not 
joining it he said i refuse to join it even if she asks me 
revson said he thought suzys column showed a certain lack of 
restraint on her part i didnt know that a lady knew those 
words or how to spell them 
on a serious note he added columnists are journalists 
columnists are reporters and there are ethics and nobody is 
allowed to break those 
is he worried about the effect of the suzy controversy on his 
fledgling column 
im delighted said revson obviously holding to the theory 
that any publicity is good publicity the next time i see her i 
may buy her a drink

a city fire investigator wednesday said that 
three cubans who died battling a blaze at their consulate might 
have been saved if firefighters hadnt been kept outside the 
building for 15 minutes 
investigator jacques plouffe criticized the cuban consulate for 
not informing the fire department of tuesdays fire 
we might have saved three lives he said 
havana radio monitored in miami identified the dead as pablo 
gonzalez martinez 35 an official at the trade office norma 
goderich 33 wife of a viceconsul and jose perez salbaluco 35 
a consulate guard 
they died fighting the blaze which apparently started on top 
floor of the fourstory mansion 
the blaze took 100 firefighters more than three hours to bring 
under control its cause was under investigation 
authorities first learned of the blaze when security guards at a 
nearby luxury apartment building reported smoke coming from the 
consulate roof 
firefighters then rushed to the consulate but were held back for 
about 15 minutes before they were allowed to enter the building 
located on the slopes of mount royal 
by the time they got in the fire was out of control 
we had a little trouble getting in because there was nobody to 
answer the door said the district fire chief guy lafortune who 
arrived about 730 pm they werent expecting us because nobody 
at the consulate had called an alarm and everybody in the 
building was upstairs fighting the fire 
under the 1963 vienna convention authorities of the host 
country such as police and firefighters cannot enter consular 
premises without permission 
consulgeneral lourdes urrutia only let the firefighters in 
after she received permission from cuban officials in ottawa 
lafortune said the firefighters were allowed to fight the blaze 
on condition that they did not enter certain areas of the building 
men were stationed at certain doors to keep us away there was 
no fire in those areas said lafortune 
lafortune said his men had a hard time fighting the flames 
because every window on the fourth floor was either barred or 
heavily shuttered and nailed closed 
he said he saw about a dozen guns of various kinds on the walls 
inside 
firefighters said it was easier to get into the cuban consulate 
than into the nearby soviet consulate when it caught fire in 
january 1987 soviet officials tried to put out that fire with 
buckets of snow and a garden hose before firefighters were let in 
in 1972 when the cuban trade commission in the north end was 
firebombed and one cuban was killed cubans held firefighters and 
police off with submachine guns 
and in 1954 the soviet embassy in ottawa burned to the ground 
after officials refused to allow firefighters to fight the fire 
investigator plouffe said it took him and his partner armand 
villette about 25 minutes to gain entry to the building wednesday 
to retrieve some tools

a rabies outbreak in nearby chester county 
has prompted health officials to warn residents to avoid wild 
animals and take extra measures to protect pets and farm animals 
the problem is big and it is growing harold russell chief 
veterinarian for the county health department said tuesday what 
we are seeing is the tip of a very massive iceberg eastern parts 
of chester county are some 20 miles west of philadelphia 
he warned the rabies virus which last week forced officials to 
kill a horse is likely to spread into philadelphia especially 
among raccoons in the citys sprawling fairmount park 
a total of 23 rabies cases have been confirmed in chester county 
this year compared to 36 in all of 1987 said ruthie ketterer 
secretary for the state health departments acute infectious 
disease division 
lancaster county the next county west of chester has reported 
37 cases the total for the state for 1988 is 101 ketterer said 
dr robert sharrar director of philadelphias office of health 
promotion and disease control said wednesday the city was 
monitoring the rabies situation in chester county and surrounding 
counties and states 
the last known case of human rabies in philadelphia was in 1938 
and the last case in a dog was 1948 he said health officials 
declared the city rabies free in 1975 but would revoke that 
designation at the first rabies case and recommend rabies treatment 
for anyone bitten by dogs or cats thereafter he said 
rabies is a viral disease that attacks the brain and is almost 
always fatal a vaccine for humans and dogs was developed by louis 
pasteur in the 1880s and scientists are working to develop an oral 
vaccine which would work when eaten by wild animals

sen paul simon entering territory staked 
out by fellow democratic presidential candidate jesse jackson 
stood in front of a chrysler corp plant wednesday and declared he 
is more qualified to take workers concerns to the white house 
when asked whether he has hesitated criticizing jackson for fear 
of offending black voters simon said you have to be careful 
you dont want to be perceived as antiblack but he added i 
dont have problems running against anyone 
im not here knocking others simon said but i think 
experience is one of the things you should look at 
jackson had led an emotional rally earlier this year at the auto 
plant where 5500 workers are scheduled to be laid off by the end 
of september jacksons support for the workers and his call to end 
economic violence won him the endorsement of the united auto 
workers union local 72 
simon at a news conference next to the plant said he has a 
similar message plus the congressional experience to translate it 
into action 
i have been fighting for workers policies on the washington 
scene not just with speeches simon said i offer not only 
passion but programs 
simon who won the march 15 illinois primary is campaigning for 
support in wisconsins primary april 5 im going to do well in 
wisconsin he said and were going on to atlanta site of 
the democratic national convention july 1821 
about 20 simon supporters were on hand for the news conference 
along with some auto workers 
i think he is speaking for the workers as well as jackson 
said bill seep an employee of the plant 
another employee phil haney said he expected the workers to 
stay unified behind jackson though he added some might choose 
simon when they cast their ballots you cant fault anyone who 
votes for simon he said 
simon said he would try to rebuild the countrys manufacturing 
base by removing tax breaks for companies that move jobs overseas 
and by giving corporations incentives to boost production in the 
united states 
he added that he came to kenosha because of this plant and 
what it represents what we have had is an administration that has 
elevated and sanctified greed 
he accused chrysler of deciding to halt production without 
giving enough consideration to the impact on the workers and the 
community

some unification church members are upset 
because their church founder the rev sun myung moon believes one 
of his followers from zimbabwe is the reincarnation of his son 
according to a report published wednesday 
the affair began last fall at the unification theological 
seminary in upstate new york where a senior named charles was 
believed to be hearing and relaying messages from moons deceased 
son lord heung jin nim the washington post said quoting 
former and present church members 
heung jin nim was killed in an automobile accident in 1984 at 
age 17 
according to the post account 
dick richard a former seminary student who recently left the 
church said that in midnovember i was told there was a black 
brother from africa who had been prepared by jesus and that 
heung jin nim had assumed his body 
it obviously scared a lot of people there but they went 
along with the whole thing because it came from reverend moon the 
messiah 
the reincarnation incident has caused what some followers of 
moon are calling the biggest theological upheaval in the 34year 
history of the unification church in part because the zimbabwean 
reportedly has been slapping church members and elders 
officials at the washington times which is owned by church 
members have tried to distance themselves from the affair 
from the bottom of my navel i dont want to know about 
this said ron godwin the times senior vice president for 
business i know that such a person exists and that hes been 
preaching in the church but i will walk a mile not to get 
involved 
arnaud de borchgrave chief editor of the times at first 
dismissed the young zimbabwean as a plant from communist north 
korea 
the north koreans have had a very strong presence in zimbabwe 
since day one de borchgrave said in an interview from paris 
it just sounds so ridiculous de borchgrave said the 
nameless zimbabwean that strikes me as suspicious right there 
ive asked people who the hell is this zimbabwean and 
nobody can tell you 
john rees coowner with de borchgrave of a private intelligence 
newsletter early warning said de borchgraves attitude was 
primarily one of concern that it would make the paper look 
ludicrous 
the zimbabwean who has taken the name of heung jin nim has 
been traveling to church parishes around the world preaching 
this guy talks nonstop said john raineri a photographer 
for the world and i sister publication to the times ive seen 
him speak for three days straight he doesnt rest the whole time 
one of the most disturbing aspects of the affair church members 
say is violence attributed to the zimbabwean 
the president of the times bo hi pak was admitted to 
georgetown univeristy hospital for tests last dec 917 saying he 
had recently fallen down a flight of stairs no injuries were 
found but later pak underwent surgery in south korea to repair a 
damaged blood vessel in his skull according to times executives 
pak is moons closest deputy and stories that he had been 
injured spread quickly through the church kate tsubata a church 
member was skeptical until she heard a church elder describe a 
meeting in which moon was asked about the reincarnated sons 
reported violence 
the elder said that even colonel pak had been beaten 
tsubata said he just let it drop it was quite significant 
tsubata spoke of a friend who was slapped repeatedly by the 
zimbabwean he described them as stinging slaps to the face 
causing him to see stars she said but afterwards he felt 
good 
gordon anderson secretarygeneral of the moonfinanced 
professors world peace academy reported similar behavior during a 
church ceremony in the world missions center in manhattan the 
zimbabwean walked among the 100 church members present listening 
to their confessions and instructing them to repent usually 
through prayers or fasting 
he did slap but he didnt strike hard enough to hurt anyone 
he cuffed me on the ear a little bit anderson said

the senate foreign relations committee 
recommended overwhelmingly wednesday that the senate ratify a 
historic treaty to eliminate all us and soviet mediumrange 
nuclear weapons 
this is a small step away from the nuclear brink said sen 
alan cranston dcalif said following the committees 172 vote 
it means the elevator of nuclear escalation will finally stop 
and hopefully descend said committee chairman claiborne pell 
dri 
cranston said his head count shows no more than five senators 
will vote against the intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty when 
the full senate takes up the treaty probably late next month 
ratification requires a twothirds senate majority 67 votes if all 
100 senators are present and voting 
the only dissenting votes inside the committee were cast by 
sens jesse helms rnc and larry pressler rsd helms has 
worked vigorously to derail the treaty 
the resounding committee vote papered over a bitter partisan 
dispute over an amendment added to the treaty on tuesday with the 
aim of assuring that the meaning of the pact cannot be 
reinterpreted by a future president without the consent of congress 
many moderate republicans said the amendment represented a 
partisan jab at president reagan and his administrations 
reinterpretation of the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty to 
permit the deployment of a star wars missile defense system 
several gop lawmakers said the controversy may cause them to 
reassess their support of the treaty and cranston said he may be 
willing to search for a compromise when the senate debates the 
issue 
the treaty signed dec 8 by president reagan and soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev requires both sides to destroy within three 
years all nucleararmed missiles with a range of 300 miles to 
3400 miles 
these include all soviet ss20 and other medium and 
shorterrange missiles aimed at targets in western europe and all 
of the smaller force of us pershing 2 and groundlaunched cruise 
missiles stationed in europe and aimed at the soviet union 
the treaty is the first accord in the history of arms control to 
require the actual destruction of the missiles that carry nuclear 
warheads and it is the first to require onsite inspection to 
verify compliance with its terms 
the foreign relations committee voted after 21 days of hearings 
in which scores of expert witnesses testified the senate 
intelligence and armed services committees also conducted an 
intense examination of the agreement and recommended it be adopted 
the latter voting its approval 182 
the armed services committee did express some lingering 
concerns and in final testimony on wednesday ambassador maynard 
glitman the chief us inf negotiator responded to them 
glitman said futuristic weapons such as lasers and particle 
beam generators are in fact banned by the treaty if they are 
carried on weapons delivery vehicles within the prohibited 
range 
the soviets the ambassador said understand that all future 
weapons systems falling within the criteria will be banned 
and if an unarmed mediumrange missile were to strike and 
destroy a target through impact alone it would be considered a 
weapon if it had been designed for that purpose he said 
later sen sam nunn dga the armed services chairman said 
glitmans statement had not resolved the issue and that he would 
seek a more definitive clarification during senate debate 
nunn said he might seek passage of an amendment to the treaty 
requiring the administration to obtain a specific statement from 
the soviets acknowledging that they had agreed not to produce 
deploy or flight test futuristic mediumrange weapons 
pell told a news conference this issue is one of several hurdles 
facing the treaty on the senate floor he said he is hopeful all 
obstacles can be overcome and the treaty ratified before reagans 
summit meeting with gorbachev in late may 
if it is not he said reagan will be embarrassed and in a 
weakened position to pursue the far more significant strategic arms 
reduction treaty aimed at cutting us and soviet intercontinental 
missile forces by up to 50 percent 
republican senators complained at length about the committees 
127 decision on tuesday to add the provision aimed at ensuring 
that administration testimony and official description of the 
treaty is authoritative and binding 
the provision says no future president can change the us 
interpretation of the treaty without congressional approval either 
by senate ratification of a new treaty or by the house and senate 
passing a separate law 
it very frankly may change my position in response to the 
treaty said sen rudy boschwitz rminn contending the measure 
was aimed at the strategic defense initiative and the 
administrations reinterpretation of the abm treaty 
cranston said the measure was worded to apply only to the inf 
treaty not to any other pact or to future accords 
but boschwitz insisted it was politically motivated i think 
we are making a great mistake it weakens the value of the treaty 
very substantially i would hope that on the floor of the senate we 
would be able to remove this provision 
pressler called the amendment mischievous and partisan 
it will lead to the defeat of this treaty entirely because 
with it the votes arent there he said

the new executives of united press 
international said wednesday that they intend to turn the 
deficitplagued news service into a profitmaking organization 
within two years by eliminating about 150 jobs focusing on 
business news and embarking on joint electronic ventures 
therell be no liquidation of upi declared chairman earl w 
brian 
president paul steinle said upi will remain a fullservice 
24houraday sevendayaweek worldwide supplier of news and 
information 
the two executives who gained operating control of upi from 
mexican publisher mario vazquez rana on feb 19 said they were 
determined to reverse upis persistently heavy losses which 
average 2 million a month and totaled 20 million last year 
brian told a news conference in this washington suburb that his 
turnaround business plan calls for stabilizing the company 
within three to six months and making a 100000 profit in the 
julyseptember quarter of 1989 
to achieve the turnaround brian said he expects to raise 15 
million in permanent equity financing mostly from outside 
investors in the meantime he said 5 million in bridge loans 
will be made available by wnw group inc aided by infotechnology 
inc 
brian is chairman of wnw group the media investment company 
that operates upi and of infotech a new yorkbased information 
technology and venture capital firm 
the upi executives said they are committed to ensuring that the 
81yearold wire service survives and flourishes into the 21st 
century 
vazquez rana rescued upi from chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings 
in june 1986 by purchasing the company for 41 million he 
reportedly put an additional 50 million into upi before he 
relinquished control of his stock for 10 years to brians wnw group 
in february for an undisclosed cash payment 
the new executives said upi will save 10 million in the first 
year in administrative cost controls 5 million in staff 
reductions and 5 million in deficit financing 
there have been published reports that 400 or more editorial 
personnel alone would be laid off at upi steinle said in a 
statement in fact there will be fewer than 150 net staff 
reductions and less than 100 of those will be editorial at 
this time we do not anticipate further cutbacks 
the executives said this means that the current 1280 upi 
employees worldwide will be reduced 14 percent to about 1130 
employees through layoffs early retirements and attrition the 
biggest percentage of layoffs will occur in administrative 
positions brian said 
steinle said wire service guild officers were briefed on the 
plan wednesday morning their response was polite he said 
they were interested i think they were pleased 
sean mccormally chairman of the guilds negotiating committee 
said the union agrees that upi needs stability we believe the 
logical next step toward stability is for management to reach a 
fair and equitable contract with its employees he said that 
added stability should prove attractive to potential investors 
upi officials said contract negotiations already had begun 
guild members at upi have been working without a contract since 
april 30 when the old one expired upi management declared an 
impasse in contract talks and instituted a new set of work 
rules in november 
mccormally said the union is happy that steinle had promised no 
further layoffs beyond the 150 announced wednesday but we are 
insisting our members have the protections guaranteed by a contract 
and by effective union representation he said 
the company executives stressed that the 180 upi bureaus 
worldwide will continue virtually unchanged 
asked how upi would improve news coverage with fewer employees 
steinle said the staff will be not as large but more focused 
concentrating on stories most in demand by subscribers while 
providing full coverage of the major stories of the day 
brian said no existing upi services such as photos or sports 
will be dropped although he said money will be saved by 
transferring a spanishlanguage translation desk from upi 
headquarters in washington to latin america possibly mexico city 
the executives said upi will concentrate on areas with major 
client support such as state and regional reporting and will 
emphasize technical reporting that local news media are unable to 
provide 
this includes an increased emphasis on business and financial 
news and analysis and its effect on the consumer plus more and 
better reporting in areas such as health science law and 
medicine steinle said 
brian said upis patchwork quilt communications system will 
be streamlined and its shoebox accounting system will be 
modernized he predicted additional savings by pooling upis 
resources with those of other companies offering the potential for 
joint ventures in the information industry 
for example he said that within the next few months upi will 
be ready to take part in a new lowcost electronic news and 
information service called dbc supernews and to provide new 
regional business and stocks reports around the country 
brian said supernews will allow anyone with a personal computer 
at more than 28 million cable television sites to receive news on 
any subject via satellite from financial news network a 24hour 
cable tv network that is a subsidiary of infotech 
the news would be gathered by comtex scientific corp from upi 
and other major news sources in a venture also involving data 
broadcasting corp an fnn subsidiary 
brian said upi is looking at dozens of other possible ventures 
including data base and electronic feeds to corporate and 
government users and serving as distributor for other information 
products 
upis national managing editor bill ferguson said one example 
of how productivity will be increased is the use of a computer 
system that can edit a story automatically in three separate styles 
for newspapers radio and television 
we will still be the second major news service in the united 
states not quite as large as we were before but certainly more 
focused with more business systems behind it with more chances of 
surviving over a longer period of time and hopefully with more 
success steinle said 
said brian we have an established and successful track record 
in turnaround management we know how to operate companies within 
their means and we have links to other companies with significant 
future jointventure potential for upi in the information 
industry 
steinle said upi will constantly assess market reaction to its 
services as a marketdriven company we will supply what the 
market wants and is willing to pay for he said

the treasury department announced wednesday it 
was selling 256 billion in 20year bonds to the government of 
mexico as part of an innovative effort to help solve that countrys 
debt problems 
mexico will pay 492 million in cash for the zerocoupon bonds 
socalled because they are sold at a deep discount from the face 
amount and pay no interest until they mature 
the sale of the us securities was the final step in an 
innovative procedure unveiled last december mexico sought to 
induce foreign banks to forgive a portion of their loans by 
offering in exchange smaller quantities of mexican government 
bonds that would be backed by collateral consisting of us 
treasury securities 
banks were asked to bid for the bonds offering to cancel their 
loans at a discount 
backers of the plan had hoped to reduce mexicos debt burden by 
up to 10 billion but when the bids were opened on march 2 the 
amount of debt reduction amounted to a disappointing 11 billion 
the mexican finance ministry rejected nearly half of the bids it 
received as insufficient the bids accepted would retire 366 
billion in debt at an average discount of 6766 cents on the 
dollar offering 256 billion worth of mexican bonds in exchange 
the 256 billion in zerocoupon bonds sold by us treasury on 
wednesday will be used as collateral to back up the mexican bonds

a machine that sends a shockwave into the body 
to break up kidney stones is effective and less risky than invasive 
surgery a panel of experts concluded wednesday following a 
conference at the national institutes of health 
the panel organized to reach a consensus on how best to treat 
and prevent kidney stones recommended use of the extracorporeal 
shockwave lithotriptor to treat kidney stones smaller than 2 
centimeters in diameter it said that a combination of therapies 
which may include surgery may be needed for larger stones 
the lithotriptor introduced in the united states in 1984 uses 
a fluid shockwave generated by an electrical pulse to break up 
stones in the kidney or in the duct that drains the kidney once 
the stones are broken up they can be more easily passed out of the 
body the procedure routinely does not require surgery 
more than a half million people have been treated with the 
lithotriptor worldwide the panel said and it has been proven to 
be effective 
but the experts cautioned that because lithotriptsy is new 
the longterm effects of the therapy are unknown 
dr fredric l coe a professor of medicine at the university of 
chicago and chairman of the panel said there have been reports of 
elevated blood pressure among some lithotriptsy patients and there 
have been cases where the therapy causes kidney injury he said 
these problems need to be further studied 
for kidney stones larger than 2 centimeters the panel 
recommended the use of a combined therapy that would include a 
surgical procedure called nephrolithotomy using this technique 
surgeons make a small incision near the kidney and then insert a 
flexible tube that can be manuevered to the site of the kidney 
stone by manipulating instruments through the tube the surgeon 
can break up the kidney stone and remove it 
coe said the panel recommended a therapy system in which stones 
larger than 2 centimeters would be removed by nephrolithotomy 
small stones or fragments could then be treated with lithotripsy 
later if needed a second removal surgery could be performed he 
said this combination was preferrable to repeated sessions of 
lithotripsy 
open surgery where a wide incision is made and the kidney 
exposed is required now only in rare cases involving special types 
of stones or other physical factors coe said 
kidney stones account for seven to 10 of every 1000 hospital 
admissions in the united states there are seven to 21 cases of 
kidney stone annually for every 10000 persons though the stones 
may cause great pain they are rarely lifethreatening 
coe said about 70 percent of all kidney stone cases can be 
treated using lithotripsy 
for prevention of stones the panel recommended the use of 
medication for certain types of stones a modification of diet 
where indicated and increased fluid intake increased urination 
caused by a higher fluid intake the panel said can lower the 
concentration in the urine of chemicals that tend to form stones 
kidney stones are formed when chemicals in the urine crystalize 
about 80 percent of the stones are formed of calcium oxalate 
crystals others are of calcium phosphate salts uric acid cystine 
or a combination of magnesium ammonium and phosphate

fashion students at florida state 
university are putting their design talents to work for children 
stuck with cumbersome or awkward medical devices 
parents of handicapped children buy readymade clothes then 
slash them and cut them to make them fit emma kittles a 
professor of clothing textiles and merchandising said wednesday 
its almost impossible to buy clothing to fit the devices their 
children have to wear 
kittles has challenged a class to design clothing that is 
functional comfortable and has style their results will be 
compiled in a stepbystep teaching manual on designing clothing 
for disabled children 
thinking of children 2 to 13 the students must design clothes 
that would be easy to put on and would camouflage any medical 
devices 
for children in wheelchairs the students must design outfits 
that eliminate excess folds and bulk and that are made of fabrics 
that dont chafe 
another challenge for the students is designing clothes that 
make it easier for children to dress themselves with the help of 
front or side fasteners such as velcro large snaps and zippers 
with large tabs 
children are at the stage that they are learning things to 
make them independent one of those things is dressing 
themselves said kittles but even if the child cannot dress 
himself the therapist and parents want clothing that is easy to 
manipulate on these children 
because each childs needs are different the students will 
interview the parents before measuring buying fabrics and 
designing outfits the child also shares personal preferences such 
as favorite colors

the head of the environmental protection 
agency has overruled a hearing examiner and banned use of the 
insecticide diazinon on golf course and sod farms in an effort to 
protect birds epa said wednesday 
agency administrator lee m thomas said the major manufacturer 
cibageigy corp of greensboro nc had failed to show by a 
preponderance of the evidence that even a single acre of turf will 
be destroyed if diazinon is canceled much less that golf course or 
sod farm operations will be significantly affected by turf 
replacement costs 
epa spokesman al heier said it was the first time epa had acted 
against a pesticide solely to protect birds though the harm to 
birds was one reason ddt was banned in 1972 
chief administrative law judge gerald harwood in january upheld 
cibageigys contention that the benefits of use under additional 
restrictions outweighed the risk to birds 
but thomass decision signed tuesday and released wednesday 
said the companys benefits case was singularly weak 
cibageigys contention that the risk to birds under new 
restrictions would be low is undermined by the critical flaws in 
its field studies thomas wrote 
even disregarding those flaws some risk to birds would remain 
thomas said and these risks are not justified by the benefit of 
avoiding a negligible cost increase to golf courses and sod farms 
other insect control measures should add less than 05 percent 
to operating costs of golf courses and sod farms thomas said 
he said that unblemished golf courses and lawns are not as 
significant as the benefits to public health programs and food 
crops normally at issue in pesticide decisions 
evidence of the benefits of maintaining price competition among 
products avoiding turf damage and the comparative safety of 
diazinon is either nonexistent speculative or in conflict with 
more persuasive evidence thomas wrote 
many bird species find golf courses and sod farms good feeding 
grounds especially in urban areas where these large expanses of 
green are easy to spot from the air they ingest the chemical both 
from the insects they eat and from directly eating small pellets of 
the chemical 
the agency has said it knows of 60 instances in 18 states of 
bird kills where diazinon was the known or suspected cause 
anywhere from one to 800 birds were killed in these cases and epa 
believes the deaths are significantly underestimated 
diazinon has other uses on farms in nurseries and in gardens 
that are not affected by thomas ruling about 8 million pounds a 
year are sold of which 512000 pounds is used on golf courses and 
60000 pounds on sod farms the agency said diazinon is contained 
in 494 licensed pesticide products 
cibageigy spokesman skip ragland said the company still 
believed its product could be used safely but had not had time to 
study thomas decision the company could begin a court appeal but 
we dont know yet how far were going to take this ragland 
said 
maureen hinkle a lobbyist for the national audubon society 
praised thomas decision and noted that other pesticides frequently 
kill birds 
we hope it will be a precedent for other pesticide decisions 
affecting birds she said

sikh radicals killed 15 more people in 
punjab bringing the death toll to 50 in three days of attacks 
linked to their violent separatist campaign police reported 
wednesday 
attacks blamed on sikh militants have taken at least 580 lives 
already this year in punjab indias main agricultural region and 
the only state where sikhs are the majority the death toll for all 
of 1987 was about 1000 
this weeks violence has included the first successful use of 
rocketpropelled grenades against police izhar alam the punjab 
police chief said he believes arms are being smuggled in from 
pakistan 
seven people killed tuesday night were members of two sikh 
families in the amritsar district adjacent to pakistan alam said 
many attacks involve random fire on monday night gunmen killed 
10 people at a sikh wedding party including the bride and groom a 
survivor said the raiders shouted that family members were police 
informers 
although members of the sect have a majority in punjab sikhs 
make up only 2 percent of indias 800 million people more than 80 
percent of whom are hindus 
targets of the sikh gunmen include moderate sikhs who oppose a 
separate state as well as hindus at least 328 of this years 
victims have been sikhs 
an increasing worry for punjabi authorities is the more powerful 
weaponry being introduced including grenade launchers and ak47 
assault rifles 
no casualties were reported in the first attack with 
rocketpropelled grenades made on a police barracks last week on 
tuesday night however 10 men were wounded by grenades fired at a 
truck carrying paramilitary personnel of the border security force 
in the gurdaspur district north of amritsar 
police found an underground arms cache in the amritsar district 
sunday that included 14 sovietmade rpg7 launchers along with 
he80 antitank grenades said ss virk a senior officer of the 
paramilitary central reserve police 
alams claim that arms have come from pakistan conforms with 
indian allegations that pakistan arms the militants a charge the 
government in islamabad denies

the rightist arena party has 
withdrawn from vote counting in the march 20 election claiming 
others are trying to deprive it of victory officials said 
wednesday 
election officials announced soon after the election that arena 
an abbreviation of republican nationalist alliance had defeated 
the christian democratic party of president jose napoleon duarte 
it appeared at the time that arena would get at least 31 of the 
60 national assembly seats under the system of proportional 
representation with about 22 being assigned to christian democrats 
arena left the count tuesday night by taking its representative 
off the threemember central elections council which does the 
tallying it was protesting a council decision to consider 
challenges to the elections of three arena candidates 
francisco merino the partys council representative said the 
other members wanted to make a game of the vote tallies in order 
to change the results of the elections 
the other members are the council president mario samayoa of 
the christian democrats and arturo mendez azahar of the 
conservative national conciliation party two votes are enough to 
approve any decision 
roberto daubuisson the former army major who founded arena 
told reporters recently that if his party did not receive 31 seats 
it would be a case of fraud and we will withdraw from this 
democratic process 
alfredo cristiani president of arena said in a television 
interview wednesday the people are being defrauded this could 
explode at any moment something difficult to stop could occur 
in a recent interview samayoa denied the accusation of fraud in 
the votecounting which he said only exists in the mind of those 
who have manipulated the information about the results in their 
favor 
he said officials completed the official tallies and assignment 
of seats last saturday for 11 of the 14 provinces but some 
recounts would be needed in the other three because of challenges 
the arena upset presented duarte a staunch us ally with dim 
prospects for his last year in office presidential elections are 
set for march 1989 
arena benefited from popular discontent about duartes failure 
to meet his 1984 campaign pledges of improving the economy and 
ending the 8yearold civil war with leftist guerrillas 
both unemployement and the annual inflation rate are estimated 
at 40 percent

the death of chairman james howard of the 
house public works and transportation committee paves the way for a 
relatively obscure californian to take over the panel and for 
possible shifts among subcommittee leaders 
rep glenn anderson of los angeles is acting chairman of the 
public works panel and its ranking democrat andersons top aide 
jeremiah bresnahan asked wednesday if the lawmaker would want to 
become the panels permanent chairman said i cant imagine he 
wouldnt want to be 
other legislators and committee aides asking to not be 
identified said it appeared certain that anderson would become 
committee chairman probably next month and that he was not likely 
to be challenged for the job 
anderson 75 is a former california lieutenant governor who was 
elected to the house in 1968 he is a strong union supporter who 
has been an advocate for many projects the committee oversees but 
he has been one of the least visible members of the panels 
leadership 
the real question is whether anderson will choose to retain his 
chairmanship of the surface transportation subcommittee when he 
takes control of the entire committee that subcommittee which 
oversees enormous highway water and mass transit programs is 
generally considered the most desirable on the committee 
under house rules anderson could retain both posts 
robert maitlin an aide to rep robert roe dnj who ranks 
behind anderson in seniority said it is very doubtful roe 
would give up his chairmanship of the science space and technology 
committee to take over the surface transportation subcommittee 
rep norman mineta dcalif said he might be interested in 
heading the surface transportation subcommittee if anderson vacated 
the job mineta now chairs the committees aviation subcommittee 
house democratic rules call for a nominee to head a committee to

environmental protection agency scientists can 
foresee no risk to humans or other organisms from a proposed field 
test in maryland of a new genetically engineered pesticide the 
agency said wednesday 
the pesticide if eventually approved would be used against the 
european corn borer 
crop genetics inc of hanover md applied to both epa and the 
agriculture departments animal and plant health inspection service 
to test the new substance on its farm near ingleside md and at 
the agriculture departments research station at beltsville md 
the report by microbiologists and plant pathologists from the 
hazard evaluation divison of epas pesticides office said the 
properties of the engineered organism and results of lab tests on 
mice indicate that there are no human health risks 
the report said it is difficult to transfer the organism from 
one plant to another except on the blades of cutting tools and the 
engineered organism eventually should die out in competition with 
the natural strain 
for this smallscale field test providing all the 
containment monitoring and contingency procedures are adhered to 
we can foresee no risk to nontarget insects and no effect on 
endangered species and the organism may be used the group said 
the report will be considered at a public meeting april 18 of a 
subcommittee of epas pesticide scientific advisory panel the 
panels report is expected in time for a decision on the permits in 
may

a senior pentagon official said wednesday the 
soviet union has been sending money to philippine insurgents but 
he said the rebels growth is slowing and they are not now 
targeting americans in the country 
richard l armitage assistant secretary for international 
security affairs also praised the capture tuesday of several top 
communist rebel leaders in the philippines saying this has to 
have a devastating effect on the morale of the new peoples army 
armitage told a congressional subcommittee hearing that he found 
dramatic differences during a recent visit to manila compared 
to one 18 months earlier 
he said president corazon aquinos government now has people who 
genuinely care about the health of the nation the debate in 
manila he said is no longer over whether the president will 
survive coup attempts but how successful she will be during the 
rest of her term which ends in 1992 
asked by rep robert mrazek dny whether there has been any 
soviet support for the rebels armitage said in terms of 
equipment none in terms of money sure 
in the first public claim by an administration official that 
there is soviet support for philippine rebels armitage said soviet 
money goes to the communist party of the philippines and is then 
funneled to the new peoples army he gave no other details 
armitage said that the up to 16000 armed and another 10000 
unarmed rebels also receive money from groups in europe australia 
new zealand and the united states and they are known to have held 
discussions with north korean and vietnamese representatives 
no outside group is known to have sent arms to the rebels since 
a shipment of about 150 weapons by the palestine liberation 
organization in the early 1980s he said 
the defense official said growth of the insurgency has been 
about 2 percent annually compared to 20 percent during the last 
year of president ferdinand e marcos regime which was replaced 
by mrs aquinos government in a february 1986 revolt 
he noted that no american servicemen have been killed in the 
philippines since two american airmen and a retired us soldier 
were gunned down last october 
communist rebels claimed responsibility for the killings and 
said more us soldiers would be killed but armitage said he 
believes it was the work of a local rebel group that backfired and 
not the result of a communist central committee policy 
assistant secretary of state gaston j sigur appeared before the 
appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations to defend 
administration proposals for 257 million in aid for fiscal 1989 
this is 90 million less than congress appropriated for the 
philippines last year 
sigur noted there are also congressional proposals for the 
united states to lead an international effort to raise 5 billion 
for the philippines over the next five years 
he also pointed to the possibility of additional aid in 
connection with the agreement allowing us use of clark air base 
subic navy base and other military facilities in the philippines a 
review of the bases agreement begins in manila next week with 
money a key issue

the iranus claims tribunal has 
sharply curtailed hearings because of iranian claims that iraqi 
missile attacks are keeping its lawyers and witnesses from 
appearing in the hague sources said 
the 6yearold tribunal is charged with arbitrating billions of 
dollars of us and iranian financial claims arising from the 1979 
islamic revolution which overthrew the late shah mohammad reza 
pahlavi 
three of four scheduled hearings have been canceled since march 
7 at iranian request 
one western source speaking on condition of anonymity said 
wednesday that the cancellations mean only one claim is expected to 
be heard by the ninejudge tribunal between march 7 through may 25 
no hearings are set during the moslem holy month of ramadan from 
april 18may 20 
current cases have taken at least six years to reach the hearing 
docket which is set months in advance 
both iraq and iran have been engaging in missile attacks on 
population centers in their 7yearold war 
in a major case involving the delaware firm combustion 
engineering co the iranian agent to the tribunal mohammed k 
eshragh wrote the tribunal that representatives and attorneys in 
the abovementioned case cannot travel to the hague due to the 
present circumstances prevailing in iran 
he requested cancellation of the hearing a tribunal source said 
wednesday the request was granted march 22 
that case scheduled for an april 1113 hearing involved a 
claim against the iranian government and two of its agencies for 
engineering and inspection services provided to steel mills in iran 
eshragh has refused official comment on the situation in tehran 
but tribunal sources speaking on condition of anonymity said he 
recently claimed iraqi missile attacks had forced evacuation of 1 
million residents from the capital a city of approximately 6 
million 
the sources said eshragh claimed iranian attorneys were 
unreachable and airline service from tehran was disrupted 
eshragh was not available for comment at the bureau of iranian 
legal services in the hague 
officials at the tribunal have tried to verify independently 
eshraghs claim that iranian parties to the cases were unavailable 
the independent sources that we have seen would support 
the statement made by the iranian agent said a tribunal source 
other hearings canceled included one scheduled april 15 on a 
claim by the silver springs md firm of tadjercohen associates 
inc against an iranian government bank the claim involved an 
undetermined amount of unpaid invoices for supervision of an 
iranian construction project the hearing was called off march 24 
a march 910 hearing in a case brought by fairfield connbased 
general electric corp was called off march 8 that claim brought 
against the iranian government and several of its agencies sought 
millions of dollars in compensation for aircraft engine parts 
shipped to iran 
still on schedule is a hearing april 14 involving a claim by the 
california firm near east technological services usa inc against 
the iranian air force for unpaid spare parts shipments 
the tribunal source said that hearing has apparently not been 
canceled because it will be handled by iranian lawyers already in 
the hague 
the tribunal has so far awarded about 1 billion to american 
claimants and about 60 million to iranians plus an undetermined 
amount of interest to claimants on both sides 
the arbitration panel was established by the 1981 algiers 
accords which brought freedom to american hostages held at the 
us embassy in tehran for 444 days in 197981 
it is the only known forum for official contacts between us 
and iranian officials

michael dukakis cautiously began speaking of differences between 
himself and jesse jackson on the middle east and domestic policy 
wednesday signaling a delicate new phase in their struggle for 
supremacy in the democratic presidential race jackson and 
tennessee sen albert gore jr tangled more openly 
jackson canceled a planned meeting with gore on wednesday 
citing comments gore made about him the day before which he called 
more personal than principled gore sounding irritated 
responded there is no reason why anyone should think jesse 
jackson ought to be treated differently from any other candidate in 
this race 
gore had said jackson did not have the experience necessary for 
the presidency 
fellow presidential hopeful paul simon said he too has better 
credentials for the white house than jackson and spoke frankly 
about the dilemma that has plagued democrats since jackson moved to 
the front ranks of the presidential contenders you have to be 
careful you dont want to be perceived as antiblack he said 
jackson an outsider if there ever was one broke bread with the 
inner circle of the democratic party establishment in washington 
he said it showed that old wineskins are expanding and making 
room for new wine but a congressional supporter said he detected 
the beginnings of a stopjackson movement taking hold elsewhere 
the democrats who met with jackson said they wanted no part of 
that but florida party chairman charles whitehead said i would 
be less than honest with you if i didnt tell you there is 
absolutely an awful lot of apprehension out there among an awful 
lot of democrats about the nomination of jesse jackson 
jackson scored a landslide victory over dukakis in the michigan 
caucuses last weekend that stunned some party leaders 
some of them say privately they fear that if nominated the 
black liberal former civil rights leader would lead democrats to 
an electionday loss that might jeopardize democratic control of 
the congress on the other hand party leaders are afraid of 
offending the millions of black voters jackson brings to the polls 
knowing that their support will be needed to produce a general 
election victory 
dukakis regained his footing with a victory in connecticuts 
primary tuesday night by a margin of 21 over jackson and holds a 
narrow lead in convention delegates 647 to 634 gore trails with 
364 it takes 2082 delegates to win the nomination 
the democratic maneuverings in advance of mondays colorado 
caucuses and tuesdays wisconsin primary contrasted sharply with 
the serenity on the republican side 
bob dole reassumed the mantle of republican senate leader 
following his withdrawal from the presidential race he went to the 
white house and told president reagan he was reporting back for 
duty 
in an interview he said he made serious tactical mistakes in 
his campaign but he added that the real problem was you cant 
beat ronald reagan 
i was running against ronald reagan jr in the south he 
said in a reference to vice president george bush who campaigned as 
reagans righthand man 
bush campaigned in wisconsin but he hardly needed to former 
television evangelist pat robertson is his only remaining rival 
and the only question left is when the vice president will garner 
the final delegates needed to clinch the nomination 
but there was enough twisting and turning on the democratic side 
for both parties 
dukakis under pressure from party officials to develop a more 
compelling campaign message spoke for the first time of 
differences between himself and jackson 
from time to time differences will arise we have 
differences over the middle east we have differences about certain 
aspects of domestic policy and how to build a strong economy how 
to create good jobs and those will come out over time he said on 
cbs this morning he didnt elaborate 
dukakis wasnt the only one jabbing at jackson 
sen simon who needs a strong finish in wisconsin clearly had 
jackson in mind when he said i offer not only passion but 
programs i am here i have been fighting for workers 
policies on the washington scene not just in speeches 
gore who took issue with jackson on middle east and other 
issues on tuesday said wednesday that his remarks were really 
not that different from what ive been saying for several months 
gore had said in new york the day before that jackson has a 
complete and total lack of experience needed to be president 
the tennessee senator who has done poorly since he won several 
states on super tuesday campaigned in wisconsin and said i 
think were going to surprise some people in this state 
jackson himself expressed pleasure at his breakfast meeting with 
party leaders from around the country including former chairman 
john white onetime defense secretary clark clifford and other 
democratic insiders 
white called it a bonding of the democratic party and said 
the subject of jackson dragging the party down to defeat was 
discussed not at all 
but someone at the table asked jackson about the 1984 
controversy that surrounded his relationship with black extremist 
louis farrakhan white said jackson quoted jesus about casting 
the first stone and forgiveness and so anybody who hasnt made 
mistakes lets not be casting stones at each other about the 
past 
jackson himself said he saw no evidence of a concerted movement 
to stop his nomination 
but rep mickey leland of texas a supporter said he did 
there is some movement afoot leland said we cant put 
our hands on it we dont know who the leader is but we do 
understand different players of the democratic party have been 
approached 
he named democratic national chairman paul kirk and house 
speaker james wright as among those approached contacted later 
kirk and a spokesman for wright said they had not been approached 
about stopping jackson

a preliminary injunction barring random drug 
testing of 9400 civilian army employees was set aside by a federal 
appellate court tuesday while it considers the justice departments 
appeal of a lower court order 
a threejudge panel of the us circuit court of appeals here 
granted a stay that was sought by the justice department of the 
preliminary injunction issued by us district judge thomas f 
hogan on march 1 
hogan had ordered the army to stop random urine testing of 
civilian army employees finding that the practice was an 
excessively intrusive search prohibited by the constitution 
the preliminary injunction was issued in a case brought by 
public employee unions representing civilian army employees at ft 
stewart fla aberdeen proving ground md and the sharp army 
depot in lathrop calif 
the injunction banned random testing of all 9400 civilians in 
sensitive jobs who were subject to the antidrug program including 
pilots guards and police officers on military bases 
in issuing the injunction hogan had expressed regret that it 
removes what might be a powerful weapon from the nations arsenal 
in the campaign against illegal drug use but the values 
represented by the constitution and fourth amendment are 
transcendent 
citing a legal precedent that allows stays of judicial decisions 
when a party is likely to prevail on the merits of a dispute 
circuit judges stephen williams james buckley and dh ginsburg 
said a stay is warranted in this case 
kenneth t blaylock president of the american federation of 
government employees expressed disappointment that the appellate 
judges had set aside the injunction against random testing he said 
the union was determined to continue its fight to protect 
employee rights under the constitution 
justice department spokesman amy brown said the department was 
pleased with the courts decision to stay hogans order the army 
had no immediate comment 
no date has been set for a hearing on the departments appeal in 
the case

would establish a 1 billion fund to clean up or stablize large 
mildly radioactive piles of uranium tailings at 26 sites in seven 
western states the cost would be shared equally by uranium mill 
owners nuclear utilities and the government 
among its more controversial provisions the legislation which 
took six years to clear the senate would 
impose a schedule of escalating fees on nuclear utilities that 
load their reactors with more than 375 percent foreign uranium 
beginning in 1995 however utilities could buy up to half their 
uranium from foreign suppliers without penalty opponents 
including sens bill bradley dnj and daniel evans rwash 
argued that this would violate the spirit of the recent free trade 
pact signed with canada a leading exporter of relatively 
inexpensive highgrade ore bradley and evans lost an attempt 
4745 to delete the import restrictions from the bill 
settle the nuclear industrys debt to the us treasury for 
past purchases of enriched uranium at 364 million opponents 
argued that the figure should be as high as 88 billion 
convert the department of energys uranium enrichment program 
supposedly selffinancing but a multibilliondollar loser since the 
mid1970s into a corporation owned by the government if and when 
the enterprise begins turning profits the treasury could sell the 
stock in a bid to recover previous investments 
sen j bennett johnston dla who guided the measure through 
his energy committee said it is the culmination of six years of 
legislative effort to fashion a sound sensible and wellbalanced 
program to address the challenges we face today in the uranium 
industry and the nuclear fuel cycle 
were not here to debate the canadian trade deal johnston 
said lets keep american jobs at home 
he estimated the bill would restore 20000 jobs in the uranium 
mining industry which has dwindled in this decade to 2000 workers 
at just three mines and he estimated the uranium enrichment 
workforce cut by half since 1980 could be restored to at least 
12000 jobs 
the national taxpayers union the environmental policy 
institute the union of concerned scientists the us public 
interest research group and environmental action all opposed key 
provisions of the bill particularly the feature which limits the 
governments recovery of uranium enrichment costs to 364 million 
the groups argued that charging just 364 million is an 
unprecedented bailout for the nuclear industry since the white 
house has estimated that the industry should be billed 3 billion 
and the general accounting office said the government should charge 
88 billion 
the 1954 atomic energy act required the government to be fully 
compensated for its enrichment of nuclear fuel used by commercial 
utilities 
enrichment is a critical process in nuclear power it involves 
increasing the percentage of fissionable material in natural 
uranium from 07 percent to about 3 percent the amount necessary 
for use in lightwater reactors 
when the government began enriching commercial fuel in 1969 the 
united states was the only freeworld supplier of the service for 
nuclear utilities and business was booming predictions of 
burgeoning demand led to the expansion of the three doe plants 
and even then all capacity was committeed 
but then came a drastic decline in the demand for nuclear power 
with utilities canceling plans for more than 100 additional 
reactors since the late 1970s meanwhile two european consortiums 
and the soviet union began to supply foreign utilities with 
enriched uranium and by the 1980s the us monopoly had dropped 
to 50 percent of the market even some us utilities found it 
cheaper to buy foreign uranium 
adding to the government enrichment programs woes was the fact 
that the energy department contracted with the tennessee valley 
authority for billions of dollars worth of electricity to operate 
its production plants but when demand fell off that electricty 
wasnt used even though tva charged for it anyway the senate 
legislation settles that longterm debt at 12 billion

democratic presidential contender michael dukakis 
seeking a way to open a lead over jesse jackson began wednesday to 
show how he might deal with his charismatic rival by stressing 
his government experience 
dukakis sought to sidestep any direct criticism of jackson 
whose campaign has boosted the democratic party with many new 
voters who will be needed in the november election but he 
indirectly raised the issue of qualifications 
i think voters want to know which one of us has the strength 
and the experience and the values to lead this country to build a 
strong future thats what this race is all about thats what 
the presidency is all about dukakis said at a statehouse news 
conference 
jacksons victories on super tuesday and in michigan have made 
him dukakis principal challenger and dukakis has been struggling 
to find an effective way to fight off jackson without alienating 
jacksons backers 
dukakis was drawing fire from another democratic contender sen 
albert gore jr who accused him wednesday of being overly 
reluctant to specifically spell out his differences with jackson 
he was asked why would you make a better president gore 
said of dukakis he said im not going to answer that question 
i think thats ludicrous 
however dukakis has been using the experience theme to separate 
himself from jackson who has never held elective office 
im a doer i just dont talk about these things ive created 
jobs im building housing for families of low and moderate 
income dukakis told an interviewer on the cbs this morning 
show 
but at his boston news conference dukakis was at pains to say 
he considers himself on friendly terms with jackson 
we get along we enjoy each others company he knows about 
the things were doing here we know about the things hes doing 
the governor said 
pressed however dukakis mentioned two broad areas in which he 
and jackson differ 
we dont agree on middle east policy we dont agree on some 
aspects of economic policy here in the united states dukakis 
said 
he refused to go into detail promising to do so in a speech in 
wisconsin later this week 
dukakis said he spoke to jackson by telephone wednesday morning 
just hours after taking a 2to1 victory over jackson in the 
connecticut primary however the massachusetts governor refused to 
say what the two men discussed

a house committee urged the federal aviation 
administration on wednesday to block a plan by eastern airlines for 
a cargo carrier to fly eastern passenger flights in the event of a 
strike 
in a report the house government operations committee said 
orion air inc of raleigh nc should not be allowed to fly 
eastern aircraft until orion corrects major deficiencies noted 
in an april 1987 faa report 
the committee is of the view that prudence and common sense 
dictate that orion not be graduated to the ranks of a passenger 
carrier pending a full and complete resolution of the major 
problems cited in that report the panel said 
orion officials have said they have corrected most of the 
problems cited by the faa 
the committee also recommended that the government require 
eastern to notify passengers if their flights are to be operated by 
orion personnel 
earlier this year eastern signed an agreement under which orion 
would hire and train up to 400 pilots to fly eastern aircraft if 
the airlines pilots honor a possible walkout by the carriers 
mechanics 
the pilots union has challenged that arrangement in court on 
tuesday us district judge barrington d parker issued a 
preliminary injunction blocking eastern from proceeding with its 
orion plan

construction crews scrambled wednesday to 
repair a cracked sewer main as million of gallons of raw sewage 
flooded nearby bodies of water endangering fish and forcing 
industries to close 
health advisories warning residents against fishing in local 
waterways remained in effect as did three plant shutdowns ordered 
monday in hopes of curbing further environmental damage from toxic 
chemical discharges 
a 20foot section of the 11mile sewer main the only link 
between muskegon and the county wastewater management system had 
to be replaced after construction crews discovered two small cracks 
in the section monday 
but before the section could be replaced the entire main had to 
be drained releasing about 10 million gallons of untreated sewage 
into sanfords bayou 
from 30 million to 40 million gallons of raw sewage was expected 
to be released into local waterways before completion of the 
repairs expected thursday said michael vandenheuvel chief 
sanitarian for the muskegon county health department 
ron woods environmental engineer for the state department of 
natural resources said preliminary tests showed there definitely 
would be a fish kill in sanfords bayou but that none was expected 
in muskegon lake or muskegon river 
were optimistic that the lake will be able to assimilate the 
waste said woods who added that the sewage leak is among the 
worst ive ever seen 
vandenheuvel said the released sewage posed only a slight health 
risk to humans 
just as a precaution we dont want people drinking that water 
or fishing in it he said he predicted the health warning would 
be lifted in about a week 
vandenheuvel said a small leak had been detected in the pipe in 
january and that repairs had been scheduled next month though the 
cracks required quick action he said drainage of the main would 
have been necessary in either case 
theres just no way to shut that big pipeline down without 
draining it he said 
to drain the pipeline construction crews tuesday cracked open 
the broken section of the main with a power shovel resulting in a 
30foot geyser of raw sewage and industrial waste which flowed 
into the bayou and eventually into muskegon lake 
the wastewater vaporized and the resulting steam cloud was 
carried over the jackson hill neighborhood by a moderate wind the 
county health department reported several complaints of the stench 
but said it posed no health risk to residents 
officials urged residents to reduce the number of times they 
wash clothes take showers or flush toilets while repairs were 
being done 
five hundred employees were laid off temporarily at one of the 
three large muskegon plants ordered closed monday night to prevent 
the discharge of toxic chemical wastes 
at the sd warren co paper mill in muskegon the treatment 
systems largest single source of wastewater nearly half the 
companys 1060 employees were told to report to work only after 
the main was repaired company officials said 
at sealed power corps piston ring division about 50 employees 
were laid off monday night but were recalled wednesday company 
officials said the plant would begin limited operations again

the aflcio on wednesday awarded its 
oncebitter rival the international brotherhood of teamsters sole 
oranizing rights to attempt unionizing the adolph coors cos lead 
brewery at golden colo 
the labor federation ordered one of its veteran affiliates the 
machinists union to halt efforts to organize the same 3200 coors 
workers saying the teamsters had a much better chance of 
succeeding 
the decision was an outgrowth of the teamsters decision last 
october to reaffiliate their 16 million members with the aflcio 
the union had been expelled 30 years earlier on charges of 
corruption 
last september before the teamsters reaffiliation the labor 
federation had awarded sole organizing rights to the machinists 
union at coors but the teamsters challenged that ruling as soon as 
they were readmitted 
facing ongoing organizing efforts by the teamsters over the past 
two years coors and the aflcio last august ended one of the most 
prolonged and heated labormanagement disputes in the country 
in that agreement the labor federation brought to an end its 
10yearold nationwide boycott of coors beer in exchange the 
company agreed to forgo erecting legal roadblocks often used by 
management against an attempt by an aflcioaffiliated union to 
organize its workforce 
but that was before the teamsters were again an aflcio 
affiliate and teamsters officials admitted they had concerns now 
about how the coorsaflcio pact will hold up in the face of the 
federations decision wednesday 
were elated said charles klare director of the teamsters 
100000member brewery and soft drinks division but theres a 
lot to be found out yet weve got to meet with coors and determine 
if they accept the fact that the aflcio picked us 
the machinists union had argued before murray finley a former 
president of the amalgamated clothing and textile workers union who 
was picked by aflcio president lane kirkland to arbitrate the 
dispute that the teamsters should give up the coors effort based 
on last septembers decision 
the teamsters countered they had an ongoing organizing campaign 
at coors a year before the machinists entered the picture and had 
gotten more than 30 percent of the workers at golden to sign 
teamster union cards 
kirkland agreed with the teamsters according to witnesses at 
the arbitration proceedings 
it was a blackandwhite case based on the facts said 
vicki saporta the teamsters director of organizing we were 
there first and they didnt even have a single card signed were 
also the predominant union in the industry we have contracts at 
all 12 anheuserbusch breweries covering some 9000 workers

a special prosecutor was appointed 
wednesday to investigate the death of julian pierce an indian 
activist running for a judgeship who was eulogized as robeson 
countys best hope for change 
the appointment by the state attorney generals office was made 
at the request of county district attorney joe freeman britt who 
had been pierces opposition in the race for the superior court 
judgeship 
pierce who was found dead saturday has been mourned by 
supporters who at first said they suspected he was killed because 
someone did not want a lumbee indian to be elected judge more than 
2300 people attended a funeral and a memorial service for the 
activist wednesday 
sheriff hubert stone said pierces slaying was apparently the 
result of a broken romance not a political vendetta but that he 
was still investigating comments made by sandy gordon chavis 
chavis had has been charged with murder in the incident another 
man involved in the shooting committed suicide tuesday officials 
said 
senior deputy attorney general jim coman a member of the 
attorney generals special prosecution unit was appointed special 
prosecutor in the case said john simmons a spokesman for attorney 
general lacy thornburg 
coman said he hoped to begin meeting with investigators next 
week 
earlier rep harles rose dnc whose district include 
robeson county said he has asked for a congressional criminal 
justice subcommittee headed by rep john conyers dmich to hold 
a hearing in the county 
the only role a subcommittee would have would be to look at 
how the federal government is interfacing down here rose said 
i want to know is this county getting the kind of federal help 
it needs 
about 1500 people attended a memorial service at pembroke state 
university and 800 mourners later jammed a small church in maxton 
for pierces funeral 
he was loved he was respected said the rev johnnie chavis 
during services at the sycamore hill independent holiness church 
that says a lot more than we can say about a lot of people the 
minister said he was a distant relative of the man who was arrested 
pierces family filled up half of the seats in the 400seat 
church several hundred others sat on wooden chairs outside 
at the pembroke memorial service christine griffin acting 
codirector of lumbee river legal services said pierces 
compassion was overwhelming and allconsuming 
he was the best hope we had mrs griffin told the packed 
auditorium if he were here he would say to us not to use the 
same weapons that were used against him to bring about change 
we will keep up the peaceful fight for change through the 
courts and through the ballot box said the rev joy johnson 
he was our first real hero for meaningful change in robeson 
county said johnson pierce had been the legal services 
executive director until he resigned to run for judge 
despite the arrest of sandy gordon chavis indian leaders said 
racial tension would not go away 
theres a tremendous amount of suspicion that perhaps all 
the answers have not been put forward vernon bellecourt a 
representative of the american indian movement said wednesday 
chavis said that john anderson goins also 24 and a lumbee 
indian from pembroke shot and killed pierce stone said goins 
committed suicide tuesday 
stone said the killing appeared to stem from goins personal 
problems with 16yearold shannon bullard the daughter of pierces 
girlfriend ruth locklear the sheriff said goins may have felt 
pierce helped ms locklear get trespass warrants against him 
although he hasnt entered a formal plea chavis has told a 
family friend he was not involved in the slaying the news and 
observer of raleigh said the newspaper said chavis told ruth 
godwin that goins asked him saturday to go for a ride 
the two stopped near pierces home but chavis said he thought 
goins was getting out of the car to go to the bathroom the 
newspaper reported 
i heard three shots chavis said according to mrs godwin 
i was stunned 
stone declined comment on whether chavis knew goins intentions 
goins left flowers a teddy bear and some cards on the doorstep 
of his former girlfriends home before he killed himself officials 
said 
chavis father ronald helped bring the suit that prompted the 
general assembly to create a separate superior court district for 
robeson county 
the law was intended to help a nonwhite candidate get elected 
in a county where blacks and indians make up 58 percent of the 
registered voters 
under state law britt who is white will become judge because 
he is now unopposed gov jim martin said he would meet thursday 
with indian leaders calling for a special legislative session to 
allow an opponent in the may 3 vote 
the sheriff expressed regret at his comment tuesday that the 
slaying was just another murder one persons life is just as 
important as anothers stone said 
in lumberton a bomb threat emptied the robeson county 
courthouse on wednesday but employees were allowed to return in 
less than two hours no bomb was found and officials said they did 
not know if the threat was connected to the pierce case

the supreme court in a case of particular 
importance to rural areas was urged wednesday to compel states to 
provide free bus transportation for poor school children 
duane houdek representing a family challenging busing fees in 
north dakota said the state unlawfully discriminates against some 
people who have trouble affording the busing charges 
the bismarck nd lawyer was asked by justice byron r white 
whether north dakota is constitutionally required to provide 
transportation for poor people 
thats a fair characterization of his argument houdek 
replied 
but some justices indicated their decision expected to be 
announced by july could be based on narrower grounds they said 
the question may be whether north dakota discriminates improperly 
because it treats some school districts differently than others 
north dakota law provides free bus transportation to those 
living in districts that have reorganized to broaden their tax base 
and improve education only those districts that have not 
reorganized are allowed to charge parents for busing costs 
the law was intended to spur reorganization while assuring 
people in those districts they would not have to pay for 
transportation 
attorney general nicholas spaeth of north dakota defended the 
system as permissible geographic discrimination that does not 
unfairly harm the poor 
its one way economic benefits are dispensed he said he 
argued that the law does not deprive anyone of a public school 
education 
the law was challenged by paula kdrmas from rural dickinson 
nd she said the statute denied equal educational rights to her 
daughter sarita because the family could not afford a 97 annual 
bus fee 
ms kdrmas has driven sarita the 16 miles to school rather than 
pay the fee 
george t dynes a lawyer representing the local school 
district said it would have been cheaper for the kdrmas family to 
pay the bus fee which he said would be about 17 cents per mile 
bus service in dickinson is offered for a fee to elementary 
school students who live more than three miles from school and to 
high school students who live more than four miles away 
the north dakota supreme court upheld the law saying local 
school officials rationally may decide their limited resources are 
needed for services other than transportation 
a statutory scheme under which a school district offers to 
provide student transportation at considerably less expense to the 
parent than selftransportation would entail does not constitute a 
deprivation which offends either federal or state equal protection 
rights the state court said 
the case is kdrmas vs dickinson public schools 867113

the state department on wednesday defended 
israels authority to maintain order on the west bank and gaza but 
said it should be exercised in a humane way 
spokesman charles e redman supported assertions by assistant 
secretary of state richard schifter that israel not only has the 
right but the obligation to restore order in the violencebeset 
territories it has held since the 1967 sixday war 
schifter said at a congressional hearing tuesday that israel 
also was obliged to use appropriate levels of force to accomplish 
that end 
in nearly four months of protests and disorder 121 palestinian 
arabs and an israeli soldier have died in clashes schifter who is 
in charge of the state departments human rights office also 
testified the united states had protested israeli brutalization 
of palestinian prisoners and random beating of civilians 
schifter sought to distinguish those actions from dealing with 
violence and violent protests 
abdeen jabara president of the americanarab 
antidiscrimination committee called wednesday for schifters 
dismissal because of his comments 
schifter is apparently more concerned about israels image 
than he is about human rights jabara said 
the state department has consistently opposed the use of live 
ammunition bonebreaking beatings and tear gas in confined places 
against stonethrowing demonstrators he said schifters 
testimony yesterday contradicted this established policy 
but redman supported the official saying what ambassador 
schifter said is exactly the same thing that the secretary of 
state george p shultz and myself and every american authority has 
always said 
first israeli authorities have a duty to preserve order that 
kind of duty has to be carried out with a certain authority 
theres no doubt about it but it also has to be carried out in as 
humane a way as possible 
redman said we have never hesitated in the latter sense to 
express our concerns or criticism of particularly activity or 
excessive use of force 
about 75 propalestinian demonstrators protested peacefully 
outside the israeli embassys gates for an hour wednesday afternoon 
lofting flags of the palestine liberation organization the 
demonstrators chanted palestine yes israel no victory 
victory plo and no more beatings no more crime israel out 
of palestine 
this was the first protest at the embassy since the supreme 
court last week knocked down rules that had kept all demonstrations 
peaceful and otherwise at least 500 feet away from foreign 
embassies authorities still are allowed to keep potentially 
violent protests away from embassies but no violence or arrests 
occurred 
the israeli embassys press office refused to comment on the 
demonstration or the new rules concerning such protests 
moshe arad israels ambassador blamed the deaths in west bank 
protests wednesday on the palestine liberation organization which 
he said is inciting warfare 
we are faced with a situation in the west bank in gaza in 
which elements are interested especially the plo in inciting to 
violence promoting violence and making sure no dialogue is 
possible arad said on pbss macneillehrer newshour 
shultz meanwhile met with a group of israeli and arab 
reporters and defended his proposal to hold mideast negotiations 
beginning may 1 
shultz will fly to rome on thursday and then to israel on sunday 
night to begin five days of shuttling to israeli and arab capitals 
he denied in the session with reporters he would invite leaders 
of the countries to a united nations peace conference 
arad on pbs said that although israeli prime minister yitzhak 
shamir had reservations about a middle east peace initiative 
proposed by shultz israeli government is united in welcoming the 
secretarys return to the region next week 
you will find the israeli government interested and keen to 
pursue this dialogue arad said 
ibrahim abulughod a member of the palestine national council 
urged shultz to open talks with the plo 
during shultzs trip to the region in late february and early 
march the palestinians declined to meet with shultz but lughod 
also interviewed on pbs said that on shultzs return visit 
palestinians may meet the secretary the palestine national council 
is the socalled legislative arm of the plo 
redman on another subject expressed regret that israel had 
ordered the closing of the arabowned palestine press service in 
jerusalem he said the result would be to restrict reporters 
freedoms 
khalil jahshan president of the council of presidents of 
national arabamerican organizations said we find the 
administrations mild criticism of israel morally bankrupt 
in letters to shultz and to president reagan jahshan wrote 
it is our conviction that the united states government is 
contributing to the worsening situation in the israelioccupied 
territories by failing to make it absolutely clear that it will not 
tolerate the escalating oppression of palestinians 
jahshan who requested a meeting with reagan called on the 
united states to ensure that impartial observers be permitted 
access to the territories to help ensure that innocent people are 
not massacred

democrat richard a gephardt out of the 
presidential race but still campaigning on the trade front called 
on lawmakers wednesday to save the heart of his plan to fight 
foreign barriers with import curbs 
i think that we can come up with something that will be 
positive the missouri congressman told a housesenate conference 
committee that is drafting a compromise version of rival 1000page 
trade bills approved by both houses last year 
gephardt told reporters earlier that he would push for the 
conference committee to adopt his plan as it was approved by the 
house the senate takes a differing approach to unfair foreign 
trade barriers 
but gephardt seemed to acknowledge that his plan was bound to be 
modified by the conference committee in the long run something 
that lawmakers have been conceding for weeks 
he said any final version should focus on key countries 
employing unfair trade practices as part of a systematic trade 
strategy wholesale negotiations should be shunned in favor of 
working on major trade trouble spots gephardt said 
mandatory retaliation is needed when negotiations fail he 
noted saying you have to have a stick in the closet but he 
added that flexibility is necessary in dealing with trading 
partners and thus the president should have the power to waive 
retaliation when necessary 
the conference committee stopped short wednesday of action on 
any of the major issues remaining before it puts the finishing 
touches on a compromise 
im not going to kill myself to have that guy downtown say 
hes going to veto everything said rep dan rostenkowski 
dill chairman of a housesenate conference committee on trade 
legislation 
it was the latest democratic comment on a drumroll of warnings 
from the reagan administration that the bill could be inviting a 
veto the vice chairman sen lloyd bentsen dtexas said tuesday 
that he was tired of hearing veto threats 
rostenkowski said he still hoped to wrap up work by the close of 
business on thursday when lawmakers leave on their spring break 
but it remained unclear that he could meet that deadline 
were what you call clearing away brush said rep william 
frenzel rminn were to the small sapplings now and we havent 
gotten to the part of the forest where the big redwoods are 
besides the gephardt amendment lawmakers have not resolved what 
the bill should do to overhaul existing law under which us 
industries endangered by surges in foreign competition can obtain 
import restrictions from the government 
whether to ban toshiba products because of that companys sale 
of submarine silencing equipment to the soviets remains undecided 
as do provisions involving third world debt and requiring foreign 
owners of us property to disclose their identities and the extent 
of their holdings 
bentsen is campaigning to hang onto a senate provision to repeal 
the windfall profits tax on oil companies a move that is opposed 
by rostenkowski 
new protests that the bill already has been diluted came from 
lawmakers representing industrial areas where japanese imports have 
cut into jobs 
i doubt that i can vote for it rep ed jenkins dga told 
the conference committee because i dont want to be a part of 
some great trade bill that has no teeth and doesnt do anything at 
all for the industry of this country 
the house has given up an awful lot and the administration has 
gotten a lot of what it wants and the senate has also rep don 
pease dohio said the final product ought to be a legislative 
product and not just a product of the administration and ratified 
by us 
rostenkowski and bentsen repeated their goal of producing 
legislation that president reagan would be willing to sign 
or one that would embarrass him if he vetoes it 
rostenkowski said 
in a speech in richmond va on monday reagan threatened to 
veto the legislation if it contained mandatory import curbs forced 
disclosure of foreign ownership or a measure requiring employers to 
give notice of plant closings or largescale layoffs 
the plantclosings provision was adopted by a housesenate panel 
tuesday night rostenkowski was asked wednesday if he regarded it 
as a permanent feature of the legislation 
i see it as a big problem for getting the presidents 
signature he replied

the house overwhelmingly approved on wednesday 
a 48 million package of humanitarian aid for the contra rebels in 
nicaragua and for children injured in nearly seven years of civil 
war 
the aid bill passed on a 34570 vote was portrayed as a 
gesture of us support for a temporary truce reached last week 
between the rebels and the sandinista government and for 
continuing talks aimed at achieving a longterm end to hostilities 
the hope is that this will lead to political instead of 
military processes now taking over in nicaragua said house 
majority leader thomas foley dwash 
this war is over whether some like it or not said rep 
leon panetta dcalif 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said after the house 
vote we are pleased and look forward to the vote tomorrow in the 
senate 
despite producing the first strong bipartisan vote on us 
policy toward nicaragua in more than five years lawmakers showed 
more weariness than joy as they plodded through two hours of debate 
it is not the magic key to facilitate a ceasefire in place or 
fruitful negotiations and all the rest said minority leader 
robert michel rill who said it has become clear congress is no 
longer inclined to grant the military aid he would prefer but 
for the moment its the only thing we have to give 
house speaker jim wright dtexas noting the years of previous 
acrimony on the issue called the broad support for the bill very 
impressive and said it should provide encouragement to both 
sides in central america 
some democrats called the vote another victory for wright on the 
central american issue which he has dominated on the us side 
since a fivenation peace accord was signed in guatemala last aug 
7 
the speaker has invested tremendous risk and has been almost 
totally successful in saying im going to stick my neck out for 
peace down there said rep mike lowry dwash 
senate majority leader robert byrd dwva promised speedy 
consideration on the other side of the capitol and it appeared 
likely that the matter could come to a vote on thursday 
officials of the nicaraguan resistance a miamibased umbrella 
group of the contra rebels said they were elated with the package 
this is what we have been waiting for for a long time a 
broad bipartisan aid package for the resistance said alfredo 
cesar a director of the resistance he said it sends a strong 
political message to central america in general and to the world 
that the united states is not abandoning the resistance fighters in 
the mountains 
the legislation would renew aid to the rebels whose last us 
support ran out feb 29 and keep them together as a fighting force 
while they wait in ceasefire zones inside nicaragua for a 
longterm truce to be worked out with the sandinista government 
it sends a message to the contras that they are not abandoned 
that we do care about them and want to keep them healthy and a 
viable force said rep mickey edwards rokla who participated 
in negotiations to draft the compromise 
and it lets the sandinistas know that its important to the 
united states congress that the talks that take place down there 
take place with good faith and that they move toward 
democratization edwards added 
the agreement made possible by a 60day ceasefire reached by 
the two warring sides last week broke a weekslong deadlock in 
congress over whether to keep up the flow of us aid the house 
had killed efforts to provide new supplies to the rebels on two 
earlier occasions this year 
in agreeing to the deal republicans accepted wrights 
assurances that he would give any future request from president 
reagan for military aid for the rebels fair and orderly 
consideration 
the white house apparently dropped its past insistence on an 
ironclad legal guarantee of an expedited vote settling instead for 
the pledge contained in a letter from wright to the president and 
to minority leader robert michel rill 
wrights pledge says reagan can ask congress for additional 
rebel aid if nicaraguas leftist government violates the march 23 
ceasefire or any later peace accord and if the contras continue to 
observe its terms wright would send reagans request to the 
appropriate house committee which would have 10 days to act and 
return the measure to the full house for action 
wright said other than the 10day limit on committee 
consideration the letter simply laid out the normal procedures of 
the house and in that sense represented a relatively small 
concession 
the letter suggests but does not require that reagan first get 
advice on whether new military aid is warranted from a verification 
commission established by the march 23 agreement to oversee the 
ceasefire 
the commission includes nicaraguan cardinal miguel obando y 
bravo a government critic who is seen as partial to the rebels 
and joao baena soares secretary general of the organization of 
american states who is aligned more with the leftist government 
under the bill 162 million in humanitarian aid defined 
as food clothing medical supplies and family support payments 
would be sent to the contras at a rate of 27 million a month for 
the next six months it would be delivered by a neutral 
organization instead of the cia which has delivered past aid when 
hostilities were under way 
of that amount 22 million is earmarked for a miskito indian 
contra group which already had reached its own peace accord with 
the sandinistas 
the rebels would get another 15 million to buy communications 
gear deemed essential to keeping contra troops in touch with their 
commanders during the ceasefire period that pushes the total 
rebel aid to 177 million 
an identical amount would go to create a new program of medical 
and humanitarian help for children who have been injured or 
suffered as a result of the civil war which has claimed some 
40000 lives since 1981 
in addition the legislation provides 10 million to pay 
expenses of the verification commission and 25 million to pay 
administrative overhead for the state departments agency for 
international development which would handle distribution of the 
money

supermarkets pharmacies and small 
shops opened for the first time in 10 days wednesday as a 
nationwide strike aimed at toppling gen manuel antonio noriega 
began to fall apart 
despite the defections alberto boyd president of the national 
council of private enterprise said he and other strike leaders 
were not ending their effort to get rid of noriega 
in washington the reagan administration said it was considering 
new sanctions to force out noriega but it appeared no action was 
imminent 
the reopening of the capitals gago rey and super 99 
supermarkets signaled the first crack in a work stoppage that 
closed an estimated 90 percent of the nations business and 
industry 
later the citys leading pharmacies reopened as did some small 
clothing and other dry goods stores in the central business 
district 
traffic extremely light for days began to build again on 
panama citys streets with the usual jams of buses taxis and 
private autos developing at major intersections 
grocery stores were doing a brisk but not extraordinarily heavy 
business customers were required to pay in cash and appeared to be 
buying mostly essentials 
the government said some of the nations banks closed since 
march 3 would reopen thursday but only to process old checks 
even with a limited reopening of banks and some stores there 
appeared to be no hope of a quick infusion of cash that would 
permit a return to normal commerce in the moneyshort nation 
the cash crisis is due in part to us economic sanctions 
against noriega who is charged in the united states with drug 
trafficking as chief of the 15000member defense forces noriega 
is the real power behind panamas civilian government 
some us companies including miamibased eastern airlines and 
harrison nybased texaco inc this week paid the government 5 
million owed for taxes a diplomatic source who spoke on condition 
of anonymity said wednesday 
owners of the reopened grocery stores could not be reached for 
comment but angelica guinard a leader of the opposition national 
civic crusade leader said they had been under strong government 
pressure to reopen 
she said the pressure included threats of confiscation of their 
goods and personal threats against themselves and their families 
however an executive of the gago supermarket chain the citys 
largest said his companys stores opened because we have to pay 
our employees and if we didnt open we wouldnt have anything to 
do it with 
he spoke on condition of anonymity 
a woman leaving a rey supermarket in one of panama citys 
middleclass neighborhoods said she had bought only essentials 
rice milk beans and soap 
the kids dont understand she said they want to know why 
we dont have the kinds of things we had before but she said the 
eldest who turned 8 on saturday is catching on 
he said mommy you cant throw a party for me because 
noriega wont leave she said she wouldnt give her name 
felix navarro a wholesale fruit and vegetable dealer who closed 
down his own business in the strike carefully studied prices on 
fivepound bags of rice before choosing one 
pointing to the rice and a container of cooking oil he said 
i had 100 in cash at the beginning of the month and after i buy 
these im broke 
panamas chronic cash shortage worsened last month when noriega 
fired president eric arturo delvalle touching off a panic run on 
the banks that eventually forced their closure 
the united states aggravated the crisis by imposing a number of 
economic sanctions including the freezing of millions of dollars 
in panamanian government funds held by us banks 
the reagan administration continues to recognize delvalle who 
is in hiding as panamas president 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters in 
washington on wednesday that other sanctions are being actively 
considered to force noriegas ouster 
sen alfonse m damato rny said noriegas troops have 
harassed and beaten panama canal employees there is a continuing 
pattern of escalation in panamanian actions against the canal he 
said in an interview on abctvs good morning america he did 
not elaborate 
on tuesday noriega condemned the presence of the us 
helicopter carrier okinawa on the pacific end of the panama canal 
it passed through the canal tuesday on its way to its home port 
san diego 
the us defense department said in washington that the passage 
was routine but noriega called it a threat and an 
aggression there was no immediate indication how long the vessel 
would stay in the area

public universities in alabama are not 
racially biased despite the accusations of a us justice 
department lawsuit a lawyer for the major state university said 
wednesday 
we feel the same as we always have that were not guilty of 
segregating our schools said robert l potts an attorney for 
the university of alabama system when we get to the merits of 
the case in court i think well prove that 
the federal government suit was filed tuesday in us district 
court it was first filed in 1983 but had to be refiled after an 
appeals court ruled that the judge who heard the first case should 
have disqualified himself because he had participated in landmark 
civil rights cases as a private attorney 
i would not agree that the case is starting from ground zero 
again said nathaniel douglas of the justice departments civil 
rights division in washington dc 
there have been efforts to resolve the case by negotiation 
and we are ready to continue to do that 
the refiled suit charges again that state education officials 
have perpetuated a racial dual system in public higher 
education 
the justice department said two predominantly black schools 
alabama aampm in huntsville and alabama state in montgomery are 
close to mainly white schools and were intended for black students 
only while whites attended the other institutions 
justice department lawyers said evidence exists of intentions by 
state authorities to maintain vestiges of a dual school system 
federal attorneys cited a 1975 planning document of the alabama 
commission on higher education one of the defendants that said 
with alabama state and alabama aampm to meet the needs of the 
states negro citizens and with the university of alabama and 
auburn university as major state institutions the state seemed 
relatively well served 
the suit also names as defendants the state gov guy hunt and 
several universities in the system spokesmen for both the governor 
and for auburn university said they had no comment for the present 
the suit said the state continues to allocate far more money to 
the major white schools than to the mainly black ones 
state authorities contend the predominantly white and black 
schools in huntsville and montgomery are the result of decadesold 
patterns of preference by students 
in 1985 us district judge uw clemon ruled after a fiveweek 
trial that alabama maintains vestiges of a dual school system 
before he could begin the remedy phase of the case his ruling was 
appealed 
the 11th us circuit court of appeals in atlanta ruled last 
year that clemon alabamas first black federal judge should have 
stepped down because of the rights cases he handled when he was a 
private attorney

a planned meeting between two democratic 
presidential rivals collapsed wednesday with jesse jackson saying 
albert gore had launched an attack on him that was more personal 
than principled gore called jacksons charge ridiculous and 
said he was merely holding his rival to the same standard as any 
other candidate 
the two traded charges a day after gore unleashed a broad 
assault on jacksons record as without experience and said he was 
dismayed by jacksons associations and middle east policies 
in his latest remarks gore defended his earlier criticism and 
said he had mentioned nothing that could be regarded as personal 
there is no reason why anyone should think jesse jackson ought 
to be treated differently from any other candidate in this race 
gore told reporters thats not a personal attack and im 
surprised he would see it as a personal attack 
i think its ridiculous gore said hes a major contender 
for the white house is he to be immune from any questioning of his 
position on the issues or his approach to the campaign its 
ridiculous 
gore commented at a news conference upon arriving in washington 
from a campaign trip through new york and wisconsin only moments 
earlier jackson had passed through the same private air charter 
terminal 
the two had met on monday and according to both campaigns 
agreed to set aside time wednesday afternoon at national airport 
for a meeting since their schedules coincided but late wednesday 
the meeting was canceled the gore campaign saying it was jacksons 
move 
before departing on his own trip to wisconsin jackson told 
reporters the two were planning to meet 
but jackson said that as a result of his attacks which were 
more personal than principled its not necessary to meet at this 
time 
jackson said they would meet at some future time 
gore was informed of jacksons comments and responded 
questioning whether anyone believed he should bend over backwards 
to not say anything that might possibly be interpreted as 
critical of jackson 
is there supposed to be a separate standard he asked is 
there supposed to be some unwritten rule why jesse jackson cannot 
be criticized why his positions have to be just sancrosanct and 
nobody can say anything about them for fear somebody will just 
misinterpret what your saying i have from the start of this 
campaign treated him exactly the same as every other candidate in 
this race 
i dont think he really wants to be treated differently and 
if he thinks about it he wont really see a criticism of his 
positions as a personal attack 
gore also took aim at dukakis the delegate leader who was 
considered the frontrunner for the nomination at least until his 
massive loss to jackson in michigan last weekend 
gore faulted dukakis for what he said was a refusal to even 
contrast himself with jackson when asked 
he was asked why would you make a better president gore 
said of dukakis he said im not going to answer that 
question i think thats ludicrous 
on wednesday however dukakis moved cautiously to contrast some 
of his positions with those of jackson he mentioned the middle 
east and domestic policy as points of difference but declined to 
provide specifics

the chief contra military field commander who has 
expressed reservations about the rebel truce with the nicaraguan 
sandinistas said wednesday he supports the truce agreement and 
will comply with it 
col enrique bermudez who has said he doesnt trust the 
sandinistas told reporters his concerns about the truce do not 
mean he opposes contra leadership on the touchy issue 
we understand there can be differences but during 
negotiations we have to have a single position he said at a news 
conference 
as an indicator of that continuing mistrust the contras said 
wednesday they have filed a formal complaint with the nicaraguan 
government about the way the sandinistas handled the weekend 
release of 100 political prisoners a release called for in the 
truce agreement 
contra spokeswoman marta sacasa said the rebels gave the 
sandinistas a list saturday of the 100 contras they wanted 
released but only nine or 10 of those prisoners released were on 
the rebel list 
she said the sandinistas had made a verbal agreement to use 
the contra suggestions but their response does not show enough 
good faith or trust 
bermudezs comments wednesday came at the same time that contra 
directors are taking to the miami airwaves to calm opposition and 
fear in the nicaraguan community that the contra leadership gave up 
too much 
fourteen nicaraguan exile leaders held a news conference in 
miami on monday to call for the contra leaderships resignation 
sometimes its very easy sitting here in miami to say my 
god look whats been agreed to in sapoa without remembering that 
the fighting men who are dying in the mountains of nicaragua have 
been abandoned by congress said director alfredo cesar one of 
the leaders who helped negotiate the ceasefire sapoa is the 
nicaraguan border town where the truce talks were held last week 
congress has voted against continued military aid for the 
contras though the house on wednesday approved a package of 
humanitarian aid 
speaking on radio station waqiam cesar denied the truce was 
tantamount to surrender 
but he said an armed guerrilla movement has been allowed to stay 
in place while its leaders travel to the capital to discuss the 
nations future 
there is no precedent for this not even in guatemala a 
democratic country which requires that the communist guerrillas 
put down their arms before discussing the countrys future cesar 
said tuesday

a group of chinese students studying in america 
published an open letter this week urging their government in 
beijing to abandon a new policy that will slash the number of 
chinas students abroad 
the letter which began appearing in chineselanguage newspapers 
on tuesday and wednesday said the policy would be detrimental to 
chinas drive to develop its economy 
it also said the policy would force many chinese students in 
america to return home before obtaining their degrees 
an american china expert linked the policy change to concerns in 
beijing that chinese students studying in the united states are 
becoming too westernized 
the letter echoed an earlier petition signed by 1000 chinese 
students and sent to beijing in january 1987 that letter opposed 
conservative political policies in china 
we are only asking that the right to study and complete our 
degrees be restored to us said pei minxin a 30yearold 
doctoral candidate at harvard university pei was one of 21 chinese 
coordinators who included their telephone numbers in the 
letter inviting students who supported their position to call in 
and add their name to the list 
so far he said more than 800 chinese students nationwide had 
contacted the coordinators and pledged to sign the new letter 
which will be sent to beijing soon 
we are not planning to use this movement as an excuse to stay 
here permanently said pei whose request last week to extend his 
passport was denied by chinese authorities we just want to 
finish our degrees and go back to china 
currently about 40000 chinese students are studying outside of 
china 27000 of them in the united states 
under the new education policy china will send only 3000 
students abroad this year the overseas edition of the peoples 
daily reported feb 15 
student sources in new york said chinese officials told them 
only 20 percent or 600 would be sent to the united states last 
year 8000 chinese students came to america 
the policy also calls for strict limits on how long chinese 
students can stay abroad according to a copy of an official 
document obtained from chinese sources in new york 
the document says students seeking a masters degree must 
complete it within one or two years and students working for a 
doctorate have only five years to finish it 
that rule could be particularly onerous for many chinese who 
come to the united states needing time to improve their english 
zheng wanzhen press councilor for the chinese embassy in 
washington acknowledged that fewer students would be sent abroad 
but denied there was a policy change 
its just that they have been sending too many students to 
america he said china will send students to other countries 
like the soviet union east germany japan and western europe he 
said 
merle goldman a professor of history at boston university said 
the policy change marked a shift away from the liberal slant of 
chinese leader deng xiaoping who opened the country to the west in 
the 1970s 
not many students are returning to china and the chinese want 
them back she saidthe feb 15 peoples daily said of the 36000 
chinese who have come to america only 8817 have returned 
in addition ms goldman said when they do come home they are 
already infected by the political values of the united states they 
absorb western political ideas and that could be troublesome for 
the chinese state 
ms goldman said premier li peng was responsible for the shift 
which began last year when he took over as acting premier

arab leaders and the plo bitterly 
condemned israels crackdown in the occupied territories and called 
wednesday for an international peace conference to create an 
independent palestinian state 
in an emergency security council meeting israel rejected a 
conference and asked instead for direct negotiations with its 
neighbors 
us ambassador herbert s okun accused the arabs of extreme 
rhetoric and said secretary of state george p shultz will seek a 
forum in his forthcoming middle east mission that would permit 
direct negotiations leading to a comprehensive settlement 
the 15member council heard 10 speakers denounce israels 
occupation of lands captured from the arabs and call for a 
unsponsored peace conference involving all parties to the 
conflict including israel the plo and the five permanent members 
of the council 
they denounced israels sealing off the west bank and gaza its 
imposition of a curfew and banning of journalists saudi arabian 
and libyan envoys compared israels treatment of palestinians to 
nazi persecution of jews 
the council adjourned without a resolution or a vote but agreed 
to meet again to consider the situation in the occupied 
territories since the palestinian protests began in december the 
council has condemned israeli practices as violating palestinian 
human rights 
farouk khaddoumi the top envoy of the palestine liberation 
organization told the council peace can only be established 
through an end to israeli occupation and security can only reign if 
an independent palestinian state is established 
khaddoumi is director of the plo political department its 
equivalent to foreign minister he accused the united states of 
supporting repression in the occupied territories and said 
washington encouraged prime minister yitzhak shamir of israel whom 
he called a terrorist 
the united states he said is using its veto power to prevent 
the security council from adopting measures that would prevent 
israeli crimes against palestinians 
he said the palestinian people would never accept israels 
proposal of autonomy as a substitute for sovereignty 
the united nations recognizes the plo as the only legitimate 
representative of the palestinian people 
israel considers the plo a terrorist organization 
israeli ambassador johanan bein the deputy permanent 
representative condemned recent plo broadcasts which he said 
exhorted palestinians to throw rocks and attack israeli security 
forces with knives 
the plo solution is dissolution of israel bein said this 
will not be the case the plo has shown it will continue to fight 
to the last palestinian child but this will never constitute a 
basis for peace but only for violence 
he said israel regrets the loss of life of arab or jew but 
when confronted by unbridled mob violence with stones iron bars 
fire bombs and even live ammunition it has no alternative but to 
attempt to quell the violence and restore order 
foreign minister ahmed taleb ibrahimi of algeria told the 
council it is high time for resolute action by the world 
community and asked for a unsponsored middle east peace 
conference to set up a palestinian state 
there will only be peace ibrahimi said if there is total 
and unconditional evacuation of israel from all arab territories 
ibrahimi is the leader of a highlevel arab delegation visiting 
new york 
more than 120 palestinians and one israeli soldiers have been 
killed since riots began dec 8 in the west bank and gaza which 
israel captured from jordan and egypt in the 1967 middle east war 
speakers on the wednesday agenda included ibrahim massoud 
minister of state for foreign affairs of saudi arabia foreign 
minister farouk alshara of syria and chedli klibi the arab 
league secretarygeneral 
diplomats said earlier that a resolution and vote were unlikely 
because resolutions critical of israel often are vetoed by the 
united states

him into believing they were linked to the african national 
congress guerrilla movement 
i believed that what i was doing was in the national interest 
and it would never have occurred to me to question an order from an 
officer he said 
the blacks who were alleged drug dealers were killed in 
separate attacks last september and october 
van der merwe testified he knew of clandestine operations in 
which security police carried out missions to kill suspected anc 
operatives 
i realize that such actions are illegal in terms of the law

could face the death penalty although there was no immediate word 
on sentencing

senate majority leader robert byrd on 
wednesday called attorney general edwin meese iii the crown jewel 
of sleaze and urged him to quit but meese said theres no 
reason to resign and president reagan reiterated his support for 
his old friend

sapped justice department morale also predicted that solicitor 
general charles fried would not follow the path of two other 
officials who shook the department on tuesday by turning in their 
resignations 
business is operating as usual at the justice department 
meese told reporters he said replacements were being sought for 
the two aides who resigned that the management team is very 
strong and everything is going along well 
asked by reporters whether he would quit meese responded no 
not at all theres no reason to 
a republican sen bob packwood of oregon joined other members 
of the senate in calling for meese to step down 
deputy attorney general arnold burns and assistant attorney 
general william weld who oversaw all federal criminal 
investigations resigned because they were concerned that meeses 
continuing legal difficulties were damaging the effectiveness and 
credibility of the justice department said department sources 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
at a meeting wednesday in meeses justice department office 
fried who ranks fourth in the justice department hierarchy 
refused to give an immediate answer when meese personally urged him 
not to join burns and weld the sources said 
fried told the attorney general he would consider what to do in 
the next few days the sources said 
asked about the meeting with fried meese said i dont talk 
about my conversations with my top management people but i have no 
doubt that mr fried will remain a strong member of the management 
team 
meese called at the white house late wednesday and met for 15 
minutes with chief of staff howard baker but spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said their discussion was about judicial appointments 
fitzwater said meese did not meet with reagan and the two had 
not discussed the matter of the resignations but he added im 
sure the president will discuss it with him at some point 
he did not say when meese is expected to be at the white house 
again on thursday for a cabinet meeting 
there have been reports indicating mrs reagan is among those 
who want meese to go fitzwater was asked why meese remained on the 
job when baker vice president george bush and mrs reagan were 
known to want him out 
i dont think any of that is true fitzwater replied asked 
if he was denying it he said i dont know ive never heard it 
said ive never heard anybody say that 
bush said wednesday he was troubled by the resignation of top 
justice department officials but im not going to pass 
judgment on whether meese should resign mrs reagan has not 
publicly expressed an opinion on the attorney generals status 
on tuesday fried who argues the governments position in 
supreme court cases told the associated press the resignations had 
prompted him to reassess his own future he said he needed time to 
think the matter through 
congressional reaction against meese was strong the day after 
the resignations of burns who is the no 2 justice department 
official and weld 
mr meese has become the crown jewel of the sleaze factor in 
reagan administration history byrd dwva told reporters he 
said that if reagan doesnt want to ask meese to quit he should 
find someone else to ask him 
he ought to get out said byrd the country cannot have 
confidence in the justice department when the top law enforcement 
officer obviously has to spend an inordinate amount of his time 
defending himself he should be spending his time fighting the war 
on drugs crime byrd said 
but reagan almost in reply told reporters during a ceremony 
honoring young scientists in the white house rose garden hes 
been a friend for over 20 years i have every confidence in him 
im not going to comment any further 
of meese packwood said you finally reach a place where there 
is a cloud of suspicion a sufficient cloud of suspicion that i 
think you owe it to the president to remove yourself 
sen arlen specter of pennsylvania a republican member of the 
senate judiciary committee declined to call for meeses 
resignation but said the attorney general owed the american people 
a full public explanation as to why his deputies have left 
theres no doubt in my mind that it is very harmful to the 
republican party and could hurt our nominee in the fall specter 
told reporters but it is even more harmful to the country im 
concerned as an american 
specter accused byrd of trying to make the controversy over 
meese a partisan issue 
when senator byrd starts to mix his metaphors and talk about 
crown jewels and sleaze its totally inappropriate specter said 
the criminal investigation of meese launched last may 11 by 
independent counsel james mckay is continuing and so far has delved 
into his involvement through longtime friend e robert wallach with 
scandalplagued wedtech corp and a 1 billion iraqi pipeline 
mckay widened the probe this week by subpoenaing payroll records 
and other documents of the washington chapter of the multiple 
sclerosis society in connection with a 40000ayear job meeses 
wife ursula got with the charity in 1985 investigators are 
examining wallachs role in helping mrs meese get the job 
fitzwater confirmed that burns and weld had met with baker last 
week 
the gentlemen indicated they wanted to resign or they were 
disenchanted and they were advised to talk to the attorney general 
about that thats the proper way to do it the proper course of 
action fitzwater said 
the spokesman said reagan has been briefed on the concerns and 
complaints of burns and weld he just wanted to be kept informed 
he said the two officials met with baker on march 16 and then 
again tuesday morning before they resigned certainly the 
president was briefed on that meeting fitzwater said 
on capitol hill sen patrick leahy dvt said meese has 
shown no willingness to resign but he ought to at least step aside 
because he cant run the department of justice hes lost all 
effectiveness 
sen dennis deconcini dariz said he also is drafting a 
letter to meese calling on him to resign because of his lack of 
credibility and confidence 
but sen orrin g hatch rutah said meese should remain in 
office until the special prosecutor comes up with his 
conclusions 
if he concludes there was impropriety thats another 
question hatch said 
byrd leahy deconcini and hatch all are members of the senate 
judiciary committee which oversees operations of the justice 
department

eighteen months before tawana brawleys alleged 
abduction a schoolmate told police a markedly similar story of 
being kidnapped and sexually assaulted according to broadcast and 
published reports 
in a story published wednesday sources told the daily news that 
the unidentified teenager reported to police in 1986 that she had 
been abducted by men in a green car and taken to a wooded area and 
attacked 
the charges were investigated by the poughkeepsie police who 
determined that they were unfounded and apparently fabricated to 
cover up sexual abuse by a male relative the news said 
the rev al sharpton an adviser to the brawley family angrily 
denounced the news story and he and one of the brawleys 
attorneys alton maddox asserted that it had been leaked by state 
attorney general robert abrams the special prosecutor in the case 
its ridiculous to take a story that no one has established 
that tawana had any knowledge of and imply that she was trying to 
use it sharpton said 
a spokesman for abrams timothy gilles declined to comment on 
the reports but denied that abrams office had been the source of 
the story 
the case has received wide attention in part because the family 
has refused to cooperate with officials accusing them of racial 
bias in their handling of the investigation 
poughkeepsie radio station wkip said a woman saying she was the 
mother of a girl with a similar story called the stations nightly 
talk show last week the station rebroadcast parts of that 
interview wednesday 
the caller who declined to give her name said during the 
broadcast that miss brawley and her daughter had talked at a 
shopping mall the night before miss brawleys disappearance last 
november 
the girl eventually recanted her story the woman said 
miss brawley who was reported missing for several days in 
november has told her family she was abducted in a green or blue 
car taken to a wooded area and sexually abused by six white men 
one of the men flashed a policelike badge she said 
four days later she was found near her familys former apartment 
in wappingers falls dazed covered with animal excrement and with 
racial epithets written on her body miss brawley is black

a stateowned magazine says a ranking libyan 
visited egypt in an attempt to mend relations between the north 
african neighbors which have been at odds for years and fought a 
brief border war in 1977 
in the edition appearing thursday the weekly almussawar said 
col abdelfattah younis farag came to cairo after egypt allowed 
the return of four libyan warplanes whose pilots landed on the 
wrong side of the border march 1 because of bad weather and lack of 
fuel 
on monday libyan leader moammar gadhafi said he was withdrawing 
his forces from the border and asked nothing in return he said 
libya would not use force to get president hosni mubaraks 
government to renounce the peace treaty egypt signed with israel in 
1979 
mubarak reacted to that gesture wednesday by warning gadhafi not 
to conceal terrorist plans behind expressions of good will 
almussawar said farag commander of the border military zone 
came to thank mubarak for returning the sovietbuilt mig23s the 
magazine did not say if he met mubarak but said the colonel was 
expected back in cairo soon to continue talks with the egyptian 
leadership 
it said farag was close to gadhafi and visited egypt several 
times before trying with little success to open a dialogue 
in his comments wednesday mubarak questioned the motive for 
gadhafis statement that he was opening the border 
might it be to smuggle in bombs the president said at a 
political meeting in giza province i strongly warn him i know 
all his tricks 
his comments carried by the middle east news agency apparently 
referred to charges that gadhafi arranged bombings in cairo and 
other cities in 197576 
egypt also has said it suspected libya of laying mines in the 
gulf of suez and red sea that damaged 20 ships in the summer of 
1984 
mubarak said gadhafis statements have no impact on 
relations 
gadhafi recently freed and repatriated 36 egyptian prisoners 
among them three soldiers whose return mubarak had requested 
publicly egypt sent home five members of the libyan air force who 
flew to egypt last year in three separate incidents but who did not 
request asylum 
libyanegyptian relations soured in 1972 when egypt rejected 
gadhafis proposal that the two countries merge they got worse 
when the late president anwar sadat made the americanmediated camp 
david agreements with israel in 1978 that led to the peace treaty

a computer program that helps doctors figure out 
which patients have suffered heart attacks could prevent about 
175000 intensive care admissions each year saving an estimated 
85 million its developers say 
the program produced by doctors at brigham and womens hospital 
in boston is intended to help emergency room physicians determine 
whether patients with chest pain actually had heart attacks 
in testing on 4770 patients at six hospitals they found that 
the program could have reduced needless admissions to the coronary 
care units by nearly 12 percent 
they cautioned however that the program should help doctors 
not take their place and should never override common sense 
a report on the project directed by dr lee goldman was 
published in thursdays new england journal of medicine 
the program is the latest of a variety of efforts intended to 
let doctors take advantage of computers when making complicated 
decisions about patient care 
the researchers entered about 50 variables involving patient 
history physical examination results and electrocardiogram 
findings into the computer the computer program than used these 
variables to determine whether patients actually had suffered a 
heart attack or not according to the journal 
the computer and the doctors were equally adept that spotting 
true heart attacks both missed 12 percent of them however the 
computer was better at ruling out heart attacks among people who 
had not suffered them 
the researchers noted that sometimes the doctors were better 
than the computer at evaluating patients 
the doctors estimated that the program could help doctors avoid 
about 175000 admissions to intensive care units for heart patients 
each year they said that even if these patients were put in other 
hospital wards the program could help save at least 85 million 
annually

the scarcity of blacks in the news media 
continues to hinder the nations understanding of poverty in the 
united states the head of a 1968 presidential commission on race 
relations said wednesday 
there is no way i think that the white community can be 
informed regarding conditions in the black inner cities without 
the use employment and advancement of blacks and other minorities 
as reporters as editors and executives within the media said 
david ginsburg former executive director of the kerner commission 
appointed by president lyndon johnson 
ginsburg and three other members of the commission took part in 
a seminar on minorities in the news media sponsored by the 
commercial appeal newspaper in memphis 
the former commission members said racial divisions and poverty 
are as rampant in the united states today as when the kerner report 
was filed in 1968 
weve actually begun to go backward said former 
commissioner fred harris a political science professor at the 
university of new mexico and former us senator 
the kerner commission was appointed by johnson following ghetto 
riots that erupted across america in the 1960s 
in its report the commission chastised the news media for 
failing to hire very many blacks or report fully on poverty in the 
central cities 
they have not communicated to the majority of their audience 
which is white a sense of the degradation misery and 
hopelessness of living in the ghetto the report said 
ginsburg a washington dc attorney said the news media are 
poised to repeat that mistake because they have not been 
sufficiently vigorous in hiring blacks and other minorities 
the american association of newspaper editors has got it on 
their agenda but they are not doing enough he said 
ginsburg offered statistics during a break in the meeting which 
said that minority hiring in the newsrooms of daily newspapers 
nationwide was 63 percent last year while the minority population 
was about 25 percent he said 
ginsburg said during a panel discussion that while some news 
organizations have done well in hiring and promoting minorities 
blacks have generally found it easier to be elected to government 
positions than to find jobs in the media 
were electing more blacks officials by far then we are 
employing blacks and other minorities in the newsrooms to say this 
is unconscionable is almost an understatement ginsburg said 
former commission members katherine g peden president of an 
industrial development company in louisville ky and james c 
corman a washington dc lawyer also participated in the 
meeting

a woman who feared to seek medical help 
as a tumor swelled in her abdomen eventually doubled her weight 
before having the 130pound malignant growth removed her doctor 
said wednesday 
barbara louise jones 55 is almost completely recovered from 
the december operation to remove the ovarian tumor said fort worth 
surgeon dr je way 
i went to the doctor monday and my blood pressure is up a 
little but other than that im doing fine said miss jones who 
is 5foot1 
in the three years preceeding her operation miss jones said she 
at first thought she was gaining weight then realized something 
was seriously wrong 
but miss jones said she delayed seeing a doctor because she 
feared she would suffer the same type of painful death as her 
mother who died of ovarian cancer in 1973 her maternal 
grandfather and an uncle also died of cancer 
she was forced to retire early from her job as a school district 
purchasing agent last march by july she was unable to drive a car 
or move about without tiring 
in november she finally decided to seek medical attention and 
was referred to way within two weeks the tumor was removed 
way said he had to cut a 4foot incision in miss jones abdomen 
to remove the malignant tumor he said most ovarian tumors are 
detected when they are 11 inches 
theres nothing typical about this way said you can find 
a lot of tumors that weigh 5 to 30 pounds and those are humongous 
tumors 
the 1988 guinness book of world records lists a 1905 case of a 
328pound ovarian cyst as the largest tumor in history oddly 
enough the woman in that case also was from texas the reference 
book says she recovered fully 
way said the tumor was fixed to the walls of miss jones abdomen 
and stretched her skin almost paperthin he said what made the 
surgery difficult was keeping the taut skin from breaking and the 
tumor from rupturing 
if the surgery had not been done way said more tumors could 
have developed the tumor could have become so large it would have 
caused respiratory problems it could have ruptured and spread 
cancer throughout her body or it could have blocked her ability to 
digest food 
he said that all of the cancerous growth was removed and 
although miss jones must have regular checkups for a recurrence 
she is now in good health 
miss jones said she would recommend that others who suspect they 
have cancer to see their physicians early 
i realize now how dangerous it can be and could have been for 
me she said

a commission probing the deaths of 14 
hospital patients has accused two former state health ministers of 
corruption misuse of power and other charges according to a 
report submitted wednesday to state lawmakers 
the report by chaktawar lentin a retired bombay high court 
judge also criticized what it called widespread corruption among 
government officials responsible for overseeing health care and the 
pharmaceutical industry 
lentin whose report was submitted to the maharashtra state 
assembly wednesday by the current state health minister ram meghe 
recommended criminal investigations of bhai sawant and baliram 
hiray two former health ministers

of ministerial power and authority dereliction of duty and were 
unfit to hold a ministerial post 
sawant told the assembly he denied the allegations

of 14 patients at the jj hospital in bombay after they were given 
contaminated glycerine in january and february 1986 
lentins report was completed nearly four months ago but his 
findings were not made public until this week 
critics have charged that the state governments decision not to 
release the report until wednesday encouraged slipshod work in 
indias drug companies 
lentin said that the medication linked to the deaths of the 14 
hospital patients had been mixed with the lethal diethylene glycol 
it was manufactured at the alpana pharma company located in nanded 
a town in maharashtra 
the commission also said it found corruption among senior 
officials of the governments food and drug administration the 
report said that inquiries should be held into the behavior of four 
senior officials of the agency 
the entire structure of the agency has been corroded by 
rampant and unabashed corruption indiscipline naked favoritism 
crude nepotism and gross ministerial interference at every stage 
and a sense of nonaccountability all around lentin said in his 
report 
the state government announced the suspension of four doctors at 
the jj hospital on recommendation of the commission charges will 
also be filed against four drug manufacturing companies

casualties to the prosoviet army 
it was not clear how the reported violations would affect peace 
talks 
according to the transcript the hondurasbased radio station 
reported three attacks by contra troops on government soldiers in 
zelaya province along the caribbean coast and in northern matagalpa 
province it did not say when the raids took place 
the defense ministry said it had no reports of combat but the 
prosandinista newspaper el nuevo diario quoted unidentified 
military sources as saying contra rebels killed four civilians and 
kidnapped two saturday in central chontales province 
there also have been reports that renegade rebels opposed to the 
ceasefire agreement are staging attacks 
a communique at the end of technical talks held monday and 
tuesday in the southern border town of sapoa said the two sides had 
agreed in general terms on the size and location of the ceasefire 
zones 
two zones will be in the northern part of the country two on 
the caribbean coast and one in the south it said their exact 
locations were not disclosed 
last weeks peace pact does not mention the laying down of arms 
an issue that will likely be discussed in the next technical 
meeting set for april 5 or discussions scheduled for april 6 in 
managua between highranking sandinista and contra leaders 
on monday contra commander diogenes hernandez membreno known 
as fernando vowed that the combatants would not put down their 
arms until nicaragua is a democracy 
under the peace agreement the sandinistas will grant freedom of 
expression release political prisoners and allow rebel leaders to 
take part in national talks the contras in turn agreed to gather 
in the ceasefire zones and accept only humanitarian aid from a 
neutral organization such as the international red cross 
in washington the house if representatives overwhelmingly 
approved a 48 million package of humanitarian aid wednesday for 
the contras and for children injured in the fighting 
the bill was portrayed as a gesture of us support for the 
temporary truce and for continuing talks aimed at achieving a 
longterm end to hostilities 
us aid to the contras ended feb 29 
in miami the chief contra military field commander col 
enrique bermudez told reporters he supports the truce agreement 
and will comply with it he has expressed reservations saying he 
doesnt trust the sandinistas but he said wednesday his concerns 
do not mean he opposes contra leadership on the issue 
the transcript of the rebel radio broadcast wednesday cautioned 
contra combatants that agents of the communist sandinista 
dictatorship were telling troops the war had ended and they 
should put down their arms 
the arms of the commandos of liberty are the only guarantee 
for the nicaraguan people and these arms will never be turned in 
while nicaragua is not a free and just democracy it said 
most nicaraguans turned their thoughts away from the war and 
began vacations to mark holy week many looked for gasoline which 
is in short supply to fuel their trips to the pacific coastal 
beaches

wednesday

amnesty international said wednesday that british 
soldiers who killed three unarmed ira members on gibraltar may have 
deliberately avoided capturing them killing one guerrilla who lay 
wounded on the ground 
the londonbased human rights group said it is investigating the 
killings and has written prime minister margaret thatcher asking 
for an explanation of what happened 
the group said there are a number of circumstances which 
suggest that the three were deliberately targeted by the security 
forces and killed without challenge and that no attempt had been 
made to capture them 
the letter to mrs thatcher said it was the governments 
responsibility to provide a full and public account of the 
circumstances surrounding this incident an amnesty statement 
said 
british security forces shot the three march 6 as they walked 
toward the spanish border on the british island colony britain 
said the irish republican army members planned to plant a bomb on 
gibraltar 
the shooting aggravated britishirish relations and was followed 
by an upsurge of violence in the british province of northern 
ireland 
at the burial of the guerrillas march 16 a protestant gunman 
armed with grenades killed three people and injured 68 at the 
funeral three days later for one of those victims a mob attacked 
and killed two british soldiers who drove into the area 
amnesty said the three guerrillas were watched for weeks while 
they allegedly planned a bombing attack but no attempt was made to 
arrest them during this period 
the statement quoted witnesses as saying the three were shot 
without warning and that at least one of the victims having 
fallen to the ground after an initial gunshot was shot several 
times while lying helpless and incapacitated 
it noted that the government rejected demands for an inquiry 
into the shootings despite such calls by lawmakers 
amnesty also said it intends to send observers to the inquest 
into the deaths expected to be held in gibraltar in may 
the mainly roman catholic irish republican army is fighting to 
end british rule in northern ireland it wants to unite the 
predominantly protestant province with the mainly catholic republic 
of ireland 
since sectarian and political violence flared in northern 
ireland in 1969 391 british soldiers and 172 members of the ulster 
defense regiment a locally recruited militia have been killed 
there

wildlife officials who found three 
cold frightened abandoned black bear cubs in a telephone booth 
said wednesday theyre questioning a suspect who claims he fatally 
shot the bears mother in selfdefense 
the mothers head and claws were found in a bay cityarea 
residence tuesday night after department of natural resources 
officials received a tip on its tollfree poaching hotline said 
lt jay larson of the departments mio office 
hes claiming it was selfdefense larson said of the 
suspect whom he would not identify hes claiming he was out 
rabbit hunting and the bear attacked him 
the suspect on wednesday led wildlife officials to the bears 
carcass in a swamp in the au sable state forest in crawford county 
in the northern lower peninsula 
mark lutz a state conservation officer rescued the cubs last 
week after an anonymous caller said he had found them in a trash 
container in rural crawford county the man said he would leave 
them in a telephone booth from where he was calling 18 miles east 
of grayling 
the caller was gone when lutz arrived but the cubs two males 
and one female about 2 months old were in a milk crate wrapped in 
canvas 
they were cuddled up cold frightened and wet lutz said 
the cubs have been turned over to the wildlife recovery 
association in midland which will attempt to find a permanent home 
for the bears probably in zoos the past week of handling by 
humans probably has left them unable to return to the wild said 
caretaker barb rogers 
larson said it was unclear who placed the original anonymous 
call to the department but guesses it may have been one of three 
people who were in the rabbit hunting party 
the suspect is not being held and no charges have been filed 
but there may be charges filed later larson said 
before the animals were turned over to the wildlife recovery 
association lutz and his wife june cared for them at their 
grayling home 
the cubs joined the lutzes 9weekold daughter in being 
bottlefed mrs lutz said the couple carefully let their 
3yearold daughter and visitors to the house watch and pet the 
7pound animals 
they had a cute little growl mrs lutz said but added 
they had pretty good claws on them already they were teething 
like a puppy 
within two years the bears will weigh 200 to 300 pounds

the arizona senate dismissed the most 
serious of three impeachment charges against gov evan mecham on 
wednesday and moved toward considering a verdict on the two charges 
already heard 
the vote was a surprise to most involved including the senator 
who made the motion republican wayne stump who had predicted it 
would get no more than three votes 
several of those who voted to dismiss said they were doing so in 
order to avoid prejudicing mechams upcoming criminal trial on the 
charge that he concealed a 350000 campaign loan that would have 
been the subject of evidence on the third impeachment charge and 
stump said it would have put the governor in quasidouble 
jeopardy 
the motion passed on a simple majority with 16 of those present 
voting in favor and 12 voting no two senators were absent 
mecham refused to comment directly on the trial saying it would 
be inappropriate but in an upbeat speech to republican 
precinct committeemen a few hours after the senate vote he said he 
was confident that he would not be removed from office 
i can get along with the legislature an let bygones be bygones 
as far as im concerned and we can work together mecham said 
im here to serve the people of arizona 
those who voted yes to dropping the third impeachment count 
included all 11 senate democrats leading to speculation that the 
democrats believe they have enough votes to oust the republican 
governor from office without hearing the third count 
but democratic sen peter rios disputed the theory saying he 
had other reasons for voting as he did 
i think this needs to be brought to a conclusion he said of 
the 5weekold impeachment trial and this is my view of one way 
to bring it to a conclusion 
it would take a twothirds senate vote to remove mecham if he 
is convicted senators could then take another vote and bar him 
from ever holding office again in his criminal trial he faces a 
potential maximum sentence of 22 years in prison if convicted 
the senate vote was to dismiss the third count with 
prejudice meaning the senators could not decide to change their 
minds and reinstate the charge at a later date 
mechams lawyers jerris leonard and fred craft were jubilant 
as they left the senate leonard said he would tell mecham 
governor one down and two to go 
we should not put gov mecham or any other person in double 
jeopardy said democrat jones osborn of yuma 
before the vote other senators had urged putting the third 
charge in abeyance while they vote on the first two which allege 
that mecham misused 80000 from a protocol fund and obstructed and 
investigation of an alleged death threat by a staff member 
if the governor is exonerated he ought to know that so he can 
go on to other things said democrat carolyn walker if he is 
convicted the state ought not to have to go through the agony of 
this trial a day longer 
the governors trial on felony charges related to the 350000 
campaign loan begins april 21 in maricopa county superior court 
mecham 63 the first us governor to face an impeachment trial in 
six decades also faces a recall election may 17 
the senates action cleared the way for final arguments to begin 
on the two remaining counts originally lodged by the house or 
representatives arizona supreme court chief justice frank x 
gordon told senators to return thursday to discuss proposed legal 
instructions he said the trial would then recess until monday when 
arguments would be heard 
the surprise decision came after the senators heard rebuttal 
prosecution testimony on the second of the three charges against 
the governor then met in secret for nearly an hour to discuss 
whether to continue with the third charge or take a shortcut 
the secret session was held over objections from republican sen 
peter kay who said he felt the public was entitled to hear debate 
on such a crucial issue 
in her rebuttal testimony a former bookkeeper for mechams car 
dealership accused mechams son dennis of lying under oath 
i felt the truth should be known said lee christman who 
portrayed mecham pontiac as plagued with unpaid bills in july 1987 
when the governor took a disputed 80000 loan from a protocol fund 
she said she came forward to testify when i heard dennis lie 
the first allegation about which the senate heard testimony was 
that mecham tried to thwart an investigation into an alleged death 
threat by a staff member 
mecham says his car dealership didnt need the 80000 loan from 
the protocol fund and his son testified last week that the car 
dealership in suburban glendale was in glowing financial health at 
the time 
the prosecution says mecham pontiac needed money desperately 
and the governor misused state funds to get it the defense 
contends the money was private 
dennis mecham announced tuesday that the dealership has been 
sold because of plummeting sales he blamed bad publicity 
engendered by his fathers political battles 
under questioning by prosecutor william french ms christman 
testified that mecham pontiac needed at least 497000 in july just 
to pay its bills 
we had trouble through may and june she said it became 
critical that funds had to be brought in 
defense attorney jerris leonard trying to paint ms christman 
as a disgruntled fired employee noted that she had contacted 
prosecutors before she was subpoenaed to testify 
you took the effort to contact them asked leonard 
yes when i heard dennis lie she said 
she explained later that she felt the younger mecham improperly 
blamed her for bookkeeping problems she had inherited from a former 
employee her testimony also indicated that dennis mecham had lied 
about the business financial shape and his fathers motivation for 
borrowing the funds 
mecham a firstterm republican is accused of misusing the 
funds raised by his inaugural committee he has said he made the 
80000 loan only because he wanted to increase the fund by paying 
higher interest than it was getting at the bank 
he also testified he was aware of no particular financial 
problems at mecham pontiac and didnt keep up with the business 
regularly after his son took over as general manager in 1986

un talks on a ceasefire in the persian 
gulf war hit a snag tuesday as iran put off sending an envoy to new 
york as promised 
talks between secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar and a 
highlevel iranian official scheduled for wednesday and thursday 
were delayed indefinitely at irans request un officials said 
no reason was given 
iraq was to send an envoy next monday and tuesday but the 
postponement and iranian charges of chemical warfare by baghdad 
were expected to delay if not scuttle the discussions 
perez de cuellar had invited both iran and iraq to send 
representatives for the fourth round of talks since the security 
council adopted a ceasefire resolution last july 20 he has 
expressed frustration at the delay in putting a truce into effect 
irans envoy was expected to be the deputy foreign minister 
mohammad larijani iraq had not named a representative 
diplomats were pessimistic about a breakthrough and halt to the 
7yearold conflict they cited a bitter iraqi letter to perez de 
cuellar on monday and his own sharp retort and an increase in gulf 
warfare 
iraqi foreign minister tariq azia on monday sent a letter 
attacking the secretarygeneral for allegedly siding with iran the 
un chief retorted tuesday that iraqi charges were out of place 
the united states has been pushing for an arms embargo against 
iran to force the tehran government to comply with the ceasefire 
the diplomatic situation has been complicated by reports of 
iraqi use of chemical weapons iran charged that more than 5000 
people mostly iraqi kurds were killed and 7000 injured in 
chemical weapons attacks earlier this month it said the worsthit 
area was territory in iraq that had been captured by iran

a woman who a prosecutor said had an 
obsession to have a child was found guilty but mentally ill 
tuesday of firstdegree murder in the death of a pregnant woman who 
was strangled and her baby crudely cut from her womb 
the state district court jury also found darci pierce guilty but 
mentally ill of kidnapping and child abuse charges the sevenman 
fivewoman jury returned the verdicts after about six hours of 
deliberations over two days 
mrs pierce 20 had pleaded innocent by reason of insanity in 
the july 23 1987 death of cindy lynn ray 23 who was 8 months 
pregnant 
authorities said mrs ray was abducted from the parking lot of a 
kirtland air force base health clinic and was driven to the manzano 
mountains east of albuquerque where she was strangled and a key 
was used to cut her unborn bay from her body the baby survived 
mrs pierce was arrested after she went to an albuquerque 
hospital with a newborn girl and doctors determined she had not 
given birth 
both mrs pierce and the victim were married to airmen at the 
kirtland base 
district judge richard traub set sentencing for april 29 mrs 
pierce could receive life imprisonment on the murder conviction an 
additional 18 years on the kidnapping charge and 18 months on the 
childabuse charge 
in his closing arguments monday assistant district attorney 
harry zimmerman said the evidence showed mrs pierce had planned 
her actions and knew what she was doing 
zimmerman said mrs pierce elected to take a baby to satisfy 
her obsession to have a child and perhaps more important to save 
her marriage 
but defense attorney john bogren a public defender told jurors 
that witnesses during the trial testified mrs pierce suffered from 
a mental illness and multiple personality disorder 
it is a bizarre crime it deserves a bizarre explanation 
bogren said 
under state law a jury finding of guilty but mentally ill means 
the person does not meet the legal tests for insanity but had a 
substantial mental disorder that impaired judgment at the time of 
the crime 
the defendant is subject to standard sentences but the state 
corrections department is required to provide counseling and 
treatment as it deems necessary 
bogren said an appeal will be filed 
mrs rays husband samuel returned to his home state of utah 
with the infant girl named amelia and her 2yearold brother

veterans groups tuesday praised a state 
supreme court decision overturning the death sentence of a killer 
of two young girls because testimony about his combat trauma in 
vietnam was barred 
the news from california is very welcome barry kasinitz 
spokesman for the 38000member vietnam veterans of america said 
hearing of phillip luceros successful appeal 
posttraumatic stress disorder is in fact curable in many 
instances kasinitz said the biggest problem with the death 
penalty is that its the only penalty thats not reversible 
just two weeks ago another vietnam veteran wayne felde died 
in louisianas electric chair after arguing unsuccessfully that 
flashbacks from vietnam drove him to murder 
i am appalled that the american people are willing to execute 
vietnam veterans who may be imprisoned through no fault of their 
own said veterans activist george gorman of redondo beach 
calif who receives disability benefits for postvietnam trauma 
i consider that an act of vengeance and blood lust 
the seven justices unanimously reversed luceros death sentence 
monday saying potentially favorable evidence some of it related 
to his reaction to vietnam was excluded from the penalty phase of 
his trial 
the court upheld the conviction of lucero 42 for murdering 
neighbor girls ages 7 and 10 in yucaipa in april 1980 luceros 
sentence will not automatically revert to the alternative of life 
without possibility of parole however because the court voted 61 
not to rule out a new penalty trial 
prosecutor john kochis of san bernardino county said his office 
would review the ruling and check availability of witnesses from 
the 1981 trial before deciding whether to seek a new sentencing 
trial 
justice stanley mosk the lone dissenter who wanted the court to 
order a life sentence for lucero said he did not mean to 
countenance violence by veterans 
i do believe however that this defendant deserves compassion 
from a society that in the first instance taught him to kill 
mosk said 
california is not among the several states that have laws 
explicitly allowing a defense based on postvietnam stress said 
michael satris luceros lawyer 
lucero spent 7 years in the army much of it in vietnam after 
lying about his age and enlisting at 16 a psychiatrist testified 
that he had the symptoms of posttraumatic stress emotional 
isolation sleep disturbance loss of memory and concentration 
survivor guilt and recurrent flashbacks 
on the day of the killings the psychiatrist said lucero 
already under stress from marital problems may have suffered 
flashbacks triggered by the cackling of a goose and the sound of 
police helicopters searching for the girls 
the psychiatrist was allowed to testify but was attacked by the 
prosecution as a hired gun the court said a counselor from a 
veterans administration hospital who was prepared to testify that 
lucero was probably driven by postvietnam trauma might have been 
more persuasive but was not allowed to testify

reducing class size in public schools is very 
expensive and likely a a waste of money and effort for those 
seeking improved student achievement according to a study issued 
wednesday by the department of education 
there now are 24 pupils in the typical public elementary school 
classroom down from 30 in 1961 past research has indicated 
classes would have to be reduced to 15 students to have any 
appreciable impact on student impact the study said 
but that would cost upwards of 69 billion and require the 
hiring of 1 million new teachers at a time when schools already are 
having difficulty filling faculty vacancies according to tommy m

for many years french filmmaker louis malle 
didnt think he wanted to deal with a very traumatic memory of his 
childhood 
it was like my secret something i didnt want to talk about 
even less so make a film about he said but it stuck with me 
so vividly that 10 years ago i decided to give it a try 
the result of his painful recollection is au revoir les 
enfants goodbye children one of the five nominees for the 
academy award for best foreign language film of 1987 
au revoir les enfants epitomizes the kind of films entered 
this year in oscars foreignlanguage category most of the movies 
are highly personal either in the subject matter or the years of 
devotion given to the project by the filmmaker the other nominees 
are 
babettes feast denmark based on a short story by isak 
dinesen tells of two unmarried and very pious sisters who take a 
french political refugee babette into their home in norway in 
return for housekeeping she later repays them with her art the 
feast the director gabriel axel spent 14 years trying to get his 
movie made 
course completed spain about a depressed writer who 
escapes to the seashore after a failure and is followed by an old 
flame and his bothersome son the film was cowritten produced and 
directed by jose luis garcia 
the family italy an epic history of 80 years in the 
life of a roman family told with loving care by ettore scola la 
bal 
pathfinder norway written and directed by nils gaup a 
tale of revenge by a lapp boy whose family is killed in a raid 
malle based au revoir les enfants on his experience as a boy 
of 11 during the german occupation of france his welltodo paris 
family sent him to the safety of a catholic boarding school in 
fontainebleau there he became friends with a brilliant jewish boy 
who was being hidden from the gestapo by a priest the ruse was 
uncovered and three jewish boys as well as the head priest were 
sent to their deaths in concentration camps 
i began writing notes when i was making a film of the same 
period lacombe lucien 1974 malle remarked in an interview 
i decided there were little things there but not necessarily a 
film 
after i had been working in america a few years all those 
things came back maybe because i was far from home my childhood 
returned so strongly that i tried to put it into a screenplay 
maybe i decided to make peace with my memories he said 
also i reached the point that i thought i should give it away 
that it was interesting enough to make it into a film so other 
people could share it with me 
from that point i was really exhilarated and excited i wasnt 
sure i would make a good film but i was sure the material was 
really strong once i had the first draft of the screenplay i 
started preproduction and i worked with great enthusiasm it was 
like a deliverance in a way 
malle told his associates from the beginning that he would not 
make the film unless he found two remarkable children for the 
leading roles because they had to carry the whole movie after 
interviewing hundreds of parisian boys over a fivemonth period he 
found his actors gaspard manesse and raphael pejto both 
inexperienced in film work 
axel is a danish director who has divided his career between his 
native land and france he became obsessed with a dinesen story 
about a woman who escaped a 19thcentury french revolution to serve 
as cook for a pair of devout spinsters in a remote danish village 
formerly a worldclass chef the refugee stephane audran devotes 
her entire winnings in a lottery to a feast in honor of the 
spinsters late ministerfather 
fourteen years ago when i tried to make the film the french 
said ok the danes said no recalled axel who needed the 
backing of both countries i went from producer to producer to 
producer and they said you cant make a film with no story no 
action no dialogue they did not see the possibilities 
axel needed between 25 million and 3 million to make 
babettes feast he could understand the danish reluctance 
there are only 5 million people in denmark and even if every one 
of them went to the movie it would not be enough to show a 
profit 
the danish film institute finally provided 75 percent of the 
budget with rave reviews and the academy nomination the 
investment seems secure 
following his success with babettes feast axel hopes to 
film a project he has nurtured for 20 years a version of 
hamlet based on the earliest histories of the saga from which 
shakespeare borrowed his plot 
the histories tell of the prince returning to denmark to kill 
the uncle who murdered the king axel said but the original 
has a happy ending hamlet marries ophelia and they live happily 
ever after

ziad rahbani has put the chaos and 
insanity of warbattered beirut to music in an attempt to blend 
arabic music and jazz into a new form 
he calls it oriental jazz describing it as something like 
a hamburger that tastes of felafel a popular arab snack made of 
spicy minced chickpeas and beans 
the son of lebanons most popular singer fairouz rahbani has 
come under fire from arab traditionalists for his pioneering 
efforts to bridge the gap between arab and western culture with 
music 
just as automobiles replaced donkeys traditional music must 
develop to reflect the times rahbani said in an interview 
everything has to evolve 
his mother who since the death of egypts revered umm kalthoum 
is the arab worlds leading singer has performed some of his 
compositions at her sellout concerts blending lebanese folklore 
with western syncopation and phrasing 
rahbani 32 has been working on his concept since the 1970s and 
gave his first oriental jazz concert in wartorn beirut in 1985 
one of the fundamental similarities between arabic and 
occidental music he said is that both rely on improvisation in 
jazz the same basic tune is played in a different interpretation 
by each of the musicians 
oriental string and wind instruments such as the oud a sort of 
lute the zitherlike qanoun and the nay a reed flute are 
associated with an improvisation type of music called taqssim 
classical arab singers such as the legendary kalthoum are 
famous for often stretching one song for more than a hour the 
style is called tafrid repeating one couplet over and over 
but each time subtly different 
its this personal element or subjectivity that creates the 
alteration although the message is one rahbani said another 
common factor is the similarity between blues and classical arabic 
songs both are melancholic and dragging types of music 
always unconventional rahbani plays jazz standards on the oud 
known in the arab world as the king of instruments giving them 
unusual harmonies 
he has adapted wellknown jazz compositions such as thelonius 
monks round midnight with an oriental interpretation often 
usig arabic harmonies and rhythms to give the songs a unique tonal 
color 
i admire the music of composers like charley parker stan getz 
and dizzy gillespie he said but my music is not western its 
lebanese with a different way of expression this interaction 
between oriental and occidental instruments comes out in a natural 
harmony 
many arab purists claim oriental jazz is an illigitimate form 
that has planted alien seeds in classical arabic music 
to be sure rahbanis music reflects the hybrid heritage of 
lebanon which until the civil war erupted in 1975 was a cultural 
melting pot where east met west but it also is deeply rooted in 
the traumatic events of the sectarian strife the bloody street 
battles between rival militias and three years of violent israeli 
occupation after the 1982 invasion 
a leftist greek orthodox rahbani also writes plays and 
satirical radio shows centered on his violent environment that mock 
the sectarian divisions of his country and the traditional 
political thinking that has taken lebanon to the very brink of 
catacylsm 
his latest record ana mush kafer or im not an 
athiest was hailed by most lebanese christians and moslems 
alike as an expression of their miserable political social and 
economic situation 
one passage says 
we have to sell diamond rings and gold mines 
to pay the bill in restaurants 
nothing is left no health and no job 
even my home was lit by a shell 
rahbani comes from a major musical dynasty in the arab world 
his father assi rahbani who died in beirut in 1986 was one of 
the founders of modern arab music together with his lyricist 
brother mansour they wrote most of fairouzs famous songs and 
musical plays now her son is writing and arranging for her 
in a recent performance in londons festival hall where the 
onenight boxoffice take of 210000 broke the record held by 
frank sinatra she sang rahbanis plaintive khalik bilbait or 
stay at home with an orchestration and phrasing reminiscent of 
ella fitzgerald he accompanied his mother on piano

that champion of liberty and law moses dominates the drama 
that the worlds jews celebrate beginning today at sundown 
recalling humanitys first recorded triumph over tyranny 
let my people go moses challenged the egyptian pharaoh who 
finally capitulated after a series of plagues and calamities struck 
his empire 
the ensuing escape of the ragged oppressed throng of jewish 
slaves has animated the cause of freedom in history ever since and 
is the steady refrain of the weeklong passover observance 
remember the day in which you went forth from the house of 
bondage and how the lord freed you with a mighty hand 
the influence of moses in leading the israelites out of 
enslavement fired offspring religions in toppling other ancient 
oppressive regimes his impact also figured in the early migrations 
to freedom in america 
his were the hands that broke the gods of egypt mesopotamia 
greece writes novelist herman wouk islam and christianity 
stand on his shoulders both faiths are unthinkable without him 
wouk author of several bestselling novels says in a volume 
newly published by little brown amp co this is my god that 
the faithful believe moses talked directly with god 
the record is that he changed history exactly as if he had 
wouk adds he disappeared into darkness on a mountain and came 
back with a law the ten commandments 
first israel and then half the world accepted that law as 
the word of god there is no god in the west to this hour but the 
god of moses 
he was an unlikely choice for his bold undertaking wouk notes 
a desert dweller of 80 with a wife and children when he was 
called by god to do a hard job and like a man of sense he tried 
to beg off 
once he put his hand to the task however there was no 
standing before him they say a man grows to the stature of his 
office moses grew to the superhuman size of his job and grew to 
last 
initially after slaying a brutal egyptian taskmaster for 
beating jewish workers moses had fled to midian and married a 
sheepowners daughter 
but the people of israel groaned under their bondage and 
cried out for help the book of exodus recounts and god heard 
that cry and knew their suffering 
when the divine summons came to moses in a burning bush to go 
back confront pharoah and deliver the people from enslavement 
moses demurred saying who am i for such heroics 
but i will be with you god assured 
moses then tending his fatherinlaws flocks wasnt even 
clear who this god of israels forefathers was what is his 
name 
god couching his identity in the enigmatic terms of existence 
itself said in that strange passage of response i am who i am 
say this to the people of israel i am has sent me to you 
moses kept trying to get out of it oh my lord i am not 
eloquent i am slow of speech and tongue and people wont 
listen the account says the argument went on and finally god 
angered 
he insisted he would be with your mouth telling moses what 
to say to pharoah and moses brother aaron a great speaker could 
do the talking to the people 
moses gave in returned to egypt repeatedly faced the powerful 
hardboiled pharaoh thus says the lord the god of israel let 
my people go 
but pharaoh spurned it laying heavier work and harsher 
treatment on the enslaved jews again and again the account says 
moses struck back with divine reprisals pestilences flies frogs 
deaths the nile running blood red 
the forces of nature seem to work for moses wouk writes 
other conquerors and master spirits in the flood tide of their 
lives have appeared to have command of favoring events 
we call the strange power luck or destiny or a star 
whatever power moses had wherever it came from it was enough to 
wrest the freedom of a slave people from the grand military tyranny 
of the ancient world 
it was later that moses ascended that quaking mountain wreathed 
in smoke in a crescendo of trumpet sounds god spoke in thunder 
issuing those lasting commandments honored by jews christians and 
moslems 
since the time moses brought his vision of god to the earth 
there have been the most violent objections to the laws he said 
were gods laws wouk writes but his laws still live today 
challenged more violently than ever they live we call art 
inspired when passing years cannot dim it it is no proof of moses 
inspiration that his law still lives but the rocklike strength 
of his law at least makes it one of the marvels of history

there is nothing very new about recycling one of 
natures materials since nature itself has been doing that with 
air and water since the very beginning of time 
but in the 1960s when the aluminum can was introduced to the 
markets and unfortunately the highways and recreational areas of 
america recycling was a relatively new idea to business big 
business especially 
in retrospect you might wonder why to reuse aluminum was to 
save money protect the environment and generate the good will any 
company needs to succeed in selling its products it was good 
business but business wasnt sure it was 
this month the aluminum industry observes the 20th anniversary 
of the decision to recycle old cans food trays gutters 
downspouts window blinds house siding and beach chairs in doing 
so it looks back on a lesson learned 
the lesson is that it is foolish to waste and the proof of it 
is in the kind of statistics that industry pays attention to 
in that time according to reynolds aluminum which claims to 
have begun the first program in march 1968 the industry has 
recycled 105 billion pounds of the metal equal to 268 billion 
cans 
in that time it has paid 375 billion to collectors saved 60 
billion kilowatt hours of electricity conserved 184 million tons 
of bauxite an import that would have added to the trade deficit 
and created 30000 jobs 
recycling has financed charities spurred entrepreneurship 
saved highway departments big dollars provided a third of the 
industrys raw materials and undoubtedly protected companies from 
environmental law suits 
what had been viewed as a problem was really an opportunity in 
fact dozens of opportunities consider for example the enoromous 
savings on freight costs through use of lighterweight containers 
without recycling it is unlikely the aluminum can would have 
gained much acceptance since its virtues such as corrosion 
resistance and durability make it persist as trash not only in 
landfills but wherever discarded 
the 1960s was a time for activists the stirrings of a consumer 
revolt were being felt and environmentalists were making the 
nation pollution conscious it wasnt a fortuitous time to 
introduce a can with such qualities 
looking back the environmentalists might have destroyed the 
industry in its infancy had recycling not been accepted and 
developed 
as it was the beginnings werent smooth in 1968 when reynolds 
began recycling in los angeles only eight beverages three soft 
drinks and five beers were sold in aluminum cans 
few people even those in the industry believed recycling could 
work on a large scale many within our own industry thought 
largescale consumer recycling was a pipe dream says william o 
bourke reynolds president 
much to their surprise he comments in remarks prepared for 
the 20th anniversary we recycled one million pounds of aluminum 
in that first year and by 1983 just 15 years later we were 
exceeding that amount daily 
today according to reynolds more than 95 percent of all canned 
beer and soft drinks are sold in aluminum 
while there are lessons in this tale for industry and 
government there is one for individuals too if you rip the 
siding off your house or decide on new lawn furniture or throw a 
big summer party with lots to drink save the waste 
then find yourself a recycling center there are 10000 of them 
around the country you might earn as much as 32 cents a pound for 
your troubles but even if you dont youll be doing the 
environment a favor

a new york retiree who depends on her savings 
and investments for income recently asked a broker for some advice 
she was worried about the volatility of both the bond and stock 
markets and had been especially upset by a dire forecast for the 
economy she had heard on television 
in her situation she told the broker she wanted to take the 
safest possible approach even if it meant sacrificing a few 
percentage points in yield 
your money market funds are fine the broker told her and 
dont sell that bond fund if you get out of it now youll be 
taking a loss 
most financial advisers would give the broker good marks for his 
comment on money market mutual funds but they would flunk him for 
his reasoning on the other fund 
when people make choices about whether to hold or sell an 
investment these advisers say they should give very little weight 
to what has happened in the past the future is what matters 
that goes they add for any type of investment that fluctuates 
in value be it a stock bond mutual fund real estate or a 
baseball card for that matter 
waiting until the value of your property is back up to your 
purchase price before you sell is irrational says john reed in 
his newsletter real estate investors monthly your purchase 
price is irrelevant to your decision to hold or sell 
values go up and values go down and in their going up and 
down they may pass the same figure twice but values do not come 
back like homing pigeons or rubber bands that have been stretched 
to think that they do is incorrect analysis and can lead to 
bad decisions 
after the wide swings in many investment markets over the past 
year including the crash in stock prices last october there are 
countless people sitting with paper losses on their investments 
even supposedly hardnosed professionals acknowledge that it is 
only human nature to resist selling something at a loss 
in my work as a money manager i see two powerful emotions 
time and time again says paul merriman who publishes an 
advisory letter called fund exchange 
the desire to break even on an investment regardless of how 
costly a bullheaded pursuit of this goal may prove 
the desire to buy the past which manifests itself in the 
insistence on purchasing a particular stock fund or other 
investment because it has done well in the past without taking 
into account the amount of risk that may be involved 
the choice of selling rather than holding on does have some 
consequences that must be considered all other things being equal 
it is worthwhile to try to time your sales of losing investments 
with tax consequences in mind 
also sales of some types of investments involve significant 
transaction costs that cant be ignored and the market for an 
outoffavor investment may be relatively illiquid so that you 
might be faced with accepting a bigger price concession than you 
feel comfortable with 
these and other considerations militate against changing your 
mind too often jumping from one investment to another 
still veterans of the investing wars say no investment that 
falls in value with changing market conditions owes you your 
money back 
says reed all decisions including a decision to own 
property are choices between alternatives when confronted with a 
choice between alternatives you should always pick the best one 
that sounds obvious but many investors clearly lose sight of 
it especially when they get bad news like a value drop

their claim adds another twist to one of the more puzzling 
challenges of todays marketplace what is the price of a car it 
isnt the first time the question was posed 
in fact detailed sticker pricing on car windows was among the 
primary accomplishments of the consumer movement that began in the 
1960s before then not even a cryptographer could foretell with 
certainty what you might pay 
the stickers helped but still left many questions in part 
because of the number of options available on a particular car and 
like it or not some cars were available only with the options 
included and others came without them 
the options themselves so numerous present customers with 
decisions many feel unqualified to make their despair can be 
compared to a novice traveler trying to develop without help from 
an agent a lowestcost air itenerary 
when car companies decided to compete with rebates and 
belowmarket interest rates still greater complexity was added to 
the challenge and say the credit union and banking people it 
made buyers easy targets for sellers 
in the petition they state that the cutrate financing by 
chrysler financial corp ford motor credit co and general motors 
acceptance corp often applies only to twoyear loans whereas many 
customers need much longer terms 
such offers they say in the petition are bait to lure 
customers into showrooms where in spite of the low interest rates 
customers first become aware of the unacceptable high monthly 
payments on the twoyear loans 
but is it deception or is it merely an attempt by intensely 
competitve marketers to sell their products in the most enticing 
way they know how the rates are honestly quoted theyre 
available if only for twoyear periods 
and if the automobile financing companies are quilty what then 
can be said about many savings and commercial banks that publicize 
high returns on their certificates of deposit and quietly 
restrict them to larger accounts 
basic to all this is the same question that prevailed in the 
1960s when it was widely asserted that consumers were at a 
disadvantage in the marketplace because they were amateurs and 
sellers were professionals 
since then the consumer has become more aware of how the 
marketplace works the result of legislation advocacy groups 
education publicity and honest efforts by sellers to make products 
and policies understandable 
still many people suspect that perhaps the ingenuity of the 
marketplace pros may have developed more rapidly in the past two 
decades than the awareness of customers

its the big switch the great turnabout a 
joke on death ancient imagery has the resurrected christ 
confronting the devil and laughing at him about it 
thats a little known aspect of easter lore the zanily 
uproarious upside down funniness of a holiday christians celebrate 
this weekend 
blessed are you that weep now for you shall laugh jesus 
said and the fellowship of merry christians seeks to restore that 
bubbling note of laughter to the occasion 
the joke that god played on satan by raising jesus from the 
dead was indisputably the greatest and most imaginative practical 
joke in the history of the world says carl samra 
samra of box 668 kalamazoo mich is coordinator of the 
ecumenical fellowship grown to about 10000 members and editor of 
its newsandjoke bimonthly the joyful noiseletter 
the fellowship which sees humor and delight in faith and 
circulates comic anecdotes about it wants to resurrect an old 
christian custom celebrating bright monday a day for merry 
pranks and frolic 
also called white monday it comes the day after easter and 
according to the fellowship used to be celebrated as a day of 
joy and laughter by roman catholic protestant and eastern 
orthodox believers 
its a time for the laughing of the redeemed the dancing of 
the liberated writes noted german protestant theologian jurgen 
moltman 
as jesus put it your sorrow will turn into joy he 
reassured his apostles that my joy may be in you and that your 
joy may be full 
such passages inspired artist r s riddick of tucson ariz to 
paint his sketch of jesus smiling the joyful christ another 
painting jesus laughing is by willis wheatley of praise 
screen prints traverse city mich 
the fellowship of merry christians sponsors its holy humor 
month in april with monday set for a day of happy festivities 
picnics singing dancing telling jokes and fun 
mrs soule papademetriou librarian at orthodoxys holy cross 
school of theology in brookline mass says that in early greek 
tradition easter monday was a day of joy and laughter at 
christs triumph over death 
that zest games and high spirits continued through bright 
week she says 
although origins of the celebration are hazy she says it may 
have been inspired by an easter midnight sermon by fourthcentury 
greek preacher john chrysostom who envisioned the resurrected 
christ laughing at the devil 
hell was angered when it encountered thee christ in the 
lower regionsfor it was mocked ridiculed with laughter 
chrysostom said 
an old adage has it that the devil cant stand the sound of 
laughter and slinks away from it 
monsignor arthur tonne of marion kan a roman catholic priest 
of 83 and author of five volumes of jokes priests can tell 
says several catholic orders have observed monday as a day of fun 
the rev francis weiser in the easter book writes that in 
early christianty all of easter week was one continuous feast 
and easter monday remains a legal holiday in most european 
countries 
he says in medieval times easter monday was a time of special 
festivities of emmaus walks into the woods and fields for 
pinics folk dancing singing and games 
one sport was was called drenching a goodnatured game in 
which boys and girls in outlandish costumes doused each other or 
their families with buckets or bottles of water reciting playful 
ditties 
a protestant custom in england was heaving groups of men 
carrying a chair aloft would go from house to house getting a lady 
to sit in the chair then lifting her three times shouting 
hurrahs demanding forfeit of a kiss 
during this holy humor month the fellowship urges divided 
christians to be in the words of the apostle paul fools for 
christ to see the follies of their divisions and work for 
christian unity 
that was what jesus prayed for on the night before his 
crucifixion that led to his resurrection that all may be one so 
that the world may believe

at the sound of the knock a young 
mutt named roody padded over to the door to look then walked back 
into the kitchen and pawed at cary voorhees to get her attention 
good girl roody ms voorhees said enthusiastically 
petting the dog as it led her to the door 
roody a 10monthold stray with the spots of an australian 
shepherd was undergoing training at dogs for the deaf the oldest 
training center in the country for hearingear dogs 
dogs for the deaf was founded 10 years ago on a former dairy 
farm near this rustic southern oregon town each graduate earns an 
orange collar and leash and become the ears for a deaf person who 
has been waiting as long as a year 
we have people tell us after they get a dog that they never 
realized how many people came over and they just didnt hear them 
at the door said robin dickson who took over running dogs for 
the deaf after the death of her father roy kabat the founder 
a smart dog led kabat to start dogs for the deaf his daughter 
explained 
there was a deaf lady in minnesota she said she had a 
dog that had trained itself to let her know when there was a sound 
the dog got hit and killed by a car she went to her 
audiologist and said youve got to get me another dog 
he contacted the american humane society in denver and they 
called my dad in he had worked for many years training dogs for 
movies in southern california and was retired he became so 
intrigued by it that he came back here and started dogs for the 
deaf 
pins in a map on the office wall show that the 300 dogs placed 
by dogs for the deaf are spread from coast to coast with heavy 
concentrations in the big cities 
we very carefully screen the applicants mrs dickson said 
if you can hear a smoke alarm go off you dont need a dog 
deaf people who have someone at home who can hear are ineligible 
they also have to be able to physically and financially care 
for a dog once they get it mrs dickson said sometimes we can 
arrange a sponsor for a dog if a person cant afford it 
the four trainers go to humane society shelters around oregon 
and northern california to find small to mediumsized dogs that are 
playful alert and comfortable around people if you had a great 
big great dane jumping up on you to let you know the phone was 
ringing that wouldnt be so good mrs dickson said 
the dogs mostly are mutts 
so many purebreds are so inbred that their disposition and 
temperament are destroyed mrs dickson said 
about half of the dogs flunk out before their three to six 
months of training is done trainer doreen james said 
stubbornness is one of the major reasons she said that 
doesnt show up for one to three months its lots of fun for them 
until they realize they have to do it all the time 
in a onebedroom apartment built in the loft of the old dairy 
barn the dogs learn to respond to a telephone a knock at the 
door a smoke alarm an oven buzzer and a babys cry 
trainers also take the dogs to nearby grants pass and medford to 
get used to the bustle of stores being around people and riding in 
cars 
the dogs are rewarded by praise attention and play 
you have to be really up ms voorhees said some dogs 
take a week to learn to put their paws on the table 
once the dog is ready the trainer takes it to the recipient 
spending five days there while they get used to each other 
a fully trained dog represents an investment of 3000 which is 
covered by contributions from supporters of the program 
we get more people who send us donations to help the dogs than 
to help the deaf people mrs dickson said we help save the 
unwanted dogs so they want to help us 
dogs are by no means the only aids for the deaf who nowadays 
can choose from an array of mechanical devices including smoke 
alarms with intense flashing lights alarm clocks that flash or 
make the bed shake and bracelets that vibrate at the sound of a 
baby crying 
demand is also growing for telecommunications devices for the 
deaf keyboards known as tdds that plug into the phone to allow 
people to type messages to each other and decoders for 
closedcaption television 
its a very big market and its growing rapidly said 
debbie ander vice president of marketing for computty a national 
distributer for aids for the deaf based in fort worth texas 
anita farb administrative assistant for the national 
association of the deaf in silver spring md said the 16 million 
americans with hearing problems are demanding more as they become 
aware of what is available 
the demand for hearingear dogs is steadily growing mrs 
dickson said 
to meet the demand dogs for the deaf is moving to bigger 
quarters in central point where there will be kennels for 60 dogs 
instead of 25 and four training apartments instead of one 
the dogs give unconditional love mrs dickson said to a 
lot of deaf people this is the most important thing because they 
lead such isolated lives

a curious new program is going out over 
polands state radio every monday morning 
its called the west speaks and it is composed entirely of 
excerpts of polishlanguage broadcasts by radio free europe the 
voice of america the british broadcasting corp and other western 
radio stations 
the segments are broadcast without comment or counterpoint but 
since the program went on the air the polish media and officials 
have criticized the western broadcasts with greater frequency 
the western stations always have been characterized here as 
hostile propaganda tools but communist government says the west 
speaks is one way to counter the influence of the broadcasts that 
deliver a mixture of uncensored news features and commentary 
poland stopped the electronic jamming of western broadcasts jan 
1 and poles now can freely tune in to them 
but government authorities have been raising the question of 
their fairness with western officials including the director of 
the us information agency charles z wick who was here on a 
visit in march 
the authorities say that in the struggle for the hearts and 
minds of the polish people they cannot afford to overlook the 
influence of the western stations 
it doesnt matter how many people listen to it when it is 
something very dangerous government spokesman jerzy urban said 
in an interview even if its only 100 people that is enough 
because the report will spread 
at one time particularly during the cold war years in the 
1950s it was a crime to listen to the western stations 
today however the strains of yankee doodle dandy the 
signon tune of the voice of america can be heard coming from 
apartments in housing blocks 
urban said polish authorities believed that countering the 
broadcasts with polemics and arguments was better than 
continuing the jamming 
a public opinion poll quoted by the official news agency pap 
said 80 percent of respondents approved the decision to end the 
jamming but it said the number of listeners has not risen 
significantly 
how many people actually listen remains a matter of dispute 
according to a survey quoted by urban the percentage of poles 
who listen to radio free europe either regularly or occasionally is 
16 percent up 2 percentage points since jamming ended only 3 
percent or 12 million out of the population of 375 million 
listen as often as once a week he said 
but the board for international broadcasting the body that 
oversees radio free europe in munich west germany says 59 percent 
of poles listen to its broadcasts occasionally and nearly 14 
percent at least once a week 
an informal survey of half a dozen warsaw residents indicated 
that most preferred the voice of america or the bbc to radio free 
europe known as rfe on grounds that their information was more 
reliable 
recent rfe broadcasts were heavy with reports of demonstrations 
and protests in poland speeches and statements by leaders of the 
outlawed solidarity trade union and accounts of opposition 
activities in other countries of the soviet bloc 
the west speaks was conceived to show what sort of 
argumentation is used by these stations said witold stankowski 
an executive of polish radio one 
he said the show which premiered in october was given a time 
slot when we have a pretty good audience but said he could not 
judge its popularity or say how long it would be continued 
in recent months a drumbeat of commentaries have shown up on the 
pap service and in staterun newspapers disputing specific news 
items on the western stations urban has made denunciations of the 
broadcasts almost a fixture at his weekly news conferences 
in the interview urban noted that listenership tends to rise in 
times of public anxiety such as during the 1986 chernobyl nuclear 
accident in the soviet union 
he claimed rfes disgraceful methods frightened people in 
its reports on chernobyl and in its coverage of polands 
announcement in late january of price increases totaling 42 percent 
in 1988 
radio free europe presents the opinion that prices in fact 
will go up twice as much he said they want to cause and 
really do cause an increase in wage demands 
us ambassador john davis defends the broadcasts 
the great bulk of what goes out seems to me to be a repetition 
of what already has been published in the west he said it is 
broadcast in sometimes with comment and comment is fair game 
wick the usia director who arrived in poland on march 23 for a 
series of talks with polish officials said the polish side raised 
objections about radio free europe and the voice of america and the 
complaints were discussed very forthrightly 
wick said the voice of america which is part of usia and radio 
free europe which is privately operated but largely funded by the 
us government have charters that mandate that they be 
objective and accurate 
i invited the authorities to give me specific instances when 
they were not he said 
he added that editorials on radio free europe and the voice of 
america are not intended to be objective but to reflect the 
editorial viewpoint of the united states government 
as such he said they might not be pleasing to poland

if the academy awards were based on boxoffice 
popularity fatal attraction would eliminate its four opponents 
and win as best picture with ease 
if oscars were based on media acclaim broadcast news no 
doubt would be the winner the funny incisive look at how network 
journalists do their jobs under constant pressure captivated most 
critics yet broadcast news has been a disappointment at the 
box office 
despite mediocre attendance and mixed notices the homestretch 
favorite for best picture of 1987 is the the last emperor a 
mammoth epic centering on the life of pu yi boy emperor of china 
and later puppet ruler of manchuria for the japanese bernardo 
bertolucci was nominated for director and cowriter but the actors 
were overlooked 
the thriller fatal attraction was by far the biggest 
moneymaker of the year its combination of adultery and terror 
selling 150 million worth of tickets in the united states and 
canada 
fatal attraction also picked up nominations for michael 
douglas glenn close and anne archer as well as director adrian 
lyne and writer james dearden 
lyne a graduate of british tv commercials admits that he was 
sold on fatal attraction from the time he read the script 
it was a pageturner he said it was sent to me when i 
was in france i sat down on some steps and two hours later i was 
still on the steps finishing it off it was something i couldnt 
put down i thought if i could provide the visual equipment and not 
screw it up that it had a fighting chance of being as interesting 
a movie 
lyne signed on with producers stanley jaffe and sherry lansing 
and worked with dearden on the script the director carries a tape 
recorder while preparing a film and he made notes of matters he 
could use such as his own sons attempt to demonstrate card tricks 
the three leading actors of broadcast news william hurt 
holly hunter and albert brooks also were nominated for awards 
james l brooks was named as writer and producer but astoundingly 
did not receive a nomination as director 
i wanted to do a romantic comedy brooks said just 
through a series of circumstances i wound up being around a number 
of network news people 
brooks who once worked as a news writer for cbs news spent 
months hanging around in studios of washington and new york for his 
research the result is a verisimilitude that has attracted the 
praise of many network news people including the curmudgeonly andy 
rooney 
bertolucci amazed the film world by winning permission to film a 
movie with political overtones within china more amazingly he was 
able to shoot inside the fabled forbidden city the shrine of 
chinese history 
the fact that this movie exists is another proof that china is 
changing the italian director said only eight years ago it 
was inconceivable for the chinese to let a western filmmaker do a 
scene about the red guards as at the end of the movie when you see 
the cultural revolution 
nominee hope and glory is john boormans valentine to his 
boyhood during the battle of britain the writerdirectorproducer 
won triple nominations but his actors received none the movies 
boxoffice performance has been less than impressive 
despite the background of german bombings the film is primarily 
comedic 
for me as a child the experience of the war was largely one 
of exhilaration joy and fun boorman said this is what the 
film is its great entertainment its very funny there were 
moments of horror when people were killed as a child you forget 
this very quickly 
also up for best film of the year is moonstruck a romantic 
comedy about an excitable italian family in brooklyn cher vincent 
gardenia and olympia dukakis are acting nominees as well as 
director norman jewison and writer john patrick shanley 
moonstruck has been a major success at the box office doing 
more than 50 million in business so far 
after a pair of heavy dramas a soldiers story and agnes 
of god jewison was in the mood for a romantic comedy his 
first choice to play loretta the widow torn between two lovers 
was cher 
for me there has always been something streety about cher 
a lacking in pretension the canadian director said shes a 
very honest person inperson and on the screen she looks 
italian although shes part armenian and part cherokee 
yet directors dont always get their first choice for lead 
performers as was the case with fatal attraction as right as 
glenn close might seem for the role of the jilted alix director 
lyne said isabelle adjani was actually his first choice since she 
had played a similar role in a french film 
but after a few months of casting i like to see everyone i 
can i thought it would be more effective to go with someone who 
was not obviously sensual from the outset he said 
glenn close pursued the movie and was prepared to come in and 
test which was unusual for a star when i saw her testing with 
michael douglas it was already decided on 
lyne had once worked with douglas as producer on starman 
which he ended up not directing 
i had seen michael almost every day for a year and i saw him 
as a man who was infinitely charming to both men and women but was 
also very vulnerable lyne said i had never seen that in 
movies he had done i had always seen more of his father the 
heroic the macho qualities

doubts about ritalin a drug used to help 
hyperactive children concentrate have drawn the attention of 
lawyers and reporters and prompted some parents to halt treatment 
but the associated press has found the firestorm is being fanned by 
a group with ties to the church of scientology and a history of 
opposition to psychiatry in the first story of a threeday series 
r is for ritalin the ap examines the groups role in the ritalin 
furor 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
twelvepage pink pamphlets are being handed 
out on street corners across the country sounding frightening 
alarms in boldface type about ritalin a prescription drug used 
for three decades to calm hyperactive children 
warning ritalin can lead to suicide 
warning ritalin can be addictive 
warning ritalin overdose can cause death 
in newspaper stories on talk shows at medical conventions 
news conferences and neighborhood meetings the group behind the 
pamphlets makes other claims that ritalin is as dangerous as 
cocaine causes delinquency and crime is given to 80 percent of 
children in some maryland schools even that psychiatrists advocate 
putting it in school drinking water supplies 
researchers and government regulators looking into the 
legitimate worries about misuse or overprescription of ritalin 
ridicule these facts as distortions and exaggerations of their 
work because the claims are constantly recycled without 
qualification or context they say parents are panicking 
unnecessarily 
ritalin is a safe effective drug i dont know of any major 
problems with it said dr paul leber director of 
neuropharmacological products at the us food and drug 
administration 
the antiritalin campaign is run from a sparsely furnished 
secondstory office here decorated with pictures of l ron hubbard 
founder of the church of scientology and staffed by people wearing 
psychiatry kills sweatshirts 
it is the headquarters of the citizens commission on human 
rights a 19yearold organization sponsored by the scientologists 
the contentious religious group based just down the street 
the campaign complete with tollfree hotline has made cchrs 
president dennis clarke a 41yearold member of the scientology 
church perhaps the most quoted ritalin expert in the country 
it has taken the group coast to coast whenever a ritalin case 
catches public attention be it a trial in massachusetts 
conferences in minnesota and texas or the filing of at least 13 
lawsuits 
ritalin acts as a chemical straitjacket clarke said in an 
interview with the associated press repeating an oftquoted claim 
we are not dealing with a lightweight drug but parents are told 
its like vitamins 
what is not always clear in cchrsupplied information is the 
groups ties to the scientologists and that churchs predisposition 
against the mental health profession since its inception in 1969 
cchr has attacked psychiatry centering on treatments such as 
electric shock and drugs 
its latest goal clarke said is to use lawsuits to bring about 
a ban on ritalin which he calls one of the most dangerous and 
addictive substances known to man 
this fervor medical experts say is slanting the debate on 
ritalin use 
its been wild absolutely wild really bizarre said dr 
jerry wiener president of the american academy of child and 
adolescent psychiatry something calls itself the citizens 
commission on human rights and all of a sudden it gets a lot of 
credibility and theyre being quoted without any kind of 
substantiation 
ritalin has enjoyed success in treating children with a 
condition now widely known as attention deficit disorder it reacts 
chemically to help calm their fidgeting ease their impulsive 
sometimes destructive behavior and focus their attention so they 
do better in school 
yet no one denies that ritalin a drug classified with 
amphetamines must be used carefully although its acknowledged 
side effects are mostly mild and passing doctors say children 
taking the drug must be closely monitored and counseled and some 
share worries with cchr that ritalin is being improperly urged on 
parents by teachers and schools 
its sharply increased use is indicated by the number of 
prescriptions filled which rose 14 percent from 1983 to 1986 
prescriptions for most drugs increase about 1 percent a year 
according to federal statistics 
i have a concern about overuse and abuse where the drug is 
used alone wiener said when any drug begins to be known as 
effective you have to be careful about overuse like valium and 
librium 
in the rush to reexamine ritalins role much press attention 
has focused on the lawsuits filed on behalf of distressed parents 
but most stories fail to note that of the 13 suits in 
california minnesota massachusetts georgia and the district of 
columbia one is being handled by cchrs counsel and the others 
were filed by two lawyers who get ritalin data and sometimes 
clients through cchr 
they are very efficient and a wealth of information said 
one of those lawyers john coale who has represented victims of 
the bhopal india cyanide gas disaster and the dupont plaza hotel 
fire in puerto rico 
some of the suits accuse not only pediatricians or psychiatrists 
of wrongdoing but also teachers and school districts involved in 
childrens treatment 
the only thing that will turn this around is the same thing 
that turned around exploding pintos and thalidomide and thats 
major major multimilliondollar lawsuits clarke said 
unfortunately that means suing schools as well as 
psychiatrists 
at the heart of the ritalin dispute are the claims and data used 
by cchr among its questioned statements 
clarke often says 4 million american children are taking 
ritalin four times as many as estimated by the most liberal 
researchers when asked for his source clarke cited a specific 
newspaper story when it was pointed out that the article makes no 
mention of 4 million children clarke replied i dont know how 
many i just know its too many 
clarke frequently asserts that 80 percent of the students in a 
maryland school system are taking ritalin asked to identify the 
system he amended his assertion to just one school and said the 
information came from an attorney who handles ritalin suits asked 
about the attorneys sources clarke cited an unidentified parent 
told by an unidentified neurologist 
clarke said he repeats the 80 percent figure because he believes 
its true theres enough of it there in maryland to have them 
all on it he said 
clarke says ritalin may have caused a 600percent increase in 
child suicide over five years he cites medical manual warnings 
that suicide is a complication of withdrawal from drugs such as 
ritalin but doctors say the danger is minimal when the drug is 
used properly 
i have children who go off of it every weekend said dr 
ralph s smith jr a charleston wva child psychiatrist i 
have children who go off every summer because they only need it 
during school nevertheless smith said three of his add 
patients stopped taking ritalin after their parents read an article 
highlighting cchr claims 
cchr refers to a california study which clarke asserts shows 
children treated with ritalin commit more felonies later in life 
the studys author dr james satterfield says that is a complete 
misreading 
satterfield a psychiatrist and director of the national center 
for hyperactive children in encino calif and his wife 
psychologist breena satterfield studied 130 hyperactive boys all 
of whom received ritalin and 50 of whom also received therapy and 
behavioral advice 
in general hyperactive children exhibit higher than normal 
rates of misbehavior and delinquency but the boys who received 
therapy as well as ritalin had lower levels of delinquency 
while it is true that ritalin by itself has not been found to 
prevent delinquency satterfield said it most certainly has 
never been found to cause delinquency

in a report to congress last year agencies including the 
national institutes of health the food and drug administration 
the national institute of mental health and the centers for disease 
control said the side effects are minimal for children treated 
with ritalin 
ritalins manufacturer cibageigy corp is straightforward 
about the side effects which include nervousness insomnia 
rashes anorexia nausea headaches and weight loss some evidence 
suggests it can temporarily retard growth 
cibageigy also cautions about its use by emotionally unstable 
patients and the possibility of severe depression in unsupervised 
withdrawal from the drug 
clarke complains these warnings dont reach parents and further 
asserts that psychiatrists have used drugs to create a 
selfperpetuating industry those who dispute him he adds are 
trying to protect their business 
these are the babydruggers clarke said i believe im 
pretty conservative with my information the whole thing does 
not exist because of scientology the problem exists because 
children are being harmed 
clarke defends his allegations saying they are based on medical 
literature and contends doctors who prescribe ritalin arent 
acknowledging its dangers 
psychiatrists however say cchr attacks them because of their 
basic philosophical difference with the church of scientology 
which does not recognize mental illness as a physiological problem 
scientology founded by science fiction writer hubbard in 1954 
is based on a theory called dianetics which says physical and 
mental problems can be solved by using an emeter an electric 
device set up much like a lie detector members are assigned 
exercises and counseling to eliminate negative mental images and 
achieve a clear state 
the church supports cchr clarke said because the group is 
part of the basic philosophy things having to do with the 
spiritual nature of man you dont deal with the spirit by 
lobotomizing someone or using electric shock its not only bad 
science its harmful for the being 
clarke is a convincing speaker with a seemingly endless catalog 
of ritalin horror stories he left a successful solar heating 
business in hawaii in 1985 to run cchr and travels constantly 
using local issues as a platform for his crusade 
just before 15yearold rod matthews an emotionally troubled 
youth who used ritalin was tried for the murder of classmate shaun 
ouillette 14 in canton mass clarke appeared on local talk 
shows after the trial he held a news conference to announce more 
lawsuits 
last year the local cchr chapter staged a demonstration in 
canton the victims mother jeanne quinn said a couple holding a 
sign reading ritalin killed shaun not rod came to her door 
asked for her and offered pamphlets on the dangers of ritalin 
matthews defense included claims that ritalin worsened his 
severe mental problems the jury found him sane and convicted him 
of seconddegree murder he was sentenced to life in prison 
eligible for parole after 15 years 
ironically the victim had taken ritalin for four years 
successfully conquering his hyperactivity 
they look for cases like this and grab onto it for their own 
purposes mrs quinn said of cchr i have little respect for 
any of their opinions they take small quotations and excerpts from 
medical books and give you their opinion everything is out of 
context 
when the university of minnesota held a conference on add last 
summer cchr members staged rallies hung signs on expressway 
overpasses announced a ritalin lawsuit and staged a rock concert 
for a drug free america 
the following week my practice received roughly 40 phone calls 
from parents concerned about the medication said dr jeffrey 
alexander a pediatrician at minneapolis park nicollet medical 
center who has about 200 patients on ritalin three or four 
actually discontinued treatment he said 
experts like the satterfields say that while they are concerned 
that ritalin needs to be used properly they worry that because 
cchr is trading on parents fears children not getting treatment 
they need 
its unfortunate that these children become the victims of 
special interest groups instead of being looked at for their 
individual requirements said mrs satterfield fear doesnt 
contribute to good treatment of children and good medical 
practices

to calm hyperactive children doctors give them a 
stimulant 
the seemingly contradictory effects of stimulants on hyperactive 
youngsters have been known since the 1930s when used carefully 
most experts agree they are safe and effective 
the most commonly prescribed of these medicines is a mild 
central nervous system stimulant called ritalin the drug known 
generically as methylphenidate was first sold in 1955 to improve 
mental performance in the elderly and reduce fatigue 
now it is the mainstay of treatment for attention deficit 
disorder in children which parents usually recognize by its most 
common and distressing symptom hyperactivity 
experts say as many as 80 percent of add youngsters may be 
helped by drug treatment but the extent of their improvement 
varies 
thirty percent of the kids who have attention deficit disorder 
do so well on the drug that the parents want to kiss you on both 
cheeks said dr jonathan cole of mclean hospital a 
harvardaffiliated mental hospital in belmont mass other kids 
are sort of better or not really better at all the underlying 
cause of the disorder and the reason stimulants calm children and 
help them concentrate are still mysteries 
genes play some role studies show onethird of all youngsters 
with add have parents with the ailment about half the youngsters 
with add outgrow the problem by adolescence the rest carry it into 
adulthood 
this drug has been around for 50 years and marketed for 30 
said dr ron kartzinel of cibageigy the company that makes 
ritalin we really cannot fully explain biochemically or 
physiologically how the drug works in attention deficit disorder 
there are many theories but they are just that theories 
other drugs used to treat the disorder are cylert or pemoline 
and dexedrine or dextroamphetamine all of them stimulate the 
brain to produce chemical messengers that brain cells use to alert 
and stimulate their neighbors experts believe this increase in 
brain chemicals has something to do with the drugs beneficial 
effects 
the drugs do carry side effects but most are mild and passing 
some youngsters lose their appetites and have trouble falling 
asleep for the first week or two they take ritalin 
ritalin can also slow youngsters growth dr david zametkin of 
the national institute of mental health said doctors should monitor 
patients height and weight if growth slows they should take them 
off the drug temporarily during summer vacation for example the 
youngsters then have a growth spurt and catch up 
another but extremely rare side effect is tics and twitches 
zametkin said that when the drugs are stopped these problems 
almost always go away 
at cibageigy kartzinel said that over the last 16 years the 
company has received 17 reports of slowed growth and 10 reports of 
tics associated with ritalin 
a few years ago doctors feared that ritalin caused tourettes 
syndrome a disorder in which people make involuntary movements and 
noises however zametkin said it now appears tourettes syndrome 
itself is often preceded by symptoms that resemble those for add 
some youngsters who are treated with ritalin for add 
subsequently develop tourettes syndrome he said but this would 
have happened anyway regardless of whether they got the drug 
zametkin said the stimulants do not as some parents fear make 
children high or euphoric instead if they take too much they 
tend to become moody and irritable 
if you know anybody who ever took dexedrine to stay up and 
study they got some of the same effects as these kids improved 
concentration decreased distractability and less fatigue said 
cole its sort of like supercoffee although it makes you feel 
less jittery

pat robertsons presidential candidacy may have ground to a halt 
but his famed invisible army is still on the march threatening 
in some places to take over the republican party planting the 
seeds for a robertson resurgence in 1992 
battles already fought or being waged this spring could leave 
the party machinery in part or entirely under the command of forces 
loyal to the former television evangelist in such states as 
georgia oklahoma south carolina north carolina virginia 
louisiana michigan minnesota iowa nevada hawaii and alaska 
that will make things easier for robertson if he chooses as he 
has hinted he will to run again for the republican presidential 
nomination in four years even if it means challenging an 
incumbent republican 
the robertson campaign hit the wall in the south on super 
tuesday and the candidate has conceded that george bush will win 
the gop nomination but his people are not giving up they are 
still winning skirmishes across the map in places where a 
precincts party machinery can be seized merely by turning out a 
handful of loyalists to the cause 
we in the evangelical right are here to stay said robertson 
activist tom vestal pastor of the mount olivet baptist church in 
raleigh nc where supporters of robertson and george bush may 
wind up in court in a fight over the composition of the states 
delegation to this summers republican national convention 
were not trying to take over the party but we want to be an 
influence to ensure that the party is an instrument of godliness 
righteousness and morality vestal said 
robertson talks of his people running for congress and state 
legislatures in 1990 and of using his troops to maybe lay the 
foundations for something in 1992 
we have hundreds of thousands of people who are right now in 
the republican party who have never been there before and they all 
almost to a man are saying were in it for the long haul 
robertson said in an interview 
in many places in the south a minority republican party eager 
for new blood hungrily accommodated the influx of robertson 
people ideologically the newcomers and the old timers think 
alike differences are more likely to be over style and personality 
but that doesnt rule out frictions 
they dont want participation they want domination 
grumbled state legislator harry r bob purkey who was ousted 
in 1986 as district republican chairman by a religious school 
principal in robertsons back yard virginia beach va 
this year at a district convention in newport news va 
longtime party stalwarts also were thrown out by robertson 
supporters 
said anne kincaid head of the virginia chapter of americans for 
robertson we will do whatever it takes ethically and within the 
rules to get pat nominated 
terry wade chief of staff at the republican national committee 
in washington said the new blood energizes the party 
he called the robertson challenges a weak echo of the party 
takeover by barry goldwaters people in 1964 nor does it have 
anything like the magnitude of ronald reagans putsch in many 
places in 1976 which led to his winning the nomination four years 
later 
if our party were to become perceived as a single issue party 
or one having a very narrow viewpoint of america that would be a 
problem but i dont see that happening wade said 
theres always going to be some dissatisfaction and disruption 
when new people move in but hey if were going to become the 
majority party we have to grow 
checks by associated press reporters around the country found 
instances in which robertson forces fit right in and instances in 
which they didnt 
there were old guard complaints that the robertson people are 
not interested in daytoday party work and complaints from 
robertson people that the regulars preferred the comforts of 
clubbiness to winning elections 
in michigan a year and a half of chaotic battle in and out of 
court battered the republican party and put robertson forces in 
the majority in the state central committee the likely result 
competing bush and robertson delegations demanding to be seated at 
the national convention in new orleans in august touching off a 
nasty credentials fight pitting bush forces against robertson

in hawaii where robertson swept party caucuses feb 4 gop 
chairman howard chong was ousted by a robertson supporter losing 
his chance to attend the partys state convention as a delegate 
chong first pledged to unite the warring factions but later 
called a news conference to denounce the lies and innuendoes of 
robertson people and announced frankly speaking i have had 
enough 
under the rules bush won all 48 delegates in georgia but when 
the states delegates are selected as many as half are expected to 
go robertson people they will be bound to bush for two ballots at 
the national convention but free to vote with robertson on 
platform issues credentials challenges and party rules 
it is our aim to see that the party is broadened said 
attorney don johnson of marietta ga a robertson supporter 
were either going to broaden it with them or broaden it over 
them 
bob bell former state gop chairman said however nothing in 
their numbers would lead me to believe this group can take over the 
party 
robertson supporters dominated many precinct meetings and county 
conventions in oklahoma one likely result says matt seward 
bushs state director the oklahomans will support a plank 
denouncing the arms control treaty coming before the senate for 
ratification even though bush vigorously supports it 
bush swept the 111 national delegates available from his adopted 
state of texas but robertson forces based on their showings in 
county conventions in march think they have a chance to elect 
their own candidate as state gop chairman in houston in june some 
texas counties will send delegations that are 100 percent robertson 
people 
if the new robertsontype people will filter out some of the 
biblical language and keep their principles they can realize more 
of their goals commented retiring texas chairman george strake 
a former democrat who converted to republicanism in 1961 because 
i thought republicans were firmer against communism 
nevada reflecting the outcome of februarys caucuses will send 
a prorobertson delegation to the national convention robertsons 
state director steve wark said the nevadans will be in no mood to 
jump aboard a bush bandwagon such a conciliatory move he said 
would be poisonous 
in washington state the only super tuesday state that went for 
robertson gop executive director john meyers was asked if he saw 
the robertson crowd as heirs to the reagan revolution he replied 
i see it as an extension of the goldwater revolution antigay 
antiunited nations proschool prayer conservatives have run the 
state party for decades even though sen dan evans rwash is 
characterized as moderatetoliberal 
in maine when robertson people threatened to take over in 
february forces supporting bush and bob dole buried their 
differences to vote them down and prevent the selection of a 
prorobertson delegation to new orleans 
robertson coordinator john solberg cried foul the bush and 
dole campaigns are attempting to keep the majority silent in the 
democratic process he complained gov john r mckernan jr a 
bush man brushed off the charge this is not fun and games he 
said were talking about the next president of the united

as texaco inc prepares to emerge from 
bankruptcy court protection next month a welcoming party of 
takeover specialists continues to grow outside the oil giants door 
kohlberg kravis roberts amp co which has carried out some of the 
largest leveraged buyouts in us history said tuesday it is 
seeking federal permission to buy up to 15 percent of texaco incs 
stock 
the investment banking firm often a management ally in its 
deals said it had already acquired 1195 million texaco shares or 
about 49 percent of texacos roughly 242 million outstanding 
shares 
in filing to enlarge that stake kohlberg kravis would join 
financiers carl c icahn and t boone pickens in announcing 
interest or taking substantial stakes in the nations thirdlargest 
oil company 
getty petroleum co a product of texacos illfated 1984 
acquisition of getty oil co has also filed for the same federal 
permission to up its stake in texaco 
industry analysts viewed the latest development as another 
indication of the stiff challenge that texacos management will 
face as it attempts to hang on to control over the company while 
conducting an orderly reorganization beginning next month 
big shark little shark they all bite observed frank p 
knuettel who tracks oil companies at prudential bache securities 
for its part texaco took the high road in its response 
kohlberg kravis roberts has in past situations demonstrated an 
ability to be a constructive shareholder which recognizes the 
importance of building value for the long term we have no 
indication that their intentions with texaco are any different 
the company said in a statement from its white plains ny 
headquarters 
we are hopeful that it will play a constructive role as 
texaco pursues prompt and aggressives steps to restructure the 
company and maximize total value and return for all our 
shareholders 
investors responded enthusiastically to kohlberg kraviss 
announcement in nationwide trading of new york stock 
exchangelisted issues texaco jumped 325 a share to 48 
kohlberg kravis said it had purchased its shares some months 
ago in the open market ruth pachman of the public relations 
firm kekst and co which was representing the firm said there 
would be no further comment 
but a source close to the investment company said the filing 
would permit it to initiate discussions with texacos 
management the source would not elaborate 
kohlberg kravis is a leader in leveraged buyouts in which 
investors pay off the debt from a corporate takeover with the cash 
flow of the target company or by selling some or all of its assets 
its 61 billion buyout of beatrice cos completed in april 
1986 was the largest leveraged buyout ever carried out in this 
country seven months later the firm bought safeway stores for 
about 42 billion 
texaco last week received us bankruptcy court permission to 
emerge from chapter 11 protection from its creditors with a 
financial reorganization plan that will become official on april 7 
as part of that plan it has said it will sell at least 3 
billion in assets 
but analysts who estimate the company to be worth between 50 
and 60 per share if it were broken up and sold off in pieces 
have been expecting some outside move to accelerate those sales to 
raise the shares value 
icahn texacos largest shareholder with 148 percent of its 
shares has been aggressively critical of texacos management and 
has been widely expected to lead the charge on the company 
on tuesday he said he was surprised but also pleased to 
learn of the kohlberg kravis move 
icahn has promised to field a slate of five candidates 
including himself for five board seats up for election at the 
companys annual meeting this spring if texaco does not put itself 
up for sale texaco officials have vowed repeatedly not to do that 
pickens has received federal regulatory permission to buy up to 
15 percent of texacos shares he has said he would support the 
icahn slate on tuesday however david bachelder president of 
pickens mesa limited partnership would not say how many texaco 
shares pickens has actually accumulated 
getty petroleum co an independent marketer of petroleum 
products has made a similar filing claiming however that it is 
for investment only 
philip l dodge an analyst at nomura securities international 
inc said that the remaining question is whether the texaco 
management remains in charge of the company 
alluding to the growing pressure on texaco he suggested that 
provisions could be made for its management to participate in a 
leveraged buyout 
i dont think theyd do it with much appetite but they 
would if they saw it as the lesser of two evils he added

cbs inc says its special offer of increased 
pension benefits to about 11 percent of its employees who agree to 
retire within four months would help it slim down and compete in 
the tough broadcasting business 
but one securities analyst said such offers have typically cost 
companies some of their better workers and could hurt cbs in the 
long run 
these things have tended to give the best people a reason to 
leave and the worst people a reason not to said alan gottesman 
who follows media companies for the investment firm lf rothschild 
amp co 
on wall street cbs rose 62 cents a share to 15875 in trading 
on the new york stock exchange 
cbs disclosed tuesday that it was offering the option to about 
800 of the companys 7000 workers and was described as part of the 
companys continuing effort to streamline operations to be 
competitive 
a company spokeswoman alice henderson said the company had set 
no goal for how many people it hoped would take advantage of the 
program 
the program is completely voluntary and eligible employees 
have until july 1 to make their decision on this offer cbs said 
in a memo to the workers who are involved retirement must occur no 
later than july 29 
since laurence a tisch took over as chief executive in the fall 
of 1986 cbs has sold its records magazines and book publishing 
units leaving it with a core business of broadcasting and about 3 
billion in cash 
but analysts say the cbs television network has been 
unprofitable and is likely to end the current season in last place 
in primetime audience ratings a development that could depress 
its advertising revenue 
the special retirement program is available to cbs employees 55 
years of age and older who have at least 10 years of pension 
vesting credit 
those who accept the offer would get pension benefits calculated 
as if the employee were five years older and had completed an 
additional five years of service 
as we all understand cbs is still in the process of examining 
ways in which we can further streamline our operations to ensure 
our ability to be competitive in an increasingly competitive 
market the memo said 
we hope that the availability of this very attractive 
voluntary retirement option will assist us in reaching this 
objective it said 
the company offered a similar early retirement incentive plan in 
1985 and a cbs source who asked not to be identified said about 
500 people took advantage of it 
the source said the latest plan is viewed by cbs management as a 
less painful way to make staff reductions than by firings 
j kendrick noble the media analyst for the investment firm 
painewebber said the offer was a costcutting move that reflected 
the corporate restructuring and the television networks dismal 
ratings performance 
its not that this company is fat or anything but it is under 
more pressure than others to reduce costs he said

older whitecollar workers face employer 
attitudes ranging from accommodating to hostile and a companys 
financial health plays a part a university of michigan study shows 
corporations with money problems are most likely to be 
antagonistic toward older workers according to the study of 25 
fortune 500 companies by barbara hirshorn 
she said her interviews at the 25 companies indicated factors 
such as the state of the economy and the industry corporate 
personality corporate leadership and organizational structure 
shaped company attitudes 
the study also indicated corporate attitudes can change said 
hirshorn a research fellow at the universitys population studies 
center 
companies participating in the study were guaranteed 
confidentiality 
hirshorn said attitudes toward older workers could be 
categorized as 
proactive these companies dealt most effectively with older 
workers offering more than one possible career ladder maintaining 
options for the company and for workers of all ages encouraging 
lateral career changes and reassigning workers to relieve stress 
and boredom 
performancefocused such companies tried to ignore age and 
apply a reliable evaluation system to all employees hirshorn said 
this tended to benefit older employees over younger ones who had to 
be considered more in terms of their potential 
at crosspurposes at these companies managers might express 
high regard and design some effective policies for older workers 
but retain other policies that work against them limited 
opportunities for promotion or lateral moves and huge sweetened 
early retirement programs were examples 
hirshorn said some retailers have policies at crosspurposes 
voicing pride in being nondiscriminatory but at the same time 
assuming older employees will burn out because the business is 
stressful and failing to offer them new opportunities 
positive meansnegative ends these were companies where 
coordinated planning efforts were subverted to get rid of older 
workers hirshorn said such actions were often the result of new 
stresses from inside or outside the organization 
actively antagonistic in a few companies hostility showed up 
in a variety of policies i came across one insurance company 
where age bias ran deeply throughout the ranks hirshorn said 
those who refused to relocate were fired and since so few 
employees over 55 were promoted many older workers left 
some companies refused to retrain older workers citing poor 
return on investment though they did not raise the issue when 
retraining workers in their 30s who are more likely to leave for 
new jobs she said 
hirshorn said she will study 10 of the 25 companies to determine 
how they change or maintain their policies in reaction to external 
and internal stresses over time

the dollar rose against most major currencies in 
sluggish european trading this morning as volume tapered off before 
the easter break gold prices eased 
dealers predicted volume would remain thin through good friday 
and the dollar would likely trade around its present levels until 
after the easter weekend 
the bank of japan intervened for the second straight day to 
support the dollar but traders in frankfurt said the market 
reacted mildly because the amount of dollars purchased by japans 
central bank was apparently small 
traders said however the intervention served its purpose by 
reviving market fears of concerted central bank intervention 
there are a lot of traders around who want to sell dollars but 
are afraid to do so said a dealer at a major west german bank in 
frankfurt 
traders said the dollar gained some support from recent 
statistics that indicate the us economy is robust 
the underlying sentiment is still certainly bearish on the 
dollar but not aggressively so said one trader with a major 
european commercial bank in milan 
in tokyo where trading ends before europes business day 
begins the dollar rose 106 yen to a closing 12543 japanese yen 
later in london it fell back to 12528 yen 
other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late tuesdays 
rates included 16705 west german marks up from 16610 13790 
swiss francs up from 13735 56587 french francs up from 56280 
18764 dutch guilders up from 18690 123650 italian lire up 
from 123250 12362 canadian dollars down from 12363 
in london the dollar rose against the british pound it cost 
18615 to buy one pound cheaper than 18705 late tuesday 
gold opened in london at a bid price of 45450 a troy ounce and 
at midmorning the citys five major bullion dealers fixed a 
recommended price of 45400 both were down from tuesdays late 
bid of 45475 
in zurich the bid price was 45400 down from 45500 late 
tuesday 
earlier in hong kong gold fell 109 to close at a bid of 
45579 
silver bullion eased in london to a bid price of 6675 a troy 
ounce down from 669 late tuesday

gains on overseas markets helped boost the dollar 
in tokyo today while the stock markets key index closed at a 
postcrash high 
trading on the foreign exchange market was quiet with many 
corporate customers staying on the sidelines until the end of 
japans fiscal year on thursday dealers said 
the dollar opened at 12575 yen up 138 yen from tuesdays 
close of 12437 yen it began edging down in the afternoon and 
ended trading at 12543 yen up 106 yen the us currency ranged 
between 12540 and 12578 yen with spot volume totaling 53 
billion 
the gain came after the dollar had lost a total of 278 yen over 
four trading days 
the tokyo stock exchange enjoyed its third consecutive day of 
healthy gains in heavy trading the 225stock nikkei average rose 
36689 points or 141 percent ending the day at 2631998 
it was the first time the key index had closed above the 
26000level since the october market crash the closing was less 
than 327 points from the indexs alltime closing high of 2664643 
traders said stock prices were boosted by the stronger dollar 
gains on the new york and london markets on tuesday and typical 
enthusiasm marking the start of the new japanese fiscal year 
sentiment is very positive we might see a new historical high 
this week as long as new york wall street and the yen behave 
a trader said 
on the foreign exchange market traders said many participants 
continued to cover dollarshort positions as they had on tuesday 
when the dollar temporarily touched 12387 yen its lowest level 
since the first week of january 
they attributed the us currencys higher opening today to 
overnight gains on overseas markets and unconfirmed reports of 
greater intervention in support of the dollar by the us federal 
reserve 
also adding to the us currencys strength was a denial today 
by japanese insurance companies that they were planning to begin 
dumping dollars after the start of the new fiscal year 
rumors had been circulating that the companies a major 
influence in currency markets would discontinue their recent 
support for the dollar said to have been aimed at defending the 
value of their holdings for accounting purposes 
but many analysts said bullish sentiments toward the yen remain 
in the market because of healthly japanese economic fundamentals

a group of japanese life insurance companies have 
denied rumors that they plan to sell off us dollars after april 
1 a move that would send the currency into a tailspin 
a new accounting law requiring life insurance companies to 
report currency losses of 15 percent or more when the current 
fiscal year ends march 31 has sparked speculation that the 
companies would try to support the dollar at an artificially high 
level and then retreat from us financial markets soon after the 
close of the fiscal year 
largescale dollar selling here would push the us currency 
lower fears that the japanese might dump dollars has caused 
jitters in currency markets worldwide with some traders selling 
the us currency as a hedge against more widespread dollar sales 
but a statement issued tuesday by yasuyuki wakahara chairman of 
the japan life insurers association called such speculation 
absolutely groundless he noted that stable exchange rates are 
vital to japanese life insurance companies which often invest in 
currencies other than the yen 
this association hopes more than anyone else for a stable 
yendollar exchange rate the statement said 
tatsuo nakata an association executive told reporters at a 
news conference that dollar selling by the insurance companies 
would be like strangling yourselves 
i think its prudent to take the statement at face value 
said david gerstenhaber senior economist with morgan stanley amp co 
in tokyo who said he would be surprised if the life insurance 
companies pulled out of dollardenominated investments in april 
they have so much paper that the value of whats left would 
be lowered by the impact of small sales gerstenhaber said 
life insurance companies were given some leeway on the 15 
percent rule when the japanese government decided to allow the 
closing dollar rate for fiscal 1987 to be the average closing in 
tokyo for all of march not the daily closing on march 31 as some 
analysts believed 
the ministry of finance has allowed companies to use the 
months average in order to alleviate strain from the crash in 
october so people now are back above water said bruce babcock 
of prudentialbache securities inc 
in its statement the life insurers association also criticized 
what it called growing instability caused by speculation in the 
market an indirect reference to the weakness earlier this week of 
the dollar which traded briefly tuesday below the 124yen level a 
threemonth low it rebounded wednesday to close in tokyo at 12543

publisher rupert murdoch could still have 
trouble obtaining a government extension allowing him to keep both 
his newspaper and television station in boston because both 
properties are making money 
the possibility of an extension was opened tuesday by a federal 
appeals court the panel ruled that congress unconstitutionally 
singled out murdoch when it barred the federal communications 
commission from extending temporary waivers of a rule forbidding 
common ownership of newspapers and tv stations in the same city 
under existing fcc crossowership rules murdoch would have to 
show that either the boston herald or wfxttv is financially 
distressed however both properties are making money 
unless the commission were to make some tremendous change in 
the criteria for granting a waiver he doesnt qualify and we will 
oppose it said andrew schwartzman executive director of media 
access project a washington dcbased public interest law firm 
diane killory fcc general counsel said temporary waivers are 
granted to give the owner of a newspapertv combination time to 
sell one of the properties for a fair price and avoid forcing a 
distress sale 
if someone were willing to pay fair market value it would be 
tough to argue it would be a distress sale and thats the criteria 
we use when a temporary waiver is justified she said 
for a permanent waiver an owner must show that common ownership 
was necessary to keep both the newspaper and tv station afloat 
financially she said 
lawrence kessler general counsel for murdochs news america 
publishing inc acknowledged that the herald could survive without 
the tv stations revenues but he said the company will argue that 
the issue is fairness 
the hardship would be if we were forced to dispose of another 
asset and then the fcc modified the rule to allow common 
ownership that would be a hardship in and of itself he said 
kessler noted fcc precedents for granting further time for 
murdoch the commission last year granted capital citiesabc inc 
and general electric co waivers of orders to sell radio stations 
while it decides whether to eliminate the crossownership rule 
barring common ownership of radio and tv stations in the same city 
murdoch received temporary waivers from the fccs 
crossownership rule after he bought the boston tv station and new 
york station wnywtv in 1986 he was given until march 6 to sell 
either wnyw or the new york post and june 30 to sell wfxt or the 
boston herald 
murdoch had been widely expected to request extensions of his 
waivers but sens ernest hollings dsc and edward kennedy 
dmass cut short that option late last year they slipped 
through congress a measure prohibiting the fcc from extending any 
outstanding waivers the measure also forbids the agency from 
considering any changes in the rule 
in a 21 decision tuesday the us circuit court of appeals in 
washington ruled that the law is unconstitutional because it 
targeted a specific individual for no legitimate purpose 
though the ruling opens the possibility that murdoch could keep 
both boston properties at least temporarily it wont affect the 
new york post since he sold the newspaper earlier this month for 
37 million to real estate developer peter kalikow 
murdoch and others had said the ban by congress was an attempt 
to silence his newspapers criticism of kennedy kennedy and 
hollings however said they were merely trying to preserve the 
crossownership rules and force murdoch to comply with them 
the court did not address the section of the provision that 
prevents the fcc from considering whether the crossownership rule 
should be abolished therefore that prohibition remains in effect 
until oct 1 when the authority under the spending bill to which 
the measure was attached expires 
kessler said murdoch will ask the fcc to extend its waiver for 
six months after the fcc makes a final decision on its 
crossownership rule 
congress could forestall such a decision by continuing to 
prohibit the fcc from considering the issue 
whether congress would do that would depend on many factors 
including whether the commission grants murdoch a waiver said 
tom cohen a staff attorney for the senate commerce subcommittee on 
communications

the chairman of american stores co warned 
lucky stores inc against making a defensive acqusition that 
would thwart americans 174 billion tender offer for the grocery 
store company 
in a letter to luckys board of directors tuesday american 
stores chairman ls skaggs said there have been various 
reports that lucky may be considering an acquisition that could 
interfere with his companys bid 
american launched a 45ashare tender offer for the dublin 
califbased company on monday and said it was prepared to increase 
the offer to 50 a share or about 193 billion if a friendly 
deal can be worked out 
in a brief statement issued tuesday lucky acknowledged that it 
is reviewing both proposals the company has urged shareholders not 
to tender until its directors make a recommendation 
skaggs warned in his letter that any attempt by lucky to 
frustrate the choice given to your shareholders through a 
defensive acquisition would affect americans willingness to 
increase its tender offer to 50 a share 
he also reiterated that american would consider divesting stores 
in order to mitigate any antitrust concerns that may exist 
the combination of american the nations thirdlargest grocery 
retailer with 1700 stores and annual sales of 15 billion and 
lucky the sixthlargest with 480 stores and sales of 7 billion 
could produce the biggest grocery retailer in the nation analysts 
say 
documents filed monday at the security and exchange commission 
hinted that american may be positioning itself for a hostile 
takeover of lucky which resisted such an effort from takeover 
specialist asher edelman 16 months ago in return for edelman 
dropping the effort lucky agreed to pay his 28 million in legal 
bills 
americans sec documents include a copy of the lawsuit the 
company filed friday in delaware which alleges lucky and its 
executive officers have breached their fiduciary duties by 
following a course of conduct directed towards entrenching 
themselves in control of lucky stores 
as part of the defensive measures dating back to the edelman 
bid lucky voted senior management lucrative golden parachute 
contracts and announced a restructuring plan that included changing 
the companys state of incorporation from california to delaware 
and a buyback of 27 percent of its outstanding shares the suit 
contends 
the company has noted that its bylaws also contain a poison 
pill antitakeover provision limiting the voting power of any 
shareholder who acquires more than 10 percent of luckys stock

an offer by the long island power authority 
to purchase long island lighting co for 971 million was termed 
ridiculous by some industry analysts 
the state agencys decision to attempt a takeover was made after 
a study showed electric rates on long island would be 12 percent 
lower under a publiclyoperated utility 
lilco had not yet received the offer made tuesday in a letter 
to lilco chairman william catacosinos and the utilitys board of 
directors said james lois a lilco spokesman 
should an offer come in we would seriously evaluate it and 
inform our shareholders of the offer lois said 
the proposal contemplates that lipa would acquire through a 
friendly merger transaction all 111 million outstanding shares of 
lilco common stock at 875 per share 
lilco stock was trading at 9 a share down 12 cents in early 
new york stock exchange trading today 
the proposal also contemplates that lipa would acquire all 
outstanding shares of lilco preferred stock 
financing is expected to be provided through the sale of 
approximately 745 billion of longterm taxexempt bonds 
officials said 
it was not known if lipas offer which is open until april 15 
would be considered at a previously scheduled lilco board meeting 
today 
gary f hovis a utility analyst at argus research corp called 
the offer somewhat funny or ridiculous 
obviously the board of directors of lilco wont even think 
about accepting this offer he said 
he said it was so far below the true value of the company that 
even the less sophisticated investors would quickly reject it if it 
were ever approved by the lilco board and sent to the 118000 
shareholders for a vote 
that is a number that is well below what was generally 
expected said analyst paul parshley at donaldson lufkin amp 
jenrette securities inc i would certainly expect the company 
would reject the bid and that would begin a bargaining process 
he and other analysts said an offer was not likely to be 
seriously considered until it reaches at least 12 per share 
lipas ninemember board of trustees met for several hours in 
closed session tuesday before voting to attempt the takeover at 
what mack called the average trading price of lilco stock over the 
past 30 days 
lipa is an independent state agency formed in january 1987 by 
gov mario cuomo and the legislature to decide if a takeover of 
lilco would lower rates lipa also is trying to prevent lilcos 
shoreham nuclear plant from operating 
the 52 billion plant one of the most expensive ever built is 
currently licensed by the nuclear regulatory commission to operate 
at up to 5 percent of full power 
lilco officials have continued to press for a full operating 
license for the plant contending it is needed to meet the growing 
electric demands on long island 
cuomo and local officials have argued against granting a full 
operating license to shoreham saying long island could not be 
safely evacuated in the event of an accident at the plant located 
on the islands north shore about 50 miles from manhattan 
federal law requires that an approved evacuation plan be in 
place before a nuclear power plant can be granted a license

eastman kodak co and fuqua industries 
inc wasting no time after a favorable court decision announced 
today they had merged their photofinishing operations 
the new company qualex inc was formed on tuesday immediately 
after the us circuit court of appeals in new orleans reversed a 
federal court injunction that had blocked the merger since feb 22 
qualex combines fuquas photofinishing subsidiary colorcraft 
corp with kodakowned laboratories forming the countrys largest 
wholesale photofinishing operation it has 94 processing labs 
around the country 
weve been delayed in doing this by the lawsuit so we wanted 
to get it done as soon as we could our target date for having this 
merger completed had been feb 1 said paul allen a kodak 
spokesman 
the company will be based in durham nc the home of 
colorcraft colorcrafts former chairman d carl hamill will 
serve as chief executive officer 
allen said the court of appeals granted permission for the 
merger to go ahead immediately even though a lawsuit trying to 
prevent it is still being argued 
the court noted that a merger can always be undone at a later 
date allen said 
a small wholesale photofinisher phototron corp of san 
bernardino calif filed the lawsuit to block the merger because 
phototron officials claimed it would create unfair competition in 
the market 
a federal judge in fort worth texas where the lawsuit was 
filed issued an injunction feb 22 preventing the merger but that 
decision was reversed tuesday in new orleans 
that lawsuit is expected to continue allen said

corn and soybean prices retreated on profittaking ahead of 
thursdays eagerly awaited government reports on spring planting

plant the first such shutdown since november 1981 
about 2000 workers will be affected next week at the plant that 
manufactures washers dryers dishwashers and insink food waste 
disposers 
very strong firstquarter merchandising programming resulted 
in dealers buying ahead and the shortterm correction is needed to 
bring factory and dealer inventories back into line the company 
said in its announcement 
spokesman ron krajnovich said the merchandising program involved 
discounted sales to dealers as an incentive to buy maytag 
appliances 
the company said the vast majority of the production employees 
affected will receive unemployment compensation and supplemental 
unemployment benefit payments during the period 
it said production would resume april 11 
maytag is coming off its best year ever with a profit of 1527 
million on sales of 192 billion in 1987 
but when the company released its annual report earlier this 
month maytag chairman daniel j krumm noted 1987 was the fourth 
consecutive record year for the appliance industry 
the industrys growth cycle is mature and i believe demand 
will relax slightly in 1988 krumm said at the time but he also 
said he expected maytag to outperform the industry as a whole

the reagan administrations top trade official 
says that the us tariffs on canadian plywood wont be lowered 
until the two countries have developed common standards that 
would allow americanmanufactured plywood to be used north of the 
border 
in a letter to oregon republican sen bob packwood us trade 
representative clayton yeutter said the administration will propose 
that us and canadian experts from two forest research 
laboratories develop and draft construction standards for the use 
of plywood in both countries 
under this scheme reductions in the us tariff on plywood 
and other panel products would not be phased in until we get a 
satisfactory solution to the technical trade problems said 
yeutter 
packwood told reporters he was optimistic that a jointstandard 
could be negotiated 
this ought to solve our plywood problems with canada 
packwood said 
the proposed uscanada free trade agreement calls for 
elimination of the 20 percent us tariff on canadian plywood and 
the 15 percent tariff on american plywood over a 10year period 
but the treaty linked elimination of the tariffs to changes in 
the canadian construction codes 
canadians have insisted that american plywood was not sturdy 
enough to withstand the harsher climate of canada a claim the 
american plywood industry has said is unfounded 
earlier this month the canadian mortgage and housing commission 
cmhc refused to revise its building code that has essentially 
blocked imports of us plywood 
the governmentcontrolled mortgage authority rejected the 
changes without even making a technical review of usmanufactured 
plywood 
northwest lawmakers including packwood were outraged 
oregon is the leading plywood producing state and washington 
ranks no 4 together the two states produce about 40 percent of 
the plywood manufactured domestically 
yeutter said that he was disappointed with the cmhc 
rejection 
i believe that cmhcs action does not conform with provisions 
of the free trade agreement yeutter wrote my expectations of 
cmhc have not been met 
yeutter said that after common standards were developed and 
implemented then tariff reductions envisioned in the free trade 
agreement could take effect 
packwood said that adoption of joint construction standards 
should ensure that usmanufactured plywood will have access to 
canadian markets 
plywood made in eugene salem or vancouver british columbia 
will all be made to the same standard said packwood

cashrich companies have replaced corporate 
raiders of the bustemup style on the merger trail lassoing 
businesses that will increase their market share and make longterm 
economic sense 
takeover activity often of the hostile variety has resumed 
with a new frenzy as initial jitters about the economy have 
subsided in the wake of octobers stock market calamity 
despite nagging fears that the new wave will further restrict 
competition in some industries and leave many businesses awash in 
debt the urge to merge seems ever stronger among companies bent on 
raising their standing in the global marketplace 
lured by battered stock prices corporations are shedding their 
inhibitions about making overtures that are unsolicited a 
euphemism for hostile bids 
fears that taking the role of aggressor could tarnish the old 
corporate image are subsiding along with concerns about the 
disruptive effect an unwanted takeover might have on the target 
firms work force from top management defections to a sense of 
alienation among the rankandfile 
lately its become respectable for quality corporate buyers 
to make unsolicited offers said michael b hoffman codirector 
of mergers and acquisitions at smith barney harris upham amp co 
that general respectability is allowing people to come in and 
do something they havent done in the past he said 
among the unsolicited offers is american store cos nearly 2 
billion bid for lucky stores inc a combination that would create 
the nations biggest supermarket chain elsewhere in the retail 
arena campeau corp and rh macy amp co have both bid more than 6 
billion for federated department stores inc 
some companies are so intent to jump on the acquisition 
bandwagon theyre launching tender offers after a target company 
has signed an agreement with another suitor 
general electric corp which analysts are quick to note has 
never pursued an unfriendly deal launched a 507 million tender 
offer for roper corp after the appliance and lawn equipment maker 
agreed to be acquired by whirlpool corp 
smithkline beckman corp went after international clinical 
laboratories inc to beef up its lab network even though the 
company already had agreed to be acquired by corning glass works 
acquiring another company is a quicker and often cheaper way of 
broadening product lines and gaining market share instead of 
building a factory from the foundation up over the course of 
several years corporations can expand their distribution channels 
instantly by snapping up a competitor 
even eastman kodak cos megapurchase of sterling drug inc for 
51 billion the largest completed deal so far this year is not 
a wild diversification move for the camera maker some argue 
large companies also are aiming to outgun their foreign 
counterparts 
market share is being divided up and us companies are 
consolidating to meet foreign competition coming in said robert 
willard managing director and head of mergers and acqusitions at 
prudentialbache securities inc 
to the extent that companies are leading the effort as opposed 
to raiders the latest wave is clearly healthier said willard 
who noted that the recent combinations not only make economic 
sense but probably at the end of the day there is less 
dislocation in terms of employees forming stronger economic units 
to be competitive on worldwide basis 
but hoffman said it is definitely not clear that these are 
somehow better than the mergers of the past its difficult to 
argue whether campeau or macy would be an inherently better partner 
for federated he said 
still an increasing percentage of transactions are not 
bustup or junkbond driven they appear to be driven by 
synergistic ideals said stephen fraidin a partner of fried 
frank harris shriver amp jacobson a leading 
mergersandacquisition law firm 
changes in tax laws have made the breaking up of companies not 
as attractive for raiders who must sell off parts of targets just 
to finance the actual acquisition 
corporations have an opportunity to display their natural 
advantage in winning deals namely they have deep pockets and can 
borrow cheaper than raiders relegated to the highyield but risky 
junkbond markets 
and theres no question that corporations are in a strong cash 
position right now buoyed by a weaker dollar that has made 
american exports more attractive corporations aftertax profits 
shot up 84 percent in last year to 1374 billion for the first 
increase since 1984 according to commerce department figures 
while the number of takeover deals announced seems to have 
slowed the dollar value has increased steadily in december 484 
deals were announced for a total dollar value of 161 billion but 
the 364 deals announced in february carried a combined price tag of 
327 billion 
experts say the pace will wear on all the forces in place 
that have contributed to the first three months of 1988 activity 
we see as continuing into the forseeable future said j tomilson 
hill cohead of mergers and acquisitons at shearson lehman hutton 
inc 
banks are fully prepared to provide a substantial amount of 
credit theres bridge financing from the investment banks and 
while there are fewer bargains in terms of stock prices now than a 
few months ago prices nevertheless are still on average below 
their highs he said 
ironically mergers are now providing some support for stocks as 
takeover issues dominate the play on an otherwise dull wall street 
on the downside looms the specter of an economy constrained by 
too much debt and too little competition 
in the concrete and construction materials business alone three 
major takeover attempts are under way two of which are being 
spearheaded by foreign firms beazer plc of britain has made a bid 
for koppers co brierly investments ltd of new zealand is seeking 
to acquire calmat co while moore mccormack resources inc has 
rebuffed an offer from southdown inc 
ultimately the bill for such combinations will have to be paid 
theres the danger of getting into a situation where companies 
are so highly leveraged that it becomes a question whether they can 
survive an economic downturn said jay lorsch a professor at 
harvard business school 
some experts criticize restructuring in the face of a takeover 
as too short sighted to fend off a hostile bidder companies often 
take on debt to make themselves less attractive or as an 
alternative defensive move companies sell off assets that may be 
weak at the moment without considering their longterm potential 
its like the hong kong race track everybodys betting on 
the short term and not that the earnings of a company will rise 
over the long haul lorsch said

in an office park in this seattle suburb 
a staff of 92 people is kept busy answering questions like when 
im in the legend of zelda how do i find the triforce in level 
seven underworld labyrinth 
in most customer service departments that would stop em cold 
but for executives at the home office of nintendo of america 
inc the 40000 to 50000 children who call each week with such 
arcane inquiries about nintendos home video games are a reassuring 
sign their toy is still tops 
a little over 18 months ago nintendo a 99yearold japanese 
playing card manufacturer and maker of the popular arcade game 
donkey kong jumped headlong into home video games an american 
market most thought was stone dead 
today the wholly owned subsidiary of nintendo co ltd of japan 
claims to have captured 70 percent of a us market that should hit 
19 billion in 1988 
for 1987 nintendo of america had sales of 750 million out of a 
11 billion market that helped push profits for nintendo ltd to 
1728 million on sales of 987 million for fiscal year 1987 
ending aug 31 compared with profits of 1131 million on sales of 
8295 million in fiscal 1986 
without question theyre the preeminent force in the video 
game industry said rick anguilla editor of toy amp hobby world a 
trade publication that has ranked the nintendo entertainment system 
as the topselling toy for the past six months 
they learned from the mistakes that were made the first time 
around and they had the foresight to see that the american 
consumers were not the ones who stopped playing video games 
anguilla said it was more a case of american and japanese 
manufacturers putting so much bad product in the marketplace that 
it sort of ruined it for everybody 
at the height of the video craze 3 billion in games were sold 
in 1982 nintendo says but by 1985 the fad appeared over with 
sales just 100 million and manufacturers unloading 35 game 
cartridges for 5 or less 
about that time nintendo began testmarketing its entertainment 
system a small computer that played game cartridges and two sets 
of control panels add in a light gun and foothigh robot that 
would act out some games and the list price was 19995 
you really have to admire the nerve to walk into a lot of 
retailers in 1985 and ask if they wanted to buy a video game 
anguilla said 
but bill white nintendo advertising and public relations 
director said the product had been wildly successful in japan 
selling more than 10 million units since 1983 with games in 30 
percent of all japanese homes 
we liked it right from the start said michael goldstein 
chief financial officer for the retailing giant toys r us the more 
detailed and higherquality games made consumers feel they were 
getting their moneys worth he said 
if theres been a problem goldstein said its been supply 
when you have something thats hot it sells out he said 
for last christmas the game packages were reconfigured 
eliminating the robot and sold for around 100 
white said that nearly four months later nintendo still has 
trouble keeping up with demand it shipped 3 million entertainment 
systems last year and recently upped its 1988 forecast from 5 
million to 7 million 
steven eisenberg leisure industry analyst for bear stearns amp 
co in new york said he doubts such growth can be sustained but 
he said the video game industry has reestablished its stability 
and should see longterm gowth of 12 percent to 15 percent a year 
competitors atari corp with about 16 percent of the market 
and tonka cos sega with about 10 percent may make some inroads 
but are far from challenging nintendos dominance eisenberg said 
what brought video games back from the dead eisenberg said 
were nintendos elaborate graphics sharp resolution and 
highquality sound also notes anguilla theres a factor 
toymakers call play value what laymen call fun 
the oldstyle games often had plots as simple as eradicating 
space bugs flitting around the screen but nintendo games are 
intricate the top seller a swordandsorcery yarn called the 
legend of zelda leads players through 700 scenes in which they 
defeat wizards solve mazes and eventually rescue the princess 
zelda a process that can take up to 90 hours and then be played 
all over again 
nintendo maintains strict control awarding licenses to game 
makers to produce five new titles a year each nintendo gets final 
say on content 
among the 55 existing or planned titles are a soupedup version 
of donkey kong called super mario bros rad racer a 
carrace game ice hockey and mike tysons punchout a 
boxing game promoted by the heavyweight champ 
howard phillips is nintendos product analysis manager in 
charge of approving the games hes more widely known however as 
president of the fun club a fan organization with more than 1 
million on its magazines mailing list 
phillips says nintendo is looking at expanding beyond its 
initial target market of boys 815 with more adventure games and 
versions of the tv shows jeopardy and wheel of fortune that 
should appeal to adults 
in japan the nintendo box has been used to provide stock market 
quotes home shopping and even to power a knitting machine he said 
phillips also oversees the phone bank of game counselors who 
he says get asked the zelda and the triforce question about 5000 
times a week 
the answer go to the tip of the nose and defeat all the wall 
masters and push all the blocks and a secret passage will 
appear he said 
the kids will know all about that

while legions of wall streeters have headed for 
the unemployment lines since octobers market crash some 
highrolling investment bankers takeover lawyers and acquisition 
handholders have shifted into fifth gear 
weve been intensely busy for a long time now we are 
perhaps intensely busier said stephen fraidin a partner of 
fried frank harris shriver amp jacobson a new york law firm that 
handles takeovers 
some of the more entrepreneurial members of this inner sanctum 
have shifted out of oldline establishments altogether to set up 
their own shops otherwise known as boutiques 
indeed some of the hottest talk on wall street of late 
surrounded the string of defections from first boston corps 
mergers and acquisitions department superstars bruce wasserstein 
and joseph r perella who ran the highly successful operation 
announced in february they were leaving to form their own firm 
taking a score of staffers with them 
first boston was wiped out in that department one wall 
street insider said wasserstein and perella took the 20 best 
people and they are the business he added 
these boutiques are not merely highclass consulting firms with 
huge pools of international money available from pension funds 
insurance companies and the like they have access to enough 
capital to spin their own deals 
and boutiques are counting big players as clients the 
blackstone group advised japans bridgestone corp on its proposed 
venture with firestone tire amp rubber co while wasserstein 
perella amp co is counseling campeau corp in its battle against 
rh macy amp co for federated department stores inc 
one senior mergers and acquisitions banker said boutiques have 
created a second force in an industry that has evolved into a 
veritable oligopoly 
there are three firms among us that are capturing probably 80 
percent of the takeover market he said in reference to shearson 
lehman hutton inc goldman sachs amp co and morgan stanley amp co 
boutiques are vying hard for that remaining 20 percent 
this banker predicted that the recent wave of takeover activity 
could push firstquarter profits to record heights at the three 
major houses 
merger activity is carrying over to the results of the overall 
firm he said 
but that may be the very reason boutiques are popping up 
since the m and a people are on top at the moment they want 
it all for themselves and do not want to carry everybody else so 
they start their own boutiques said robert pirie president of 
rothschild inc which has advised sir james goldsmith the 
anglofrench financier

united press international will continue 
as a 24houraday worldwide wire service and will reduce its staff 
and seek joint ventures with other companies the firms new owners 
said today 
upi chairman earl w brian and president paul steinle said they 
were committed to seeing the 81yearold wire service which is 
losing 2 million a month survive into the 21st century 
the upi officials in a statement released at a news conference 
said their new business plan calls for continuation of the 
company as a fullservice 24houraday worldwide supplier of 
news and information 
to accomplish these goals upi will lay off as many as 150 
staffers worldwide but fewer than 100 of those will be from the 
editorial side steinle said at this time we do not anticipate 
further cutbacks he said to assist the departing staffers upi 
will provide a benefits package and help them find new jobs 
steinle said the wire services operators who took control of 
the company in february had conducted a market survey based on 
interviews with 500 senior executives in the news industry 
as a result we are making major changes in the way we design 
and deliver our products and are instituting procedures to ensure 
that we are constantly sensitive to what our customers want he 
said 
steinle said upis development will start at the grass roots 
and will focus on strengthening state and regional reporting he 
said the wire service also will stress technical reporting 
this includes an increased emphasis on business and financial 
news and analysis and its effect on the consumer plus more and 
better reporting in areas such as health science law and 
medicine he said 
many of the changes will be phased in over the next several 
months but upi clients should see immediate improvements as a 
result of staff training programs to develop greater writing 
clarity and succinctness the announcement said 
the statement said the wire service expects to save 10 million 
in the first year through administrative cost controls additional 
savings will come from pooling resources with other companies that 
offer joint venture potential for upi in the information industry 
moreover there will be a gradual unbundling of upi products 
over the next year which will give the company an opportunity to 
reprice products and expand those sought by customers 
brian said the people targeted for layoffs were notified 
personally today and about 35 were offered early retirement the 
staff reductions amount to 14 percent of upis employees he said 
asked how upi hoped to improve coverage with fewer people 
steinle said the staff will be not as large but more focused 
for instance he said efforts are being made to improve 
productivity by reprogramming computers to perform routine 
functions such as automatic pronouncers for broadcast copy 
additionally the spanishlanguage translation desk will be 
moved from washington to central or latin america upi announced 
brian said the unbundling of upis products will allow customers 
to buy the services they want without having to purchase unwanted 
services this type of unbundling he said should help upi sales 
with nonmedia clients who are expected to make up more of the 
wire services client base in the future 
brian the new chairman said i estimate approximately 15 
million in permanent equity financing will be required by the time 
we have completed the second phase of the business plan 
the first phase of the business plan expected to take three to 
six months is designed to stabilize the company the second phase 
will redirect the company into new and expanded lines of business 
all told the twoyear business plan should bring upi to 
profitability in two years brian said 
until equity financing is in place bridge financing will be 
made available by wnw group inc and infotechnology inc 
brian is chairman of wnw a media investment group formed to 
take control of upi and infotechnology a new yorkbased 
information technology and venture capital firm 
we know how to operate companies within their means and we 
have links to other companies with significant future joint venture 
potential for upi in the information industry brian said 
as an example of jointventure possibilities brian cited a new 
electronic news and information product called dbc supernews 
created by financial news network data broadcasting corp an fnn 
subsidiary and comtex scientific corp dbc supernews allows 
anyone with a personal computer at over 28 million cable tv sites 
to receive realtime news on any subject gathered from upi and 
other major news sources by comtex 
supernews will be available at very low cost because fnn can 
deliver it by satellite as part of its regular television signal 
brian and infotechnology own about 20 percent of fnn

president reagan today urged congressional 
approval of his request for 365 million to begin construction of 
the superconducting super collider saying the technology it 
represents is changing the way we live 
i know that some people may question the practical 
applications of the superconducting super collider the president 
said the strange world of subatomic particles they may think 
will never be more than an arcane interest to a few highly 
specialized scientists 
but the truth is the practical applications of this new 
technology are already changing the way we live the president 
told a gathering of science students and others in the rose garden 
every time someone turns on his desk computer makes a phone 
call or plays a video game he is plugging into that mysterious 
world of quantum physics reagan said the superconducting 
super collider is the doorway to that new world of quantum change 
the superconducting super collider will investigate the origin 
and nature of matter by whirling beams of protons into each other 
at an energy 20 times greater than is now possible in a 
53milearound underground tunnel 
the students in the audience were part of a program established 
in 1985 that gives top students from each state an opportunituy to 
work for two weeks in the summer at national laboratories in the 
washington area 
reagan approved construction of the collider the worlds 
largest energy particle accelerator in january 1987 the 
department of energy asked for site proposals in april 1987 and 36 
of the 43 proposals received were judged qualified 
the national academy of sciences and the national academy of 
engineering selected eight as the best qualified the sites were in 
arizona colorado illinois michigan new york north carolina 
tennessee and texas 
secretary of energy john s herrington is sheduled to recommend 
a preferred site in july and the final site is to be chosen in 
january after an environmental imnpact study 
some scientists oppose the project saying it would be too 
expensive and drain money from more desirable scientific projects 
however six nobel laureates four of whom were present for the 
ceremony wrote reagan that the project represents americas 
commitment to the pursuit of excellence in basic scientific 
research 
although reagan spoke seriously of his dedication to the 
project he opened his remarks with a joke about it 
when i first heard about this place where things go round and 
round at great speeds and then crash into each other i thought 
tney were talking about a presidential campaign the president

thursday is the last day to qualify for the big 
airlines triplemileage programs and travelers have been flocking 
to the skies to beat the deadline 
this is their time to strike said suzanne jensen a 
spokeswoman for uniglobe travel international inc a large 
travel agency franchiser based in richmond british columbia 
to drum up business in the slow winter months the major 
airlines offered to triple all mileage credits accumulated by 
participants in frequentflier programs this year if the member 
took at least one roundtrip or two oneway flights on that carrier 
between by the end of the day thursday 
the deadline coupled with the approach of easter and school 
vacations seems to have touched off a flying spree with many 
travelers taking short relatively cheap flights in order to 
qualify for the bonus mileage 
the rush has mainly caught up ordinary consumers rather than 
frequent business travelers who qualified earlier in the year for 
triple credits 
there may be some short hops out there being taken for 
qualifying trips said alan loflin a spokesman for pan am corp 
we were extremely heavy this weekend all over the pan am 
system 
he said traffic was especially thick on pan ams northeast 
corridor shuttle service and on pan am express both shorthaul 
operations for the international carrier pan am express serves 
about a dozen cities in the northeast and feeds into the airlines 
main hub in new york while the shuttle links new york washington 
and boston 
uniglobes jensen reported an especially big flurry of business 
in the west and midwest with a lot of western customers booking 
short trips from los angeles for example to las vegas san 
francisco or san diego 
launched at the start of the year by delta air lines the 
triplemileage marketing weapon was quickly embraced by other major 
carriers hoping to bolster business during the first quarter which 
is traditionally the slowest for leisure travel 
triple mileage is an extension of the popular frequentflier 
programs which reward passengers with free tickets or upgrades to 
first class after they have flown a set number of miles 
weve had some very heavy passenger loads the past few days 
said dan sheehy a spokesman for united airlines it looks like 
people are rushing to qualify for triple mileage 
united the nations largest airline saw passengers board its 
planes in record numbers last weekend on its 400 or so daily 
flights out of its hub at chicagos ohare international airport 
sheehy reported boardings on friday saturday and sunday ranged 
from around 45000 to more than 49000 a day compared with 
uniteds average rate of 30000 to 35000 
secondranked american airlines had a similar increase in 
passenger traffic last weekend spokeswoman mary oneill said 
eastern airlines also has experienced a travel frenzy 
recently spokeswoman paula musto said citing the twin factors of 
easter and the triplemileage deadline 
observers said most major airlines are reaping the same 
lastminute windfall with one notable exception delta which 
started the triplemileage competition did not impose a deadline 
for eligibility spokesman neil monroe said 
deltas frequentflier program including the triple mileage 
feature is also unique in that all tickets must be charged on an 
american express card

the japanese government hailed the usjapan 
accord on access to japans construction market but japanese 
construction executives expressed wariness about the agreement 
wednesday 
since this agreement came about when japanese firms are still 
barred from the us public works market i am dissatisfied 
hajime sako president of the japan federation of construction 
contractors said in a statement 
washington banned japanese companies from us public works 
projects last year because of japans restrictive policies 
it is good that the two countries were able to reach an 
agreement prime minister noboru takeshita told reporters 
construction minister ihei ochi said he was satisfied that japan 
had done enough to help american companies take part in japanese 
construction projects long seen as representing continued closure 
of japans markets 
japan will honor the agreement and with the cooperation of 
japans construction industry i hope things will go smoothly in 
the future ochi said 
japanese and us negotiators agreed japan will encourage 
foreign participation in major public works projects financed by 
the japanese government and other projects carried out by japanese 
companies with funding from both the central and local governments 
the united states had threatened to invoke a law calling for 
retaliation unless negotiations this week produced an accord 
allowing us companies to bid on an equal footing with japanese 
firms for hundreds of millions of dollars of work in large public 
works projects in japan 
such projects include airports and airport terminals 
particularly the planned kansai international airport in western 
japan plus conference halls expressways and bridges 
keizo obuchi chief cabinet secretary and takeshitas top aide 
told a press conference the successful conclusion of the washington 
talks was a victory over protectionism and said he hoped the 
agreement will have a favorable influence over deliberations in 
the us congress on various trade bills 
on the tokyo stock exchange construction company stocks were 
boosted by the progress of the talks and announcement of the 
accord possibly because investors believed it would lead the 
united states to drop restrictions on them 
since monday shimizu construction surged 33 yen to 934 yen 
742 per share while taisei corp rose 22 yen to 969 yen 775 
and kajima corp jumped 40 yen to 1550 yen 1240 
japanese construction executives however expressed caution 
sako said he was happy japan has been able to prevent us 
retaliation but said it was unavoidable that japan had to 
compromise to bring about a resolution to the deadlock 
teruzo yoshino president of shimizu construction thanked the 
government wednesday for reaching a conclusion without us 
retaliation but stopped short of endorsing the accord 
from now i hope the japanese industry discusses the issue 
fully to develop a policy yoshino said in a statement 
the european economic community charged the japanus agreement 
ignores other countries 
the ec has repeatedly warned against bilateral deals on trade 
and public procurement and particularly against this tendency 
between japan and the us said michael lake a counsellor at 
the ec delegation in tokyo 
european firms have shown more practical interest than 
american firms in the kansai airport he said we do not regard 
any usjapan deal as infringing on our rights to pursue our own 
interests in this market 
a french firms design was chosen for the kansai airports 
terminal and european firms are hoping to follow with actual 
construction contracts

contracting for future construction projects 
jumped 10 percent in february recouping januarys 8 percent 
decline according to a report published thursday 
the survey by the fw dodge division of mcgrawhill 
information systems co estimated the annualized value of all 
newly started construction projects in february at 2497 billion 
the highest level since last october 
while the february increase was paced by a 14 percent surge in 
nonresidential building the construction information service said 
housing and public works also contributed to the advance 
the gain in nonresidential construction was concentrated in 
commercial and industrial buildings up 32 percent while 
institutional construction projects declined 11 percent 
fw dodge said its seasonally adjusted index of construction 
contracting rose to 159 in february from 145 in january which was 
its lowest level in two years the index is based on a level of 100 
for 1982 
because construction activity can be notoriously erratic 
during the winter months februarys welcome gain in contracting 
needs to be paired with januarys sharp decline said george a 
christie vice president and chief economist for fw dodge 
taken together he said january and february showed the rate of 
new construction contracting to be 5 percent below the fourth 
quarter of last year extending a gentle decline from the peak rate 
reached in the third quarter of 1987 
contracting for residential buildings rose 9 percent in february 
to an annualized value of 1202 billion according to the report 
it noted however that the improvement was limited to multifamily 
housing and hotels and motels while the singlefamily sector 
showed little change 
public works and utility construction in february was valued at 
434 billion up 3 percent from january but 5 percent below the 
average level in 1987

a new agriculture department analysis of last 
years trade situation helps point the direction for us farm 
exports in 1988 and beyond if a year or two can be called the 
beginning of a trend 
basically the report showed that the value of agricltural 
exports in the 1988 calendar year rose while imports of 
agricultural commodities declined that resulted in a larger trade 
balance in favor of american farmers 
the periodic report is called fatus which stands for foreign 
agricultural trade of the united states it was issued last week by 
the departments economic research service 
a bit of background may be useful 
one of the quirks of usda agencies that sometimes confuses as 
well as informs is the practice of compiling statistics for 
different time periods there is the fiscal year which begins each 
oct 1 and the calender year which commences on jan 1 
then there are crop years which vary according to the 
commodity and the marketing year which is just as confusing and 
can include livestock as well as crops international trade figures 
often are reported for years beginning on july 1 
under most circumstances the most popular usda farm trade 
figures are those for the fiscal year running fr 45 0

the british pound has jumped to its highest level 
in two years boosted by a strong economy britains relatively 
high interest rates and prime minister margaret thatchers 
unrelenting grip on inflation 
sterling held relatively steady for 12 months and was uncapped 
when the conservative government decided earlier this month to ease 
central bank intervention and allow the pound to rise above a 
previous target against the west german mark 
it is a currency renaissance said keith skeoch chief 
economist at the london investment firm james capel and co what 
were beginning to see is the transition of sterling from being one 
of the weaker brethren among the international currencies to one of 
the stronger 
jonathan lopatin vice president for foreign exchange dealing at 
goldman sachs amp co in london said the authorities decided to 
allow sterling exchange rates to rise 
the bank of englands index measuring the pounds tradeweighted 
value against 17 currencies finished at 777 on wednesday 
unchanged from tuesday when it rose 06 point to reach its highest 
level since closing at 78 on jan 16 1986 
on wednesday the pound rose to 18790 from 18705 and to 
31225 west german marks from 31069 marks 
in the past seven years the pound has hit a low of 10470 in 
february 1985 and a high of 24525 in november 1980 
until taking the rein off the pound this month the government 
through the bank of englands sale of pounds and purchase of west 
german marks had closely guarded a rate of 3 marks it also has 
controlled sterling by signaling changes in interest rates 
but that ceiling was lifted because there was a great deal of 
market pressure pushing sterling up at that rate more people 
wanted to buy it than sell it lopatin said 
it certainly has been made clear in the eye of the foreign 
exchange market and investors that the government is more concerned 
about the threat of inflation than they are at holding the exchange 
rate at any particular level 
mrs thatchers priority has been to control inflation now 
running at an annual rate of 33 percent compared with a 18 percent 
in 1980 
that means the government is less likely to cut interest rates 
further for fear of reigniting inflation 
britains high interest rates compared with the rates of other 
major industrialized nations make pounddenominated investments 
more attractive and create demand for sterling 
the british commercial banks base lending rate a benchmark 
interest rate stands at 85 percent 
the strong economy however is the underlying factor pushing up 
the pound 
britains gross domestic product its total output of goods and 
services is expected to grow 3 percent in 1988 faster than any 
of its major trading partners except japan that will be the 
economys seventh consecutive year of expansion 
other propound factors are a fiscal budget surplus the first 
in nearly 20 years announced march 15 political stability and a 
conservative government 
they all are the hallmarks of a basically hard currency 
skeoch said 
the trade deficit is forecast to widen sharply with the strong 
currency which can hurt exports and encourage imports 
on tuesday the pound also was boosted by rumors that chancellor 
of the exchequer nigel lawson had resigned even though the 
treasury issued a denial and by a later statement from mrs 
thatcher that she and her finance minister werent split on policy 
the pound would be allowed to find its own level under a new 
chancellor dealers first speculated then they decided the 
authorities wont step in to restrain the pound even if he stayed 
both mr lawson and i put downward pressure on inflation as 
topmost priority both of us think interest rate stability can be 
very useful to industry mrs thatcher said in response to a 
question in the house of commons 
mrs thatcher and lawson have expressed differing views in 
recent weeks he for restraining the pound and she being more 
concerned about inflation 
meanwhile the analysts expect the pound to continue to move 
upward skeoch said he expected the pound to reach 320 marks 
within a few months and 204 later in the year

political opponents attacked prime minister 
margaret thatchers plan to inject 800 million pounds into 
automaker rover group plc when the government sells it off calling 
it an amazing giveaway 
the rover plan criticized tuesday in parliament would come to 
the aid of the automaker with the equivalent of 149 billion in 
government funds 
the plan part of mrs thatchers huge and ongoing privatization 
program also is likely to create controversy in the european 
economic communitys executive commission without whose approval 
the plan cannot proceed 
british aerospace plc announced tuesday that it had reached an 
agreement to acquire rover from the government for 150 million 
pounds or about 279 million a cheaper price than had been 
expected the government would make the cash injection to reduce 
rovers debt british aerospace said 
labor party legislator bryan gould who serves as a spokesman on 
industrial issues for the opposition party said the british 
aerospace announcement was astonishing and attacked the plan as an 
easter giveaway 
lord williams also a member of the opposition said british 
aerospace shareholders will no doubt think christmas has come 
rather early this year 
gould claimed that the government was paying british aerospace 
650 million pounds enough to raise the governments child benefit 
by 1 pound a week to persuade them to walk away with net assets 
worth 770 million pounds 
gould demanded a full house of commons debate on the issue after 
the easter recess 
trade secretary lord young countered this is not a knockdown 
price and described the package as the deal of the decade 
rover chairman graham day said the sale was good for the company 
and its employees 
british aerospace chairman roland smith promised to develop the 
combined company and not to destroy it 
one condition the government has attached to the rover sale is 
that british aerospace must not dispose of any of the business 
within five years 
the conservative partys large majority in the house of commons 
guarantees passage of mrs thatchers policies 
rover group which is made up of automaker austin rover and land 
rover which produces utility vehicles recently announced a 1987 
profit before taxes of 279 million pounds or about 52 million 
that compared with a loss of 3556 million pounds or around 661 
million in 1986 
mrs thatcher has sold 165 billion pounds worth of stateowned 
companies since she came to power in 1979 as part of her 
capitalist revolution her goals have been to make those 
companies more competitive as well as to get more shares into the 
hands of the british public

companies are increasingly demanding 
concessionary contracts as a tactic for provoking strikes in an 
effort to drive unions out of their plants a house subcommittee 
was told wednesday 
labor leaders for now are combatting the effort by instructing 
their members to keep working after a contract expires and wages 
and benefits are unilaterally cut by an employer 
but through an orchestrated series of congressional hearings 
they also are trying to build a case for lauching another attempt 
to change the nations labor laws if a democrat is elected 
president next fall so that it would be more difficult from 
companies to hire strikebreakers 
local union officials at paper chemical and meatpacking plants 
complained wednesday to a sympathetic subcommittee of the house 
education and labor committee that the national labor relations act 
has been turned againt them 
rep william clay dmo chairman of the committees 
labormanagement relations subcommittee said the growing 
antiunion tactics adopted by employers and approved by the 
national labor relations board threatens the future of collective 
bargaining 
what was once the workers weapon of last resort the strike 
is now being used as a tool by employers to terminate bargaining 
relationships clay said employers are purposely adopting 
bargaining positions intended to drive their workers out on the 
picket line 
ken tritz president of a paperworkers union local in missoula 
mont said its members have been working at a stone container 
corp paper mill the past seven months without a contract after the 
company tried to provoke a strike 
as a result he said his members have been losing premium 
vacation and holiday pay incentives as well as some of the fringe 
benefits they formerly had he estimated the lost wages and 
benefits for each worker at about 7000 a year 
the company was so convinced that it would succeed in 
provoking a strike and breaking a strike that it prepared a 
manual for strikebreakers tritz said we chose to work without 
a contract at this time because the alternatives were even more 
obnoxious would you rather be shot or hung some choice 
no stone container officials testified at tuesdays hearing but 
a vice president of another paper company locked in a lengthy 
strike at three plants with the paperworkers union testifed that 
union officials and their members were repeatedly warned that 
replacements for them would be hired 
competition both domestic and foreign is real serious and 
does not allow a labor strike time out said john nevin a vice 
president of international paper co if we are not producing one 
of our competitors will gladly take our place

reynolds metals co celebrating the 20th 
anniversary of the first aluminum can recycling said wednesday it 
is expanding its network of companyoperated recylcing 
installations 
more than 650 units will be operating by the middle of the year 
compared with about 500 last year and about 600 now company 
officials said at a news conference 
since reynolds began buying used cans in los angeles in 1968 
the first in the industry to do so it has bought 88 billion cans 
to melt into aluminum ingots in its furnaces 
the industry has bought 270 billion cans the company estimates 
and is recycling about half of current production reynolds itself 
is recycling more than 100 percent of can production it buys more 
cans than it sells 
scrap aluminum is the cheapest source of raw material in part 
because aluminum manufacture is energyintensive it takes 65 
kilowatthours of electricity to make a can from ore and only about 
5 percent of that energy to make a can from scrap 
reynolds started out paying 8 cents per pound the price 
fluctuates according to the world market and currently reynolds 
pays 42 cents to 46 cents for a pound of cans about 26 cans or 
16 cents to 18 cents per can 
a brewer or other bottler pays about 75 cents for a can with a 
label printed on it 
reynolds estimates the handling costs double that before the 
metal is in a form equivalent to what would result from smelting 
the ore at that price scrapderived aluminum is still cheaper 
than orederived but the company declines to release exact figures 
prices have been rising recently and aluminum trades on the 
london metal exchange at about 131 a pound in the form of 19ton 
ingots 
can production is rising at better than a 6 percent annual rate 
by about 5 billion cans a year william o bourke reynolds 
president and chief executive officer said the company believes 80 
percent can be recycled by the year 2000 as more and more cities 
turn to recycling programs to ease thir wastehandling problems and 
the shortage of landfill space 
but he opposed as not costeffective the socalled bottle 
bills that some states have enacted to require refundable 
deposits on beverage containers 
manufacturers of competing containers should make it possible 
for people to return the bottles for cash he said but he 
conceded that those companies would find it difficult since their 
materials are not as valuable as scrap aluminum 
reynolds spokesman bob shaffer said later the company opposed 
bottle bills also to retain the good will of its bottler customers

five japanese automakers have been dumping small 
trucks on the us market costing us workers jobs and the us 
auto industry 500 million in lost wages sales and profits a 
study released wednesday claimed 
the 42page study was commissioned by the us motor vehicle 
manufacturers association on behalf of general motors corp ford 
motor co and chrysler corp 
the study analysts concluded that the effect of this dumping 
margin was something on the order of 140000 lost units of 
production to us manufacturers said mvma president thomas 
hanna 
the investigation by the washington dc law firm wilmer 
cutler amp pickering found that the five japanese companies are 
selling compact pickup trucks for 10 percent to 48 percent less in 
the united states than they charge in their japanese home market 
dumping is illegal under trade agreements between the united 
states and its foreign partners the companies charged with dumping 
by the mvma are toyota motor corp nissan motor co mazda motor 
corp isuzu motor co and mitsubishi motors corp 
toyota immediately denied the charges in statement by robert 
mccurry senior vice president of toyota motor sales usa 
any assertions that japanese compact trucks are injuring or 
threatening to injure the us industry ring hollow mccurry 
said first us producers are enjoying their greatest success 
in history collectively continuing to set records for sales and 
profits 
second japanese truck sales continue to decline and presently 
represent the smallest share of the us market since compact 
trucks were introduced by the japanese he said 
mccurry has been the most outspoken japanese auto company 
executive in denying charges leveled this year particularly by 
chrysler corp executives 
in previous defenses mccurry and executives for other japanese 
auto companies have said that the strength of the japanese yen 
against other currencies has made it cheaper for them to buy raw 
materials 
in addition japanese automakers have worked aggressively to cut 
production costs they said 
in a letter accompanying the study which was handdelivered to 
commerce secretary william veritys office tuesday afternoon the 
mvma asked that the us government begin negotiating with the 
japanese government to end the dumping 
however claire buchan a commerce department spokeswoman said 
the us government has only initiated a dumping investigation 
once in a semiconductor case 
in the vast majority of dumping cases she said it is up to the 
us industry involved to file petitions with the commerce 
department and the international trade commission 
if the two agencies find dumping has occurred and has injured a 
us industry then the government assesses a duty on the imported 
product that is equal to the difference between the prices charged 
here and in the products home market 
john greenwald an attorney with the firm that conducted the 
study said negotiations between the two countries would eliminate 
the need for lengthy and costly litigation involved in filing the 
petitions 
the white paper was prepared in hopes they would go to 
japanese government and say dumping is causing us problems not 
only in compact pickups but in other products and preventing the 
exchangerate realignment from curing the trade deficit 
greenwald said 
automotive products account for about half of the nearly 60 
billion us trade deficit with japan greenwald said continued 
dumping and denials of dumping would push the value of the dollar 
down further against the yen 
the mvma study found the truck dumping prevented us makers 
from fully using factory space from moving car workers to truck 
production jobs instead of laying them off or from earning healthy 
returns on production and sales of small pickups 
it estimated the cost to the us auto industry and its workers 
at 500 million in lost wages profits and sales 
for example according to the study toyota charges 3988 at 
the factory for a small pickup destined for the us market and 
5313 for the same truck destined for sale in its home market 
the studys authors wrote that when the japanese yen began to 
appreciate against the dollar two years ago the japanese producers 
lost the price advantage that had enabled them to undersell 
american makers 
faced with the choice between surrendering the gains in import 
levels or dumping they decided to dump the study said 
the authors also called japanese makers response that the 
dumping has caused no harm absurd

eastman kodak co and fuqua industries 
inc said wednesday they had combined their photofinishing 
operations although a lawsuit challenging the merger is still 
being argued 
kodak and the atlantabased fuqua wasted no time in completing 
the deal tuesday after the us circuit court of appeals in new 
orleans reversed a lower courts injunction that had blocked the 
merger since feb 22 
qualex inc combines fuquas photofinishing subsidiary 
colorcraft corp with kodakowned laboratories to form the 
countrys largest wholesale photofinishing operation it has 94 
processing labs around the country 
paul allen a kodak spokesman said the target date for the 
merger had been feb 1 
the court of appeals decided that phototron corp a small san 
bernardino califbased photofinisher had no right to try to 
block the merger although it may continue pursuing its lawsuit 
allen said 
phototron sued kodak over the photo giants colorwatch 
photofinishing system claiming it violates antitrust laws because 
it is forcing noncolorwatch processing labs out of business said 
joseph alioto a photron lawyer 
alioto said phototron is seeking between 100 million and 150 
million in damages because of colorwatch the merger he said will 
just increase that range 
nonetheless alioto said wednesday that he plans to ask the 
supreme court to issue a temporary injunction preventing the merger 
until he can file a request for the court to consider the matter 
as far as were concerned the supreme court should get a look 
at this thing prior to the scrambling of the eggs alioto said 
as far as kodak and fuqua are concerned the eggs have already 
been scrambled 
the company will be based in durham nc the home of 
colorcraft and colorcrafts former chairman d carl hamill will 
serve as chief executive officer 
the lawsuit filed by phototron is being heard in us district 
court in fort worth texas and is expected to continue regardless 
of the status of the injunction blocking the merger

the rising british pound continued to take 
center stage in foreign exchange wednesday at the expense of the 
dollar which lost ground against most key currencies despite 
reports of central bank intervention 
gold prices edged higher after falling overseas republic 
national bank of new york said gold was bid at 45625 a troy ounce 
as of 4 pm est up 1 from late tuesday 
currency traders said the dollar was hurt by sterlings 
strength although it managed to gain some ground in europe 
trading was said to be generally quiet everywhere in anticipation 
of the upcoming easter and passover holidays 
british chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson speaking to a 
committee in parliament said wednesday that the pound has moved 
higher recently only as a result of tight monetary policy not due 
to an adjustment in any specific targeting by the government 
one trader at a major british bank said such comments 
represented nothing new but it is taken as a confirmation the 
government was unlikely to tamper with the pound in its current 
higher range and could allow it to appreciate further 
nigel lawson implied that the rise in sterling was 
something that was still in the spirit of the louvre accord of 
currency stabilization said james t mcgroarty a trader and 
vice president at discount corp 
the traders took that to mean that the central bank had 
decided to let it go i dont buy that i think there may be some 
action to slow the sterlings rise 
still many traders said that with prime minister margaret 
thatcher bank of england governor robin leighpemberton and lawson 
backing a lowinflation stragtegy and paying less attention to the 
pound that currency could advance until the middle of next month 
in london the british pound jumped to 18790 from 18705 
tuesday sterling fetched 18780 in new york up from 186425 
earlier in tokyo the dollar closed at 12543 japanese yen up

platinum futures prices soared wednesday for the second 
consecutive session on the new york mercantile exchange on rumors 
of increased japanese buying and an improving economic outlook 
on other markets copper and precious metals futures advanced 
energy futures were higher livestock and meat prices retreated 
grains and soybeans were mixed and stockindex futures fell back 
platinum settled 1210 a troy ounce to 1380 an ounce higher 
on the nymex with the contract for delivery in april at 53250 an 
ounce 
platinum prices have gained about 75 a troy ounce in the past 
two months as economic data have increasingly dispelled fears of a 
recession and pointed toward higher inflation 
gold prices have also advanced on inflation concerns but 
platinum has an edge because of its strong industrialuse 
component analysts said 
although there was no fresh positive economic news on wednesday 
rumors that japanese firms planned to increase their purchases of 
platinum gave the market a boost said stephen w platt an analyst 
in chicago with dean witter reynolds inc 
heightened racial tensions in south africa the source of most 
of the refined platinum on the market also underpinned the rise in 
prices platt said 
copper futures also posted strong gains wednesday on new yorks 
commodity exchange with the april contract settling 395 cents 
higher at 10795 a pound 
a sustained rally in industrialmetals prices likely would be 
perceived as inflationary which could push gold and silver prices 
higher as well said analyst craig sloane of smith barney harris 
upham amp co 
on the comex gold settled 150 to 220 higher with april at 
45780 a troy ounce silver was 47 cents to 55 cents higher with 
april at 6757 a troy ounce 
unleaded gasoline led energy futures prices higher on the new 
york mercantile exchange 
the buying stemmed from a strong increase in demand reflected by 
tuesdays weekly american petroleum institute report showing a 
422millionbarrel drawdown in gasoline stocks to 230 million 
barrels 
thats 156 million barrels behind last year said andrew 
lebow an analyst in new york with edamp f man international 
futures inc were seeing very strong demand for gasoline and 
that seems to be dragging the other markets up 
lebow said higher speed limits have resulted in greater 
consumption of gasoline a sharp increase in wholesale demand in 
the past two weeks may have reflected dealer stockpiling ahead of 
the easterpassover weekend he said 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 1 cent to 11 cents 
higher with may at 1708 a barrel heating oil was 32 cent to 45 
cent higher with april at 4860 cents a gallon unleaded gasoline 
was 11 cent to 53 cent higher with april at 4865 cents a gallon 
cattle futures retreated on the chicago mercantile exchange on 
fears that consumer demand for beef will drop when recent price 
increases in the cash cattle market reach grocery stores in the 
form of higher beef prices said chuck levitt an analyst in 
chicago with shearson lehman hutton inc 
pork futures prices fell as traders squared their positions 
ahead of thursday afternoons 10state hogs and pigs report from 
the agriculture department he said 
live cattle were 05 cent to 62 cent lower with april at 75 
cents a pound feeder cattle were 07 cent to 78 cent lower with 
march at 8275 cents a pound hogs were 58 cent lower to 07 cent 
higher with april at 4535 cents a pound frozen pork bellies were 
unchanged to 28 cent lower with may at 5590 cents a pound 
wheat settled slightly higher on the chicago board of trade 
while corn and soybean prices retreated in light trading 
wheat was supported by expectations that the soviet union would 
bid thursday for 500000 metric tons of us wheat analysts said 
acceptance of the bid by the usda would complete a soviet purchase 
of 1 million metric tons of wheat it was recently offered under the 
usdas export enhancement program 
the slight downward movement of soybeans and the other grains 
reflected positionevening ahead of the usdas thursday afternoon 
reports on spring planting intentions and us grain stocks said 
joel karlin research analyst for research department inc in 
chicago 
wheat settled cent to 1 cents higher with may at 302 a 
bushel corn was 1 cents to 2 cents lower with may at 209 a

texaco inc said it filed an appeal of a 
multibilliondollar damage judgment to the us supreme court on 
wednesday but stressed the move was only a formality in the event 
its settlement with pennzoil co fell through 
texaco agreed in december to pay pennzoil 3 billion in return 
for pennzoil dropping the 103 billion judgment the settlement 
was the keystone of a bankruptcy reorganization plan that was 
approved by a us bankruptcy court judge in white plains ny 
last week 
the plan is scheduled to take effect april 7 at which time 
texaco is to transfer 3 billion to pennzoil and begin payment of 
26 billion to its other creditors texaco said it would withdraw 
its request for a supreme court hearing at that time 
pennzoil won the judgment when a houston jury ruled texaco had 
improperly interfered with a pennzoil acquisition of part of getty 
oil co and bought all of getty itself 
texaco filed for bankruptcy court protection last april to avoid 
having to pay a 11 billion security bond while appealing that 
judgment

spurred by greatly reduced minimum prices 84 
oil companies bid almost 593 million dollars wednesday for leases 
of federal waters in the gulf of mexico 
successful high bids totalled 4046 million according to 
eileen angelico spokeswoman for the minerals management service of 
the interior department 
atlantic richfield co submitted the highest bid of any of the 
companies 182 million for a single 5000acre block identified 
as west cameron block 248 
shell offshore submitted the largest number of bids 250 said 
angelico 
angelico said 931 bids on 684 different tracts had been 
submitted for wednesdays bid opening a breakdown of how many 
tracts were leased to each successful bidder was unavailable 
wednesday afternoon she said 
at a similar lease sale a year ago about 300 bids were 
received angelico the increase in bids was probably due in large 
part to the interior departments drastic drop in the minimum price 
per acre from 150 to 25 
we think that helped the number of bids said angelico 
one thing it did was provide an opportunity for more small 
companies to compete in the sale 
interior secretary donald hodel said last month that the minimum 
bid was dropped to stimulate interest in the lease sale during a 
period of low oil prices 
the lease sale was announced in february when 6265 unleased 
blocks each about 5000 acres went up for sale the blocks are 
anywhere from three miles to 220 miles offshore angelico said

southland corp the parent company of 7eleven 
convenience stores on wednesday reported a net loss of around 59 
million for 1987 because of interest expenses and other costs 
related to its leveraged buyout 
however the company said that in the seven months prior to 
going private it earned 901 million on revenues of 49 billion 
southland said it lost 1497 million in the first five months of 
its new operating structure 
in 1986 southland earned 2004 million on revenues of 78 
billion 
southlands operating performance for the year was quite 
strong especially considering that the company undertook the most 
extensive reorganization and costreduction program in its history 
during the fourth quarter said jere w thompson southland 
president and chief executive officer 
in december southland completed its 49 billion leveraged 
buyout by merging with jt acquisition corp an affiliate of the 
thompson co the investment firm of the founding family 
in a leveraged buyout a company is bought primarily with 
borrowed funds that are repaid with funds generated by the acquired 
companys operations or through asset sales 
southland owns about 7000 7eleven stores and is the nations 
largest independent gasoline retailer with 50 percent interest in 
citgo petroleum corp 
in reporting 1987 earnings southland divided the seven months 
preceding the companys buyout and merger activities from the five 
months at the end of the year 
the company warned a clear comparison between the two earnings 
periods is impossible because of the changed structure and 
different accounting bases 
southland said it does not expect to report a net profit for 
some time because of interest costs to service the lborelated 
debt and other factors

john baldwin of oklahoma city told a us district court jury 
baldwins testimony focused on william patterson 37 who was in 
charge of penn square energy loans when the oklahoma city bank went 
under 
patterson is one of three men being tried on charges of improper 
loan activity that may have played a part in the nearcollapse of 
chicagobased continental illinois national bank amp trust co in 
1984 
all have pleaded innocent 
federal officials have said continental participated with penn 
square in more than 1 billion in uncollectible loans most of 
them energy loans the chicago bank was saved from collapse in 1984 
by a 45 billion federal bailout 
baldwin testified wednesday at patterson should have been aware 
of the banks agreement not to sell off parts of loans that had 
been questioned by federal bank examiners 
patterson violated the pact in 1982 by taking part in the sale 
of at least 5 million in problem loans to continental he said 
baldwin also said patterson didnt seem to care about 
continentals buying loans that carried inordinate risk and was 
concerned only with dumping the penn square energy loans on the 
chicago bank 
the sales shifted virtually the entire burden of risk for those 
loans to continental 
defendant john r lytle 52 of suburban northfield who once 
headed continentals oklahoma oil and gas lending operation is 
accused of buying millions of dollars in poorquality loans from 
penn square in exchange for nearly 600000 in personal unsecured 
loans 
patterson is accused of arranging the personal loans which 
prosecutors characterize as kickbacks 
the third defendant tulsa drilling contractor jere sturgis is 
accused of making payments to lytle in an attempt to obtain loans 
from continental 
prosecutors hope to show that lytle knew or should have known he 
was buying up problem loans for his bank and that patterson knew 
he was dumping off a bad product on lytle 
baldwin told the court that while he was at penn square from 
july 1981 through its closing top bank officials seemed intent on 
expanding their loans to independent oil and gas concerns 
in my opinion the banks growth had no rhyme or reason to 
it he said calling penn square severely understaffed 
lawyers said they expected the trial which began march 9 before 
us district judge milton shadur will last about three more weeks

hilton hotels corp chairman and chief 
executive barron hilton won a major court ruling wednesday in a 
nineyear legal battle over his fathers estate 
the court fight has in effect pitted hilton against several 
orders of catholic nuns devoted to helping the poor who were 
singled out as beneficiaries of the estate of the late conrad 
hilton 
the california court of appeal reversed los angeles county 
probate judges decision and concluded that a stockpurchase option 
granted by the father to the son covers all 678 million of the 
estates shares that is 27 percent of hilton hotels shares 
the stock was given to the conrad n hilton foundation after the 
hotel magnate died in 1979 at age 91 the foundations directors 
were instructed by the elder hiltons will to promote world peace 
and shelter little children with the umbrella of your charity 
nuns as far away as italy were beneficiaries of the estates 
largesse 
the fathers will also gave barron hilton an option to buy stock 
that couldnt be properly held by the foundation 
the dispute centered on a 1969 internal revenue service rule 
prohibiting private foundations from owning more than 20 percent of 
any public company 
barron hilton claimed that since the rule was violated he could 
exercise his option to buy all the stock at 24 per share or 163 
million its value at the time of his fathers death 
the stock today is worth about 598 million 
to avoid the stockownership rule the charitable foundation 
reclassified itself as a publicsupport organization last april a 
probate judge ruled that action was proper and that the foundation 
didnt need to divest itself of the stock 
barron hilton appealed resulting in wednesdays ruling that 
remanded the case to probate court to determine terms of selling 
the stock to barron hilton who now owns only about 4 percent of 
the company 
he said he was very pleased with the action adding it 
validates the positon i have taken since my fathers death and i 
regard this as a significant victory 
the head of hte foundation donald hubbs said he would meet 
soon with the organizations directors to determine what action 
to take but i presume we will appeal to the california supreme 
court
