bloody clashes between muslims and police 
that reignited decadesold tensions on the south side also have 
prompted unprecedented meetings between police and leaders of the 
predominantly black religious sect 
a street fight with police jan 3 injured three muslims who 
were treated in a jail hospital and four officers including one 
who suffered a broken arm two muslims were booked for 
investigation of assault 
then on jan 23 about five miles from the first melee oliver 
rodell beasley a 27yearold muslim was fatally shot during a 
struggle with sheriffs deputies officers arrested six men and a 
juvenile but only one man was charged 
an autopsy report released friday said beasley died of a gunshot 
wound to the head and was grazed on his hip authorities said they 
believe beasley was shot in the hip while struggling for control of 
the deputys gun 
the sheriffs department said its deputies were fighting for 
their lives with a group of young men mostly muslims and the 
shooting started after beasley disarmed one of the deputies 
in one of the few comments offered by nation of islam officials 
on the killing khallid muhammad an aide in chicago to muslim 
leader louis farrakhan said the fight began when deputies beat 
another man for refusing to kneel on the ground 
police and the sheriffs office would not comment on the cause 
of the incident pending results of their separate investigations 
the nation of islam said it will issue its own report 
muslims long have claimed that police routinely order blacks to 
kneel or lie on the ground during traffic stops and rarely do the 
same to white drivers police have denied following such a policy 
we have a prayer position in which we go down on our knees and 
touch our foreheads to the floor muhammad said we dont bow 
down to anyone except allah 
the nation of islam which uses koran and bible scripture began 
in the 1930s as a black nationalist movement though popularly 
known as black muslims its followers prefer to call themselves 
muslims most live in the united states about 5000 in the los 
angeles area 
the group has been criticized for antisemitic statements 
attributed to farrakhan but locally muslims have gained stature 
with black community groups that once shunned them 
the muslims focus on family values and selfsufficiency has 
taken precedence over their sects more controversial policies 
such as advocacy of a separate black nation 
they are an integral part of the black community said danny 
bakewell director of brotherhood crusade a south side community 
group they bring dignity and respect to the community and take 
men off drugs 
both of this months clashes with police began with a traffic 
arrest that drew a crowd situations that strike a nerve in los 
angeles where a traffic stop in the mostly black watts section 
sparked the august 1965 riots that killed 34 people 
tensions between muslims and police were not directly 
responsible for that bloody rampage but they did contribute 
four meetings between authorities and muslim leaders have not 
resolved the issues but show a willingness to communicate that was 
unthinkable when policemuslim tensions flared in the 1960s 
in april 1962 a bloody riot started outside the sects old los 
angeles mosque after police stopped a muslim on the street one man 
died in police gunfire and 11 members of the sect later were 
convicted on various charges 
in the closing days of the watts riots police fired 500 rounds 
at the mosque during an earlymorning raid prompted by a tip that 
weapons were being stored there no weapons were found 
two years later the mosque again was raided because of an arms 
cache tip again no weapons or explosives were found and 
thenmayor sam yorty apologized 
that is history we cant change said deputy police chief 
william rathburn but we learned from it we can alter what 
happens in the future 
telephone calls to the sects chicago headquarters for further 
comment on the deaths and the meetings were not returned

governing coalition received only 56 percent of the vote 
compared to 10 percent in the 1985 elections

the crew of avianca flight 52 told 
highaltitude air traffic controllers the plane was low on fuel and 
needed a priority landing before it crashed but that information 
wasnt relayed to local controllers officials said sunday 
the boeing 707 crashed on long island thursday night killing 73 
people and injuring 85 
the pilot of the colombian jetliner told controllers at new york 
center who handle highaltitude traffic that he was low on fuel 
50 minutes before the plane crashed said lee dickinson a member 
of the national transportation safety board 
when the new york center controllers turned over control of the 
flight to local controllers handling approaches to john f kennedy 
international airport they apparently failed to mention the plane 
was low on fuel dickinson said 
the conversation between the crew and new york center came after 
the aircraft had been in a holding pattern for 46 minutes 
dickinson said at that point controllers asked the pilot if the 
boeing could safely land at bostons logan airport the pilot said 
he lacked fuel to get to logan said dickinson 
shortly afterward control of the aircraft was transferred to 
local controllers terminal radar approach control or tracon 
who told investigators sunday they never knew the plane was low on 
fuel 
one local controller learned about the fuel shortage but only 
after the plane had to abort an attempted landing he said after 
that attempt the pilot twice told the local controllers he was 
running out of fuel dickinson said 
the latest information was discovered after investigators spoke 
to six local controllers who either handled the aircraft or were 
keeping track of it he said 
for whatever reasons we dont know the controllers at tracon 
did not know that said dickinson referring to the fuel shortage 
he said investigators on monday will question at least four new 
york center controllers to determine if the information was relayed 
asked if there are rules requiring that fuel shortage 
information be passed along among controllers he said there has 
to be a handoff or an agreement one would expect that 
information going to the center that that information would be 
passed on 
he said the controllers at tracon and new york center were 
speaking to each other by telephone when control was handed off 
fuel receipts obtained by investigators indicate the aircraft 
had 81000 pounds of fuel on board more than enough for a normal 
flight from medellin colombia to new york the flight originated 
in bogota colombia with a stop in medellin 
the plane was delayed because of weatherrelated congestion 
three times en route for 16 minutes over norfolk va for 27 
minutes between norfolk and new york and for 46 minutes about 40 
miles south of jfk 
the crash in an affluent long island community occurred as the 
plane circled back for a second landing attempt after an initial 
approach was aborted because it was too steep the ntsb said 
the pilot told the highaltitude controllers at new york center 
he needed a priority landing dickinson said but the word 
emergency was never used and for that reason perhaps the 
severity of the situation wasnt relayed he said 
both control centers are on long island as is the airport 
tracon the local control center is in garden city about 10 miles 
from kennedy airport and the new york center is in ronkonkoma 
about 50 miles from the airport 
a source close to the investigation who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said that many pilots are reluctant to declare a fuel 
emergency because the federal aviation administration strictly 
monitors those cases 
should the faa determine a pilot was unjustified in declaring an 
emergency he can lose his pilots license 
a federal official close to the investigation who spoke on 
condition of anonymity said the information indicates the error 
appears to lie with new york center 
controllers told investigators that the night of the crash was 
hectic at tracon dickinson said 
it was a night of intense energy the weather was bad and 
there was a shortage of controllers dickinson said he couldnt 
explain why or by how much tracon was understaffed 
he noted that an american airlines flight that landed right 
before aviancas aborted attempt had just 14 minutes of fuel when 
it landed 
ntsb investigators sunday again studied the jets four engines 
and fuel pumps 
what they found was indicative of no fuel in the tanks 
dickinson said 
investigators earlier said the plane may have had up to 10000 
pounds of fuel upon impact which would have left the boeing with 
only several minutes of flying time however they said sunday that 
figure could be wrong because they were unsure about the integrity 
of fuel gauges theyve examined 
for example a gauge that keeps track of all fuel on board 
indicates the plane had between 1100 pounds to 1200 pounds of 
fuel two other gauges for individuals fuel tanks however show 
that those tanks each had between 2300 and 2400 pounds of fuel 
he said 
mike benson a spokesman for ntsb said those figures have 
temporarily been discounted until the gauges can be calibrated and 
tested probably within the next few days 
picking through the wreckage sunday investigators found four 
more cockpit fuel gauges bringing the total to six there are 
eight in all one for each of seven tanks and another showing the 
overall amount 
officials again revised their casualty count saying there were 
85 survivors rather than 86 as previously stated 
more than 20 remained in critical condition hospitals reported 
at saint dominics church in oyster bay near the crash site 
worshippers sunday morning prayed for the victims and offered 
solace to rescue workers struggling to cope with what they had 
witnessed 
investigators were looking for cockpit logs that may show how 
much fuel was taken on in bogota and again after a stop in 
medellin the center of the cocaine trade officials in bogota were 
expected to fax other fuelrelated documents to the ntsb 
the ntsb is also looking into the effect the aborted approach 
may have had on the fuel system benson said 
an avianca pilot in colombia who asked for anonymity told the 
associated press that a steep climb after an aborted landing may 
force the fuel away from the engines causing them to stall 
were looking at that but we dont have anything specific on 
that benson said sunday we know that gravity can potentially 
have an effect on the fuel thats why there are fuel pumps but 
to what degree it has an effect we need to take a closer look 
none of the four engines was running when the plane crashed into 
a hillside and there was no explosion both early indications to 
investigators the plane had run out of fuel 
the ntsb expected to finish up its onsite investigation by 
monday or tuesday dicksinson said the plane would be removed 
toward the end of the week he said the four engines were to be 
returned to boeing in the next two days he said

greek and turkish cypriot artists resumed 
work sunday on two halves of a giant painting calling for peace 
that they plan to stretch 500 yards across the buffer zone dividing 
this island 
the two groups continued to work on their respective sides of 
the dividing line after turkish cypriot authorities again refused 
to allow the turkish cypriot painters to join their greek cypriot 
colleagues 
panicos neocleous the president of the greek cypriot artists 
association said he walked through the buffer zone to meet the 
turkish cypriots at the checkpoint on the turkish side but the 
police there were very tough they wouldnt allow us even to talk 
to the artists waiting for us there he said 
so the two sides began painting separately the greek cypriots 
in the buffer zone and the turkish cypriots behind their checkpoint 
the canvases include pictures of doves and olive branches and 
multicolored slogans declaring no more violence cyprus a 
common future make love not war and yes to peace the 
project began jan 21 
we have completed 200 yards of the painting and we hope that 
eventually we will be able to join up with our turkish cypriot 
colleagues neocleous said 
about 100 greek cypriots were busy painting on the stretch of 
white canvas spread on the roadside in front of the ledra palace 
hotel which serves as home for the canadian contingent of troops 
in the un cyprus peacekeeping force the hotel is in the buffer 
zone 
the unpatrolled zone has divided nicosia and the rest of the 
island since a 1974 turkish invasion resulted in partition turkish 
cypriot officials bar most greek cypriots from entering their zone 
charles gaulkin the un spokesman who acts as a gobetween for 
the two groups of artists said 30 turkish cypriot painters were 
working on their canvas 
the painting for peace exercise as it has been called has 
the blessing of maj gen clive milner the canadian commander of 
the un force as a good idea to boost grassroots efforts on both 
sides for reunification 
we hope that through art we will achieve some sort of 
reunification and the great thing is that the turkish cypriot 
artists feel the same way as we do neocleous said gaulkin said 
the united nations was trying to arrange for the two groups to get 
together later to join the two segments of canvas 
unsponsored peace talks for the reunification of the island 
in a twostate federation have been deadlocked since june 
the un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar has invited

foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze said there 
is no danger of mikhail s gorbachev being toppled from power but 
that western nations worry about it because they want his reforms 
to succeed 
i believe that this particular preoccupation stems from 
sincere feelings from sincere support for the process of 
perestroika that is under way in the soviet union shevardnadze 
told the associated press in a rare oneonone interview he was 
the one who spearheaded this arduous but holy struggle 
the softspoken whitehaired official from soviet georgia 
acknowledged there is some segment of the population that is 
definitely disappointed by president gorbachevs efforts at 
reform 
but he said gorbachev and the political leadership of this 
country on the whole do enjoy the support of the bulk of the soviet 
people in spite of the fact that we are experiencing great 
difficulties we have empty shelves in stores we have a host of 
other social economic and interethnic difficulties 
shevardnadze a member of the ruling politburo and close ally of 
gorbachev said the soviet leaders opponents do not really 
constitute a significant force 
discussing soviet economic problems in a set of separate written 
responses shevardnadze said for all the difficulties of 
economic conditions in our country the situation is not such that 
we need the last straw a russian expression akin to grasping 
at straws 
we have vast reserves he said and the purpose of 
perestroika is to mobilize those reserves 
in addition to the facetoface interview thursday shevardnadze 
submitted written answers to a separate set of questions submitted 
in advance his russian comments in the facetoface interview were 
translated into english by the associated press shevardnadze 
provided his own english translation to the written answers 
communist party sources speaking on condition of anonymity say 
the party is becoming more polarized with hardliners expected to 
mount a challenge to gorbachevs leadership when the national 
bodys central committee meets in moscow on feb 5 
a progressive faction also has formed and sources say it may 
stage an attack at the same meeting on the partys constitutional 
monopoly on power and demand a virtual apology for decades of 
totalitarian communist rule 
the strength of either group is difficult to measure but the 
problems for gorbachev who portrays himself as a centrist have 
mounted in recent weeks the communist party in the baltic republic 
of lithuania has broken with moscow in a campaign for independence 
and longsimmering ethnic hatreds and territorial disputes have 
boiled over into open warfare in the southwestern caucasus region 
gorbachev ordered troops into the azerbaijani capital of baku to 
crush an armed takeover by azerbaijani nationalists and since the 
interview took place officials have announced the arrests of 
nationalist leaders 
shevardnadze said secession of republics would not only cause 
military political and economic problems for the regions but could 
result in a major destabilization of the existing international 
structure 
it is in no ones interest to see this happen the foreign 
minister said in a written response to questions submitted before 
the facetoface interview shevardnadzes home republic of georgia 
is among those with an active nationalist movement 
shevardnadze who marked his 62nd birthday last week was 
practically unknown outside the soviet union before gorbachev 
plucked him from his post as communist party chief in georgia to 
replace veteran foreign minister andrei a gromyko shortly after 
gorbachev rose to power in march 1985 with a warm smile and 
pensive manner shevardnadze has reshaped the image of soviet 
foreign policy molded for three decades by gromykos stony 
countenance 
almost from the beginning shevardnadze showed a willingness to 
negotiate not from a standpoint of class struggle but from 
gorbachevs new thinking which seeks solutions to problems 
through international cooperation disarmament and attention to 
human values 
the interview in the foreign ministers office ranged from 
discussion of arms control issues and shevardnadzes meeting next 
month with us secretary of state james a baker iii to his views 
on the unrest in the caucasus and the independence movements in the 
baltic republics 
he defended the decision to send troops into the republics of 
azerbaijan and armenia saying it was for the purpose of saving 
people and said the outbreak of ethnic violence there was 
nothing short of civil war 
the decision he said does not correspond to either our 
internal convictions or to our sentiments in general because in 
principle we are opposed to use of any force anywhere 
as the situation in that region stabilizes we will gradually 
withdraw our forces from there he pledged 
asked if he had kept the united states informed of soviet 
military actions in the region which is closed to foreign 
journalists shevardnadze said there was no need for that because 
everything thats happening down there is made public 
shevardnadze predicted the most important event of this year 
will be the us summit in june between gorbachev and president 
bush 
he expressed confidence that he and baker will make further 
progress toward an agreement to cut in half the two superpowers 
strategic nuclear arsenals 
shevardnadze and baker meet in moscow on feb 7 
for his written responses the foreign minister was asked if the 
soviet union would sign a strategic arms reduction treaty start 
that did not limit sealaunched cruise missiles or the us star 
wars program two longtime sticking points in the negotiations 
shevardnadze wrote we are willing to limit the missiles 
outside the treaty framework on the condition that the relevant 
provisions will be recorded concurrently with the treaty will be 
mandatory and subject to verification 
we are willing to sign and implement a start treaty even 
without agreement on space if the sides continue to observe the abm 
antiballistic missile treaty as signed in 1972 shevardnadze 
said 
he was also asked to comment on a recent article signed only 
z in daedalus the journal of the american academy of arts 
and sciences that argued gorbachevs reform efforts are futile and 
thus shouldnt receive the support offered by the bush 
administration 
the foreign minister dismissed the article as a bag of old 
cliches 
the articles author who seems to be prone to stereotype 
thinking has completely distorted ideas about the content of our 
perestroika he said

there is no doubt that all the citizens in the world and all the 
peoples in the world including the american people have a vital 
stake in the success of our perestroika and in the renewal of 
soviet society and i have no doubts whatsoever as to the sincerity 
of your president your secretary of state and other political 
leaders who have stated many times over and over again their 
support for perestroika 
i know that my friend mr baker is in a businesslike and 
constructive mood and i think that we will be able by common 
efforts to look for and find solutions that the whole world is 
looking forward to and to set a good stage for the summit meeting 
and i believe that this will be the most important event of this 
year 
shevardnadze was asked about soviet military actions in the 
republics of armenia and azerbaijan 
we were compelled to bring our troops down there and to use 
force people died this is a great tragedy we had to take 
that decision when those peoples engaged in direct clashes with 
each other then we saw that it might erupt into a real tragedy so 
at that point we made that decision which certainly does not 
correspond to either our internal convictions or to our sentiments 
in general because in principle we are opposed to use of any force 
anywhere 
and here of course the decision was made to use force for the 
purpose of saving people because they were at the brink of civil 
war actually it was nothing short of civil war as the situation 
in that region stabilizes we will gradually withdraw our forces 
from there 
i happen to come from that region myself and perhaps i am 
second to none in feeling concerned about whats happening there 
there was no other solution that we could have made acting in the 
interests of those people and i believe that president bush does 
understand it just as well as the us public opinion and the 
entire world community 
the foreign minister was asked about concern in the west that 
gorbachev wont survive the many crises he faces 
i believe that this particular preoccupation stems from sincere 
feelings from sincere support for the process of perestroika that 
is under way in the soviet union we initiated our perestroika on 
the initiative of comrade gorbachev he was the one who spearheaded 
this arduous but holy struggle i should say that gorbachev and 
the political leadership on the whole of this country do enjoy the 
support of the bulk of the soviet people in spite of the fact that 
we are experiencing great difficulties we have empty shelves in 
stores we have a host of other social economic and interethnic 
difficulties well there is some segment of the population that is 
definitely disappointed it is a reality too they do not really 
constitute a significant force

some drug experts are challenging the wisdom 
of dire public warnings that a few hits on a crack cocaine pipe 
will lead immediately to addiction and ruin 
attention was focused on the issue when mayor marion barry was 
arrested jan 18 on a charge of cocaine possession the fbi said it 
had videotapes of the mayor smoking crack in a hotel room 
barry has been mayor of washington for a decade and was expected 
to announce for a fourth term this month 
it will raise questions in peoples minds said kevin zeese 
of the drug policy foundation which favors treating drug abuse as 
a health problem not as a criminal problem he was mayor and he 
was successful at it 
lurma rackley a spokeswoman for barry said his most serious 
problem is alcoholism law enforcement officials said blood and 
urine samples taken after his arrest tested positive for cocaine 
barry checked in last week at a treatment clinic in florida 
i happen to feel crack volatile cocaine is dangerous and 
i believe its risky and i do not recommend its use dr john p 
morgan director of the pharmacology department at city university 
of new york medical school said tuesday but the idea that two 
hits and youre dead or youre addicted is not true 
patricia erickson a criminologist who heads the drug policy 
research program at the addiction research foundation in toronto 
said in our most recent study half the people who used crack 
didnt prefer that form of cocaine 
that hit that rush isnt to everybodys liking she said 
for any substance the users own expectations and attitudes 
mind set in conjunction with the social circumstances combine to 
produce the outcome 
erickson said that in many cases the users own 
characteristics and background and friends they use with tend to 
check use or channel it in ways that arent necessarily 
destructive its certainly evident that some people can control 
it 
but dr mark gold director of research at fair oaks hospital a 
psychiatric facility in summit nj and founder of the cocaine 
hotline said compared to heroin crack cocaine or intravenous 
cocaine is as addicting if not more addicting the idea that 
theres a significant number of people using crack occasionally is 
not supported by the data 
studies by the national institute on drug abuses addiction 
research center in baltimore have found that while casual users can 
perform simple tasks when under the influence they suffer brain 
wave impairments that would hurt performance on more difficult 
tasks said researcher ronald herning 
at the same time a study found that when heavy users abstained 
from the drug their performance suffered which herning attributed 
to withdrawal 
gold said there are several different types of cocaine addicts 
those who use it continuously or daily those who binge 
occasionally and those who use crack weekly but not daily but 
are obsessed by it think about crack all the time and for one 
reason or another will exert a tremendous amount of pressure to 
attempt to manage the drug craving and addiction 
james n hall executive director of the up front drug 
information center in miami said the time period from first use 
to fullfledged addiction is going to vary according to several 
factors the first being a preexisting perhaps genetic 
disposition to the addiction cycle 
another factor is previous drug use if a person has been 
using cocaine for a number of years in an apparently controlled 
situation and the switch is to crack the person is at high 
risk of becoming fullfledged addictive in as short as a few 
weeks 
who will become addicted is impossible to determine in advance 
he said 
the safest thing to do is never use it in the first place 
he said almost every addict has said it wont happen to me 
while morgan acknowledges the dangers of crack use he contends 
that the one puff and youre addicted kid attitude stems in 
part from racism the issue of crack being overwhelmingly 
addictive is the sort of mistake that gets made when a drug becomes 
democratized and we become frightened of the users 
we werent ready to turn the world on its ear when wealthy 
people smoked cocaine by freebasing long before crack showed up on 
the street he said the concern grew when young urban minority 
males started using crack we are terrified about their ability 
to control themselves at all times he said 
morgan also blames the media for focusing on the worst addiction 
cases for their dramatic value 
there is no drug which in and of itself is sufficient to 
explain addictive behavior he said our tendency is to focus 
on the drug the crack the heroin the ice the ecstasy a 
dramatic story is only useful if it has a focus a lot of people 
use this drug and dont get addicted to it 
when the other factors leading to addiction are included such 
as the users socioeconomic background that makes a messy story 
so crack becomes a scapegoat

q the united states and soviet union are pressing for a 
strategic arms reduction agreement in principle by june and for 
signing of a start treaty this year yet there has been little if 
any progress reported on the most difficult longstanding obstacles 
to agreement will the soviet union sign and implement a strategic 
arms reduction treaty that does not limit sealaunched cruise 
missiles or restrict the us strategic defense initiative 
a one of the most important results at malta was the political 
decisions of the sides to conclude a start treaty in 1990 
generally speaking this year can become the disarmament year 
it is quite realistic to reach agreements also in areas such as the 
reduction of conventional armed forces in europe and the 
elimination of chemical weapons 
thus our joint policies have been defined very clearly it now 
remains to translate them into negotiating positions 
as to the fundamental issues that you have touched upon we 
submitted back in wyoming compromise proposals on sealaunched 
cruise missiles we are willing to limit them outside the treaty 
framework on the condition that the relevant provisions will be 
recorded concurrently with the treaty will be mandatory and 
subject to verification 
we are willing to sign and implement a start treaty even without 
agreement on space if the sides continue to observe the abm 
antiballistic missile treaty as signed in 1972 that was also a 
major step that we took in wyoming it is to be hoped that 
secretary baker will bring to moscow adequate responses to our 
initiatives it is not too long before he comes here 
q does the united states support for the independence of the 
baltic republics contribute to the separatist campaign in lithuania 
and elsewhere and will you seek a change in us policy as part of 
president gorbachevs effort to prevent breakup of the union 
a we know the position of the united states which does not 
recognize the entry of the baltic republics into the union our 
assessment of it must be well known to you too 
as to the specific aspects of establishing a truly federative 
structure of our country to supercede the unitarism that actually 
existed and setting up a new mechanism of relationships between 
the republics and the center these problems are addressed in the 
course of a broad dialogue in our country taking into account the 
interests of all the ethnic groups 
the secession of some particular republics from the union would 
produce not only additional militarypolitical and economic 
stresses for their population but could also result in a major 
destabilization of the existing international structure it is in 
no ones interest to see this happen 
the problems of interethnic relations are so delicate and 
sensitive that one should avoid any outside interference in the 
process of their development otherwise one can provoke 
unpredicatble repercussions 
i should say that on the whole we see that responsible 
politicians are aware of this 
thus recently the us administration has reaffirmed that since 
the establishment of diplomatic relations with the soviet union 
the united states recognizes the territorial integrity of our 
country the principles recorded in the helsinki final act to 
which the united states affixed its signature are also well known 
q an article signed z in the american magazine daedalus 
has provoked something of a sensation with its contention that 
president gorbachevs attempts at reform are futile and that the 
west should therefore not try to help them succeed perhaps the 
article is getting particular attention right now due to the 
climate with lithuania trying to break from moscow the caucasus 
ablaze with ethnic quarrels and the economy unable to provide basic 
food and consumer goods to people throughout the country how would 
you respond to z 
a i know about the article by z from its newspaper version 
it is strange that the bag of cliches it contains about the demise 
of socialism is portrayed as something of a sensation this was 
written and spoken about many times over the past 70 years and 
such forecasts always turned out to be in the dump of history 
the articles author who seems to be prone to stereotype 
thinking has completely distorted ideas about the content of 
perestroika and about the nature of the ongoing processes within 
soviet society it is our impression that the changes occurring in 
the world are not to his taste altogether and that he does not like 
the administrations course which is supported by most americans 
for a new closeness with the soviet union 
as to our own difficulties we do know about them and we do not 
conceal them but we are confident that these difficulties will be 
overcome because there is no alternative to perestroika 
there is much work ahead of us and we are prepared to do it

people hurried to buy food and medicine

exchanged fire in the center of the city but there was no word on 
casualties

islamic militants want indiangoverned kashmir a part of the 
state of jammukashmir to become independent or join pakistan

green vegetables 
not much fresh produce has reached this city of 1 million since

indian troops abruptly pulled out of 
the tamil stronghold of jaffna leaving the town to the tamil tiger 
guerrillas they had battled more than two years residents and 
officials said sunday 
the indian troops who are to complete their withdrawal from sri 
lanka by the end of march evacuated jaffna late saturday and 
pitched camps 10 miles or more outside the northern town residents 
said by telephone 
the unannounced evacuation caught many people by surprise when 
they woke up sunday 
we saw the tiger flag fluttering all over the town and shops 
were open traffic was abnormally active and people were thronging 
the roads one resident said speaking on condition of anonymity 
we then realized we were free of the indian occupation which 
began over two years ago he added 
jaffna about 200 miles northeast of colombo was the heart of a 
tamil separatist revolt that erupted in 1983 against the sinhalese 
ethnic majority that dominates the sri lankan government and armed 
forces 
when the government failed to squelch the insurrection it 
enlisted indian help an indian peacekeeping force arrived in 1987 
but soon became the target of the tamil tigers 
in a dizzying reversal of roles the sri lankan government began 
negotiating with the tigers to give them a political role while 
the indians who once gave the tigers sanctuary on indian soil 
became the enemy 
jaffna was partisan turf for the tigers who were routed from 
the predominantly tamil town by indian forces in the fall of 1987 
small groups of armed tigers moved openly in the town on sunday 
according to the telephone reports 
a sri lankan military official in colombo said the indians had 
completed their withdrawal from jaffna by 6 pm 
an indian diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity 
confirmed the departure but declined to say how many indian troops 
were involved 
the evacuation of jaffna leaves only one major town still 
patrolled by the peacekeeping force the port of trincomalee 147 
miles northeast of colombo 
an indian departure from trincomalee is expected to trigger one 
of the biggest power struggles within the tamil movement because 
trincomalee is the base of three proindian tamil groups fiercely 
opposed by the tigers 
these three groups captured control of the provincial council in 
an election boycotted by the tigers who now are staking their 
claim to political power and want new elections called 
a former council member who belonged to the proindian eelam 
national democratic liberation front was assassinated early sunday 
by two gunmen who pedaled up to his trincomalee home on bicycles 
the councils coordinating secretary anthony muttu vedanayagam 
accused the tigers of killing cm ganeshalingam the councils 
rehabilitation minister 
a tiger spokesman in colombo denied the charge claiming 
ganeshalingam was killed by fellow members of the eelam national 
democratic liberation front in an embezzlement dispute 
meanwhile in the ampara district that was vacated by the indian 
peacekeeping force late last year three sinhalese game wardens and 
their sinhalese driver were killed by a mine sri lankan military 
officials said 
three other people were critically wounded when the game 
wardens jeep was blown up saturday on a jungle road about 125 
miles east of colombo 
the military officials blamed the deaths on the tamil national 
army a militia set up by the proindian tamils running the 
northeastern provincial council and banned by the central 
government 
the tigers have run the tamil national army out of most major 
towns in regions vacated by the indians the various guerrilla 
groups once banded together to fight the sinhalesedominated 
government but have been splintered by their quest for power within 
the tamil minority 
the tamil insurrection grew out of a desire for a separate 
homeland which militants said was needed to preserve the tamil 
ethnic identity tamils accused the sinhalese 75 percent of sri 
lankas 16 million people of discrimination in jobs and education 
tamils comprise 18 percent of the population

there he goes again richard darman has 
mounted his bully pulpit to deliver another hellfire and brimstone 
lecture against gamesmanship when some would argue that president 
bushs budget director is the champion of all times in that arena 
in a 15page essay which will be included in the presidents 
budget when it is released monday darman chastises congress for 
trivializing the historic changes occurring in eastern europe 
rails against wonderland budgeting gimmicks and challenges 
lawmakers to get serious about attacking the problems facing the 
country 
even the existence of the essay titled the directors 
introduction to the budget is unusual normally presidential 
aides go out of their way to make sure that the centerpiece of 
attention when the administrations budget is sent to congress is 
the presidents annual budget message 
but this time around darmans essay is getting a lot of advance 
publicity taking up an entire page in the new york times over the 
weekend and being quoted at length by other news organizations 
darman on sunday termed the news leak of the document 
regrettable but it certainly guaranteed wide dissemination of his 
views 
the essay which likens the federal budget to the ultimate 
cookie monster who mindlessly gobbles up scarce resources struck 
many of the same themes as darmans famous broadside last july 
against the nations nownowism 
he defined that term to mean our collective shortsightedness 
our obsession with the here and now our reluctance to adequately 
address the future 
the governments huge budget deficits he said were a 
mathematical representation of our wish to buy now pay later 
or more accurately buy now and let others pay later 
stern words 
but they were being issued by the man who served as a top 
political strategist for ronald reagan helping to craft all the 
details of reaganomics an economic policy that stressed tax cuts 
even as federal budget deficits were hitting record levels and the 
national debt was nearly tripling in eight years 
this is the same darman who insists that george bush stands 
firmly by his pledge against raising taxes even if it means 
continued budgetary gridlock with a congress which refuses to go 
along with sharp cuts in domestic programs 
in his vivid essay on bushs 1991 budget darman urges congress 
to abandon political gamesmanship and responsibly address the tough 
problems that must be dealt with in order to get the budget under 
control 
at some point there is an obligation to be serious he 
wrote at some point partisan posturing must yield to the 
responsibility to govern 
but darmans attack left congressional critics grumbling that 
they were being given a hypocritical lecture designed to obscure 
the fact that the bush budget fails to honestly attack the deficit 
problem 
instead the critics contend the bush budget relies on highly 
optimistic economic assumptions to reach the deficit reduction 
targets established in the grammrudman law including cutting the 
deficit nearly in half to 631 billion in 1991 
the congressional budget office which usually makes less rosy 
forecasts is projecting that the deficits will be billions of 
dollars above the administrations estimates totaling 138 billion 
in 1991 alone 
the administration also is claiming budget savings by trimming 
medicare spending slashing subsidies for amtrak the 
governmentowned passenger railroad and a making a variety of 
other cuts all of which have been rejected by congress repeatedly 
in the past 
the administrations various proposals left sen james sasser 
dtenn and chairman of the senate budget committee complaining 
it is clear that the administration still is not serious about 
deficit reduction 
but darman interviewed sunday on nbctvs meet the press 
seemed unfazed by the criticism continuing to attack what he 
called hypocrisy and posturing on the part of congress 
when asked whether he shouldnt include the administration in 
that assessment the budget director said perhaps we are guilty 
somewhat ourselves but that doesnt mean that we all dont have an 
obligation to be more serious our budget will be criticized 
unfairly people ought to sit down and do serious work

if government tape transcripts are any 
indication reputed mafia boss john gotti knows there is more to 
being a mob executive than making offers that cant be refused 
transcripts of secretly recorded conversations show gotti 
talking about profits relations with middle managers and the rank 
and file promoting rewarding and realigning personnel his hopes 
to establish a legacy and why an executive must be aloof from 
underlings 
in an exchange with an unidentified man who was presumably an 
equal gotti said me and you may socialize but i cant 
socialize with these guys i cant bring myself down im a boss 
you know what i mean 
prosecutors say the transcripts prove gotti is the nations most 
powerful crime boss the defense says theyre inaccurate 
transciptions of what even the prosecution admits are sometimes 
barely audible tapes 
the transcripts were released last week at gottis trial on 
charges of ordering the revenge shooting of a union leader jurors 
got to listen to the tapes as well as read the prosecutions 
transcripts 
gotti 49 and anthony guerrieri 60 are charged with assault 
and conspiracy in the 1986 shooting of john oconnor former vice 
president of carpenters union local 608 oconnor was wounded in 
the legs and buttocks 
testimony was scheduled to continue monday with leavenworth 
kan prison inmate james mcelroy returning to the stand on 
friday mcelroy 45 described how he spent 30 years killing 
maiming extorting and lying as a member of the tough new york city 
irishamerican gang the westies 
it was the westies prosecutors say who were hired by gotti to 
shoot oconnor because oconnor had goons trash a mobaffiliated 
restaurant that was being built with nonunion labor 
in his testimony mcelroy also fingered gotti as the boss of the 
gambino crime organization 
law enforcement authorities say gotti took control of the 
gambino family after gambino boss paul castellano was shot to 
death outside a manhattan steakhouse in december 1985 no one has 
been convicted in the killing 
the transcripts indicate gotti was talking like a leader within 
weeks of that shooting 
in a conversation with an unidentified man on jan 18 1986 
gotti said get a year gonna put this thing together where they 
could never break it never destroy it even if we die be a good 
thing 
its a hell of a legacy to leave the unidentified man 
replied 
the tapes made at the bergin hunt and fish club gottis queens 
hangout paint a picture of gotti known as the dapper don because 
of his fine suits enjoying his position and reputation 
at the wedding of an underboss son he bragged every good 
fellow every skipper and every nongood fellow came and bothered

bulgarias opposition will not join the 
government before free elections are held because any reforms it 
backs could be blocked by the communistcontrolled parliament a 
spokesman said sunday 
the communists have a 67 percent majority in parliament and 
they can stop any program said georgi spassov spokesman of the 
union of democratic forces a loose grouping of 12 opposition 
movements 
spassov is a key opposition participant in talks with the 
communists and other political and social groups the talks are to 
resume monday 
in an interview with the associated press spassov asserted that 
the communists are seeking to discredit the opposition 
emilyan abadzhiev spokesman for the official trade unions that 
now have asserted their independence called on the government on 
friday to resign saying it was ineffectual and bowing to pressure 
but spassov claimed that the resignation call could be a ploy by 
the communist leadership to pressure the opposition into 
participating in a subsequent coalition 
we will not do this he said speaking through a translator 
if the government of premier georgi atanasov in fact steps down 
knowledgeable bulgarians say a caretaker government of civil 
servants would be set up to function until the elections 
a public opinion poll on a variety of issues which was issued 
by bulgarian staterun television saturday gave opposition leaders 
low popularity ratings 
according to that poll the most popular politician is the 
defense minister and politburo member dobri dzhurov who is widely 
rumored to have played a key role in the november ouster of 
hardline party leader todor zhivkov 
spassov expressed fears that the ruling communists will hold 
parliamentary elections in may although the opposition coalition 
has been calling for november elections to have more time to 
organize 
however he said there was a chance that the agrarian party a 
longtime docile ally of the communists may join the opposition 
if that really happened the opposition would also stand a 
chance at the polls in may spassov said 
spassov suggested the opposition is fighting an uphill battle to 
win popularity and supporters outside big cities where people are 
still very conservative 
smaller cities and villages are like little feifdoms in 
bulgaria where a handful of families wield power and no one else 
has any say spassov said 
he said that when the communist party meets for a congress jan 
30 it is unlikely to enact radical reforms because the vast 
majority in the party are conservatives hardliners 
spassov said although the communists are stalling the 
opposition would continue to negotiate with them as long as 
necessary 
key demands of the opposition include access to the mass media 
a new electoral law providing for proportional representation and 
removal of a constitutional clause describing bulgaria as a 
socialist country ruled by the working class 
if this principle is upheld all democratic parties that do 
not espouse socialist programs would be illegal spassov said

people in countries that have gone deeply into 
debt enjoy higher living standards than the average third world 
country according to world bank figures 
the bank calculates that third world countries owe a total of 
13 trillion some are in trouble with their creditors and have 
tried austerity measures to grow out of their difficulties but 
they still seem to be in constant crisis 
in many ways however debt seems to have little effect on their 
progress 
mexico the largest third world debtor after brazil has 
completed the biggest and most difficult arrangement up to now for 
reducing the burden of the 104 billion it owes this was done 
under the strategy proposed last year by treasury secretary 
nicholas f brady 
reduction in the actual debt is expected to be small because 
there also will be new lending to mexico more important is a 
reduction expected in the 7 billion that has been flowing out of 
the country every year mostly as interest and repayment of 
principal 
compared with many third world countries mexico is fairly well 
off the world bank found in 1988 the average mexican earned the 
equivalent of 1820 compared with 1970 for what the bank calls 
the average middleincome country a group that includes such 
diverse countries as malaysia and poland 
but income isnt everything more than nine out of 10 mexicans 
over the age of 15 can read compared with fewer than eight in the 
average country only 47 mexican babies out of every 1000 die in 
their first year against an average 55 in the third world the 
average mexican has 3132 calories available a day compared with 
2846 in similar countries 
mexicans now have a car for every 16 people compared with one 
for every 59 people 25 years to 30 years ago over half of mexican 
teenagers are in secondary school three times as many as there 
were a quartercentury ago even taking the growth of population 
into account there is a doctor for every 1242 people while in 
the 1960s there was only one for every 2078 
the bank gives approximate dates for some of the material in the 
1989 edition of its social indicators of development 
distributed to reporters this week that is because some countries 
compile their figures more quickly than others so that the latest 
statistics available come from different years depending on the 
country 
the debtor countries started by being better off explained 
john oconnor head of the bank division that deals with the 
figures 
but theyve been doing less well since the debt crisis hit 
for example the average mexican income in 1968 was about 13 
percent of the average in the united states in 1988 it was down to 
9 percent 
countries with large debts tend to be larger countries with 
more population and resources they had the assets that encouraged 
lenders to give them credit in the first place 
egypts 50 billion debt is twice that of nearby algerias 
according to the banks figures though the average income is much 
lower in egypt 650 a year to 2450 egypt has two out of three 
young people in secondary school compared with a little more than 
half of young algerians 
egypt has a doctor for every 786 people while the average 
algerian doctor has to take care of 2327 egyptians have 3342 
calories a day available compared with algerians 2715 calories 
there are 77 newspapers for every 1000 egyptians but only 21 
for every 1000 algerians 
algerians have it better some ways in egypt 108 children out of 
every 1000 die before the age of five despite the larger number 
of doctors compared with 92 in algeria 
the average life expectancy in egypt is 54 years while the 
average algerian baby can expect to live to 62

president fw de klerk 
summoned police commanders to a closeddoor meeting and told them 
the nations force will no longer be used to fight the governments 
political battles a major newspaper reported sunday 
we cant become embroiled in an eighty years war de klerk 
reportedly told 500 commanders we will have to move toward 
finding solutions that are acceptable to the majority of the 
population 
also sunday raymond suttner a prominent white antiapartheid 
activist who left south africa illegally last year returned to a 
jubilant welcome from colleagues police followed him home but took 
no immediate action 
de klerk addressed the police commanders about two weeks ago 
but the speech remained secret until the nationally circulated 
sunday times reported its contents the newspaper said de klerk 
asked the commanders to convey his message to every member of the 
force 
anton pretorius a spokesman for de klerk confirmed that the 
president had addressed the police commanders but said he could 
not comment on the substance of the speech 
since taking office in august de klerk has eased restrictions 
on antigovernment protests freed senior leaders of the outlawed 
african national congress guerrilla movement and allowed them to 
engage freely in political activity these moves and a public 
commitment to free top anc leader nelson mandela are believed to 
have embittered some rightwing officers in the national police 
force 
de klerk in his speech reportedly said he was aware that his 
actions have raised a number of questions in your minds 
in the past you have been asked to handle situations that had 
nothing to do with ordinary crime de klerk was quoted as saying 
referring to use of police to disperse protests and enforce 
segregation laws 
circumstances have changed and we have reviewed our definition 
of crime 
it will never again be asked of you to say to someone hey 
you cant swim here because of your appearance de klerk 
reportedly said you will not be required to prevent people from 
gathering to gain support for their views 
this is the political battlefield and we want to take the 
police out of it he was quoted as saying let the politicians 
look after politics 
de klerk reportedly said his government sought to take the 
intiative in avoiding a race war 
for if this armageddon takes place and blood flows ankle 
deep in our streets and 4 or 5 million people lie dead the 
problem will remain exactly the same as before the shooting 
started he was quoted as saying 
since de klerk announced in september that peaceful protests 
would be allowed most marches and demonstrations have proceeded 
without serious disturbances however police have insisted that 
permission for major protests be obtained in advance and there 
have been clashes in several cases where approval was not obtained 
the antiapartheid activist suttner said upon his return to 
johannesburg that he was uncertain whether police would act against 
him 
all i have done is exercise my freedom of speech he said 
during his time abroad suttner said several western diplomats 
assured him that their governments would lodge protests if he were 
detained again 
suttner a law school lecturer was freed from jail in september 
after more than two years in detention no charges were filed 
against him and he spent much of the time in solitary confinement 
upon his release he was placed under heavy restrictions and was 
barred him from any educational facility including the university 
of the witwatersrand where he taught 
in december suttner 43 broke his restrictions went to 
zimbabwe to attend an antiapartheid conference and then remained 
abroad

contra rebel forces were responsible for the 
new years day ambush and killing of two roman catholic nuns 
including an american in nicaragua according to an investigation 
by the us human rights group americas watch 
the private group said in a 53page report sunday that its 
investigation which included numerous interviews and other data 
obtained in nicaragua concludes that the ambush was conducted by 
contra forces although it appears the attack was not aimed 
specifically at the nuns 
the two nuns including sister maureen courtney 45 of 
milwaukee were killed when the white toyota pickup in which they 
were riding came under attack on a remote highway 165 miles 
northeast of managua a bishop and another nun survived the attack 
the contra rebels have denied any involvement 
it is our conclusion based on this investigation that those 
responsible were a unit of the rebel resistencia nicaraguense or 
contras firing indiscriminately at the vehicle without warning to 
stop but also without knowledge that the vehicle belonged to the 
church the report by americas watch said 
the group had been asked by five members of congress to 
investigate the shooting 
americas watch said that a large rebel force was operating in 
the vicinity of the highway on the day of the shooting 
the report said the contra unit did not intend to kill the 
church people but fired on the vehicle because it resembled those 
used by the nicaraguan government no attempt was made by the 
contras to ascertain whether the occupants were military or 
civilian said the group 
among those interviewed were two youths who had been kidnapped 
by the contras and held by the unit involved in the attack at the 
time of the shooting and the father of the man allegedly in command 
of the unit as well as local residents said the report 
at the same time americas watch accused the sandinista military 
of numerous civil rights abuses against local residents suspected 
of working with the contras 
the worst such incident the report said involved the execution 
in august 1988 by sandinista troops of six persons who were 
believed to have been contra collaborators 
the human rights group called the execution on aug 20 1988 in 
the area of umbla one of the worst abuses we learned of by either 
side during recent years

following are the highlights of proposals 
expected in president bushs 1991 budget which will be unveiled on 
monday 
deficit the administration cut the budget deficit roughly in 
half reducing it from an estimated 1238 billion this year down 
to 631 billion for the budget year which begins oct 1 that 
would be the smallest deficit if realized since a 402 billion 
shortfall in 1979 
spending the government would spend 1233 trillion while 
taking in 1170 trillion in revenues 
taxes there would be no general tax increase upholding the 
presidents nonew taxes pledge although the budget boosts certain 
user fees charged to businesses and individuals for government 
services 
military defense spending would total 3033 billion 2 
percent below the amount needed to keep up with inflation 
family savings account a new savings vehicle which would allow 
families to put away up to 5000 annually with the interest and 
dividends accumulating taxfree if they are kept for a total of 
seven years 
capital gains bush is renewing his call to slash the tax on 
capital gains profits from the sale of assets an effort which 
prompted months of partisan wrangling last year 
economic assumptions the budget is based on an estimate that 
the economy as measured by the gross national product will expand 
26 percent this year a forecast that is significantly higher than 
many private analysts if the higher growth is not realized it 
will mean a shortfall in revenues and a bigger budget deficit

two girls named sandra lee ferguson were 
born may 3 1959 they dont know each other but the government 
has considered them one and the same 
sandra lee ferguson boles and sandra lee ferguson johnson share 
the same social security number 
for three years mrs boles an employee of wright state 
university has tried to convince the social security 
administration that she isnt mrs johnson who was last known to 
live in sunset utah 
mrs boles said she became aware in 1987 that her namesake 
shared her social security number when the irs claimed there was a 
discrepancy in her reported income 
later some of mrs johnsons purchases showed up on mrs boles 
credit reports which also are indexed by social security numbers 
last month the social security administration notified mrs 
boles that her number was given to her in error and that she must 
prove her age identity and citizenship to get a new number 
since we do not have this evidence we have to remove your 
earnings from our files the notice said 
the only thing i ever wanted from these people is an 
explanation so that when i got in the bureau of motor vehicles 
credit bureau banks payroll office i have something to prove 
what i am saying mrs boles said they said its your problem 
thats insane 
mrs boles says she works in an office and can understand how 
the mistake was made whats hard to swallow she said is that 
social security doesnt have a place to resolve mistakes 
im going to start my own country and were not going to have 
a social security administration she said 
she said her case has been transferred from the dayton social 
security office to baltimore then back to xenia 
richard rogers manager of the xenia office said mrs boles 
information was sent to baltimore to get her a new number but it 
seems like they gave her the same number again 
he said a number mixup normally should take three months at most 
to resolve 
even if mrs boles gets a new number she might have to get a 
new drivers license and establish a new credit history she 
wonders if it might be easier just to trade places with mrs 
johnson 
id like to see if she has a rich and goodlooking husband 
mrs boles said

advocacy groups for the elderly say a 
congressional proposal to cut the payroll tax helps highlight their 
concern that social securitys trust funds are being used to mask 
the size of the federal deficit 
thats not to say they support the taxcut plan advanced by 
their traditional ally sen daniel patrick moynihan dny 
many groups representing the elderly are expressing reservations 
about the proposal warning that it could jeopardize social 
securitys financial standing and cause a loss of confidence in the 
system 
there are going to be a lot of yellow lights telling congress 
to go slow said an official at one organization who asked not to 
be identified a consensus is emerging that its a bad idea to 
cut the payroll tax now 
an official at another group said moynihans plan could make it 
harder to expand benefits in future years because there would be no 
giant surplus to tap 
public criticism by the groups has been muted however because 
most of the organizations see moynihan as a wellintentioned friend 
lawrence smedley executive director of the national council of 
senior citizens said the group appreciates senator moynihans 
truthinbudgeting social security proposal as an honest attempt 
to expose the extent to which the growing surplus is being used to 
mask the federal deficit 
however he said rolling back the payroll tax increase is an 
issue that needs further study 
president bush hoping to derail the moynihan plan will offer 
an alternative program that would use the surpluses to reduce the 
28 trillion national debt administration officials said saturday 
the administration is expected to spell out the proposal as part 
of bushs fiscal 1991 budget which will be released monday 
advocates for the elderly said debate over the moynihan plan is 
an even hotter topic for todays workers than for retirees whose 
benefits appear secure and who no longer are subject to the payroll 
tax 
workers meanwhile must decide whether they want immediate 
extra cash from a tax cut or the potential delayed benefits of 
building up social security trust funds to finance future 
retirement benefits 
the national taxpayers union is supporting the moynihan plan as 
a good way to reduce the tax burden on us workers and wants to 
see it followed by cuts in federal spending said ntus sheila 
macdonald 
one of the best ways to help the country meet its social 
security obligations in the next century is to reduce the deficit 
now and improve the countrys competitive position she said 
moynihans chief concern is that social securitys growing trust 
fund reserves a stockpile designed to help finance the retirement 
of the huge baby boom generation born between roughly 1946 and 1964 
are being used to obscure the size of the deficit 
the congressional budget office estimates the social security 
surplus the amount collected in payroll taxes above what is paid 
out in benefits will total 98 billion in 1993 rising to 112 
billion in 1994 and 128 billion in 1995 
moynihans solution is to halt the buildup of the reserves and 
return social security to a payasyougo system in which taxes 
would be raised in the next century to finance retirement benefits 
then 
he wants to cut this years 765 percent social security payroll 
tax back to last years 751 percent rate and cancel a further 
increase scheduled for next year 
many aging groups share moynihans concerns but would prefer an 
accounting change that removes social security from the 
calculations that determine the federal deficit increasing 
pressure to cut the deficit without slowing the buildup of the 
trust fund reserves 
it is our hope that congress will move quickly to separate 
social security trust funds from the unified budget and that it 
will move much more deliberately on the question of rolling back 
the payroll tax smedley said 
a similar sentiment was voiced by horace deets executive 
director of the american association of retired persons moynihans 
proposal highlights the deficit problem deets said but his 
solution i dont think is the solution 
aarp is holding off on taking a formal position on the proposal 
until after moynihan addresses the organization 
dan schulder of the national council on the aging said the 
councils board is reviewing a proposed statement opposing the 
taxcut plan 
what were concerned about is the confidence factor 
schulder said we got in trouble with payasyougo just a few 
years ago when the system almost went broke 
one group that traditionally has leaned the other way is the 
national committee to preserve social security and medicare which 
has advocated a payasyougo system with a oneyear benefits 
reserve 
there is a good reason to look at payasyougo said 
committee president martha mcsteen through the years social 
security has been changed to meet the needs of the people in this 
country and taxes have been raised or they have been delayed 
depending on the reserves that were needed to meet the benefit 
payments 
the committee has yet to take a position on moynihans plan

a newly ordained homosexual priest may be 
asked to resign from the episcopal clergy if he doesnt agree to 
uphold the principles of monogamy espoused by the church says the 
bishop who ordained him 
the rev j robert williams ordained dec 16 over the 
objections of some top episcopal officials provoked further 
controversy by telling a church forum that monogamy and fidelity 
arent requisites for marriage 
williams said his position is based on pastoral experience that 
showed few heterosexual or homosexual couples to be faithful the 
starledger reported sunday 
williams called monogamy as unnatural as celibacy in 
comments the newspaper said were carried by the religious news 
service following a jan 13 church forum in detroit 
if people want to try okay but the fact is people are not 
monogamous williams said it is crazy to hold up this ideal 
and pretend its what were doing and were not 
williams 34 a priest at all saints episcopal church in 
hoboken has lived with james skelly 39 a hospital administrator 
for four years 
in a diocesan news release friday bishop john s spong of the 
newark diocese who ordained williams said williams wouldnt have 
been ordained if church officials had known of his view of marriage 
he said officials were unaware of it although williams had been 
screened for ordination for two years 
spong who has been assailed by conservative episcopalians for 
permitting williams ordination said he reprimanded the priest and 
asked him to apologize 
his own life needs to be conducted according to the same 
standards applied to all priests homosexual or heterosexual 
spong wrote if mr williams is not able to conform to the 
standards of this diocese then his resignation would be 
requested 
williams issued a statement saturday night saying 
irreconcilable differences had led him to resign his position 
as head of a program called oasis that ministers to homosexuals 
williams told the starledger he felt disappointed and 
betrayed and alleged that spong was using him as a scapegoat for 
the pressure he was feeling from church authorities 
he said he didnt think he would be able to continue as an 
episcopal clergyman but would continue with religious work 
maybe it will have to be my own church said williams a priest 
at all saints episcopal church in hoboken

released monday democratic lawmakers are complaining that it fails 
to address the deficit seriously and that its defense cuts are too 
timid

year the documents show 
also proposed will be cuts in defense and domestic programs 
including energy conservation efforts and medicare the documents 
and officials who spoke on condition they not be identified have 
indicated 
the 631 billion deficit falls just below the 64 billion 
ceiling required by the grammrudman balancedbudget law it will 
be the smallest shortfall proposed by a president since president 
reagan sent his first spending blueprint to capitol hill in march 
1981 when his budget for fiscal 1982 contained a 45 billion gap 
but democrats say bushs budget relies on unrealistically 
optimistic assumptions about economic performance such as the 
spending plans expected estimate that the economy will grow by 
about 26 percent this year that drives up the amount of revenues 
the administration can project collecting and makes the amount of 
needed deficit reduction appear smaller 
they also say bushs 3033 billion defense spending proposal 
a 2 percent cut when compared to the costs of inflation is too 
high considering the political and social changes in eastern europe 
senate budget committee chairman james sasser dtenn 
predicted a very chilly and negative reception on the hill for 
bushs spending plan 
its clear the administration is still not serious about 
deficit reduction he said last week their spending priorities 
are misdirected and they still are directing too much to defense 
the bottom line for everyone to ask is is it real is it 
fair is it balanced house budget committee chairman leon 
panetta dcalif told reporters friday hes promised that kind 
of budget but i think were going to see something thats very 
different 
it is known that bush will seek to trim 85 billion from 
projected growth of the medicare program for the elderly and 
handicapped by cutting payments to doctors and hospitals not by 
shrinking benefits to patients other cuts are expected in 
agriculture spending and in payments to retired federal workers 
bushs defense proposal which includes some nuclear weapons 
spending by the energy department is an increase over this years 
2963 billion in outlays or the funds that actually will be spent 
this year but the way budget deficits are calculated the 3033 
billion proposal counts as about 4 billion in savings the amount 
by which it lags behind inflation 
darman said that over several years military reductions could 
result in more than 200 billion in savings compared to earlier 
projections 
whats unfortunate in this case is everybodys assuming that 
thats right this moment and they plan to spend it 10 times 
over he said 
other details that documents and official and congressional 
sources have provided about the budget include 
a 24 percent increase to 152 billion for nasa and a 1 
billion increase to 123 billion for basic research efforts 
a proposal to gradually stop using the massive social security 
surpluses to make the overall federal deficit look smaller it is 
the administrations answer to a plan by sen daniel moynihan 
dny to reduce the retirement systems surpluses by cutting the 
payroll tax 
a boost in education spending from 241 billion to 246 
billion not enough to keep up with inflation some student loan 
programs will be cut while rewards to schools that show improved 
student performances will be increased 
a 500 million increase in the head start preschool program 
for poor children to nearly 2 billion announced friday by bush 
a firstever requirement that veterans be required to pay 4 
percent down payments on modestly priced homes and a 1 billion 
increase to 123 billion for veterans health care 
a renewal of bushs call for a cut in the capital gains tax 
rate ratcheted to increase the breaks for property the longer it 
is held bush will claim the cut will increase revenues by several 
billion dollars next year arguing it would stimulate sales of 
property democrats say the proposal is a boon to the rich and will 
eventually lose money for the government 
a socalled family savings account allowing families to put 
away up to 5000 annually into accounts that would earn taxfree 
interest if they are kept for at least seven years 
cuts in many domestic programs including energy conservation 
programs mass transit assistance and federal aid to amtrak the 
passenger railroad 
higher spending for space antidrug and research programs

armenian and azerbaijani fighters began 
withdrawing from a key battlefront on sunday and the bitter 
enemies agreed to discuss extending the truce to other parts of the 
volatile region activists reported 
the armenian national movement agreed to conditions demanded by 
the azerbaijani peoples front for peace talks that are to begin 
wednesday in riga latvia according the latvian peoples front 
which is sponsoring the talks 
both sides now say they will discuss troop withdrawals refugees 
and other humanitarian concerns but not the pivotal territorial 
dispute that triggered the hostilities said artis erglis of the 
latvian peoples front 
armenians demand control of nagornokarabakh an enclave of 
azerbaijan populated largely by armenians azerbaijan is 
predominantly shiite moslem while most armenians are christians 
the two soviet republics have feuded intermittently over 
nagornokarabakh for two years 
the conflict burst into antiarmenian riots on jan 13 in baku 
the azerbaijani capital and led to battles between armenians and 
azerbaijanis in the countryside president mihail s gorbachev 
ordered soviet troops to restore order leading to more bloodshed 
as kremlin forces encountered stiff resistance from azerbaijani 
fighters 
at least 197 people have been killed in the neighboring 
republics since jan 13 
the nationalist movements in the baltic republics offered to 
mediate the conflict a sign of how much clout the burgeoning 
movements have gained in the past year and their concern over 
unrest that requires kremlin intervention to control 
yusif samedugli a board member of the azerbaijani peoples 
front confirmed in a telephone interview from baku on sunday that 
azerbaijani representatives would attend talks in the latvian 
capital 
samedugli said the peoples front in tbilisi the capital of 
neighboring georgia also volunteered to mediate and the 
azerbaijanis will send a representative there as well 
georgia the three baltic republics armenia and azerbaijan are 
among several of the 15 soviet republics that have sought greater 
independence from moscow 
this feared unraveling of the soviet unions 15 republics has 
presented gorbachev with his greatest domestic challenge 
militants began withdrawing without incident sunday from the 
border between armenia and nakhichevan an azerbaijani territory 
bounded by armenia iran and turkey according to samedugli and 
armenian activist rafael popoyan in the armenian capital yerevan 
last week activists agreed to a truce at the border one of the 
most bitterly contested areas in the region 
the two sides agreed to patrol roads near the border with groups 
of no more than 10 unarmed men the action will leave security 
along the border zone to soviet troops the soviet news agency tass 
said 
samedugli said a preliminary agreement was reached on holding 
negotiations on a similar disengagement on the border of azerbaijan 
and nagornokarabakh and in the shaumyan and khanlar districts of 
azerbaijan near nagornokarabakh 
samedugli elaborated sunday on the azerbaijanis proposals 
the only basis or peace talks can be the armenians total 
renunciation of any territorial claims he said for our part 
we will guarantee full civil and cultural rights in 
nagornokarabakh 
tass said separate talks produced a hostage exchange 17 
armenians for 22 azerbaijanis in the khanlar district but popoyan 
said three other armenian hostages remained in azerbaijani hands 
and two were feared dead 
soviet soldiers arrested scores of activists in azerbaijan on 
saturday to crush what tass called a criminal military 
structure of nationalists among those arrested were the leaders 
of two organizations called the national defense committee the 
militant arm of the peoples front and national salvation tass 
said sunday 
but some of the masterminds of terror are still in hiding 
tass said 
tass said sunday that government and communist party officials 
were restored to power in lenkoran after army troops battled the 
national defense committee one army lieutenant and five 
terrorists were killed and the military captured 50 extremists 
three mortars and 52 guns it said no date was given 
radio moscow said sunday that life in baku was returning to 
normal but tass said extremists were distributing leaflets calling 
for civil disobedience 
the national television evening news showed azerbaijanis 
criticizing soviet media coverage of the unrest and the 
commentator laid blame squarely on tass the official news agency 
often we are obliged to run tass reports which are considered 
official even if we dont share the tass viewpoint he said 
he noted that many of the tass reports in question are unsigned 
statements apparently drawn up by bureaucrats we would always 
like to know the names of the authors the commentator said 
azerbaijan television went back on the air for the first time in 
more than a week on saturday much of the city remained on strike 
to protest the soviet military presence although some bus service 
resumed official reports said

the hottest ticket at the sundance united 
states film festival was blue steel a police thriller with

lowbudget deeply personal movies from black filmmakers 
staying true to its focus on independent againstallodds 
filmmaking the festival which ended sunday gave its top prizes 
to chameleon street and to sleep with anger two projects 
whose path to the screen was more perilous than any shootout in 
blue steel 
chameleon street a quirky look at a peerless con man took 
writerdirectorstar wendell b harris four years and nearly four 
dozen investors to make the film awarded the grand jury prize 
was produced by harris mother helen 
to sleep with anger an alternately haunting and comic 
account of a family crisis was completed by writerdirector 
charles burnett just days before the festival began it won a 
special jury prize 
neither to sleep with anger nor chameleon street yet 
have distributors but their victories here are likely to propel 
them to us theaters soon 
and their selections also indicate that the festival littered 
as it is with hollywood parties dealmaking on the ski slopes and 
stargazing remains dedicated to providing alternatives to 
mainstream studio fare the festival is organized by actor robert 
redfords sundance institute 
theres nothing worse than a commercially compromised art 
project said jim stark producer of the independent hits 
stranger than paradise and down by law you cant make a 
better top gun than the studios can

renegade filmmakers has never been so tight 
said todd mccarthy the coscreenwriter of the documentary 
hollywood mavericks there are not as many loose 
opportunities to make any old film 
but tom rothman the president of worldwide production for 
independent the samuel goldwyn co said not all independent 
films have merit just because they were a struggle to make 
optimists point to the fact that more than 36000 admissions 
were sold to this years festival

against hunger malnutrition and literacy in addition to the fight 
you confront in drought and desertification the pope told a 
crowd of 1000 people lining the hot and windy airstrip at bamakos 
senou airport 
he stressed dialogue again later in talking to the nations 
seven bishops calling moslems important partners with 
authentic religious values that we need to recognize and 
respect

tracy shirley a homeless mother of two 
is determined to get a job and a nationally recognized program 
called project worth is helping 
theres nothing more that i want than a paycheck every week so 
i can pay my bills and have some money left over said ms 
shirley 
ms shirley 27 is trying to bounce back from an unpromising 
job interview for a 565anhour office job in which she scored 
only 27 words per minute and made several errors on a typing test 
well below her normal skills 
i panicked she said i was so embarrassed 
thanks to project worth ms shirley returned to class last week 
to practice 
im going to do it she said 
project worth is great said sue speed director of the 
louisville coalition for the homeless 
she said the program funded by the us labor department and 
administered by the county school system succeeds because planners 
worked closely with other agencies to mesh project worths services 
with other programs and to determine what homeless people need to 
do to prepare for jobs 
project worths wraparound approach begins with individual 
vocational and educational assessment it then channels the 
homeless into adulteducation and vocational classes and offers 
them guidance in personal and practical matters such as homemaking 
parenting grooming and budgeting 
a daycare program at a school allows parents to attend classes 
without having to worry about their children 
as people reach the point where they are ready to apply for 
jobs project worth counselors help them in polishing their 
interviewing skills and contacting potential employers 
the program also helps them find their own place to live and 
stays in touch for 13 weeks after theyve gone to work 
last year 264 people received training through the program 
most were in their early 20s to mid50s and nearly threefourths 
were women 140 children received day care most are still in the 
program but 42 have landed jobs and 77 have moved from shelters 
into places of their own 
although its been in existence only a year project worth has 
already been noticed it was one 33 trial programs financed last 
year by the department of labor and one of only nine to receive 
funding this year 
federal funding went from 279000 in 1989 to 350000 this 
year additional support comes from the state division of adult 
basic education metro united way and other sources 
success however doesnt come easily 
brenda adams 30 who dropped out of school after the eighth 
grade has been in project worth almost a year trying to earn her 
general educational development certificate the equivalent of a 
high school diploma 
the long slow climb has been aggravating at times but adams 
said shes making progress she scored 186 on the fivepart 
equivalency test the first time she took it well short of the 225 
needed to pass but last time she fell only five points short 
its taken me longer than i thought to get my ged said 
adams who lives with two of her three children in an apartment 
building for the homeless ive always wanted to go back to 
school but i didnt know how to do it i didnt have any support

vice president dan quayle was cheered 
by church goers whose priest welcomed the us military invasion 
and the new governments leaders said american troops still are 
needed to help stabilize the country 
while the continued presence of the us troops has rankled 
other latin nations panamas new president guillermo endara said 
the occupying troops are needed until panama can get its police 
force operational 
peruvian president alan garcia has refused to attend the feb 15 
drug summit in colombia with president bush unless the us 
invasion forces are out of panama 
but endara said sunday that other latin leaders should think 
of the panamanian people and what they want 
quayle met with leaders of panamas new government to discuss 
bushs 1 billion economic recovery package and the withdrawal of 
occupying troops in what he said would be a matter of weeks endara 
had sought 2 billion in us assistance 
in a television interview quayle said the issue of the us 
military invasion of panama is behind us and that it is time to 
focus on the future of panama 
the bush economic recovery package includes loan guarantees 
through the exportimport bank and a variety of us emergency 
relief assistance to help panama pay its foreign debt recover its 
economy and help businesses and other victims recover from the us 
invasion and subsequent fighting 
the focus of discussion shifted somewhat however as endara 
said his country needs some us troops to remain until the new 
national police force is operational 
at this moment we have not the police our forces are not 
quite capable of protecting the life property and public order as 
the panamanian people want endara told reporters outside morning 
church services but we hope that in a very short time this will 
not be necessary 
endara said his government does not want to plan to build a new 
army but will keep only a police force 
quayle repeated that he sees the withdrawal of invasion troops 
within weeks rather than months a senior official traveling 
with quayle said it would likely be within two weeks that the 
current 17000 member force is reduced to the 13000 preinvasion 
level 
us officials have said they have no plans to cut back below 
the 13000 troop level 
at the packed cristo rey church the proamerican congregation 
cheered quayle one person held a sign reading gringos dont go 
home 
some in the welldressed crowd wore tshirts with the words 
operation just cause the name bush gave the operation 
they enthusiastically applauded quayle when he entered the roman 
catholic church with endara and his two vice presidents people 
crowded into the aisles to shake his hand as he made his way to the 
front row 
the rev javier villanueva whose weekly antinoriega sermons 
were well known before the dec 20 invasion told the congregation 
the bush administration recognized panamanian suffering and helped 
eliminate it by driving out noriega 
he said other latin nations who deplored the invasion never did 
anything to help panamas situation 
quayle said outside the church service that the reaction of the 
people was very gratifying 
quayle the highestranking administration officials to visit 
panama since the invasion offered a new rationale for the invasion 
on abctvs this week with avid brinkley 
i am convinced that implementing the treaty as ratified by the 
senate would have been a very difficult proposition he said the 
agreement signed under president carter calls for the united states 
to turn control of the strategic canal to the panamanian government 
at the end of this century 
he repeated previous assertions that the invasion will not be 
of longterm consequence in a negative sense 
obviously there are concerns but this issue of the invasion 
is behind us the question that we focus on is where do we go from 
here and how can we collectively work with this democratically 
elected government and their pursuit of democracy 
quayle later ate lunch in a sparsely peopled outdoor cafe before 
heading to view the panama canal where he operated the controls 
that enabled a ship to pass through the qauyle visited the mira 
flores lock a popular tourist viewing spot 
from there he went to nearby fort clayton to watch the super 
bowl with a roomful of troops and later headed out for a working 
dinner with endara 
at a photo session with quayle panamanian vice president 
ricardo arias calderon told reporters that panamas new government 
looks to the united states for help in developing a modern police 
force to replace the powerful panamanian defense force that was 
noriegas strength 
we will have no army no air force no navy said arias 
calderon implying a domestic police force on the model of 
neighboring costa rica which has no army 
quayle arrived in panama on saturday night from honduras and 
meetings with the presidents of costa rica venezuela guatemala 
honduras and el salvador as well as the prime minister of belize 
he travels to jamaica on monday 
everywhere the vice president traveled in the panamanian capital 
he was guarded by us soldiers in battle fatigues as well as the 
normal secret service detail his limousine had to negotiate barbed 
wire blockades en route from the airport 
the vice president on sunday drove past boarded up stores and 
shops that had been looted during the invasion onlookers watched 
silently as his limousine passed but when the entourage stopped 
briefly at an outdoor market a few hundred bystanders greeted him 
with friendly applause 
quayle handed out silver ballpoint pens and shook hands in the 
waterfront market where people clustered around him he tried to 
buy a bunch of bananas pulling out his wallet but the seller 
augustin espinosa refused to let him pay 
we are very appreciative of him espinosa said later 
god bless you another man told quayle

a bomb exploded in the 
center of londonderry on sunday killing a youth and injuring eight 
other people during a march marking the 18th anniversary of bloody 
sunday police said 
the irish republican army claimed responsibility and said in a 
statement it regretted the youths death which it called a freak 
accident 
it said the blast had been intended to kill security patrols and 
that the march itself had not been a target 
the ira has continually attacked government troops in its 
campaign to rid the predominantly protestant province of british 
forces and unite it with the mainly catholic republic of ireland 
the blast occurred while supporters of the campaign to drive the 
british out of northern ireland marched in the largely roman 
catholic bogside and creggan areas to remember jan 30 1972 when 
british troops shot and killed 14 people during a catholic civil 
rights march 
a spokesman for the royal ulster constabulary the provincial 
police said the blast injured four policemen and a soldier as they 
monitored the approaching crowd of several hundred marchers 
three civilians standing in the area were hurt by flying debris 
the spokesman said 
the youth 17 suffered head injuries when he was struck by 
masonry falling from a wall where he waited with a crowd for the 
parade to pass by police said he died in the hospital 
the bomb had been placed beside a monument regularly used by the 
security forces as a vantage point from which to monitor activities 
in the bogside 
none of the participants in the parade was injured in the blast 
and the rally continued 
all the injured were taken to the altnagelvin hospital in 
londonderry for treatment for injuries most of which police said 
were not serious

the number of americans planning to make 
major purchases or spend money on recreation has declined from last 
year according to a poll released sunday by the gallup 
organization 
asked what they planned to do differently with their money in 
1990 compared to last year 6 percent of 1000 heads of household 
said they would shell out for bigticket items or leisure 
activities 
asked the same question last year 12 percent said they would 
spend money in those areas 
the princetonbased pollster conducted the poll in conjuction 
with bank advertising news of north palm beach fla to determine 
americans anticipated financial behavior in 1990 the randomly 
chosen respondents were interviewed by telephone last month 
as in the previous two annual polls the survey found that about 
40 percent of americans expected to have more money this year than 
last 45 percent expected to have about the same amount and 16 
percent expected to have less 
the survey also found that 27 percent of the respondents said 
they would put more money into savings or certificates of deposit 
roughly the same number as gave that answer last year 
passbook savings accounts remain the most popular savings 
vehicle and were cited by 52 percent of those surveyed 
despite the talk of a sluggish economy the poll illustrates 
some confidence and even optimism at the grassroots level for the 
economy in the coming year said bank advertising news editior 
frank j diekmann 
there is also some evidence that more people are looking at 
increasing their savings rather than purchasing goods diekmann 
said 
gallup didnt give the polls margin of error

an avalanche prompted officials to close 
the jackson hole ski resort sunday but no one was injured 
officials said 
the resort was closed for the day after the avalanche at 110 
pm in an area called the headwall said mike mccollister 
director of operations 
about 50 searchers with tracking dogs sifted through the snow 
for three hours and determined no one had been trapped resort 
officials said the area was to reopen monday 
the avalanche began in a spot that is out of bounds for skiers 
he said it reached an area that is in bounds but isnt a 
regularly marked ski trail 
ski patrols routinely set off explosions near potential 
avalanche slopes early in the morning to clear dangerously loose 
snow before the resort opens to the public 
sometimes avalanche control is not an exact science 
mccollister said you do the best you can and you work hard at 
it but sometimes this happens with a lot of snow a lot of 
buildup

about 200 people marched around a store 
sunday protesting the alleged abduction and assault on a farm 
worker by the stores owners and demanding an end to violence 
against migrant workers and hispanics 
these people make your food one demonstrator said in a 
heated exchange with people standing on the country stores porch 
they pick the food that you eat that they send to the market 
the stores owners ricky ryberg and his brother randy have 
been charged in an attack on 26yearold migrant worker candido 
salas 
salas told authorities the rybergs abducted him jan 3 
assaulted him gagged and handcuffed him and placed a bag with the 
words no mas aqui which means no more here over his head 
the rybergs were released without bail they deny the charges 
said their attorney richard borg 
attorney marco lopez filed a federal civil rights lawsuit 
against the rybergs last week seeking an unspecified amount in 
damages 
before sundays brief march hispanic rights groups held a rally 
in a field about 100 yards from the store in this coastal city 
about 20 miles northwest of san diego 
we are here to speak with one voice said political activist 
martin eder we want justice we are not here just because of the 
kidnapping there have been other abuses that have been perpetrated 
against farm workers 
we are here because this incident is just the tip of the 
racist iceberg eder said 
about 50 mostly white store customers stood on the porch 
watching the rally 
borg said the rybergs and other merchants in a small shopping 
center have been hurt by migrant workers who stole from the store 
gathered on the parking lot urinated on the property sprayed 
graffiti on the building and assaulted customers 
he blamed the migrants problems on federal and local officials 
and said the store was willing to contribute money to establish a 
center where workers could go to find jobs 
borg said characterizing the situation as racial was 
irresponsible 
no business can withstand such activity by any group 
irregardless of race and remain open to the public at large the 
attorney said 
one customer reinette thurman of carlsbad said farm workers 
had stolen items from her house and said she had seen several 
thefts from the store 
another customer mike haggerty carried a sign that said put 
american citizens to work and they will go home illegals 
americans cant do this kind of work because theyve run the 
wages down so low said haggerty an electrician 
the businesses should just raise the wages a little bit he 
said but a lot of businessmen are greedy and dont want to pay 
the wages and then they end up paying for it in the long run 
mexican president carlos salinas de gortari who has made a 
commitment to keep abreast of his countrymens wellbeing abroad 
inquired last week about the salas case salinas has urged mexican 
consulate officials throughout the united states to monitor any 
abuses against mexican laborers and take appropriate action 
the salas incident is the latest of several involving alleged 
attacks on hispanics and illegal aliens in san diego county 
including charges this week against two san diego policemen accused 
of kidnapping and robbing three undocumented workers in separate 
incidents last august

a roar went up as chinas no 1 and only rock n 
roll singer cui jian bounded on the stage sunday night 
the band grinded into heavy metal high gear colored strobes 
blinked zanily fans waved their arms for cuis first concert in 
nearly a year and the first rock event since the political 
crackdown last june 
it was about as crazy as a crowd in communist china can get and 
hundreds of police were there to make sure it didnt get any 
crazier 
uniformed police occupied the entire front row in the beijing 
workers gymnasium sitting stolidly while dozens more uniformed 
and plainclothes police patrolled the aisles and ordered stray fans 
back to their seats 
but that didnt stop the nearly 10000 fans most in their teens 
and 20s from jumping up and down in place and waving posters of 
the 28yearold singer in syncopation to his songs about love and 
youthful alientation 
i want to leave i want to die and start all over again 
cui sang as much of the crowd joined in 
in todays society youths are looking for someone to speak 
for them said a college student who spent the entire twohour 
concert bopping singing and stabbing the air with his fists 
look around most everyone here is young he speaks for our 
dissatisfaction 
his songs are the songs of our generation we all have 
nothing said another student referring to cuis first hit and 
most famous song i have nothing 
the words are great in the past i asked constantly when 
will you go with me but you always laughed at me i have 
nothing the student recited breathless and a little hoarse 
from cheering 
authorities remain suspicious of rock music which they openly 
condemned in the early 1980s as overstimulating and too sexually 
charged cuis career has been a rocky one including long periods 
when he was not allowed to perform 
police dragged him off stage at a 1988 concert yelling at him 
for provoking chaos according to an official report 
no such incident occurred sunday although police stopped a 
group of students carrying signs from streaming into the aisle 
their signs proclaimed cui jian chinas no 1 rock and 
roller and identified them as the economics institute fan 
club 
a plainclothes member of the peoples armed police chinas 
paramilitary force stood by scowling 
i dont like his music he said i dont like the way he 
sings it i like someone like fei xiang a taiwaneseamerican pop 
singer who recently toured china 
veteran soldiers reportedly are offended by cuis rock rendition 
of the 1940s classic nan ni wan about communist land reform 
and by his recent hit rock n roll for the new long march 
which compares the search for self with the red armys epic march 
during the revolutionary war 
were all opportunists cui shouted to the crowd before 
launching into his song opportunists which expresses social 
alienation the communist party insists such feelings do not exist 
cuis songs are not overtly political but express the 
restlessness and searching that repeatedly has sent chinas youth 
into the streets in protest most recently last spring when the 
army was called in to crush the prodemocracy movement 
police closed in quickly at the concerts end shooing fans out 
the gymnasium was cleared in 10 minutes flat 
one youth who knew the words to all cuis songs said he would be 
back monday for cuis second of three performances despite the 
high 425 ticket price several days salary for the average 
beijing worker 
hes the pride of the chinese people the fan said

east germanys communistled government and 
opposition forces agreed late sunday to move the nations first 
free elections up to march 18 and to govern by coalition until then 
communist premier hans modrow and the more than 40 opposition 
representatives announced the new election date moving ahead by 
nearly two months the balloting that had been planned for may 6 
the decisions were part of a common responsibility to 
strengthen democracy in east germany modrow said 
the agreement which includes the fourth restructuring of the 
cabinet in as many months acknowledged the need to quickly seat a 
government that has the trust and confidence of the populace 
a new cabinet the first to include representatives from 
emerging reform groups will be submitted by wednesday to 
parliament said martin ziegler a lutheran church official 
the new leadership will include one member from each of the nine 
opposition groups represented at weekly talks with government 
although the ministers will be named without portfolio ziegler 
said 
wolfgang schnur of the democratic awakening movement said the 
cabinet members will decide later how to distribute ministerial 
responsibilities 
the planned cabinet changes follow an announcement three days 
ago that christian democratic union was pulling out its three 
ministers but following sundays agreement the union one of 
four traditionally communistallied parties was expected to take 
part in the new leadership schnur said 
modrow also has been repeatedly challenged by the prodemocracy 
opposition groups which contend he has no mandate to govern 
because he and his 27member communistdominated cabinet were 
seated by a parliament that was not democratically elected 
more than a dozen small political parties are vying for public 
support in this nation of 16 million which is troubled by economic 
disaster and a continuing exodus of its most promising workers 
the flight westward which drained the nation of more than 
340000 people last year recently swelled to about 2500 
departures daily 
many opposition parties held weekend congresses to chart 
strategy for the elections which will be the countrys first free 
competitive vote 
but there was little indication the fractious reform forces 
would be able to band together to challenge the stilldominant 
communists 
new forum the largest of the prodemocracy groups to emerge 
from last falls peaceful revolution previously claimed 200000 
members 
but a moderate faction split from the movement to form a new 
party over the weekend and the core group collapsed into divisive 
squabbling sunday at its convention in east berlin 
the splinter group named itself the german forum party and spoke 
out at its meeting in karlmarxstadt for a complete break with 
socialism it claimed to have 100000 members suggesting that as 
many as half of new forums supporters had defected 
the new forum delegates who met in east berlin reiterated their 
aim of combining socialist ideology with some free enterprise 
meanwhile the leader of the christian democratic union 
announced that he was prepared to seek an election coalition with 
democratic awakening and the german social union two opposition 
groups that support marketoriented reforms and closer ties with 
west germany 
also sunday a west german newspaper reported that east 
germanys former hardline leader erich honecker will be arrested 
monday upon his release from a hospital 
doctors have determined that honecker 77 is too ill to be held 
in custody following surgery for kidney cancer and he will be sent 
to a prison hospital instead of jail bild newspaper said 
the east german chief prosecutors office refused to comment on 
the report the state news agency adn said 
honecker led east germany for 18 years until his ouster oct 18 
earlier this month prosecutors said he would be charged with 
treason as well as corruption in connection with his leadership 
several members of the disgraced leadership have been arrested 
since the new government took office 
bild also said honeckers wife margot who served as education 
minister in his ousted leadership had been thrown out of a luxury 
compound for top officials and is living with their daughter in 
east berlin

trouble in a pacifist religious sect has 
landed several dissidents in jail for visiting a cemetery against a 
court order and led the groups leader to stage a hunger strike 
that lasted 47 days 
the rebels have been ousted from bon homme colony believed to 
be the oldest hutterite settlement in america and moved into a 
house here five miles from their former home 
the dissidents led by a former californian who said he spent 
years on a personal quest for a simplier way of life charge that 
colony elders quest for profit has corrupted their spiritual 
leadership 
but hutterite leaders say the rebels have been brainwashed by a 
powerhungry outsider they say the colony provides for its people 
from cradle to the grave and deny that its thriving farm 
enterprise reflects materialism 
we feel everything should be spiritual explains john k 
wipf pastor of the maxwell colony another hutterite settlment 
near the bon homme colony but we also have to work for a 
living 
the dissidents say a communal religious enclave shouldnt be run 
like a business and charge that colony leaders have too much power 
i bet jakob hutter would turn over in his grave if he could 
see how they are today says james wainscoat referring to the 
sects namesake who was burned at the stake in 1536 
the hutterian brethren originated in what was once moravia part 
of presentday czechoslovakia in 1528 members emigrated to the 
united states after centuries of persecution in eastern europe and 
russia 
about 35000 hutterites live in north america twothirds in 
canada south dakota has the largest hutterite population of any 
state 
hutterites shun contact with the outside world and forbid 
television radio and personal luxuries but they embrace modern 
farm technology and conveniences that benefit the entire colony 
such as laborsaving kitchen and laundry equipment that is what 
the dissidents are fighting 
at present wainscoat is recuperating from his hunger strike at 
the dissidents rented home in tabor he ended the strike earlier 
this month after authorities released two of the five dissidents 
held on the contempt of court charges 
he sits in a chair surrounded by young boys and girls and women 
holding babies they listen intently nod in agreement with his 
words and talk among themselves in a german dialect a calico cat 
and tiny white dog frolic at wainscoats feet and the pungent 
aroma of the noontime meal fills the air 
the dissidents split from the colony last year after elders gave 
them an ultimatum choose to follow colony rules or follow 
wainscoat 
wainscoat 48 was denied membership nearly a decade earlier for 
refusing to obey colony rules he returned in 1987 after an absence 
of several years and renewed a friendship with samuel wurtz son of 
a former head pastor who died in 1952 it is his grave they have 
been arrested for visiting 
wurtz and about 20 members of his extended family followed 
wainscoat the dissidents along with a handful of defectors from 
other colonies call themselves the ark of the new covenant 
ark members claim a right to tend the grave the colony says it 
will allow relatives to visit if they obtain permission but it 
will not tolerate wainscoat though its his fathers grave wurtz 
didnt ask permission to visit without wainscoat 
the courts granted the colony an injunction barring ark members 
from the cemetery three dissidents including samuel wurtz have 
been jailed since early october on contempt of court charges for 
violating the order wainscoat will serve time for trespassing when 
his health improves 
john kabeiseman an attorney for the colony said the rebels 
latched onto the cemetery issue because it arouses public sympathy 
he said the real motive is to undermine authority 
theyre doing it in defiance of the leadership of the 
hutterite community he said 
samuel wurtz said in an interview at the jail that the current 
leaders have no right to authority because their moral leadership 
is lacking 
its preached but its not lived he said its 
hypocrisy its a lie 
wurtz said he has a calling to continue his fathers mission by 
leading the approximately 100 people of bon homme colony but he 
concedes that current head pastor jacob waldner 82 is not likely 
to welcome his bid for leadership 
norbert mach mayor of this town of 340 said opinion is split 
some people resent the dissidents for continuing to trespass at the 
cemetery leaving taxpayers with the bill public defender lawyer 
fees and jail costs but others are sympathetic to the dissidents 
he said 
its just about like whats going on in eastern europe he 
said they want to be more like citizens

social justice we link her future to democratic socialism 
before the vote to create a new party however reformer tadeusz 
fiszbach took the floor to denounce artificial unity 
we will be unable to explain to society how we were 
transformed into social democrats out of communists overnight 
said fiszbach who heads a faction of about 200 delegates 
if we dont make accounts for the past 45 years we will be 
committing suicide together he said 
we also must admit that the tragedy of martial law did not 
have to happen fiszbach said referring to the communist 
crackdown that suppressd the solidarity opposition movement until 
it was legalized again last year 
he then stormed out of the congress and formed a breakaway 
party the socialdemocratic union 
fiszbach said his party would likely field candidates in 
municipal elections in june 
outgoing party chief mieczyslaw f rakowski had hoped to create 
a single new leftist party that would abandon communist ideology 
and thereby win public support 
aleksander kwasniewski who appeared to be rakowskis heir 
apparent said the former communists should remain as unified as 
possible but he added this does not mean unity at all costs 
two or three parties could emerge but even they should 
cooperate he said 
the new partys platform endorses a marketdriven economy but 
rejects exclusive private ownership and says unemployment cannot be 
treated as a permanent element of the ecomomic mechanism we 
assess the right to work as a natural right of man 
outside the hall where the 1600 delegates met about 50 
protesters chanted communists must go as police looked on 
late saturday more than 500 demonstrators threw stones and 
bottles at riot police in clashes that lasted several hours 
the polish communists relinquished power to solidarity making 
it the east blocs first government led by noncommunists in 
september after the party was trounced in june elections 
the government of prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki since has 
plunged into radical reforms to make poland a capitalist democracy 
the changes in poland were followed in swift order by revolts 
against hardline communist regimes in czechoslovakia east 
germany bulgaria hungary and romania

julia staniszewski says she hadnt seen 
some of her neighbors in this wooded suburb for at least a year 
but when avianca flight 52 crashed thunderously into a nearby 
hillside they came running 
the radio went off and everything went dark but there was 
absolute silence the 85yearold longtime resident said sunday 
recalling as did others the eerie absence of engine noise before 
the crash i stayed in bed until neighbors came looking for me 15 
minutes later to check that i was ok 
the boeing 707 clipped the tall oaks near mrs staniszewskis 
house before breaking into pieces and coming to rest in a mess of 
twisted steel killing 73 people aboard the craft and injuring 86 
three days later residents of this affluent community of about 
340 people 35 miles east of new york city say the enormity of the 
tragedy is just beginning to hit home 
we were on automatic pilot until last night said richard 
hassanein whose home sits two houses from the wreckage we 
couldnt think about ourselves 
hassaneins wife adrienne said she still feels numbed mrs 
hassanein was one of the first to reach the scene after the 
redandorange jet crashed 
it sounded and felt like an earthquake she said the 
scene was terrible it was almost surreal you dont forget 
something like that 
the plane tore part of the rear deck off a house but damaged no 
other homes on long islands north shore even so the community 
will never fully recover from the emotional impact mrs hassanein 
said 
on sunday residents dressed in running gear many with dogs in 
tow looked on in disbelief as investigators dug for clues 
most suitcases and other personal effects were hauled away 
saturday but the odd shoe or piece of clothing remained amid 
broken seats inflated life vests oxygen masks and bits of 
fuselage 
police guarding the wreckage looked around in dismay 
occasionally picking up an item of clothing or passport then 
silently letting it fall 
i dont want to be here one officer said no one does 
the quiet search recalled the strange silence that preceded 
thursdays crash all four engines stopped before the plane went 
down indicating it may have run out of fuel 
i was paying bills watching television and listening to the 
wind when i heard a thud i thought lightning had struck said 
marjorie isaksen whose home sits above the crash site 
mrs isaksen said she heard about the tragedy about 15 minutes 
later when a friend phoned to check on her 
my reaction was utter disbelief she said 
i didnt really realize what had happened until i knelt beside 
an injured man lying on a stretcher and lay my coat over him 
mrs isaksen said his face was swollen and bloody i cried when 
i was alone with him 
mrs isaksen said however that the tragedy still hasnt set 
into my brain

the san francisco 49ers routed the denver 
broncos 5510 sunday in the most lopsided super bowl victory ever 
the 49ers win in the 24th super bowl made them the first repeat 
nfl champion in a decade and tied the pittsburgh steelers as a 
pinnacle of super bowl perfection with four wins in four tries 
san francisco won the national football league championship game 
in 1989 1985 and 1982 the broncos on the other hand lost the 
last four super bowl games they have played 
san francisco quarterback joe montana made five touchdown 
passes three to jerry rice breaking a super bowl record for 
touchdown passes on a day on which he also set a record with 13 
straight pass completions

super bowl most valuable player award and san franciscos point 
total was the most ever montana left the game with nearly 11 
minutes to play

by halftime the score was 273 with their third loss in four 
years the broncos have now been outscored 13640

in which police said 929 people were killed and 2744 wounded 
the new hostilities came as president elias hrawis government 
prepared to ban militias and combat terrorism in west beirut to 
encourage foreign diplomats to return to the citys moslem sector

president bushs trust me policy on china 
could use an assist from the hardline government in beijing and 
soon the white house needs some toldyouso evidence that 
conciliatory gestures are serving to ease repression 
that will take more than the steps the administration cited in 
putting together the 37 republican senators who voted to sustain 
bushs veto of a bill extending the visas of chinese students in 
the united states 
i think there is a trust factor that hopefully will result in 
changes that are satisfactory to the american people and to me a 
trust factor in the administration the president said and i 
hope that i can use that having won this now to further the kinds 
of things that i think will help move china forward 
his political hand and the trust he seeks at home both would 
be strengthened by a clear and convincing reciprocal move on the 
part of the chinese government 
while bush claimed a mandate for his handling of china policy 
that is hard to read into roll calls in which only 25 house members 
sided with him while the senate enforced his veto with three votes 
to spare 
minorities are enough to fend off the opposition on a foreign 
policy issue but sustaining vetoes will not sustain a policy for 
long 
symbolism and politics figured heavily in the debate the 
lobbying and the surprise turnaround on the veto the senate upheld 
on thursday 
bush rendered the bill largely symbolic by accompanying his nov 
30 veto with an executive order to do the same thing he could have 
ended it there with a pocket veto that would not have been subject 
to override votes instead given political sensitivities he sent 
it back for action when congress reconvened 
the veto was sustained after gop leaders called the vote an 
electionyear test of republican loyalty sen bob dole of kansas 
the republican leader called it the first installment of the 1990 
campaign saying democrats were trying to force gop senators into a 
politically difficult vote it was that and eight republicans 
voted against bush 
bush said he also won on the strength of his argument against 
doing by law what he ordered done anyhow in a policy realm that 
properly belongs to the president he said that if the veto were 
overridden the chinese would retaliate by canceling all student 
exchanges 
his executive order and personal pledge guarantee at least what 
the bill did and possibly more in extending the visas of about 
32000 chinese students 
no student as long as im president will be sent back 
against his or her will he promised he said that guarantee 
holds good even if the chinese government relents in its repression 
of democratic dissent the crackdown that led to the massacre in 
tiananmen square last june and to bushs limited sanctions against 
beijing 
democrats said the sanctions werent tough enough to begin with 
and the administration has been gradually easing them for months 
one was a bar against highlevel exchanges of government officials 
and within two weeks of it the president secretly sent two of his 
top aides to beijing when word of that leaked out months later 
bush said hed never forbidden official contacts only exchange 
visits 
that refuge in the fine print hasnt done much for the 
administrations credibility on the china sanctions 
bush who once served as us envoy to beijing insists that 
harsh sanctions including the visa bill would be 
counterproductive driving china toward isolation choking off 
exchanges and worsening the situation inside the country 
while the students arent going home either way bush said 
beijing found the bill more offensive than his order even though 
officials dont like it either the bill he said would have 
seemed to them a further public slap at a time when they feel 
some steps have been taken that are positive 
he claims headway for human rights as a result of his policy 
citing the lifting of martial law on jan 10 the release of 573 
jailed dissenters an end to harassment at the us embassy where 
a leading chinese dissident remains in refuge continued student 
exchanges and peace corps missions 
but bush critics in both parties insist that those and other 
steps are tokens not nearly enough to warrant the easing of 
american sanctions against a government that turned guns on its 
people executed demonstrators and jailed uncounted thousands of 
dissenters 
bush and the republicans havent heard the end of the matter 
there are likely to be new sanction proposals in congress there is 
certain to be more rhetoric from the democrats who have accused the 
president of kowtowing to china and sacrificing his own credibility 
with a campaign coming this is an issue the democrats want to 
keep on the agenda

lifted by higher prices and stronger 
production the oil revenues of the opec nations soared last year 
to their highest level since 1985 industry analysts say 
pierre terzian editor of the parisbased newsletter 
petrostrategies said the earnings surge for the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries was a big pleasant surprise 
nobody expected it would be as high as this 
they should have done quite comfortably said paul mcdonald 
a londonbased oil consultant 
terzian estimated the cartels 13 nations earned a total of 
1106 billion last year from export sales of their crude up more 
than a third from his calculation of 1988 revenues at 801 billion 
peter bogin assistant director for oil markets at cambridge 
energy research associates in paris figured the exports including 
natural gas liquids and related products at 1115 billion in 1989 
last years showing was the best since 1985 when the producing 
nations which depend heavily on sales of their oil to foreign 
customers earned 1272 billion 
opecs revenues swung wildly in the 1980s reflecting the sharp 
rise and fall of crude prices 
the revolution in iran in 1979 resulted in a steep drop in 
production by that key supplying nation world oil prices spun 
above 40 a barrel 
in the following years a production freeforall sent prices 
plummeting futures prices for west texas intermediate the 
benchmark american crude fell to 1042 a barrel on march 31 
1986 less than half of what it sells for now 
opecs oil earnings according to official figures registered a 
record 2845 billion in 1980 but slumped to a decadelow 773 
billion in 1986 
the cartel earned 864 billion in 1988 from exports including 
sales of some petroleum products the official tally for 1989 wont 
be released until later in the year 
analysts attributed last years big gains to rising prices and 
output a nice combination as mcdonald put it 
the average price of a basket of seven crudes monitored by opec 
was 1731 a barrel last year up about 3 from 1988 the cartels 
official target is 18 
bogin estimated the cartels average production was 217 million 
barrels a day last year vs 197 million barrels in 1988 he said 
demand for opecs oil was strong particularly from robust 
economies in the far east 
looking ahead he predicted the average price of opecs basket 
of crudes would run in the range of 16 to 18 a barrel this year 
production would likely average 23 million barrels a day he said 
as a result he said the cartels 1990 earnings could run 10 
billion to 20 billion above last years pace 
terzian estimated that earnings for kuwait a big cheater on its 
opecimposed production ceiling skyrocketed 72 percent to 94 
billion last year its output rose 43 percent 
irans revenues shot up 616 percent to top 12 billion terzian 
reckoned 
in value terms the increase in iranian oil revenues was huge 
46 billion he wrote in his newsletter this value increase 
was bettered by only saudi arabia which lifted its 1989 oil 
revenues by 54 billion 
saudi arabia the worlds no 1 crude exporter rang up export 
sales last year of 257 billion by terzians calculations bogin 
tallied saudi exports at 24 billion 
in 1988 opec pegged the kingdoms export earnings at 205 
billion in 1981 they reached a high of 1162 billion

the japanese have gotten slammed by some 
americans for their highly visible investments in us corporations 
and business properties ranging from columbia pictures to 
rockefeller center 
but this past weeks slump in bond prices suggests that the us 
government and those holding its debt should put out the welcome 
mat for japanese investors in treasury securities 
over the past few years the japanese have been steady and 
substantial customers at the quarterly securities sales where the 
government has borrowed heavily to finance its expanding debt 
market watchers estimate the japanese typically buy 25 percent 
to 35 percent of new treasury issues maturing in 10 to 30 years 
as a result some analysts argue the government has been able 
to peddle its securities at lower rates of interest than it would 
have to pay otherwise 
but worries about whether japanese investors will be big buyers 
of the treasurys expected 30 billion auction of new securities 
next month have weighed heavily on bond prices 
those concerns have stemmed from a recent rise in japanese 
interest rates that has narrowed the difference in yields available 
on japanese securities relative to us notes and bonds 
william griggs a partner with the investment firm griggs amp 
santow inc said 10year japanese notes for example were 
yielding about 135 percentage points below the yields on 10year 
treasury notes earlier this month compared with a 2 percentage 
point difference at the start of the year 
while the difference in yields has since widened toward 2 
percentage points once again in more recent days william v 
sullivan jr of dean witter reynolds said the more typical yield 
spread has been 25 to 3 percentage points 
the fear among us bondholders is that some japanese investors 
will find the current yields in japan rewarding enough that they 
will decide against taking the extra risks involved in converting 
yen to dollars and buying treasury issues 
that could drive us rates higher depressing the value of 
bonds already trading in the market 
the realities of what can happen when foreign investors sit out 
a bond auction were illustrated this past tuesday when the 
resolution funding corp had to pay higher rates than many market 
professionals had anticipated to find buyers for its 5 billion 
issue of 40year thrift bailout bonds 
the japanese had not been expected to bid on the bonds which 
carry maturities of 10 years later than the treasurys longest 
security and are expected to be far less readily salable than 
treasury issues 
we didnt expect the japanese to be there and they werent 
said robert brusca economist for nikko securities international in 
new york 
he said no conclusions should be drawn from the absence of the 
japanese from the 40year auction relative to what may happen at 
the treasury auctions expected to be conducted in early february 
but some traders said the auction illustrated nonetheless that 
interest rates must often go higher than expected when the pool of 
bidders is smaller 
prices of long bonds tumbled in the wake of the 40year auction 
and got another jolt on thursday that reflected traders 
sensitivity to the importance of foreign investment in the us 
bond market 
bond prices careened lower after some press reports suggested 
federal reserve chairman alan greenspan had indicated he might 
consider the idea of reinstating a withholding tax on investment 
income earned here by foreigners the federal reserve later said 
greenspan did not favor such action 
but the market failed to revive anyway and prices lost more 
ground friday in the wake of a strongerthanexpected report on 
durable goods orders in december 
by midafternoon friday prices of 30year treasury bonds were 
down more than 25 for every 1000 in face value for the week 
their yield had risen to 854 percent from 826 percent at the end 
of the previous friday 
griggs suspected yields were getting high enough that japanese 
interest in the upcoming auctions will be strong 
but sullivan said it is still too early to tell we have a a 
long way to go until we bid these securities he said

chinas financial woes and political upheavals 
continues to dampen hopes of revived trade with the troubled giant 
throughout asia 
businessmen in the regions booming countries are hoping for a 
quick end to western sanctions on beijing and a resumption of 
international loans but the heady visions of burgeoning growth in 
commerce with the worlds most populous country have been shaken by 
the prospect of continued political strife 
earlier this month chinese premier li peng announced a lifting 
of martial law the move was seen as an attempt to end the western 
sanctions imposed after the bloody crackdown on the prodemocracy 
movement in china last june but it received a lukewarm welcome in 
most world capitals 
washington refrained from giving a full goahead for the world 
bank to resume lending china money for development projects japan 
said the move although positive would not immediately thaw 
tokyos freeze on a huge loan package for china 
japan hong kong and taiwan all have suffered trade reverses 
with china in the past year japanese investment in china is off 
and business confidence remains shaken analysts say 
japanese business leaders said they hope chinas situation will 
stabilize and tokyo will go ahead with a fiveyear program to lend 
56 billion to china 
i felt quite relieved at the news because the chinese economy 
could get worse if western sanctions against china last for long 
kyodo news service quoted kazuo haruna chairman of marubeni corp 
one of japans leading trading companies as saying about the 
lifting of martial law 
sueo kojima a china researcher at the japan external trade 
organization said the frozen loans are the key for japanese 
businesses 
now all our companies are waiting for the loan package because 
otherwise china doesnt have money to pay for imports kojima 
said in an interview 
prime minister toshiki kaifu has said he hopes the package can 
be implemented on schedule in april japan chinas biggest source 
of foreign credit in recent years says it doesnt want china to 
become isolated in international affairs 
kojima said japanese businesses will take a waitandsee 
attitude for now keeping an eye on the us congress to see if 
it continues tough sanctions 
maybe from the second half of this year japanese businesses 
will renew contact with the chinese side he said 
chinas austerity measures imposed for economic reasons before 
the june political crackdown cut imports at the same time that 
chinese exports in some sectors surged 
japans trade deficit with china 594 million in the first 11 
months of 1988 soared to 24 billion in the same period of 1989 
according to japanese government figures 
hong kong is the main port of entry for goods from asia passing 
into china and its trade balance has shifted like japans 
economic retrenchment policies have stopped china from buying 
products abroad and in hong kong said cl law an economist at bt 
brokerage ltd the hong kong operation of bankers trust 
chinas purchases of goods in hong kong slipped to about 33 
billion in the third quarter of 1989 down 1 percent from the third 
quarter of 1988 the first drop in several years 
sales of chinese goods in and through hong kong rose 
dramatically however to about 7 billion for the third quarter of 
1989 up 49 percent from a year earlier 
law said one reason chinese sales surged was because many 
factories built in china with hong kong money had opened for 
business in the last year sparking a jump in production he said 
he expects the increase to continue although not at such a high 
rate 
in taiwan trade with china has grown since the nationalist 
government eased restrictions on ties with the communist mainland 
three years ago but growth slowed in the third quarter of last 
year because of chinas clampdown on raw material exports and 
taiwans shifting of some orders to other countries because of 
instability in china said economist kao chang of the semiofficial 
chunghwa institute for economic research 
but kao said some taiwanese businesses ignored political 
instability and moved chemical plants or laborintensive industries 
such as textiles and footwear to china because of rising labor 
costs and environmental concerns at home 
many of our businessmen believe chinese authorities will try 
to maintain the open trade policy despite possible political 
turmoil kao said 
south korea was just getting started in trade with communist 
china when business shrank after last junes violence said 
officials at the trade and industry ministry in seoul 
in december south koreas goldstar co temporarily closed a 
plant making color television tubes saying it had expected to ship 
15 million tubes to china in 1989 but shipped only 40 percent in 
the first half of the year and none in the last half

after two years of legal and political 
wrangling the public service co of new hampshire bankruptcy is on 
the brink of resolution despite the continued opposition of some 
consumer advocates 
a plan for connecticutbased northeast utilities to take over 
new hampshires largest electric utility the lead operator of the 
troubled seabrook nuclear power plant should go into effect this 
summer public service says 
the governor and the legislature have approved the deal and 
state and federal regulators are expected to give their nods in 
coming months 
it would be surprising if the deal doesnt go through said 
robert viles dean of franklin pierce law center in concord and a 
bankruptcy authority it would require a new fact that isnt in 
the picture now 
even steadfast opponents of the 23 billion takeover say they 
have thrown in the towel 
its done said paul mceachern a portsmouth lawyer who was 
the states democratic gubernatorial candidate in 1986 and 1988 
were victims of a sellout 
public service entered chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization on 
jan 28 1988 under the weight of its leadshare ownership of the 
64 billion seabrook nuclear plant which remains idle for lack of 
a commercial operating license it was the first large publicly 
owned utility to file for bankruptcy since the depression 
the utilitys slide began years earlier some say with the 
small utilitys decision in the early 1970s to take on a major 
nuclear project 
public service itself points to passage of a 1979 state law that 
forbids utilities from charging for power plants before they 
operate the law intended to prevent consumers from becoming 
unwilling financiers for seabrook forced public service to borrow 
more money for the plant raising borrowing costs and ultimately 
the cost of the project 
last september northeast presented one of four reorganization 
proposals including one by public service itself gov judd gregg 
and a committee representing public service shareholders and 
creditors backed northeast soon after and the legislature endorsed 
the plan at a special session last month 
the plan calls for northeast to take over public services 36 
percent share of seabrook it also gives northeast approval for 
seven annual rate increases of 55 percent the first of which took 
effect provisionally on jan 1 
opponents say gregg forced the plan on legislators on short 
notice 
i think an awful lot of legislators thought they just had to 
trust the leadership because they didnt have the time or 
background to understand what they were going to do said robert 
backus a lawyer for the seacoast antipollution league 
gregg said he stands by the plan and the states handling of 
negotiations 
the issue is whether consumers are going to get charged a fair 
rate for electricity if there will be a dependable supply of 
electricity and whether the company supplying the power would be 
under new hampshire control gregg said the answer under the 
plan is yes he added 
gregg and state negotiators also defended the rate increases as 
a reasonable tradeoff for avoiding the possibility of much larger 
increases through the normal regulatory process once seabrook was 
licensed 
but opponents argue that consumers are being forced to pay for 
the bankruptcy while unsecured creditors get all of their 
investment back plus some interest some holders of socalled junk 
bonds earned interest rates of more than 20 percent for their 
speculative investments 
i think public service company stands out in this country as 
an aberration in the bankruptcy field mceachern said its the

a consortium of japanese businesses are 
debating whether to help finance construction of highspeed 
magnetic levitation train systems in pittsburgh and other us 
cities and may reach a decision by next week members say 
most members of the group are supportive of the project but 
we dont have a final consensus among all members yet said 
jitsuro terashima of mitsui and co one of the firms involved 
terashima said news of the project was leaked prematurely to a 
japanese news service on thursday 
the consortium of 11 companies wants to help finance the trains 
so theyll be in a good position if the technology becomes 
widespread officials said 
theyre doing this so as this develops they can 
participate said meyer berger chairman of the pittsburgh maglev 
action group of business leaders city and county officials and 
representatives of carnegie mellon university 
a 20mile demonstration project would link station square a 
shopping and restaurant complex on the citys south side with 
greater pittsburgh international airport 
the project would cost about 400 million total financing for 
research development and construction throughout the united states 
would total 6 billion terashima said 
richard uher director of cmus high speed ground transportation 
center declined to discuss the project saying details would be 
disclosed at a news conference feb 23 
maglev trains ride about a quarterinch above the track on a 
field of magnetic energy they can reach speeds of 300 mph 
the pittsburgh maglev action group and the high speed ground 
transportation center have been advocating development of a train 
from station square to the airport 
the action group is pushing for a 15 million feasibility study 
for the project gov robert casey has said he wants the state to 
contribute 300000 toward the study 
berger said he expects the japanese consortium to contribute 
250000 contributions from other businesses would pay for the 
rest of the study he said 
william dickhart us representative for transrapid 
international a german consortium that has developed highspeed 
rail technology said it may be premature to consider financing 
proposals before a feasibility study has been conducted 
berger said its unlikely ridership to the airport could cover 
the costs of the train but the project eventually would stretch 
beyond the airport extending into a regional system serving erie 
cleveland charleston wva and other cities 
discussions with the japanese consortium began about six months 
ago the consortium includes york mitsui and co toshiba corp 
toyota motor corp nippon steel corp nkk corp sumitomo metal 
industries ltd longterm credit bank of japan sony corp 
industrial bank of japan mitsui bank and ajinomoto berger said 
bob casey president of the pittsburghbased high speed rail 
association said the first magnetic levitation train in the united 
states is likely to be in operation in florida by october 1994 
connecting the orlando airport to a transit station near disney
