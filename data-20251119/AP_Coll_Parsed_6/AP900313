timbuktu was lucky last year it rained 
the locusts stayed away and with some help from the outside 
farmers produced one of the best harvests in half a century 
farmers in nearly all the countries that hug the southern sahara 
deserts harsh border produced similar bumper crops that filled 
graneries and childrens bellies from senegal east to niger 
the good fortune of 1988 and 1989 welcome as it is also 
illuminates the profound problems facing these poor nations 
struggling to feed themselves problems that range from a 
birthrate that outpaces production to a marketplace that stacks the 
deck against even the hardestworking farmer 
experts note that even with the bountiful harvest in most 
countries subsaharan africa imported nearly 9 million tons of 
cereal grains in 1988 
nonetheless the 500000ton grain surplus is spectacular 
news said us ambassador robert pringle now everyone is 
wondering how to export what they have grown 
abduleh al kalifa hipdeep in a field of emeraldgreen wheat 
rippling in a desert wind near timbuktu doesnt worry about 
exporting he just wishes he could sell his surplus 30 miles away 
in timbuktu 
five years ago there was no rain nothing to eat said 
kalifa 36 already middleaged in a nation where the average life 
expectancy is 49 foreigners gave us everything these last two 
years the harvests were good we have hope and two warehouses are 
full 
we have more than we can eat more than we can store and we 
cant sell the rest he said how can we get our grain to town 
if there are no roads how can we compete with grain from other 
countries how can we earn enough money to buy food when there is 
another drought 
malis last drought left its mark on the children twoyearolds 
are solid and round but children born in the drought of 19841985 
are spindly apt to suffer from chronic malnutrition 
if you are malnourished a few good meals will make you feel 
better but you are still malnourished said leo devos director 
of the united nations childrens fund in mali the whole country 
is like these children it will take more than a couple of good 
harvests to put the country back on its feet 
still its nice to see the green he said it is the 
color of hope 
when unicef arrived five years ago with emergency food the 
government was in chaos people were starving and huge numbers of 
refugees arrived in cities each day from the barren countryside 
enormous need remained when the crisis ended so unicef and 
others stayed on to help 
the united states which spends about 30 million a year in 
mali now helps entrepreneurs and small farmers west germany built 
warehouses for reserves and a highway that spans a nation as large 
as texas and california combined 
france italy and others fight the advance of the desert dig 
wells organize cooperatives and help in dozens of other ways 
unicef has concentrated on timbuktu a oncemysterious oasis 
that still evokes romance and adventure 
centuries ago timbuktu was a crossroads of caravans a center 
of learning and a garden in the desert where the river ran deep 
and trees hung heavy with fruit 
now the advancing desert has tied a noose of dunes around it 
and many donors have written the city off as a lost cause 
with funds donated by italian labor unions unicef installed 
pumps to make use of niger river water and drilled wells to tap 
ground water for irrigation 
we wanted to set an example to show what could be done in 
even the most precarious situation devos said one result of the 
fiveyear project was the field where kalifa and his neighbors grew 
a 15ton grain surplus little of which can be sold 
the malian government used to have price controls which kept 
food costs down and made urban voters happy but discouraged 
farmers because of the low return on their labor controls were 
abolished at the insistence of the world bank and international 
monetary fund 
international donors and lenders also demanded that mali 
eliminate protectionist measures and subsidies to farmers their 
message was simple no open markets no aid 
we have a longterm commitment to food aid in return for 
which we ask that the entire cereal market be freed said dennis 
brennan director of the us agency for international development 
in bamako 
with the market wide open rice from thailand and louisiana 
costs less in the timbuktu bazaar than grain grown down the road 
the little guy works like crazy to grow something pulling 
grain from soil that is poor in primitive conditions and in a 
climate that is never favorable even when there is no drought 
said giovanni fiore director of unicefs timbuktu project and an 
africa veteran 
then when the farmer produces a surplus there are no buyers 
no one in the villages has any cash and consumers in timbuktu buy 
whatever is cheapest 
it comes from europe or the united states where farmers 
receive subsidies fiore said how can a malian compete he has 
no subsidy all he has is taxes and the high cost of the pump 
gasoline oil fertilizer all of which has to be imported at 
double triple 10 times the cost to an american 
meanwhile the donors tie aid to an open market in which 
farmers from developed countries can sell their surplus so our 
farmers eat what they can store a little which will last a year 
or two and when there is another extended drought there will be 
famine

the kids go to chez vous to roller skate and 
gossip to share sodas and stories and for a safe haven from the 
gunfire of the streets 
now they also come to weep at the wall a stark memorial 
inscribed with the names of 65 teenagers who have died in recent 
years on bostons streets 
they come over and see the names of friends and relatives 
said dorcas dunham who with her husband runs the innercity roller 
skating rink theyre starting to see the reality and theyre 
crying out 
theyre seeing death in a blackandwhite list that grows longer 
every day a list that includes the names of gang members gunned 
down by their rivals and innocent kids caught in the crossfire 
the war has claimed 28 lives in boston aleady this year if the 
pace continues the wall will soon be filled no one wants to start 
another 
the memorial hangs in a corner at the 50yearold rink in the 
citys dorchester section its housed behind a reinforced door and 
around the corner from one of the citys busiest police precincts 
the teenage skaters are all frisked for weapons and agree to play 
by the rules no gum no smoking no fighting no profanity 
the rev bruce wall a minister and youth counselor tacked the 
names of four more victims to the list saturday afternoon when the 
kids came in saturday night they looked 8 feet up and noticed the 
additions 
they come in and go for their skates and start looking for 
their friends said wall who is also a juvenile court clerk 
magistrate then they stop and stare and stare 
faces go with these names its like you can almost see the 
kids remembering them their classmates and friends said john 
dunham who with his wife keeps tabs on as many as 350 teenagers 
on a busy night at the rink 
theyre overwhelmed and then they seem like broken with 
despair said dunham theyre tired of seeing friends faces on 
the evening news and hearing that another one bit the dust he 
said 
dunham said he sees it in the way the kids shoulders slump as 
they read the words scrawled across the memorial dedicated to 
those youth who died before their time 
sometimes he stands back a few feet and just watches the 
emotions and tears wash over the teenagers faces 
some of them dont even come to skate anymore they just come 
to look at the wall dunham said theyre learning about 
respecting life and that there are no second chances 
audrey moore knows there are no second chances her 11yearold 
sister tiffany is on the list tiffany was shot down by a stray 
bullet one summer day two years ago as she sat on a mailbox in her 
neighborhood 
i talk to the gang members and try to get through she said 
i know none of them want to see one of their own on the wall 
maybe this will make them stop and think 
dunham said he thinks the message is getting through he watches 
the kids leave the rink at night cutting a wide path around the 
groups that hang outside looking for trouble after closing 
he has seen fights start erupting inside the rink and has seen 
them cut short when a kid stands up and points toward the wall 
they say dont you all see that look at all our friends 
dead and then things get real quiet he said were planting 
a seed of hope here 
thats what its all about activists said the memorial is 
about dealing with death and staking a claim to life its one 
piece of a bigger effort to turn things around in these tired 
communities where people sleep on their floors to stay out of the 
line of fire at night 
the effort includes an antidrug hotline crimewatches and 
classes on civil rights for the youngers who are stopped and 
searched for arms it includes meetings and marches one of which 
was held on the walls inauguration day march 3 
the idea for the wall has a lot to do with the vietnam war 
memorial said dunham who put up the memorial with his wife and 
rev wall that was a battle and so is this even if a lot of the 
kids dont know it

two days after israels army captured east 
jerusalem in 1967 defense minister moshe dayan ordered removal of 
all barriers dividing the holy citys arab and jewish sectors 
dayans decisive action ended a division that existed since the 
jewish state was founded in 1948 
he brushed aside fears of some israeli officials that fighting 
would break out between arabs and jews recalling in his biography 
that he told them we could deal later with whatever problems may 
arise 
on tuesday 23 years later the sensitive problem of jerusalem 
was largely to blame for the collapse of israels coalition 
government in a dispute between prime minister yitzhak shamirs 
likud bloc and the centerleft labor party 
labor accepted us proposals to include east jerusalem arabs in 
a palestinian delegation to peace talks with israel likud was 
opposed fearing israels control of all jerusalem could be called 
into question 
the dispute reached a crisis when shamir hardened his stance 
after a comment by president bush equating the jewish suburbs 
around jerusalem with settlements in the occupied west bank 
i hear the voices coming today from washington on the issue of 
jerusalem things that enrage every jew in israel and i have to 
react the 74yearold shamir angrily declared 
bush had said nothing to change american policy which has never 
recognized the annexation of the arab sector into israels 
eternal undivided capital after the land was seized from 
jordan in the 1967 war 
but the american president reignited an issue that is the most 
emotional one of the entire israelipalestinian conflict jerusalem 
is a city holy to both jews and moslems 
for jews it is at the heart of israels very existence the 
site of king solomons ancient temple the symbol of gods promise 
to return the jews from exile 
while many israelis can accept trading the west bank and gaza 
strip for peace few are willing to give up any part of jerusalem 
even those who are not deeply religious think of the city as theirs 
in the hilltop fortresslike suburb of gilo that israel has 
built on captured territory south of the city laborer menachem 
bentlulia was asked his views of living on occupied land 
i dont understand all this politics said bentlulia who 
immigrated six years ago from morocco i feel like i live in the 
city of jerusalem our city all of it 
in east talpiot another suburb once in arab territory shlomo 
einstein complained about bush comparing parts of jerusalem to the 
settlements where jews live among the 17 million palestinians of 
the west bank and gaza 
i dont feel like i live in a settlement said the 
56yearold psychologist areas outside jerusalem are 
settlements 
gilo and east talpiot are among seven neighborhoods built by 
israel on 18000 acres of arab land it annexed 
on tuesday housing minister david levy a likud member laid 
the cornerstone for a new development to house 3500 israelis 
the hebrew daily haaretz wrote that building of the jewish 
suburbs was based on a policy intended to emphasize the constant 
israeli presence in all areas within the boundaries of jerusalems 
jurisdiction 
now 120000 of jerusalems 340000 jewish residents live in 
these suburbs virtually surrounding the citys 140000 palestinian 
residents 
for palestinians jerusalem also is a religious and political 
heritage 
the dome of the rock mosque built in the 7th century stands on 
the spot where moslems believe mohammed ascended to heaven for 
palestinian christians the city is a living reminder of jesus 
crucifixion and resurrection 
the leading palestinian families the husseinis the 
nashashibis the nusseibehs have lived in jerusalem for 
centuries the plos parliamentinexile founded in east jerusalem 
in 1964 declared two years ago that the city was the capital of 
its wouldbe palestinian state 
sari nusseibeh a palestinian professor of philosphy echoes 
israeli politicians when he says the question of jerusalem is not 
subject to negotiations 
east jerusalem is the capital of the occupied palestinian 
state nusseibeh said the unilateral action of israel having 
annexed it does not change the historical facts and the political 
facts 
housing minister levy was just as determined when he inaugurated 
the new jewish suburb tuesday in east jerusalem building 
determines our future here he said this is our united 
capital jerusalem is the heart of every jew eternally 
for most of the past 23 years the arabisraeli dispute over 
jerusalem remained largely beneath the surface but it burst forth 
at the start of the palestinian uprising 27 months ago 
east jerusalems palestinians joined those in the occupied lands 
in resisting israeli rule in the first year of the revolt police 
found 1229 illegal palestinian flags flying in jerusalem the 
slayings of four israelis and six palestinians in the city have 
been linked to the uprising

a bill to compensate poisoned uranium 
miners brought a day of hope to longneglected workers who 
provided the raw material for americans burgeoning nuclear 
programs former us interior secretary stewart udall said tuesday 
udall spoke at a hearing on a bill cosponsored by sen pete 
domenici rnm to establish a 100 million trust fund for the 
workers many of them navajo indians who worked uranium mines in 
new mexico arizona colorado and utah between 1947 and 1971 
i support compensation for the uranium miners both indian and 
nonindian because of the service they performed for our nation 
domenici said in the course of that service a number of them 
suffered from very very serious diseases it is time that we 
recognize that fact and set to work righting the wrong that began 
more than 40 years ago 
he said 250 to 350 uranium miners or their beneficiaries would 
receive compensation under the bill which would provide 100000 
awards to miners suffering lung cancer and other diseases 
for more than 20 years according to testimony the miners dug 
uranium ore without warnings from their employers or the 
government they breathed radioactive dust ate their lunches deep 
in the mineshafts and even drank contaminated mine water 
the bill also would compensate with 50000 each residents of 
nevada and utah who can prove they were exposed to radiation 
fallout from nuclear testing 
the bill in a small way will make up for the mistakes made in 
the early days in the uranium mines domenici said we could 
never replace the ones that died or those who are ill but this is 
a giant step 
udall who once sued the government on behalf of injured miners 
said the governments treatment of the navajos was especially 
grievous the government not only didnt warn them it was 
flagrant malpractice to do what they did udall said 
he said the hearing of the senate subcommittee on mineral 
resources development and production before 600 people at a high 
school gym brought a day of hope to the navajo community 
navajo interim chairman leonard haskie said the public health 
service conducted a study in 1949 of radiation and knew then the 
dangers to the miners in order to proceed with its study phs 
decided not to tell miners of the hazards for fear that many miners 
would quit which would interrupt the production of uranium 
haskie said families continue to be exposed because many mines 
are still open children play in them 
susan dawson assistant sociology professor at utah state 
university said miners were never informed of the dangers or their 
rights under state workers compensation laws when they became ill 
one navajo foreman said mine owners told him not to tell the 
workers about the dangers of radiation she said

at twilight in a blacktop parking 
lot jeffrey dryfka fell dead with a 25caliber bullet through the 
back so ended seven years of hell the title of his unfinished 
journal 
through dryfkas writings telephone records and tales from the 
back streets of south florida police pieced together a bizarre 
tale of obsession in which dryfka was allegedly stalked by a former 
homosexual lover the man had boasted the hunt would end in death 
authorities said 
this guy said he would not rest until jeff dryfka was dead 
said detective john donadio if he couldnt have him no one 
could its much weirder than the movie fatal attraction because 
its true 
last week a grand jury indicted james charles barfield 47 for 
firstdegree murder in the feb 17 slaying prosecutors will seek 
the death penalty 
the poor victim was hounded said broward state attorney 
brian cavanagh 
the story of dryfka 26 and barfield which began with small 
talk on a park bench illuminates a shadowy side of south florida 
each night young runaways prostitutes and junkies and those who 
prey off their weaknesses bargain and barter away under the 
bugencircled street lamps 
this is a good lesson of how someone can get caught up in the 
sick side of society without even knowing it at first donadio 
said 
the beginning of dryfkas journal describes how at 18 years old 
he was sent from the home of his mother and stepfather in san diego 
to his fathers apartment in west palm beach 
i had the perfect life he wrote of san diego i had a 
pool in the backyard a skateboard friends and girlfriends 
but in florida he was lonely his father worked at sea for a 
salvage company dryfka began hanging out at a park where he could 
buy marijuana 
he befriended barfield a chainsmoking man with a limp who 
lived off welfare and disability checks and over the strong 
objections of his family soon moved in with him 
barfield spent 16 years in prison for convictions including 
sodomizing a 13yearold boy at gunpoint said donadio 
from 1982 to 1989 dryfka exchanged sex for housing and money 
some of which was spent on cocaine and marijuana police say dryfka 
tried for years to leave but each time barfield would find him and 
persuade him to return 
on sept 18 dryfka moved out for good he told barfield he was 
moving back to san diego but remained in florida dyed his hair 
blond painted his pickup truck black and began dating a woman 
barfield took a bus to san diego and discovered dryfka was not 
there he then began a string of threatening telephone calls to 
dryfkas family making at least 150 calls to dryfkas mother from 
september to january donadio said barfield sometimes demanded 
money 
hed say stuff like you want to see your next birthday 
said donadio then hed laugh he has this charlie mansontype 
laugh this guy is totally wacko 
during the hunt barfield posed as a police officer a banker 
and other officials authorities said knowing dryfkas social 
security number credit cards and date of birth helped persuade 
others to give out information 
the break came feb 3 when barfield contacted palm beach county 
probation officials who were monitoring dryfka after he violated 
probation on cocaine possession charges they told him dryfka 
turned in an ankle bracelet thats used for tracking violators 
ordered confined to their homes 
dryfka knew barfield was getting close on feb 15 the day he 
had gotten engaged a car sped by and the driver shouted at him 
he knew that was barfield said donadio his girlfriend 
who was very naive about the whole thing was traumatized to say 
the least 
the next day dryfka told his landlord he wanted his fiancee to 
have all his possessions if he was killed 
police say barfield took a cab to an airconditioning repair 
company where dryfka worked and let the air out of a tire on 
dryfkas truck dryfka drove about a halfblock before realizing 
the tire was flat when he got out he was shot in the back 
dryfkas father has since moved to west virginia his fiancee 
now lives somewhere in the northeast police said 
so many lives messed up by this one guy said donadio im 
sure this was the farthest thing from jeffreys mind that first day 
he met barfield 
the subtitle of dryfkas journal i have my own life too

polands borders are again an issue in 
european politics as they have been during peace and war for more 
than 300 years 
this time poland is wary that a united germany will want to 
change frontiers established after the german defeat in world war 
ii and reopen the polish question that has vexed european 
diplomacy for centuries 
in 1688 poland stretched from the baltic sea almost to the 
black sea and its territory encompassed much of what is now the 
ukraine and byelorussia 
a century later a united poland and lithuania came under 
pressure from russia austria and prussia and was systematically 
dismembered in three stages between 1772 and 1795 when poland 
ceased to exist 
the country was not established again until 1919 
the traditional fragility of polands borders and the need to 
guarantee them was behind prime minister tadeusz mazowieckis 
determined campaign to win a place at talks on german reunification 
in the 20th century europe has been reshaped three times around 
poland after world war i in the secret 1939 ribbentropmolotov 
pact and in 1945 at meetings of the victorious allies in yalta and 
potsdam 
through it all poles have endured borders that were seldom of 
their own choosing and have become obsessed with the issue 
people who live on islands or on half continents of their 
own find difficulty in comprehending the territorial obsessions of 
landlocked nations historian norman davies wrote of poland in 
gods playground a history of poland 
never having faced the prospect of ceding kent to germany or 
california to the ussr they tend to look with quizzical 
unconcern if not contempt on those who would lay down their lives 
for an inch of ground or for a dotted line on a map 
after russia prussia and austria erased poland in 1795 poles 
kept alive dreams for their own state their chance came in 1919 
after the world war i collapse of the three partioning powers the 
separated parts of poland united to establish their own government 
president woodrow wilson of the united states had made an 
independent and autonomous poland with free unrestricted access 
to the sea one of his fourteen points in the postwar settlement 
through a combination of negotiations plebiscites and military 
actions that lasted until 1922 and managed to alienate all its 
neighbors poland carved out a saddleshaped territory with a 
narrow corridor to the baltic dividing the main body of germany 
from east prussia 
the oddly contoured country bordered romania in the extreme 
southeast and included vilnius the heavily polishpopulated city 
in lithuania 
though shrunken poland was roughly similar in outline to the 
poland that existed in 1772 
the reestablishment of an independent state caused bitterness 
in germany and the soviet union 
the main irritant was the socalled polish corridor to the 
baltic guaranteed by the victorious world war i powers at 
versailles it made the german city of danzig now gdansk at the 
mouth of the vistula river into a free city under protection of 
the league of nations with poland and germany sharing some 
administrative responsibilities 
the german government of the 1920s and adolf hitlers regime of 
the 1930s agitated to get danzig and to recover its historic 
lands in the corridor 
after incorporating austria in 1938 and czechoslovakia in early 
1939 danzig and the polish corridor became hitlers target 
the green light to invade came on aug 23 1939 when foreign 
minister joachim von ribbentrop of germany and foreign minister 
vychaleslav molotov of the soviet union signed a secret pact 
splitting poland between them nine days later hitler launched the 
invasion of poland that began world war ii 
the soviets occupied the countrys eastern half on sept 17 
the polish state again vanished and the peaceful border between 
germany and the soviet union lasted until june 22 1941 when 
hitler invaded the soviet union 
at an allied conferences at yalta and potsdam in 1945 stalin 
insisted on keeping most of the territory he had gained in eastern 
poland in 1939 in all the soviet union claimed 46 percent of 
prewar poland or 71288 square miles 
to compensate poland the allies approved the transfer to the 
sovietdominated polish government of 40480 square miles of 
formerly german territory 
although poland was technically on the winning side of the war 
it lost about onefifth of its territory and came under control of 
a sovietassembled government and the red army 
communist domination lasted until 1989 when the solidarity 
movement forced partially free elections that brought mazowiecki to 
office 
because no formal peace treaty establishing the western frontier 
was ever signed the status of the polishgerman border on the oder 
and neisse rivers described in the aug 2 1945 potsdam agreement 
has remained somewhat nebulous the potsdam agreement itself said 
the oderneisse line was to exist only pending the final 
determination of polands western frontiers 
meanwhile millions of ethnic germans fled or were expelled 
while poles from the sovietannexed eastern territories flooded in 
formerly german cities like stettin and breslau were renamed 
szczecin and wroclaw 
east germany under stalinist control recognized the polish 
border in 1950 west germany in a treaty signed by thenchancellor 
willi brandt recognized it in 1970 
but kohl apparently concerned about political supporters who do 
not want to renounce claims to the area has hestitated to commit a 
reunited germany to the oderneisse line he has said it is a 
matter for a freely elected government that unites east and west 
germany

the fall fashion message from london is short 
sporty by day and slinky by night with flashes of british wit and 
individuality 
the mood among designers however is uncertain 
top designers katherine hamnett and john galliano skipped london 
to show in paris two other big names rifat ozbek and jaspar 
conran opted for videos instead of catwalk shows and fewer buyers 
stopped off in london en route from milan to paris 
nonetheless there was still some of that old wacky madness that 
put london on the fashion map 
vivienne westwood the mother of punk garb captivated the 
audience with a collection ranging from classic tailored tartan 
suits to fake furtrimmed bloomers worn with old masterprint 
corsets 
a lycraclad dancing troupe dressed as haute couture pigs opened 
the show based on barnyard characters of country life bodymap did 
a vision of dragqueen club life in their sexy sportswear 
collection 
britains designers of the year workers for freedom duo richard 
nott and graham fraser showed a collection nott described as 
spare feminity which featured bikinis over striped body suits 
one of the key fall looks from london 
london fashion week which ends tuesday has spread out even 
further with designers showing all over town and the trade show 
featuring about 250 exhibitors at the olympia 2 exhibition hall 
at olympia accessories from hats to bracelets seemed hotter 
than clothes 
i think largely because of high interest rates and the high 
cost of living women cant afford to buy another outfit so 
theyre buying accessories said beverley mann 28 one of the 
design duo of the costume jewelry firm flash harry 
melanie lazlo of obsession another costume jewelry firm said

last weeks attempt to topple 
president najib has brought the sovietsupported leader to his 
lowest point since he was installed in 1986 
but despite his setback and a brush with death when bombs fell 
12 feet from his office najib seems unlikely to fall 
in thwarting the coup attempt by defense minister shaw nawaz 
tanai najib once again demonstrated his ability to juggle 
allegiances within the party and come out on top no other leader 
has yet emerged or been permitted to emerge with a following 
that rivals najibs 
he has also made an effort to expand his predominantly urban 
base to the countryside najib has made overtures to minorities 
such as various ethnic groups and the shia moslems who make up 18 
percent of predominantly sunni moslem afghanistan 
there is likely to be even more disunity and bloodshed following 
the attempt to overthrow him 
about 15 million afghans already have died in the 12yearold 
civil war which saw nine years of direct soviet intervention 
three coups and numerous purges efforts to end the war between the 
government and usbacked moslem guerrillas are expected to take a 
back seat as najib tries to consolidate his own position 
faced with questionable loyalty in the armed forces najib is 
expected to turn to tribal militia leaders for military support 
foreign diplomats and afghan officials say 
in exchange the tribal leaders will undoubtedly demand more 
autonomy from the central government 
we expect the already high level of lawlessness in the 
countryside to rise one foreign diplomat said speaking on 
condition he not be identified further 
even if the military regains najibs trust its firepower and 
manpower have been weakened diplomats estimate that 10 fighter 
jets and numerous other military aircraft were lost during the 
mutineers bombardment of kabul and the governments retaliation 
bagram air base a major center of the coup plot was virtually 
destroyed according to most assessments in addition hundreds of 
highranking officers and elite commandos are believed to have been 
killed on both sides 
sultan ali keshtmand who as chairman of the council of 
ministers is the countrys de facto prime minister met the heads 
of foreign diplomatic missions in kabul on saturday and pleaded for 
aid 
we have been severely weakened by the coup a senior asian 
diplomat quoted keshtmand as saying keshtmand requested food 
medicine and greater political support the diplomat said 
najibs position also has been hurt within his own peoples 
democratic party of afghanistan which is split between najibs 
parcham or flag faction and the more hawkish khalq or 
masses faction 
tanai who led the march 6 coup attempt was a prominent khalqi 
and najib apparently was forced to make concessions to other 
khalqis in exchange for their support during the coup attempt 
the diplomats all speaking on condition of anonymity said this 
was illustrated by the presidents subsequent cabinet reshuffle 
najib purged tanai and at least four other top khalqis from the 
party after the attempted coup but he promoted two others lt 
gen mohammad aslam watanjar and raz mohammad pakteen both 
watanjar and pakteen could ultimately prove troublesome because 
they are thought to have little loyalty to najib 
watanjar the former interior minister succeeded tanai as 
defense minister watanjar persuaded most of the armys 15th 
armored division which he once commanded to abandon its initial 
support for tanai eastern european diplomats and two afghan 
government sources said 
pakteen was given watanjars old job in the interior ministry 
which is responsible for the countrys intelligence agencies he 
appears to be largely a figurehead the diplomats said najib 
former head of the dreaded khad secret police actually controls 
the ministry they added 
the failed coup also exacerbated the already bitter splits among 
the mujahedeen or islamic holy warriors who have been trying to 
oust najib and his predecessors since shortly after the party 
grabbed power in a 1978 coup 
extreme fundamentalist gulbuddin hekmatyar embraced the coup 
and his people now are trying to strike deals with tanai according 
diplomatic sources in kabul and in neighboring pakistan where the 
mujahedeen are based 
but other mujahedeen groups including some of the staunchest 
fundamentalists have distanced themselves from the coup saying 
they find no difference between najib and tanai 
an eastern european diplomat in kabul said there was a 
possibility tanai might be persuaded to take command of the 
stalemated mujahedeen offensive against khost his home turf 
if tanai a gifted military tactician succeeds in taking khost 
it would give the antinajib forces an important staging area for 
attacks deeper into afghanistan and closer to kabul 
we could see afghanistan carved up more than it already is 
the eastern european diplomat said 
still none of the diplomats and military experts interviewed in 
kabul said he thought the rebels were capable of toppling najib 
the stalemate will continue one of the military experts 
said it will just get bloodier

leaning out the window of a pickup doing 
35 mph its siren whooping jack burton aimed his shotgun and fired 
a blank that exploded near a galloping moose framed in the 
headlights 20 yards ahead 
shes moved over burton yelled lets get ahead of her 
highballing through the moonlit susitna valley in a oneton 
pickup equipped to ride the rails burton and ken hightower were on 
night moose patrol for the alaska railroad 
they were shooing moose from the rails on the 
anchoragetofairbanks run where 603 of the lumbering animals have 
been killed so far this winter more than twice the winter 
average the reason the deepest snow in 25 years 
the moose are hungry and worn out from staggering for food 
through snow deeper than their legs are long when one of the 
animals stumbles across the plowed railroad tracks where the 
walking is easy it tends to remain until the moose patrol scares 
it off or a train runs it down 
they can handle any other situation probably but they dont 
do too well against the iron horse said bill collins a state 
wildlife biologist 
many of the moose are killed after dark when they come out to 
feed 
the railroad has been trying for five years to find a way to 
stop killing moose this year the effort has cost 337000 in 
expenses and train delays spokeswoman vivian hamilton said 
the number of moose killed by the railroad may not seem like 
much out of a local population of 15000 but every animal counts 
collins said he expects 90 percent of the calves born last fall to 
die before the heavy snows melt 
state wildlife officials and volunteers have begun putting out 
hay for the moose even though the animals have trouble digesting 
it 
by feeding them they are trying to keep them from wandering 
back and forth across the highway and the railroad collins said 
once you start feeding them they tend to stay put 
leaving a shed burton and hightower headed toward eklutna then 
left the highway and drove over squeaky snow through the tanaina 
indian village of 50 people with its russian orthodox church of 
logs and handhewn onion domes 
at milepost 142 they jockeyed the pickup onto the rails and 
jacked in the steel dollies that let it run like a train burton 
loaded a shotgun with kracker shells blanks that explode with 
a small flame but have no shot 
on the citizens band radio an engineer reported his freight 
train had gone by milepost 139 
roger that were at 142 and rolling at 35 burton answered 
matching the speed of the train 
several miles later the eyes of a moose reflected the spotlight 
long before its huge brown bulk materialized out of the darkness 
when the moose saw the pickup it ran loping along the middle of 
the tracks rather than going into the deep snow to let it pass 
normally they will fight or flee collins said if they 
fight they are in trouble if they flee they are still in trouble 
thats where burtons version of the squeeze play comes in 
with hightower at the wheel and burton riding shotgun the 
pickup followed the moose finally the animal strayed and hightower 
gunned the engine slowly passing it 
ahead was a railroad bridge where hightower parked the truck to 
block the moose from trying to cross if it got on the bridge the 
moose would fall between the ties breaking its legs or pitching 
head first into the creek to drown 
were stopped at the bridge burton radioed to the freight 
minutes later the freight approached and slowed to a stop the 
engine headlight and numbers shining 
caught in a squeeze between the train and the truck the moose 
tossed its head and reluctantly walked down a trail cut through the 
8foothigh snow berm by volunteers from a snowmachine club 
good moose hightower said

lithuanias declaration of independence from 
the soviet union poses the most serious threat in 70 years to the 
unity of the communist state but leaves the united states able to 
offer little but the most muted applause 
the fear too much encouragement to tiny lithuania could provoke 
a soviet crackdown do serious damage to president mikhail s 
gorbachevs program of economic and political reform and even 
weaken his tenacious grasp on power 
and since there is little the united states could do to affect 
the outcome in lithuania and in other independenceminded soviet 
republics there might be real danger in trying 
secretary of state james a baker iii set the tone for us 
policy in capitol hill testimony last week saying that the united 
states ought not to gloat too much over our success 
it is not overly productive to stick a stick in their eye just 
for the hell of it baker said 
the fear is that the unraveling of the soviet union is not 
necessarily a success for us said ilya prizel professor of 
soviet studies at the paul h nitze school of advanced 
international studies at johns hopkins university 
if it ends up in a civil war how do you deal with a civil war 
in a superpower that sits on thousands and thousands of nuclear 
weapons prizel asked 
the administrations careful litany on lithuania as delivered 
by the white house and state department on monday goes like this 
the united states recognized the independence of lithuania and 
two other baltic states in 1922 after the victors in world war i 
carved them out of the fallen russian empire 
that diplomatic recognition has never been withdrawn 
the united states never accepted the secret nonaggression 1940 
deal between germanys adolf hitler and soviet leader joseph stalin 
folding lithuania latvia and estonia into the soviet empire 
it still regards their transformation into soviet republics as 
illegal 
but in the last analysis washington is prepared to recognize 
lithuania diplomatically and exchange ambassadors with it only if 
negotiations with moscow give it the attributes of a nationstate 
we would want any recognition to take into account a final 
government that was in control of its own destiny and much of that 
has yet to be negotiated with the soviet union said white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater 
diplomatic recognition would follow once that government is in 
effective control of its territory and capable of entering into and 
fulfilling international obligations said state department 
spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
i think its a prudent and correct policy prizel said we 
cannot jump in ahead of the soviet union we should understand that 
we can provoke the soviets but we cannot deter them 
do you want to encourage the lithuanians to a point where the 
russians crack down then what do you do he asked you might 
bring a terrible fate down upon them 
prizels conclusion i think the best thing to do is to lie as 
low as we can and let the situation evolve in a way that moscow 
does not find provocative 
its one thing for a soviet leader to get rid of the outer 
empire in eastern europe he said but its quite a different 
thing to preside over the disintegration of the soviet union 
but others believe that granting independence to lithuania and 
the other baltic states is unlikely to lead to such a drastic 
result 
stasys lozoraitis jr acting chief of the lithuanian legation 
here which has been maintained with us cooperation for the last 
halfcentury says he believes moscow will erect barriers to full 
independence but will ultimately agree 
rozanne l ridgway former assistant secretary of state for 
european affairs said on public televisions macneillehrer 
newshour that she believes the soviets will eventually see the 
wisdom of granting lithuania independence 
if gorbachev does not paint himself into a corner by using the 
wrong words she said i think in the end you will see an 
independent lithuania

up to 360000 truckers could lose their 
driving privileges if states dont step up their plans to comply 
with a new federal commercial drivers license law congressional 
investigators say 
the general accounting office said monday that 33 states may not 
comply with a federal law that requires truck drivers to take tests 
and obtain federally approved commercial drivers licenses by april 
1 1992 the law aims to get unsafe drivers off the road by 
requiring them all to meet national standards 
however the federal highway administration official overseeing 
the program said the states are doing a terrific job and that 
all plan to meet the deadline 
a quirk in the law gives states until october 1993 to establish 
testing and licensing programs but the shorter deadline for 
drivers to have the licenses makes it necessary to set up programs 
18 months earlier 
the commercial drivers license law was prompted by the 4500 
annual highway fatalities involving large trucks trucks account 
for 45 percent of the traffic and 10 percent of the fatalities 
nationwide 
before congress passed the law several states required only 
ordinary drivers licenses for truckers and others had inconsistent 
requirements leading some drivers to go shopping for lenient 
states 
the gao study which assesses conditions as of october 1989 when 
states were surveyed said 13 states indicated they cannot meet the 
april 1992 deadline 
an additional 20 states plan to test and license between 
onefourth and onehalf of their drivers in the final three months 
before the deadline which the study said probably is impossible 
jill hochman chief of the highway agencys standards review 
division said seven states already are issuing the new commercial 
drivers licenses they are arizona california maryland new 
hampshire utah virginia and washington michigan started but 
temporarily suspended its program because of a computer problem 
she said 
twentyseven other states plan to issue licenses before the end 
of the year ms hochman said and 10 states have not yet passed 
commercial drivers license laws 
ms hochman said a limitation in the gao report is that 
conditions in a state can look different depending on which 
official answers the survey 
the states have been making terrific progress she said 
nobody said its going to be easy but they all plan to meet the 
deadline and im certainly not going to challenge their plans 
most states plan to test and license all of their drivers over a 
twoyear period rather than the four years permitted in the 
legislation that implemented the law the gao study said 
gao also said most states are having problems in making changes 
in their drivers license computer systems so they can hook into a 
national databank of information on all drivers 
ms hochman said the federal highway administration has been 
working with states to help them set up the computer system 
gao researcher ron wood said the 13 states that indicated they 
could not meet the april 1992 deadline for all truckers to be 
licensed are arizona hawaii michigan minnesota mississippi 
nevada new jersey oklahoma wyoming rhode island kentucky 
wisconsin and massachusetts 
wood said the 20 states that plan to issue an unusually large 
share of licenses in the final three months before the deadline 
are california oregon illinois florida iowa alabama alaska 
indiana kansas missouri montana nebraska new hampshire new 
mexico ohio pennsylvania south carolina tennessee utah and 
vermont 
the 10 states that have not yet passed commercial drivers 
license laws according to the highway administration are alaska 
iowa kentucky massachusetts new jersey oklahoma pennsylvania 
rhode island vermont and new york the district of columbia also 
has yet to pass such a law

the bush administration says it stands ready 
to help a provisional government bring democracy to haiti after 
hastening the departure of a deposed ruler for the second time in 
four years 
lt gen prosper avril flew out of homestead air force base near 
miami for an undisclosed refuge on monday barely seven hours after 
a us air force c141 transport plane evacuated avril and his 
family from portauprince 
with maj gen herard abraham the army chief of staff expected 
to turn authority over today to a civilian provisional president 
the administration urged all haitians to work together in a 
spirit of reconciliation to achieve free elections and respect 
for human rights as rapidly as possible 
the united states shares these goals and is prepared to help 
the provisional government bring democracy to haiti state 
department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said 
a week of bloodshed that left at least 24 dead in the streets of 
haiti brought an end to avrils 18month rule in the western 
hemispheres poorest nation 
administration officials said avrils downfall came after he 
staged a crackdown in january that led to the arrest of some 
opposition leaders and forced others into exile 
this was just a tremendous error on avrils part all of 
haitian society became galvanized against him said an 
administration source who asked not to be identified he just 
became more and more isolated 
the white house said avril requested us help in leaving haiti 
during a weekend meeting with us ambassador alvin p adams 
we had discussions with him about the transition there 
was a feeling of some obligation to help him leave and facilitate a 
peaceful transition said white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
he said avril was granted only a temporary sanctuary here 
an air force spokesman said avril left homestead by personally 
arranged transportation but provided no other details 
in february 1986 the united states dispatched another air force 
jet to carry jeanclaude baby doc duvalier into exile in 
france ending 29 years of dictatorship under the duvaliers father 
and son 
avril 52 chief of the presidential guard and a former duvalier 
adviser declared himself president in september 1988 he foiled a 
reported coup attempt last april and declared the state of siege 
jan 20 after the mysterious slaying of an army colonel 
we are hopeful for a smooth transition to democracy in haiti 
and are encouraging that effort fitzwater said 
haitians are scheduled to vote in local elections in april and 
in presidential elections in october and november 
the united states is providing 414 million in humanitarian and 
development assistance to haiti through private voluntary and 
nongovernmental agencies 
it cut off 78 million in direct aid after the massacre of 34 
voters in aborted elections nov 29 1987 the united states did 
provide 10 million in emergency food assistance to the 
portauprince government last year 
fitzwater said the united states would have to see tangible 
evidence of progress and a transition to democracy and to respect 
for human rights before direct aid is resumed

decaying rural communities could look to a new 
government office within the agriculture department for development 
help if a bill up for a house vote this week becomes law 
the measure would create a rural development administration for 
programs currently carried out by the farmers home administration 
such as water and sewer business and industry and loan and grant 
programs for community facilities 
money now placed in three funds for each of those categories 
could be pooled for one purpose based on community needs 
for example if the big need were improved water and sewer 
facilities all the money could go for that if the community had 
adequate public works the funds could be used to lure business and 
industry 
rep glenn english dokla who coauthored the bill with rep 
tom coleman rmo said the idea is to give communities more power 
and flexibility with existing federal money 
the bill is scheduled for a floor vote wednesday the senate 
passed a significantly different rural development bill last summer 
lawmakers believe some kind of development bill is needed to 
save communities that are losing jobs and population because of the 
decreasing number of farms around the country 
under the house bill rural communities would have to prepare 
local or regional economic plans that would be submitted to a state 
review panel in order to get development money 
the bill doesnt say exactly who should prepare the plans but 
it calls for participation by local government business 
industrial financial transportation utility labor agriculture 
and educational institutions 
the state review panel would then rank the applications for 
projects with special priority required for declared health 
emergencies 
each state would get a grant of up to 100000 to pay the costs 
of the review panel 
the bill also establishes a technical assistance unit within the 
rural electrification administration that would allow borrowers to 
defer payment on certain loans for up to 10 years if the loan is 
invested in rural development projects 
other key provisions include 
action teams to help communities dependent on forestry to 
diversify 
a rural development informationgathering and dissemination 
center to help communities exchange ideas for successful projects 
50 million in each of the fiscal years 1991 through 1993 for 
competitive grants to nonprofit institutions that establish 
centers for rural technology or development 
more help from the agricultural extension service for business 
development 
grants from the cooperative state research service for research 
on nonfood uses of agricultural commodities 
the bush administration objects to several provisions in the 
bill including the forest community action teams the 
deferring of rea loans and the establishment of state review 
panels which it says encroaches on the presidents authority to 
decide how federal development money should be spent

animal rights activists who attack farms and 
research labs to set animals free would be breaking federal law if 
a bill being considered by the house agriculture committee is 
enacted 
were talking about terrorism against farmers rep charles 
stenholm dtexas said during a recent hearing 
stenholm introduced a bill called the farm animal and research 
facilities protection act last fall that has wide support in the 
house 
it sets penalties of up to three years in jail and 10000 in 
fines for anyone who damages or disrupts an enterprise involving 
animals 
the bush administrations office of science and technology 
policy says a federal law is needed because the research involving 
use of animals is of immense value to the welfare of the citizens 
of this country and the federal government must ensure that the 
environment in which research is conducted and the persons 
pursuing such research are free from threats of violence 
intimidation and debilitating distractions 
paul maloney of the justice department however said state laws 
are sufficient for prosecuting the crimes committed by activists 
who break into labs or farms to set animals free 
in testimony before a house agriculture subcommittee local law 
enforcement officers said a federal law is needed to make sure the 
fbi uses its resources and authority to go after the groups that 
operate nationally

president bushs defense budget is an 
excessively cautious and inordinately expensive response to the 
rapidly diminishing soviet threat a bipartisan group of us 
military experts said today 
the administrations fiscal 1991 budget calls for fullscale 
strategic modernization with procurement of the b2 stealth bomber 
two landbased nuclear missile systems and the strategic defense 
initiative 
but the disintegration of the warsaw pact requires a 
restructuring of the us military starting with a reasonable goal 
of a 50 percent reduction in defense spending by the year 2000 the 
group said in a 27page report 
changes in the world must be reflected in the defense budget 
and us national security can be supported with a steady 
sustained decrease in defense budgets over the next 10 years the 
report said 
the panel headed by lawrence j korb a former assistant 
secretary of defense in the reagan administration recommended 
halting production of the b2 bomber at 15 planes canceling plans 
to move the multiplewarhead mx from fixed silos to railroad cars 
and limiting spending on sdi to no more than 3 billion a year 
in its report restructuring the us military defense needs 
in the 21st century the panel also proposed that the united 
states seek a ban on multiplewarhead intercontinental ballistic 
missiles stop the purchase of trident submarines at 17 and cancel 
production of the c17 cargo plane 
the panel suggested cutting active forces army divisions from 18 
to 10 reducing the navys carrier battle groups from 14 to nine 
and halving the air forces active tactical air wings from 24 to 12 
it said the number of troops us stationed in europe should be 
cut from the current 305000 to about 100000 
bushs 292 billion defense budget for the fiscal year beginning 
oct 1 calls for a nearly 1 billion increase in spending on sdi 
55 billion for the b2 bomber and more than 3 billion on the mx 
and singlewarhead midgetman missiles 
defense secretary dick cheney has said no major cuts in spending

ussoviet arms control treaties are completed 
a good deal of prudence is in order cheney told congress 
last month

slight reductions in defense programs and budgets over the next 
five years reflect an excessively cautious and inordinately 
excessive response to the changing security environment

annually for a 50 percent cut in the next decade the current 
budget is a 2 percent reduction from last year after adjusting for 
inflation

a kgb defector who recently surfaced after a 
decade in hiding was a technician with no access to serious 
secret information a soviet official says 
nevertheless sergey b chetverikov ministercounselor at the 
soviet embassy said monday that he had lodged a strong protest 
about the case of victor i sheymov at a meeting with deputy 
secretary of state lawrence eagleburger 
chetverikov said the involvement of us intelligence in 
smuggling sheymov his wife and his 5yearold daughter out of the 
soviet union in 1980 was a gross violation of rules of 
international law which is in fact an act of state terrorism 
the state department had no immediate comment on the case 
at a news conference chetverikov confirmed that sheymov 43 
did indeed work at some point within the system of the committee 
for state security the full name of the kgb 
he said sheymov graduated from bauman technical school in moscow 
as a mechanical engineer and was employed by the kgb as a coding 
equipment maintenance technician 
his responsibilities however allowed him no access to 
serious secret information including documents the official 
added 
chetverikov also complained about some of the allegations that 
sheymov made at a news conference march 2 
sheymov said he was present in the warsaw station of the kgb in 
1979 when a cable arrived from moscow ordering what he believed to 
be the initial stages of a plot to assassinate pope john paul ii 
totally untenable and malicious from beginning to end is his 
assertion about the committee for state securitys involvement in 
the affair relating to the attempt on pope john paul iis life 
chetverikov said 
he said cia officials knew very well that the kgb had not and 
could not have anything to do with this heinous crime 
allegations have long circulated about possible soviet 
involvement in a plot to kill the pope after he was wounded by a 
turkish gunman in 1981 no connection with moscow has ever been 
firmly established however 
chetverikov also said hints about the kgbs involvement in 
organizing the attempt on the late president zia ul haq of pakistan 
can also be described as wild fiction zia was killed when his 
plane blew up in 1988 
sheymov also said in the late 1970s the soviet union had two 
sources inside the state department able to deliver secret 
information on us policy and negotiating positions the 
department has refused to comment on that assertion 
chetverikov accused us intelligence of promoting sheymov to 
undermine improved relations between the soviet union and the 
united states 
those who brought sheymov to the united states were directly 
involved in the attempts to call attention to the sheymov story 
through mass media in an apparent pursuit of the objectives which 
run counter to the dynamic process of normalization of ussoviet 
relations emerging during the years of perestroika 
restructuring he said 
sheymov said at his news conference that he was looking for a 
publisher for a book he has written 
despite the protest chetverikov said he doubted moscow would 
retaliate in any way against the united states i guess we are 
beyond that stage he said 
the soviet official also said he did not know where sheymov 
lived or what charges he would face in the soviet union if he ever 
returned sheymov has become a us citizen since his defection a 
decade ago

the government wants airlines flying the dc10 
to make some changes in the planes hydraulic system to avoid the 
kind of crash that killed 112 people in iowa last year 
the federal aviation administration on monday tentatively issued 
an airworthiness directive requiring modifications that the 
agency said would enable pilots to steer the plane even if 
hydraulic lines are severed in the planes tail section 
the order which becomes final after a period for several weeks 
for public comment resulted from the july 19 1989 crash of a 
united airlines dc10 at the sioux city iowa airport where it was 
making an emergency landing with 295 people aboard 
investigation into the crash continues but pilots said they 
lost hydraulic steering control after the planes tail engine 
exploded 
the faa order follows changes recommended in the airliner by its 
manufacturer mcdonnell douglas corp 
the change would preserve enough hydraulic fluid following 
damage to the system to enable the flight crew to safely fly and 
land the airplane the faa said airlines would have six months 
to make the modifications in the 10series of dc10s and a year for 
all other dc10 models 
investigators into the iowa crash have said they believe flying 
debris from the explosive tail engine failure severed all three of 
the jetliners independent hydraulic systems that control flight 
the faaordered modification would require devices in the 
hydraulic system to keep fluid from leaking out in the event the 
lines in the tail section where the hydraulic systems come the 
closest together are cut 
with the change the pilot would still lose control over the 
rudder which turns the airliner and the elevators which control 
climb and descent but other control surfaces including the 
ailerons which make it possible to keep the wings level would 
remain operable the faa said 
crew members of the united plane said their only means of 
steering the aircraft and controlling descent was to selectively 
accelerate the remaining wing engines 
the faa earlier ordered an ultrasonic inspection of all dc10 
engine fan disks for a possible microscopic defect in the metal 
that investigators said may have caused the engine failure

japanese yen and speculation that the bank of japan would raise key 
interest rates 
market players have long expected the central bank to hike its 
official discount rate which now stands at 425 percent after 
three increases last year 
they say a hike of as much as 1 percent is likely to take place 
as soon as bank of japan governor yasushi mieno returns from a trip 
to europe thursday 
the nikkei had fallen more than 540 points at midmorning in part 
prompted by computeraided selling by arbitrageurs said kazuhiro 
nomura a dealer with new japan securities 
arbitrage is a tactic used to profit from the spread between the 
spot and future markets largescale computeraided arbitrage 
selling has been blamed for the markets recent volatility 
last month the tokyo stock exchange asked major securities firms 
to refrain from arbitrage when the index is falling but dealers 
said many investors seemed to ignore the request

work said the spokesman who commented on condition of anomymity 
reynaldo fernandez secretary general of the union at ilo said 
the toquepala workers were considering whether to join the strike 
southern workers agreed in september not to strike for one year 
in exchange for monthly bonuses which at that time amounted to 
about 200 a month 
however perus hyperinflation which last year reached nearly 
3000 percent has cut the value of the monthly bonus to about 39 
a month 
the miners are now demanding the agreement be scrapped and for 
monthly wages to be increased to 400 fernandez said

a grumman corp official is the latest in 
a series of individuals and defense contractors to plead guilty to 
unlawfully obtaining and distributing classified pentagon documents 
harry kotellos who pleaded guilty monday to a felony conspiracy 
count faces a maximum penalty of 250000 in fines and five years 
in prison when he is sentenced may 18 for his actions from 1980 
through 1985 as a senior marketing analyst for grumman 
the plea agreement submitted to us district judge claude 
hilton is contingent on kotellos full cooperation in the probe 
into the illegal trafficking in classified defense department 
documents 
mr kotellos was a significant player in the tightly knit 
group which acquired and distributed some very sensitive dod 
information said michael j costello special agent in charge of 
the defense criminal investigative services washington field 
office we have attempted to reach the inner core of the 
network and neutralize it 
the documents involved were those that summarize the resources 
the pentagon is planning to spend in future years said richard 
smith costellos assistant the case also involved air force 
budget documents according to court papers 
kotellos 53 is a west point graduate and retired air force 
lieutenant colonel who has worked for grumman since 1980 said his 
attorney plato cacheris 
investigators would not say whether grumman itself was under 
investigation but company spokesman larry hamilton said grumman 
is engaged in discussions with the government as to the 
consequences to the company of mr kotellos plea since this 
matter continues to be under review the company cannot comment on 
these discussions 
the criminal investigative service has been conducting an 
investigation codenamed operation uncover since the mid1980s 
into illegal transfers of pentagon documents to defense contractors 
four major defense contractors and several individuals have 
pleaded guilty to been convicted of charges resulting from 
operation uncover 
hughes aircraft co pleaded guilty last friday and agreed to 
pay a total of 367 million in fines and restitution 
gte government systems division pleaded guilty in 1985 and paid 
about 300000 
the boeing co pleaded guilty last november and paid fines and 
restitution of 52 million and boeing employee richard lee fowler 
was convicted last december of all counts of a 39count indictment 
rca corp pleaded guilty and was ordered feb 5 to pay fines 
and restitution of 275 million former rca employee leonard kampf 
and current rca employee ronald stevens each pleaded guilty to one 
felony count and face sentencing april 6 
the conspiracy count against kotellos said he acquired 
classified documents from a government employee who was not 
authorized to release them getting classified documents from 
fowler of boeing sharing classified documents with other defense 
contractors and obtaining such documents from them and destroying 
some of the documents in his fireplace at home 
court papers did not identify the government employee smith 
declined to reveal the name or to say whether that person was under 
investigation 
a source close to the investigation said he believed prosecutors 
may have a problem with the statute of limitations in the case 
against the government employee because of a lack of information of 
wrongdoing after 1984 
but smith said in a continuing conspiracy the last overt act 
that an individual or corporation does in furtherance of that 
conspiracy can continue the life of the statute of limitations 
the 1985 actions enabled prosecutors to go after kotellos smith 
said 
kotellos was placed on administrative leave with pay from his 
job monday morning grummans hamilton said

this is the city that says it knows how 
the one where tourists love to leave their hearts 
but while most of the physical damage from the oct 17 
earthquake has been repaired community leaders are not sure how to 
fix the damage done to san franciscos reputation for warm if 
eccentric hospitality 
from cable cars to chinatown fishermans wharf hotels to 
theaters and museums commercial and cultural business has been 
reported way down since the quake 
that may be changing thanks to time and fading memories 
promotions ad campaigns and a realization by the business 
community that it must also deal with skyrocketing air fares 
recession fears and increasing competition 
the earthquake is a very good excuse for everything said 
john marks president of the san francisco convention and visitors 
bureau but there are many other factors that are causing the 
momentary bump in tourism 
many touristoriented cities across the country are experiencing 
similar sluggishness he said 
the visitors bureau is spending more on national advertising 
this year than ever before its budget is 1 million up 400000 
marks said 
we believe that time is our greatest ally and the more time 
that expires after oct 17 the less likely the impact of the quake 
is going to affect the decision of the traveler said marks 
helping to influence those decisions are discount room rates 
the mark hopkins for example is offering 205 rooms for 99 at 
the ramada at fishermans wharf rooms are 59 rather than the 
standard 120 
while san francisco hotel occupancy rates stood at about 70 
percent last year the breakeven point for the average hotel they 
dropped by as much as 10 percent in the first two months of 1990 
i cant decide which is the greatest problem concern about 
the economy or about another earthquake said oscar vahidi 
general manager of the ramada 
adding to the problem of earthquakequeasy tourists the city 
saw a 7 percent growth in hotel rooms last year and 1400 more 
rooms are scheduled to come on the market around the end of the 
year 
near the wharf kathy paver spokeswoman for the pier 39 complex 
of boutiques and restaurants said business is comparable to that 
of the same time last year hundreds of hungry and lovesick sea 
lions frolicking in the bay feasting on tourists handouts have 
generated even bigger crowds she said 
but at the cannery nearby spokesman chris martin said business 
is off as much as 20 percent at some shops and restaurants i 
dont think theyre going to be back to normal until the 
doubledeck freeways that are out of commission are back on 
track he said 
the california transportation department said the quakedamaged 
embarcadero freeway which took an average of 80000 cars daily 
from the san franciscooakland bay bridge to the financial 
district chinatown and the wharf could be back in operation by 
september 
part of the problem is people just dont know how to get 
around the city martin said 
even the romantic cable car is in a slump municipal railway 
spokesman george newkirk said average daily ridership before 
october was 11000 to 13000 today 8000 to 10000 take the 2 
rides on the rolling landmarks he said 
businesses are preparing a celebration april 1022 featuring 
dedication of a restored cable car a parade an easter egg hunt at 
fishermans wharf a merchants fair and an earth day extravaganza 
a campaign by the california arts council is raising money for 
art organizations hurt by the quake which killed 67 people 
injured thousands and caused about 10 billion in damage 
at san franciscos american conservatory theater the nations 
largest regional theater company with about 200 employees 
spokeswoman carla befera said attendance has been down 40 percent 
since the companys geary street theater was closed for quake 
repairs plays have been performed at other theaters 
when youre moved out to the center of the financial district 
it really affects your sales she said 
act which needs about 14 million overall to handle repairs and 
seismic upgrading hopes to move back to the geary in the middle of 
the 199192 season so the rest of this season we live as 
gypsies befera said 
san francisco museum society director harry parker said 
attendance slipped at one point to about half the normal 50000 
visitors per month he said attendance appears to be picking up 
but whatever the financial or physical costs a survey of 300 
area residents commissioned by japanese groups developing 
earthquake reaction plans for their nation about a month after the 
quake showed only 7 percent considered moving 
its like this is a fact of life and the benefits of living 
in california outweigh the fear of even more devastating 
earthquakes said polly smith of plog research inc

sponsors of the annual cherry blossom festival 
say they hope unseasonably warm weather hitting the nations 
capital will not cause the trees to bloom too early for the 
celebration 
even though the weather forecasts are good drat it and the 
cherry blossoms look like they may come out early were still 
hopeful national park service spokesman al dale said 
april 1 is the scheduled start of the 78th annual festival 
commemorating the gift of the 3000 trees to the united states by 
the mayor of tokyo in 1912 temperatures ranging from the mid 60s

15 the delicate pink and white blossoms last four to five days 
after they peak 
if things go according to our estimates by april 1 the 
program may just be the japanese tree festival because the 
blossoms will have come and gone national weather service

some inexperienced federal aviation 
administration inspectors dont have the training to prevent 
intoxicated crews from flying airliners says the chairman of the 
house aviation subcommittee 
an faa inspector in fargo nd allowed a northwest airlines 
jet to take off last thursday despite a tip that the crew had been 
drinking for more than six hours 
the system could fail again the same way rep jim oberstar 
dminn said monday after meeting with faa administrator james 
busey 
busey told oberstar that he was going to get their 
inspectors training upgraded to deal with situations like that 
said faa spokeswoman joann sloane 
sloane could not provide any details of how the inspectors 
training would be improved 
the faa is going to act on this quickly or were going to burn 
their behind oberstar said 
the three crew members on the flight from fargo to minneapolis 
were arrested upon landing last thursday when blood tests showed 
excessive alcohol levels their licenses were revoked 
the fargo inspector didnt detain the crew members because they 
didnt smell of alcohol and didnt appear to be impaired said 
oberstar the inspector interviewed the men and observed them for 
more than an hour while they prepared for departure oberstar said 
the faa had said that the fargo inspector did not have the 
authority to stop the plane from taking off under north dakota law 
and that the tip didnt constitute evidence of intoxication 
however oberstar said northwest or any other airline would have 
voluntarily grounded the flight had it been warned of the 
allegations

us subsidies on wheat sold to the soviet 
union totaled 481 million over a 29month period according to a 
general accounting office report 
the subsidies are collected by us exporting companies which 
then ship to the soviets and other foreign buyers at less than 
market prices 
the object is to help us farm products compete with growers in 
other countries whose exports receive government subsidies the 
program is aimed especially at competition from the 12 countries of 
the european economic community where france and west germany are 
big exporters of wheat 
detailed figures in the report made available recently cover 
oct 1 1986 through feb 28 1989 during that period the total 
subsidies to all exporters amounted to 23 billion total sales of 
us products helped by the subsidies were 68 billion of which 
55 billion was for sales of wheat 
five countries were the biggest wheat buyers under the program 
the soviet union china algeria egypt and morocco 
critics say the subsidized sales discourage those governments 
from paying better prices to their own farmers and that the bread 
from the wheat is so cheap that some feed it to animals

radical group moves headquarters five years ago 
the settlement approved by a federal judge feb 28 was 
confirmed monday by charisse r lillie city solicitor under mayor

on moves fortified home setting off a fire that destroyed 61 row 
houses

in age from 9 to 14 one or both parents of each child were 
imprisoned for their move activities 
jim beasley an attorney for the childrens estates said the 
city could not have defended its case in court

courtroom and explain to a jury that this is something that should 
have happened or was anticipated in happening and could be 
justified he said 
the settlement brings to at least 25 million the estimated cost 
to the city of the move disaster including rebuilding of the homes 
ten cases stemming from the confrontation are still pending

pro football voted to continue allowing 
referees to check disputed calls against the instant replay but 
allowed the judges only two minutes to watch a tape and barred them 
from listening to tv sportscasters 
twentyone of the 28 national football league teams monday 
approved the use of replays for another year 
the replays began on a trial basis for the 198687 season and 
have been voted on each year since the procedure allows referees 
to request a review of the videotape on plays where a call from the 
field may have been in error 
many teams expressed unhappiness over the delays caused by the 
replays according to nfl figures the delays averaged 1 minute 55 
seconds although some reviews took four or five minutes 
next year if a play isnt overturned in two minutes it is 
assumed to stand 
nfl commissioner paul tagliabue overcame resistance to renewing 
replay by also agreeing to ensure that replay officials wont hear 
the opinion of tv commentators while using network tape in 
reviewing plays 
tagliabue said he didnt become an ardent supporter of replay 
until saturday when he watched tapes of the 65 plays overturned by 
replay last season 
what i saw were 65 errors that were rectified he said 
any time youre able to rectify a mistake i think you should do 
it 
voting against replay were buffalo cincinnati kansas city 
phoenix chicago tampa bay and the new york giants

prime minister yitzhak shamir on tuesday fired 
vice premier shimon peres collapsing the 15month coalition 
government in a dispute over starting peace talks with 
palestinians israel army radio said 
the rest of the cabinet ministers from peres centerleft labor 
party resigned after shamir leader of the rival likud bloc 
dismissed peres as finance minister 
on monday peres won the approval of the labor partys central 
committee to bring down the government after accusing shamir of 
leading israel into the desert of indecision about peace talks 
with palestinians 
shamir spokesman yossi achimier said on army radio tuesday that 
the prime minister was now turning his attention to surviving a 
noconfidence vote in parliament on the motion labor is expected to 
file on thursday 
if successful shamirs conservative likud bloc would be able to 
rule without labor 
with the governing coalition broken up elections are likely 
the last two elections were indecisive and tenuous likudlabor 
coalitions resulted 
the government crisis began last month when labor demanded the 
cabinet approve proposals by secretary of state james a baker iii 
that had been under consideration since october 
on sunday shamir refused to allow the decisionmaking inner 
cabinet to vote on the plan which involves arranging preliminary 
israelipalestinian peace talks in cairo 
labor supports the baker proposals but likud says the provision 
for including residents of arab east jerusalem in the talks could 
threaten israels declared sovereignty over the area 
likud also opposes participation by exiled palestinians on 
grounds that could provide an opening to the talks for the 
palestine liberation organization which israel views as a 
terrorist organization 
the israelpalestinian talks are meant to lead to eventual 
elections in the israelioccupied territories with their final 
status decided later

following a combined decline of 137255 points today and 
monday the nikkei index has lost nearly 6300 points or 162 
percent since the beginning of this year 
the dollar closed at 15267 yen up 067 yen from mondays 
15200yen finish after opening higher at 15282 yen it ranged 
between 15195 and 15288 yen during the day 
dealers said the yens weakness and a plunge in japanese 
government bond prices led to massive arbitrage selling that in 
turn contributed to the nikkeis eighthlargest singleday loss in 
history 
the yens weakness discouraged bond investors and caused the 
price of benchmark no 119 japanese government bonds to plunge to 
8606 points down 043 points from mondays close of 8649 
dealers said the yield rose from the previous days 724 percent 
to 7324 percent the highest level in five years 
share prices kept falling in the afternoon as the dollar 
remained above the 152yen level said yasumasa shinagawa a 
dealer with yamaichi securities co participants discarded issues 
while nobody bought them back 
shinagawa said arbitrage trading in which participants profit 
from price gaps between the spot and the futures markets 
accelerated the nikkeis plunge in afternoon trading 
analysts have blamed computeraided largescale arbitrage 
trading for recent market plunges they say such trading can 
control the market direction especially when overall volume is low 
today only 400 million shares traded hands on the markets first 
section up slightly from mondays 370 million 
other dealers said persistent speculation over a hike in the 
official discount rate hike also contributed to the plunge 
japanese financial markets have been fluctuating nervously in 
recent weeks because a hike in the central banks key interest rate 
that was expected after last months general election has not 
materialized 
now investors expect the hike of as much as 1 percentage 
point according to local news reports to take place as soon as 
bank of japan governor yasushi mieno returns from a trip to europe 
on thursday dealers said 
the official discount rate now stands at 425 percent after 
three hikes last year 
local news reports today said mieno hinted at the possibility of 
an imminent hike in the nations key lending rate to commercial 
banks 
the dollar opened higher in tokyo following an overnight upswing 
on overseas markets and then weakened marginally in the morning 
after intervention by the bank of japan traders said but the 
dollar rose back in the afternoon session as market players bought 
the us currency said a trader with mitsui bank who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
he said the dollar would have risen higher without the bank of 
japans intervention 
it was the dollars highest finish in tokyo since march 13 
1987 when it closed at 15348 yen 
traders said the central bank sold at least 1 billion yen 66 
million in an effort to stem the dollars rise against the yen

communist leaders met today to 
debate the shape of a new government for this longtime soviet 
client state and a spokesman said reformers were winning over the 
few remaining conservative opponents 
before resigning monday the politburo of the ruling communist 
party agreed to abolish the partys constitutional guarantee on 
power hold a special party congress to choose a new leadership and 
hold early elections this year for a new legislature to rewrite the 
constitution 
it is a crucial moment for the party foreign ministry 
spokesman tepbishiin chimeddorj said today 
he said todays special meeting of the partys 120member 
central committee could produce a new politburo and even change its 
structure and name 
he said it was too early to give details of the form the new 
leadership of the worlds secondoldest communist country would 
take the sparsely populated pastoral country of 2 million people 
lies between the soviet union and china 
chimeddorj said central committee members meeting for a second 
day had been arguing behind closed doors about the reform 
proposals and practically nobody opposed them 
in general we can say in the central committee there are 
radicals and conservatives they are arguing but the viewpoints of 
the conservatives also are changing he said 
mongolian officials did not rule out the possibility that the 
officials who tendered their resignations monday might be 
reelected 
party general secretary jambyn batmonh and the four other 
members of the politburo resigned monday but he remains chairman 
of the parliament and head of state his government titles were not 
affected by mondays announcement 
members of mongolias fledgling opposition said the politburo 
moves were only a first step toward democracy since the beginning 
of the year opposition demonstrations have pushed mongolias 
sleepy reform process into high gear 
a political struggle has started and it is only the first 
victory said batsukh single name is cq an activist in the new 
progressive movement 
the movement today announced formation of a new wing the 
national progressive party to join two earlier established 
opposition parties the democratic party and the social democratic 
party 
the national progressive partys leaders said they differ from 
the other two opposition groups mainly in their demand for an 
immediate transformation of mongolias centralized economy into a 
market economy 
opposition parties are pressing for legislative elections to be 
held in june or july 
mongolia in the early 1920s was the original soviet satellite 
and has borrowed heavily from soviet experience and popular culture 
drab sovietstyle apartment buildings dot the capital people 
drive sovietbuilt cars past traffic police dressed in sovietstyle 
uniforms and just as in mongolias northern neighbor buyers queue 
up to make purchases 
until recently a statue of stalin stood along one of the 
capitals main streets a monument to the soviet leader mongolians 
revered for helping them fight japanese invaders 
but the reforms soviet president mikhail s gorbachev unleashed 
on eastern europe have had an effect in mongolia as well there is 
a new emphasis on learning languages other than russian and the 
country gradually has begun opening to the outside world 
in washington the state department on monday welcomed the 
mongolian governments opening to opposition demands 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler pointed to the 
mongolian opposition movement that surfaced in recent months and 
mounted peaceful rallies for democracy 
the central committee on monday set a special party congress for 
april 10 at which a new central committee will be chosen batmonh 
said the new group should be younger and in favor of reform 
he called for early legislative elections but did not specify a 
date 
one of the tasks of the new parliament will be to approve a new 
constitution and work on the draft has started one of the goals 
of the new constitution will be to separate the roles of party and 
government 
batmonh also called for renewed efforts to rehabilitate people 
wrongly punished in past political purges

a federal judge said he was inclined to let 
reuters end its picture exchange agreement with united press 
international 
a decision was expected today 
judge peter k leisure on monday was weighing a request from upi 
for a preliminary injunction barring reuters from pulling out of 
the agreement 
reuters has said the agreement is not meeting its expectations 
upi maintained that allowing reuters to pull out would cause upi 
irreparable harm 
the agreement reached in 1984 called for upi to supply reuters 
with pictures from the united states while reuters provided upi 
with pictures from other countries it was to run for 10 years 
beginning in 1985 
after more than two hours of oral arguments monday leisure said 
he was prepared to rule against upi in the dispute between the two 
news services 
but upis lawyers asked that dr earl brian upi chairman be 
allowed to testify on the impact of such a ruling 
after brian testified the judge said he would issue his ruling 
today 
brian said that after reuters announced feb 16 that it was 
canceling the contract and interrupted the exchange for four hours 
upi began negotiations for a photo exchange with the french news 
service agence francepresse 
we were unable to reach any agreement save the supply of 
photographs by afp for three months brian said we have not 
accepted it 
he said a survey of 36 of upis major clients revealed that some 
newspapers said they would drop the upi photo service if the 
reuters canceled brian said a loss of foreign photos also could 
result in clients dropping upis news service 
if the injunction is not granted brian said upi will go 
forward with its negotiations with afp 
after brians testimony leisure extended a temporary 
restraining order that bars reuters from canceling the contract 
until next monday to enable upi lawyers to make whatever 
applications are needed to an appeals court 
upi lawyer mitchell karlan said upi would appeal if leisure 
denied the injunction

treatment to a public reception and dance put on for lawmakers 
william hauda executive director of common cause in wisconsin 
said monday he distributed 2000 fliers announcing the event to

prohibited from accepting anything of value including food and 
drink unless the same is offered to the general public a notice 
of the event was published in the classified section of madison 
newspapers 
we felt that the tiny notice wasnt sufficient notice 
hauda said we thought that we should help get the word out 
superior mayor herb bergson who is hosting the do said he was 
angry common cause did not tell him about the fliers i didnt 
find out until late afternoon so we couldnt get more food he 
said 
but jeff wendorf a university extension employee who helped

we come down here to share the hospitality of northern 
wisconsin and will do just that wendorf said when the food

the digging is under way on the big dig a 10year 
project to cut another tunnel under boston harbor and replace the 
citys elevated highway with an underground one 
groundbreaking was held monday on the 44 billion project 
without which officials say boston could someday develop 14hour 
gridlock 
because of the construction however traffic will get much 
worse before it gets any better and the demolition work may 
unleash an onslaught of rats 
under the plan a third tunnel will be built under the harbor 
and the more than 30yearold central artery the rusty sixlane 
elevated highway through the city will be replaced with an 8 to 
10lane underground expressway 
the project underwent two years of planning drafting and 
approvals if all goes according to plan it will be complete in 
1998 
rodents washed over the citys south end in 1984 during 
construction on an expressway in an effort to avert a similar 
assault the state has undertaken an antirat plan including early 
baiting and inspection aimed at controlling the millions of rats 
whose habitats will be destroyed by the project

allstate insurance co threatened a court 
challenge moments after gov jim florio signed a law to lower auto 
premiums by 20 percent for new jersey motorists who pay the 
secondhighest rates in the nation 
this will strike a blow for the working people who have been 
oppressed by this unfair tax we call auto insurance the governor 
said monday 
florio promised that the auto insurance reform package which 
moved through the legislature and back to his desk within 45 days 
of its unveiling by the new governor will save motorists 222 a 
car by next march 
florios bill cuts auto insurance bills by eliminating the joint 
underwriting association a stateoperated pool for highrisk 
drivers that has piled up a 31 billion debt a 222percar 
annual fee charged every motorist to keep the pool from bankruptcy 
will be dropped 
the law requires the insurance industry to pay 14 billion of 
the jua debt florio said that insurance companies which at one 
point had assigned more than half of new jersey drivers to the jua 
bilked the poorly operated pool and must now pay the money back 
the law bars insurers from charging higher premiums to make up the 
cost of paying off the jua debt 
insurers said however they are not to blame for the 
statecreated pool and promise to block the measure in court within 
a month 
we believe the bill is unconstitutional said allstate vice 
president edward young it takes our stockholders assets to pay 
for a deficit we didnt create 
at an average of 1000 per car insurance rates in new jersey 
are second highest in the nation behind massachusetts according 
to a survey by am best co which rates the stability of 
insurance companies 
young said allstate will consider pulling out of new jersey 
because of the new law itt hartford insurance group which has a 
very small part of the new jersey market also said it would stop 
selling auto insurance for independent agents and brokers 
florio said new jersey will adapt if insurers leave 
this is a fair system for all including the industry he 
said for some of the companies to literally say theyre going to 
pick up their bat and ball and go play somewhere else is by 
definition childish 
under the law the jua will be replaced by a much smaller 
assigned risk plan motorists will pay higher registration fees and 
professions that benefit from auto accidents doctors lawyers and 
body shops will pay 100 license fees to help pay the jua debt 
the insurance industry challenged with some success reforms in 
california where voters in 1988 passed an initiative rolling back 
auto premiums 20 percent 
last week californias insurance commissioner announced 
premiums will be cut more than 20 percent in los angeles county 
where a third of californians live but will be raised in all but 
two other counties

a plaster ceiling caved in and dropped two tons 
of debris on customers at a croissant shop in the majestic ansonia 
hotel killing a woman and injuring 12 other people 
passersby and a homeless man who sells books on the sidewalk in 
front of the ground floor shop helped pull out the survivors monday 
they were really good the men got the women out first said 
police officer robert schelhorn 
we thought the building was falling said elvin rodriguez a 
clerk at a nearby bookstore first it was like a vibration then 
glass breaking and then a big boom 
the sidewalk bookseller benjamin montalvo was pulling a lot 
of people out he went in a couple of times rodriguez said 
none of the injuries were considered life threatening 
fire department spokesman john mulligan said the collapsed area 
was 250 square feet and weighed about two tons 
the plaster ceiling in the ornate beauxart building had been 
covered with a suspended ceiling and the combined weight apparently 
caused the collapse mulligan said 
its an old ceiling decorative molding heavy plaster with 
metal leaves holding it all together it just gave way said 
buildings commissioner charles smith 
the ansonia a 17story residential building built in 1904 
occupies a full city block on broadway 
in earlier years its residents included enrico caruso arturo 
toscanini lily pons florenz ziegfeld theodore dreiser sol 
hurok igor stravinsky and other celebrities arts figures favored 
the hotel because its heavy construction made it soundproof 
more recently the ansonia has witnessed bitter landlordtenant 
squabbles in 1988 its owners were fined 400000 for illegal 
removal of asbestos

the state asked the corporate sponsor of 
an exhibit on the holocaust to delete references to homosexuals 
from educational materials accompanying the exhibit 
the materials including an article on the repression of 
homosexuals by nazis were prepared by orembased geneva steel for 
teachers planning field trips to the exhibit the world of ann 
frank 19291945 to open here march 25 
utah school board guidelines state the acceptance of or 
advocacy of homosexuality as a desirable or acceptable sexual 
adjustment or lifestyle may not be taught in utah 
geneva steel removed the article on homosexuals at the urging of 
school board officials said geneva employee kathy bryson 
we were specifically told never to mention the homosexuals 
she said 
school superintendent james moss on monday authorized geneva 
steel to restore the deleted article saying his intention earlier 
had been misunderstood 
but he said there would be a question in a teachers mind of 
sensitivity to state rules and laws and that any material 
dealing with homosexuality would need to be approached very 
carefully by teachers to ensure that they conform to those 
guidelines 
the deleted article includes two pages detailing the treatment 
of homosexuals after adolf hitlers rise to power in 1933 
homosexuals were rounded up and sent to concentration camps where 
they were castrated or exterminated 
a third page shows a pink triangle the symbol the nazis forced 
homosexuals to wear surrounded by the words gays against 
facism it contains a brief history of the adoption of the symbol 
by the gay liberation movement in the 1970s 
michele parishpixler of the american civil liberties union said 
moss had waffled on the issue leaving teachers unsure where they 
stood 
one of the problems with putting censorship laws on the books 
and adopting them into policies is such a practice makes everyone 
afraid and thats what were talking about here is fear she 
said 
religious human rights and gay rights groups met privately with 
moss on monday and then announced they would hold a ceremony to 
honor homosexual victims of the holocaust when the exhibit opens 
when first alerted moss said he wondered why the issue was 
raised at all 
homosexuality is not a major feature of the holocaust he 
said during the weekend i think the major focus that certainly 
needs to be focused on continuously was the religious and cultural 
prejudice 
moss amended his statement monday saying he was quoted out of 
context 
there has never been any question in our minds about the 
importance of including the material about the treatment of 
homosexuals in the holocaust he told reporters monday 
homosexuals were poorly treated in the holocaust as were jews 
as were gypsies as were artists as were a variety of groups 
geneva chairman joseph a cannon who sits on the national 
campaign board of the national holocaust museum in washington had 
said he was unaware that anything was being excluded from the 
teaching materials 
my hobby is history and i dont like fooling around with 
history he said i really dont think we ought to do something 
that ignores a pretty significant element of the holocaust

pakistan an islamic nation but in the past year have demanded 
independence and the status of a neutral country

burmese military authorities have moved 
tens of thousands of people from the cities to outlying areas in an 
effort to control political dissent two western diplomats said 
today 
they are getting rid of potential flash points one diplomat 
said some areas were more active than others during the 
demonstrations and the army wants to have people where it can 
easily control them 
one diplomat citing reports from the new settlements before the 
government recently stopped allowing visits said certainly in 
many cases the move was involuntary 
from the estimates that we have built up we would say that the 
total figure would be up to half a million people countrywide 
the other diplomat said 
the relocations began early last year said the diplomats who 
were reached in rangoon by telephone and spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
they said the action apparently was aimed partly at breaking up 
blocs of antigovernment sentiment in the cities where millions of 
people took to the streets two years ago to demonstrate against the 
authoritarian rule of gen saw maung 
the general seized power in a september 1988 coup and his 
troops suppressed the demonstrations killing hundreds of people 
the movements also may be an attempt to influence voting 
patterns in the scheduled may 27 election which are to be the 
first multiparty polling in three decades the diplomats said 
authorities already have barred aung san suu kyi and other 
opposition leaders from running in the election 
the diplomats said many of the new settlements had no running 
water or electricity and some were malariainfested armed 
soldiers often supervised the relocations herding people into 
trucks they said 
they said most of the people were moved from the capital 
rangoon but others were moved from the northern cities of mandalay 
and taunggyi to outlying areas 
in rangoon it is very extensive one diplomat said people 
are ordered by the military to dismantle their houses at their own 
cost 
in bangkok last week burmas minister of health and education 
pe thein said the relocations were for sanitary reasons 
we want rangoon to be a good clean city and these are just 
squatters he said 
citizens have held smallscale demonstrations despite 
restrictions and one diplomat cited reports of protests in 
mandalay at the beginning of march involving up to 200 buddhist 
monks the protesters had demanded the release of opposition 
leaders and other dissidents he said

president bush is seeking a quick 300 million 
aid infusion to help salvage nicaraguas warbattered economy and 
to solidify the political ground under presidentelect violeta 
chamorro administration sources say 
vice president dan quayle said in asuncion paraguay this 
morning that he told outgoing nicaraguan president daniel ortega 
the aid package will take the fighters and try to make them 
farmers 
bush scheduled a morning news conference to announce the aid 
package he was expected to press congress to enact the emergency 
appropriation by april 25 when mrs chamorro is to be inaugurated 
in her countrys first peaceful transition to a democratically 
elected government 
bush also is expected to announce the lifting of us trade 
sanctions that have been in place since may 1 1985 said the 
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
mrs chamorro leader of the 14party coalition that upset 
president daniel ortega of the leftist sandinista party on feb 25 
will inherit a country whose economy has been devastated by a 
decade of mismanagement and war bush called mrs chamorro on 
monday to brief her on the package a source said 
on capitol hill bushs aid proposal will fall into place behind 
a pending 500 million request for emergency money for panama 
which has been bogged down in disputes about how the new aid will 
be funded and how it will be used 
after 10 years of trying to destroy nicaragua we do have a 
responsibility to help democracy said sen patrick leahy dvt 
chairman of the senate appropriations subcommittee that doles out 
foreign aid 
i may well agree with whatever the presidents policy is 
there but i dont think it is wise to be raising expectations by 
promising money we dont know whether we have leahy said 
the 300 million request will be paid for like the supplemental 
money bill for panama through commensurate cuts in various 
pentagon accounts in the current fiscal year 
the request includes about 30 million to help pay costs of 
relocating some 10000 contra rebels and tens of thousands of 
family members from their camps along the honduran border to homes 
inside nicaragua administration sources said 
supplementing that amount will be roughly 10 million left over 
from a humanitarian aid program for the rebels and from an 
international oversight panel set up to help the central american 
peace process 
in addition to the demobilization money for the usbacked 
rebels bush will ask for emergency agricultural aid to help 
nicaraguan farmers meet may planting deadlines the sources said 
some of the money also could be used to repatriate other 
nicaraguan refugees who fled the country during the sandinistas 
10year rule the sources said 
the package also will include money to help the country buy oil 
which in the past has been supplied through cuba the incoming 
government fears that the sandinistas will have exhausted the 
countrys stocks of oil by the time they turn over power officials 
said 
us aid would help nicaragua buy oil from other sources 
presumably mexico and venezuela said one senior administration 
official 
money for planting oil purchases and contra demobilization 
plus smaller amounts for medical and technical economic assistance 
would make up roughly half of the 300 million package the sources 
said 
the other 150 million which has not yet been as clearly 
defined would go to help nicaragua pay off overdue international 
financial obligations and to encourage economic development they 
said 
bush also may outline the need for additional money for 
nicaragua probably somewhat less than 300 million in the fiscal 
year that begins oct 1 the sources said 
the money request reflects needs outlined in meetings that 
francisco mayorga the leading economic strategist for the new 
chamorro government held last week with us officials in the 
administration and on capitol hill 
the administration hopes the urgency of the nicaraguan request 
will help provide some momentum for its stalled aid request for 
panama the panama measure has been delayed by arguments with 
congress over which defense accounts were being cut to fund it and 
over the size of the request 
panamanian president guillermo endara installed after the us 
invasion that ousted dictator manuel noriega in december is on a 
hunger strike perceived partly as a protest over the slow pace of 
us aid to his country 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler noted monday that 
55 million in aid already was being used in panama to rebuild 
damage from the invasion create public works jobs and help 
establish a police force

mikhail s gorbachev today called lithuanias 
declaration of independence illegal and invalid but urged 
patience saying moscows relations with the baltic republic would 
continue unchanged for now 
he said a commission was studying how to respond to lithuanias 
action 
in comments to the congress of peoples deputies gorbachev 
indicated that lithuanias independence drive is likely to 
encounter formidable resistance he said the kremlin would not 
begin negotiations with the three baltic republics on the 
independence they are seeking 
we cannot talk about negotiations he said you carry out 
negotiations with a foreign country 
but several lawmakers said it was likely gorbachev would soften 
his positon 
the soviet leader told the 2000 deputies that premier nikolai 
ryzhkov and a commission were studying the lithuanian 
situation on sunday lithuanias legislature reclaimed the 
sovereignty the nation lost 50 years ago 
gorbachev won applause from the congress when he said the 
kremlin would not give in to demands to negotiate independence with 
republics seeking independence including the other two baltic 
states latvia and estonia 
the lithuanians want recognition as a sovereign state and the 
start of talks on secession on monday the estonians called for 
talks with moscow on independence all three republics were 
forcibly annexed in 1940 
at one point calling the lithuanians comrades gorbachev 
paused and then said i think they are comrades 
the soviet leader made a point of welcoming the presence of 
lithuanian deputies at the congress but lithuanian deputy vaidotas 
antanaitis said they now considered themselves observers 
antanaitis read excerpts from the declaration of independence 
together with appeals for recognition of their sovereignty he said 
lithuania wants good relations with moscow and called for 
negotiations 
gorbachev offered no reaction 
another lithuanian deputy algimountas chekuolis said he 
believed the soviet leader would soften his position gorbachev 
is a realist he said hell change his stand 
ingrik toome a deputy and premier of estonia said estonians 
and latvians were upset by gorbachevs statement there would be no 
negotiations but added that the soviet leader might not yet have 
fully explained his position 
so far many of his political steps have shown that he has to 
start these negotiations toome said 
the lithuanian communist party chief algerdis brazauskas told 
reporters he met with gorbachev early today and there were no 
reproaches contacts have not been broken brazauskas lost the 
post of lithuanian parliament president last weekend 
on monday conservative politburo member yegor k ligachev ruled 
out the use of force against the republic of 37 million people 
we will not use force he declared we must resolve this by 
political means 
in january red army troops stormed the azerbaijani capital of 
baku to put down unrest fueled by independence demands killing 
dozens in april 1989 troops killed at least 19 people in tbilisi 
the capital of georgia during an independence demonstration 
in order to make sundays declaration a reality lithuania must 
resolve a daunting array of questions including matters of 
territory compensation the status of thousands of soviet 
soldiers ownership of factories and land and control of the 
police and kgb 
hope and joy must dissolve into determination to work for 
lithuania the republics new president vytautas landsbergis 
told the lithuanian legislature in its capital of vilnius on 
monday we must work very hard 
the tass news agency said lithuanian legislators declared that 
their sons no longer need serve in the soviet army and appealed to 
gorbachev to ensure the welfare of lithuanian soldiers until 
negotiations start on mustering them out 
lithuanians said they expected at least a partial economic 
blockade by the soviet side which supplies all of the fuel to the 
republic 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov asserted monday 
that lithuania cannot go it alone in the world market 
lithuania is not selfsufficient if only because it receives 
energy at subsidized prices he said 
a barrel of oil costs 1570 on the world market but the 
lithuanians get a barrel for less than a dollar from the soviets 
he said 
a week ago gorbachev demanded in talks with brazauskas that the 
republic pay 21 billion rubles in hard currency about 34 billion 
for soviet investment in factories and infrastructure during the 
past halfcentury 
the soviet leader also suggested lithuania might have to hand 
over the baltic port of klaipeda a key city that the independent 
republic would need to carry out foreign trade 
but algimontas chekuolis a leader of the proindependence 
lithuanian political movement sajudis said in an interview at the 
congress that the kremlin also owes 
the kremlin should pay 300 billion rubles to compensate for 
300000 people who were killed imprisoned or exiled by stalin and 
his successors and for the economic havoc caused by a halfcentury 
of soviet mismanagement 
the congress of peoples deputies was called into session in 
moscow to consider a strong new presidency that gorbachev wants to 
establish lithuanians rushed their new legislature into session to 
declare independence before gorbachev could be elected to that post

the anger us sen john east felt against navy 
doctors when he committed suicide in 1986 was unjustified a 
government attorney said in opening arguments of a wrongful death 
lawsuit brought by his widow 
east was cured of a serious thyroid disorder with synthetic 
drugs 11 months before the north carolina republican asphyxiated 
himself with carbon monoxide assistant us attorney susan ringler 
said monday 
priscilla east 58 of greenville nc contends her husband 
believed the doctors failure to diagnose his condition for several 
years had caused his mental and physical powers to deteriorate 
her 35 million claim is believed to be the first wrongful 
death lawsuit against the government by the family of a us 
senator 
not every death is someone elses responsibility ringler 
said the evidence in this case will demonstrate that the only 
one responsible for john easts death was john east himself 
ringler also disputed the claim that hypothyroidism dulled 
easts mental abilities saying he led an active life until his 
death 
east left a suicide note on june 29 1986 saying doctors at 
bethesda naval medical center outside washington dc ruined my 
health by failing for years to diagnose his hypothyroidism 
the disease occurs when the thyroid gland fails to produce the 
hormones necessary to maintain the bodys metabolism 
mrs easts attorney argued that east suffered from a series of 
symptoms including fatigue and inability to sleep for two years 
while under the care of rear adm freeman cary who was then 
attending physician at the us capitol 
mrs easts attorney said cary did not diagnose the thyroid 
problem 
cary is not named in the lawsuit survivors cannot sue 
individual military doctors but can file claims against the 
government 
it was not until april 1985 when east fell into a nearfatal 
coma caused by hypothyroidism that the correct diagnosis was made 
according to court documents until then cary had recommended 
psychiatric treatment and other medical tests attorneys on both 
sides said 
ringler said east saw his own doctor during his first 2 years 
in the senate and when he did consult the attending physicians 
office did not describe symptoms that could have led to a proper 
diagnosis 
on the stand easts widow painted a picture of an intelligent 
vigorous former marine who fought polio as a young man and 
relentlessly pursued his professional and political goals until he 
became sick in 1983 
her voice broke repeatedly when she described his struggle 
against the polio that paralyzed his lower body in 1955 after 
undergoing a spinal tap he told her from a stretcher you know 
pris everything will be all right she recalled 
us district judge walter black jr is hearing the case without 
a jury the trial is expected to last several weeks

vice president dan quayle said today 
he pressed paraguayan president andres rodriguez for progress on 
human rights and is convinced rodriguez is dedicated to 
democracy 
quayle met with opposition political leaders and planned a 
second meeting later in the day with rodriguez 
the vice president fresh from talks with president daniel 
ortega on a peaceful transfer of power in nicaragua said he 
pressed for progress on human rights in his first meeting with 
rodriguez shortly after his arrival monday night from santiago 
chile 
i have already talked to him about human rights and the 
advancement of democracy quayle told reporters when asked about 
a state department report that criticizes paraguay for continued 
human rights problems 
im convinced he is dedicated to democracy quayle said of 
rodriguez hes certainly moving along the road of democracy 
the vice president said before meeting with opposition leaders 
representing various political parties 
no other us president or vice president has visited paraguay 
since the 1950s when richard nixon stopped there as vice president 
quayle and his wife marilyn were honored monday night in a 
gala dinner at the palace of rodriguez who gave the quayles a pair 
of young spotted jaguars the jaguar is native to paraguay 
rodriguez is the former armed forces general who overthrew 
military dictator gen alfred stroessner in february 1989 
rodriguez won the election he called in may in a country where 
political diversity was squelched in the 34year stroessner regime 
quayles message during his brief stay here is to praise the 
move toward democracy but also urge continued progress toward 
democratization said the vice presidents chief of staff bill 
kristol 
although the rodriguez government has taken significant steps to 
reverse repression that was prevalent under stroessner the bush 
administration wants to see greater strides according to the 1990 
state department report on human rights in paraguay 
the countrys armed forces under rodriguez have been used to 
forcibly remove poor squatters from farmland and government 
corruption remains a serious problem the report said 
while some human rights violations have been recorded the state 
department said they do not appear to be systemic or reflective of 
government policy 
about 200 antiamerican protesters demonstrated peacefully 
against quayles visit in the central part of asuncion but quayle 
did not see them 
earlier monday quayle met for 1 hours with nicaraguas ortega 
as both attended a lunch hosted at the presidential palace by 
chiles newly inaugurated president patricio aylwin 
quayle said ortega promised there will be a peaceful transition 
of government when he hands over the presidency on april 25 to 
violeta chamorro the usbacked candidate who defeated the 
leftist ortega in the feb 25 election

mayor marion barry arrested in january on a 
charge of possession of cocaine is returning to the nations 
capital after seven weeks of substance abuse treatment 
a mayoral spokeswoman vera jackson ended speculation about the 
mayors whereabouts saying he would hold a news conference in 
washington later today barry has been enrolled in treatment 
centers in florida and south carolina since his arrest on the 
charge of possession of crack cocaine 
during his absence barrys political support has eroded with 
the citys nonvoting delegate to congress walter fauntroy 
entering the mayoral race and top supporters including the 
cochairman of barrys campaign finance committee joining the 
fauntroy camp 
the mayors whereabouts were the subject of much speculation but 
no answers monday as his aides tried to learn whether he had 
checked out of the south carolina substance abuse program to return 
to the nations capital 
i would say he is in south carolina but i dont want to put 
my foot in my mouth said barry spokeswoman lurma rackley i 
have no reason to believe that he is elsewhere but he could be in 
transit right now i dont know anything definitive yet but 
theres no reason to believe he is out there in limbo somewhere 
madelyn andrews a spokeswoman for city administrator carol b 
thompson said her office didnt know barrys whereabouts 
although we feel confident we could contact him through the 
treatment center if we had to 
thompson is handling the daytoday chores of the running the 
government but she is not authorized to sign legislation or 
approve spending bills 
a thompson aide speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
city administrator had been unable to locate barry on monday and 
was incredibly irritated 
she is trying to run things but no one can find him the 
aide said that is truly frustrating 
top government officials had predicted the mayor who has been 
enrolled in two substance programs since shortly after being 
arrested in january on a drug charge would return to the city last 
weekend 
but barry did not return to washington on saturday or sunday 
rackley said she believed barry was still at the fenwick hall 
hospital outside charleston sc where he has been enrolled since 
feb 23 
rackley said barry can always be reached because he travels 
with security and the security officers are police and the police 
department can always contact them 
there would be no reason for anyone to look for him today 
because there are no burning issues she said 
i do not know where he is said corporation counsel herbert

prime minister yitzhak shamir fired vice 
premier shimon peres today in a dispute over peace talks and all 
the cabinet members of peres labor party quit collapsing the 
15monthold coalition government 
peres dismissal and the resignations do not take effect for 48 
hours leaving room for a lastditch compromise things could 
happen the situation can change shamir said on israel radio 
but reconciliation seemed remote as labor leaders ruled out 
further contacts with shamirs rightwing likud bloc the 
compromises are behind us not before us peres said 
the collapse of the coalition sent party leaders searching for 
alliances to form a new government before a planned noconfidence 
vote in parlaiment thursday both likud and the centerleft labor 
party are seeking alliances with small religious parties who hold 
a swing vote 
if the noconfidence motion fails shamir could remain prime 
minister by forming an alliance with the smaller parties if it 
passes shamir remains head of a caretaker government until a new 
government is formed by either labor or likud 
the dispute is over labors support of a us proposal to hold 
peace talks in cairo with a palestinian delegation the delegates 
would discuss plans for elections in the occupied territories on 
selfrule for the palestinians 
likud objects to involving the 140000 arabs in east jerusalem 
in the elections 
in a radio interview shamir said he acted to preempt labors 
efforts to muster a majority for thursdays parliament vote he 
said the jerusalem issue was the main obstacle 
these differences of opinion are not so smallthey exist and 
firstly about jerusalem an issue about which we are very 
sensitive especially these days when we hear voices from the 
united states shamir said 
the remark was an allusion to recent statements by us leaders 
including president bush suggesting jerusalem could be negotiable 
in peace talks and bushs criticism earlier this month of building 
jewish neighborhoods in east jerusalem 
both labor and likud maintain that jerusalem is not negotiable 
but labor favors a compromise allowing jerusalem palestinians to 
vote elsewhere in the disputed lands 
israel radio said today that shamir also considered submitting 
his resignation before thursday but the premier denied it 
after leaving the cabinet peres raised the possibility of 
avoiding new elections by forming a laborled government with 
ultraorthodox and leftwing parties 
the balance of power is held by two ultraorthodox religious 
parties who have seven of the 120 seats in the knesset or 
parliament labor and its allies control 55 seats while likud and 
its partners control 58 
explaining the prime ministers decision to expel labor from the 
coalition shamir spokesman yossi achimier said his boss wants 
only one thing to prevent a palestinian state 
labor communications minister gad yacobi said shamirs decision 
to end the coalition ruined prospects for a palestinianisraeli 
dialogue the prime minister has closed the door on the peace 
processfor this he bears heavy national responsibility 
palestinians described the collapse as a setback for israels 
plan to hold elections in the occupied territories as a first step 
in resolving the palestinian problem 
bethlehem mayor elias freij said i believe israel has killed 
its own peace plan and this will have very dangerous 
repercussions throughout the middle east 
freij alluded to predictions that without an active process 
arabisraeli tensions would increase and result in violence both 
in the occupied territories and from radical palestinian groups 
abroad 
baruch askarov an aide to peres said todays cabinet session 
began with stormy arguments between the two sides and then shamir 
announced the dismissal of the labor leader the other labor 
ministers then submitted resignations prepared in advance he said 
peres dismissal came after the labor partys 1300member 
central committee voted monday night to give the partys leaders 
the power to pull out of the government if progress was not made in 
the middle east peace process 
likud argues that accepting the us peace plan would mean 
implicitly recognizing the palestine liberation organization and 
bringing into question israeli control over arab east jerusalem 
which was annexed after its seizure with the occupied lands in the 
1967 middle east war 
more than 660 palestinians have been killed by israelis in a

john doe the amnesia victim is he 
melvin wolf the texas repairman who disappeared last year is he 
jim j king the california insurance man who vanished 12 years 
ago or some mysterious combination of both 
the case began in october when police in topeka kan found 
the man wandering without identification he said he didnt 
remember who he was or how he came to be there 
he was known only as john doe until feb 10 when relatives who 
saw him on television identified him as 53yearold melvin wolf a 
smallappliance repairman who disappeared in august from his 
sisters home in angleton texas 
wolfs family has taken the man in and short of fingerprinting 
there seems little doubt that doe was wolf at least for much of 
his life 
on feb 28 a topeka tv station reported that wolf maintained 
the separate identity of jim j king a successful insurance 
salesman from burbank calif who hasnt been seen since 1978 
on march 6 a third identity surfaced that of robert j hart 
a dennys restaurant employee in washington dc 
i was just now accepting that im melvin wolf now i dont 
know who i am again the man said recently 
police havent had time to run down the hart story but burbank 
police spokesman sgt don goldberg said authorities believe wolf 
and king are the same person 
goldberg said investigators were still seeking dental records or 
other proof 
kings wife ann reported him missing march 31 1978 under 
suspicious circumstances an investigation turned up nothing 
but kings car found abandoned two months later in a burbank 
parking lot goldberg said 
authorities investigated kings insurance dealings for any 
misconduct goldberg said but did not find enough evidence to 
charge the man the investigation is still open 
burbank police have been searching for mrs king since reports 
that king might be wolf surfaced recently so far they havent 
found her 
the man who could be king is about 6 feet tall with white hair 
a weathered face and a rural accent wolf or king left topeka 
on feb 28 to stay with wolfs relatives in angleton 
wolfs sister donna caskey said the family had lost track of 
him for many years before he turned up in angleton in 1986 during 
much of that lost time they heard stories that wolf was living in 
california caskey said last month 
the mysterious man and his angleton relatives have refused to 
give interviews since the reports of his multiple identities 
rick selig a therapist at the topeka psychiatric clinic said 
the man suffered from psychogenic amnesia a total memory loss 
normally brought on by an extremely stressful event 
the question selig said is what caused the amnesia selig is 
trying to find out through hypnotherapy 
the pentagon says wolf joined the army in 1953 and was stationed 
in west germany from 1957 to 1960 he left the service in 1961 
employees of a prudential life insurance co office in los 
angeles said they recognize the man as king their lost colleague 
they said they had assumed that king was abducted and killed in 
1978 
prudential employee eugene bullington said watching a tv report 
was like seeing someone come back from the dead 
herb pierce who hired king in the prudential office in 1969 
said king and his wife had two children burbank police have no 
record of the children goldberg said 
wibwtv in topeka whose reports led to the mans unfolding 
identities reported that employees at a dennys in the washington 
area called claiming they had worked with someone who resembled 
wolf and went by the initials rj 
dennys personnel files showed that a robert j hart began 
working at the restaurant on april 7 1978 a week after king 
disappeared from burbank hart moved in september 1979 to phoenix 
where he worked at another dennys until may 1980 wibw reported 
although wolf king and hart had different social security 
numbers they listed the same birthplace west allis wis and the 
same high school in johnson creek wis wibw has reported 
the school says its records show that none of the three men 
studied there 
wolfs birthday is sept 27 1936 king and hart each listed 
their birthdays as sept 26 but the years were different king 
said he was born in 1940 and hart in 1943 
selig said his patient had been making slow progress in 
remembering technical information wolf would have known such as 
appliance electronics but he said wolf had no big bang of 
revelations about his life 
its kind of preposterous to him how he could have done all 
this stuff selig said its frightening to him its 
confusing

president bush said today that past use of 
marijuana should not be used against a political candidate 
bush was asked during a news conference about the texas 
gubernatorial primary election today in which questions of drug use 
have been raised democratic candidate ann richards has lost ground 
in public opinion polls after refusing to answer questions about 
possible past drug use 
the president said the importance of such an issue is a matter 
for the voters to decide but in my view if somebody used marijuana 
some time ago and is not into anything of that nature why no i 
dont think that should be used against them 
after his statement on marijuana bush was asked about past use 
of stronger drugs by a political candidate 
youre getting me involved in the texas primary something i 
dont want to do he responded 
this is election day in texas bush said adding that he had 
voted in the republican primary but declining to say for whom 
i hope everybody understands bush said 
of the general election he said ill be involved but im not

here is the text of president bushs news 
conference tuesday 
president bush well we began this administration by saying 
that the day of the dictator is over and now restless millions 
have spoken and have elected or prepare to elect new governments 
their governments 
as long as we live the images of this revolution the 
revolution of 89 will be with us the playwright president in 
prague the tumbling of the berlin wall crumbling of a romanian 
dictatorship but this revolution leaves us with a new challenge 
how to best support newborn democracies this challenge is utterly 
unlike the task of rebuilding europe after the second world war 
for no single great plan will do we need a flexible approach one 
that will meet the needs of each country we seek to help 
today i want to speak about how we can best help two 
democracies in our hemisphere panama and nicaragua we should take 
great pride in the way in which our leadership congress and the 
administration helped the democratic spirit take hold in these two 
countries 
but this is no time to bask in selfpraise these nations need 
our help to heal deep wounds inflicted by years of strife and 
oppression years of loss and deprivation and we must act and act 
soon to help the peoples of these new democracies in two great and 
historic tasks reconstruction and reconciliation 
ive taken an important step today as a demonstration of our 
resolve to be part of the process of reconciliation i just signed 
an executive order to end the economic embargo against nicaragua 
americans are determined to help the people of nicaragua 
and next im asking the congress and the american people to 
join me in crafting a bipartisan agreement to help both countries 
after all bipartisanship did work well last year to put the focus 
on free elections and end the fighting in nicaragua bipartisanship 
also helped bring an end to the tyranny in panama and we need to 
work again in that same spirit to put together an assistance 
program for both countries 
im proposing the creation of a fund for democracy to assist in 
the reconstruction and development of these two countries and im 
requesting the congress to approve by april 5 a package of 
assistance of 800 million for these two countries using funds from 
the defense budget 
this package consists of 500 million for panama already 
requested in that jan 25 proposal to congress along with 70 
million for refugees and an additional 300 million for nicaragua 
im asking the secretary of state and the secretary of the 
treasury to work together on the economic assistance aspects of 
these packages and of course to consult with the us congress 
in addition under existing authorities im initiating 
immediate action to provide 21 million of previously appropriated 
economic aid principally for food and humanitarian assistance 
i also will be sending to the congress in the future a budget 
amendment for an additional 200 million in fiscal 91 for 
nicaragua consistent with the approach that weve taken this year 
moreover ive instructed the secretary of defense and dick 
darman at omb to begin negotiations immediately with the congress 
on mutually acceptable offsets from the defense budget that can be 
used for this democracy fund without having an unacceptable impact 
on national security 
i further propose that in the event that an agreement on offsets 
cannot be reached by march 27 the congress authorized me to select 
offsets from the defense budget and should neither of these 
alternatives prove to be workable i am prepared because of the 
dire need for these funds to ask for a waiver of the budget act to 
allow this critical program to proceed on the required timetable 
i urge the congress to move quickly and also urge in the 
strongest terms that it not add any extraneous requests items to 
this request 
it is urgent to advance the prospect for democracy and 
reconciliation in nicaragua and panama damage to both economies 
has been great we must help and we want to help our help is 
needed swiftly to bring about demilitarization and advance the 
whole central american peace process if bipartisanship prevails we 
will be able to meet this goal and respond to the expectations of 
our neighbors

president bush said today he is pursuing all 
leads in efforts to secure the release of us hostages in lebanon 
even those going around in back alleys 
when the whole story comes out on this you are going to be 
very very fascinated with the details very fascinated he told 
reporters at a white house news conference 
bushs aides confirmed last week that the president fell victim 
to a hoax when he accepted a telephone call from a man purporting 
to be iranian president hashemi rafsanjani the conversation took 
place several weeks ago aides said 
the president took the call after a man identifying himself as 
an iranaian official contacted the white house to say that 
rafsanjani wanted to talk about the american hostages in lebanon 
the captives are thought to be held by proiranian moslem shiites 
at his news conference bush refused to provide details of what 
his administration is doing on behalf of the eight americans held 
in lebanon 
but he said there are things that go on going around in back 
alleys and trying to find out information and weve got to do 
that i owe it to the families of those people and to those people 
themselves that are held hostage 
the bush administrations official policy on the hostages is 
that it will not negotiate with the hostageholders or their 
patrons at the same time officials say they are willing to talk 
with anyone about the hostages 
good will begets good will bush said 
eight americans are among 18 westerners thought to be hostages 
in lebanon the longest held american hostage terry anderson 
chief middle east correspondent for the associated press will mark 
his fifth year in captivity on friday 
bush said administration officials had not been trying to reach 
rafsanjani who has recently made statements indicating he would 
like to see the hostages freed soon 
hes got some political problems at home and we understand 
that bush said of rafsanjani 
earlier marlin fitzwater bushs spokesman said officials did 
not know who initiated the call but he did not rule out that it was 
perpetrated by a faction inside the iranian government 
while administration officials have said they were encouraged by 
rafsanjanis statements they say they have no reason to believe 
the hostages are on the verge of freedom

let me save the details for congressional briefings and give you 
the three broad categories of assistance aid for democracy for 
development and for demilitarization 
we want to help democratic institutions take root in each 
country but democracy begins with the rule of law and respect for 
human rights it needs the support of courts that are fair and free 
of every influence but the law it needs the support of police 
forces that are upright and honest and it needs our support 
development and demilitarization they go hand in hand they 
start when we provide textbooks for children when we create 
thousands of new jobs when the hand that held a gun guides a plow 
in short as we demobilize the military we must mobilize the 
market this is a great and historic task but we are inspired by 
the courage of our neighbors we are close very very close to a 
hemisphere that is completely democratic a compass of freedom that 
spans half the world from alaska to argentina and facing this 
enormous challenge we are not alone other nations can and must 
help but only america can take the lead on this one 
i stand prepared to work with the congress to do our part for 
reconstruction and reconciliation for democracy and now id be 
glad to respond to questions and helen i believe you have the 
first one 
q thank you mr president your warm reception of the 
rostenkowski plan does that mean youre ready to negotiate tax 
increases and a freeze on social security benefits things you have 
never gone for in the past 
a no it doesnt 
q off mike 
a the answer is no follow up 
q follow up 
a yeah 
qyou are not willing to negotiate or what is your 
a overall feeling look i think he without rancor without a 
lot of rhetoric made a very broad proposal weve made a proposal 
the administration we now would like to hear from the budget 
process on the hill what their proposal is and then well talk 
but i perhaps as i told some reporters yesterday i was being 
receptive though not knocking the things in it we dont like and 
there are plenty i was somewhat colored by the way in which 
chairman rostenkowski approached this and with the i think 
evident good will on his part and determination to try to break the 
ice and move the process forward we 
q youre not saying whether you would go for a tax increase or 
 
a no im not for a tax let me q how about a freeze on 
social security 
a well theres a lot of things im not for that are in his 
proposal a lot including taxes yeah terry 
q mr president the united states has never recognized the 
forced incorporation of lithuania into the soviet union now that 
lithuania has declared its independence the united states seems to 
be moving tentatively toward full recognition is that because 
were afraid of offending mr gorbachev or dont want to alienate 
him 
a its because we want to see the evolution of the control of 
the territory there and also we want to see peaceful resolution 
to this question 
q well do we still regard lithuania as a captive nation along 
with the other baltic states 
a we might not use that word but we never have regarded 
lithuania as incorporated into the soviet union thats been our 
policy and we rejoice as people are permitted the free expression 
that we take for granted in this country and clearly i think 
theres a great deal of interest in this concept of working it out 
lithuanians working it out with the soviets to achieve what they 
want and so were not standing in that way but in terms of 
recognition there is a standard of control of ones territory that 
we are that ive been advised should guide this yeah right here 
go across and then back 
q mr president are you considered about the apparent 
reluctance of the contras to disband and what can you do about it 
a yes i am concerned about it i talked to and im also 
concerned about certain military action by the sandinistas but i 
am also encouraged brit and i am encouraged because yesterday i 
talked to dan quayle and he told me of his visit with ortega where 
ortega seemed concerned about seemed willing to transfer the 
defense ministry seemed willing to transfer the interior ministry 
and was open about the discussion of reducing i want to be 
careful here i dont overstate it but reducing military action 
on both sides there is a united nations vehicle that can be 
helpful onuca 
unuoca staff on 
a on onuca onuca which is could have a useful role to 
play in the separation of forces and in getting done what violeta 
chamorro wants which is to both sides start laying down their 
weapons that onuca chuckles has got has support from other 
leaders in this hemisphere carlos andres perez i believe supports 
it i know mrs chamorro wants us to give more support to this so 
i will be ive asked the state department to look into that 
immediately so im less concerned than i was about the peaceful 
transfer of power including the military but i think to the 
degree both sides can start laying down weapons and moving towards 
the kind of market economies we are talking about and with less 
reliance on military its better so i cant say im not 
concerned but i am encouraged the way its going so far 
q mr president do you regret the other day raising the issue 
of settlements in east jerusalem 
a no i dont regret it i think i think all the speculation 
and commentary of the last 10 days have blown things way out of 
proportion what i was doing was reiterating united states policy 
but let me say this right now in israel theres internal 
developments taking place in the political scene there and i do 
not want to look

haitian exiles in florida arent sure about the 
woman chosen interim president of their homeland following the 
departure of a military leader but they will go along with the 
majority a community leader says 
haitis latest exleader lt gen prosper avril left haiti on 
monday aboard an air force plane which brought him to florida 
where he apparently spent only a few hours before leaving for an 
undetermined location 
a us government official speaking on condition he not be 
identified said avril left florida 
about 300 exiles gathered late monday according to police 
estimates many expressed cautious optimism about the latest 
government change which they hope will bring democracy to their 
caribbean homeland 
they were trying to learn more about ertha pascaltrouillot the 
supreme court judge designated by an opposition coalition to head a 
provisional civilian government in haiti 
the rev gerard jeanjuste a longtime leader in the south 
florida exile community that numbers at least 150000 claimed mrs 
pascaltrouillot had ties to the former regime of dictator 
jeanclaude baby doc duvalier 
but he added if the haitian people accept her we will accept 
her we will be very cautious 
mrs pascaltrouillots brother jazz guitarist alix pascal was 
shot in the back in portauprince in the late 1960s by a tonton 
macoute the feared secret police of francois papa doc 
duvalier jeanclaudes father and predecessor pascal now lives in 
new york city 
a group of haitian exiles demonstrated briefly monday afternoon 
outside the us attorneys office calling for an indictment of 
avril dozens more gathered outside the haitian refugee center in 
miamis little haiti neighborhood listening to radio reports and 
speakers 
most speakers called for avrils capture trial in haiti and 
execution for allegedly ordering the slayings of civilians and 
opposition leaders 
the haitian military has been linked to shipments of south 
american cocaine to florida but there was no indication that us 
authorities might charge avril 
as far as any charges are concerned this office will attempt 
to bring an indictment if there is sufficient evidence and 
information to justify it we strongly suggest that anyone that has 
such information turn it over to the dea said diane cossin 
executive assistant to us attorney dexter lehtinen 
the overall mood in little haiti seemed more anxious than 
boisterous after four years of instability and dashed hopes in 
their homeland 
the mood contrasted with nearriotous celebrations that broke 
out on feb 7 1986 when duvalier fled haiti to end his familys 
29year rule 
everybody is happy but we are still watching said pierre 
joseph 30 who said hes been in florida 10 years nothing 
changed yet maybe if we have elections then it will change

john poindexters lawyer attempted today to 
undermine oliver norths damaging testimony by confronting him with 
previous conflicting statements he made in the irancontra scandal 
in crossexamining the former white house aide richard beckler 
brought out norths earlier assertions that he was ordered to 
conceal his activities from poindexter and others in 1984 and most 
of 1985 
north testified at a pretrial hearing three months ago he had 
been told to disclose his contrarelated activities only to 
thennational security adviser robert mcfarlane and thencia 
director william casey 
on monday north testified that i cant think of any 
information he kept from poindexter who didnt become national 
security adviser until the end of 1985 
on monday north also testified that he watched poindexter 
destroy a politically embarrassing presidential document the 
destruction of the presidential paper depicting us involvement in 
a straight armsforhostages deal with iran was the most damaging 
testimony north gave monday during his second day on the witness 
stand at poindexters trial 
today on crossexamination beckler brought out that a 
succeeding presidential paper contained much the same language 
about us hostages 
the language in a succeeding paper indicates that one of the 
missions in the iran arms sales was to further the release 
of american hostages beckler said north readily agreed 
on monday irancontra prosecutor dan webb asked north you 
were present when john poindexter in his office ripped the 
paper into shreds 
not the way you describe said north 
you saw the former national security tear up the 
original finding webb asked 
tear it in two replied north 
he threw it in a waste basket behind his desk or put it in a 
burn bag asked webb 
i think he just put it on his desk replied north 
the finding approved a november 1985 shipment of hawk missiles 
to iran on the same day that he destroyed the finding poindexter 
told some house and senate intelligence committee members he hadnt 
found out about the hawk shipment until january 1986 
admiral poindexter was well aware of the hawks shipment 
he was aware because you kept advising him about it wasnt that 
right asked webb 
yes replied north 
president reagan on nov 13 1986 denied that the us 
government was swapping arms for hostages webb noted as he told 
north this document the finding on its face made ronald reagan 
out to be making a false statement to the american people 
i guess so north replied 
on crossexamining north poindexters lawyer richard beckler 
tried to portray north as a midlevel staffer who was remote from 
the national security adviser 
there are many things you did not tell your superiors 
beckler suggested while questioning the exnational security 
council aide 
i cant think of any right now north replied and later 
added i tried to keep my superiors apprised 
until he was confronted with testimony he gave at his own trial 
last year north maintained he didnt know his superiors were loath 
to use the finding as justification for the hawks shipment 
if i did i surmised it north said initially 
later he agreed with his earlier testimony in which he said 
the political people up the line from me to include admiral 
poindexter did not want that finding to be used as a 
justification for what had happened in 1985 
us district judge harold greene rebuked north several times 
for quibbles with webb over minor facts and for repeatedly 
failing to remember significant ones 
almost every time a question is asked he says he cant 
recall the judge complained of north who had been declared a 
hostile witness its like pulling teeth 
north also said poindexter approved his retrieving highly 
classified documents from national security council files on nov 
21 1986 which north then proceeded to alter and destroy with help 
from his secretary fawn hall 
north said former national security adviser robert mcfarlane 
directed him to make the changes in memos which north had written 
to mcfarlane detailing norths military assistance to the contras 
did you find mcfarlanes request at all bizarre 
strange greene asked north 
these were his mcfarlanes documents replied north 
these were not personal documents mr mcfarlanes house 
mortgage said greene you dont think that is at all strange 
i think it was futile said north 
im not asking futile said greene is this what goes on 
at the national security council all the time 
no your honor said north 
among the documents destroyed was a handwritten note by 
poindexter suggesting that something be done to stop a 
nicaraguanbound shipload of military equipment

testing of an experimental vaccine on 
california aids patients will be expanded and extended to 
individuals who are infected with the aids virus but have not 
developed symptoms of the disease 
the food and drug administration on monday granted permission 
for further testing of the vaccine developed by dr jonas salk 
the vaccine which uses an inactivated virus is being tested as 
a treatment for aids rather than as an agent to prevent someone 
from acquiring the fatal disease which destroys the bodys ability 
to fight infection 
researchers are trying to find out whether the inactivated virus 
will cause the body to produce specific cells called t cells that 
destroy other cells infected with the human immunodeficiency virus 
or hiv 
they hope that by stimulating the immune systems response to 
hiv the vaccine might halt or reverse spread of the virus in newly 
infected people those who have the virus but have not developed 
symptoms of aids or aidsrelated complex 
this vaccine is for treatment of aids said dr janet 
woodcock director of the fdas division of biological 
investigational new drugs use of this to prevent acquiring 
aids is a totally different question 
but she added trials like this in the hivinfected could 
yield information that could help design trials for the 
uninfected 
work has been accelerating on developing a vaccine to prevent 
aids but such a vaccine is at least 10 years away from being 
marketed she added 
under the fdaapproved plan initial testing will involve about 
60 people during a 36week trial researchers will test different 
doses of the vaccine 
the california trials which is testing individuals who have 
aids were approved under a state law that allows such testing 
strictly within california 
fda permission was required for the sponsor immune products 
ltd of san diego to expand the trials to testing centers outside 
california 
directors of the california study are seeking roman catholic 
priests and nuns as volunteers to take the vaccine as a control 
group because of their celibate lifestyles if any of those 
volunteers developed aids it would be because the vaccine was 
flawed 
in the fdaapproved trials only people already infected with 
the virus will be able to participate in the testing 
two other vaccines both genetically engineered have been 
approved for human testing in hivinfected individuals the first 
approved in august 1987 was made from an insect virus and 
developed by microgenesys inc of west haven conn the second 
made from the vaccinia virus and developed by bristolmyerssquibb 
co of new york was approved for human trials in november 1987 
a genetically engineered vaccine uses pieces of the virus that 
are replicated and do not contain anything that could be infectious 
unlike those two the salk vaccine uses an inactivated virus 
that has been partially stripped of its envelope or surface 
proteins salk used a similar technique in developing the polio 
vaccine 
using an inactivated virus in an uninfected person carries the 
risk that some traces of the virus may still be live and could 
infect the person being vaccinated

here are major elements of president bushs 
aid package for nicaragua and panama 
overall funds bush coupled a 300 million aid package to help 
nicaragua speed the transition to democracy with a renewed request 
for 500 million in aid to panama he requested the panama money 
earlier this year but it got sidetracked in congress on other 
issues 
the nicaragua and panama money would be diverted from 
unspecified pentagon programs an existing 21 million would be 
used for emergency aid to nicaragua including food some of it 
would be used to help reintegrate the contra rebels 
trade the president lifted a fiveyearold trade embargo 
against nicaragua he also took steps to allow nicaragua to resume 
shipping sugar to the united states and to make that nation 
eligible for dutyfree treatment for a variety of other products 
supplies some 60 million would be earmarked for providing 
critical agricultural supplies petroleum and medical supplies 
employment programs 10 million would help pay for emergency 
employment programs including ones designed to help turn 
soliders into farmers 
resettlement some 45 million would go toward helping speed the 
repatriation and resettlement of the usbacked contra forces and 
other refugees and an additional 1 million would be used for 
technical assistance in restructuring the economy 
international finance some 50 million would be used to help 
nicaragua pay off debt to the international monetary fund and other 
international financial institutions an additional 75 million 
would go toward helping to prop up the nicaraguan currency to help 
restructure the economy and aid the country with its 
balanceofpayments imbalance 
projects about 60 million would help pay for such projects as 
bridge road and highay repair and refurbishing schools and 
hospitals

three democrats waged a barefisted 
struggle for the gubernatorial nomination in todays primary while 
a millionaire oilman making his first run for office was expected 
to win the gop nomination outright 
the final preelection poll showed former gov mark white 
attorney general jim mattox and treasurer ann richards in a dead 
heat for the democratic nomination with clayton williams gaining 
more than half the republican vote 
turnout was brisk this morning in dallas and fort worth and 
fair in houston said officials at polling places in el paso 
voting was light in the first hour of balloting said el paso 
county election clerk robert rodriguez 
the secretary of states office predicted a turnout of 21 
million to 26 million of the 83 million eligible voters who can 
vote in either primary each partys choice needs more than 50 
percent of the vote to avoid a runoff 
williams said if he wins outright and the democrats are forced 
into a runoff april 10 he will relax and have some fun watching 
each of the democrats murdering on each other 
the winner in november will succeed republican gov bill 
clements who is retiring 
ms richards known for her caustic keynote speech at the 1988 
democratic national convention in which she said thenvice 
president bush was born with a silver foot in his mouth held a 
slim lead in the latest poll 
mudslinging has been the mainstay of the democratic campaign 
ms richards accused her rivals of profiteering from public 
service they lashed out at her for refusing to say whether she has 
used illegal drugs 
bush who maintains a residence in houston told reporters in 
washington today that he voted in the texas primary and that he 
felt a candidates past drug use should not necessarily be held 
against him or her 
i think thats a matter for the voters to decide bush said 
but in my view if somebody used marijuana some time ago and is 
not into anything of that nature why no i dont think that 
should be held against them 
in recent days ms richards questioned how white could afford 
to move into a 13 million houston estate after leaving the 
governors mansion in 1987 
she attacked mattox for accepting 200000 in contributions from 
danny faulkner whose trial on charges of heading a scheme that 
cost lending institutions 500 million ended in a hung jury 
mattox campaigning monday in the dallas neighborhood where he 
grew up called ms richards charges scurrilous and said her 
refusal to answer the drug questions had led her into a really 
gutterstyle campaign 
white said he would have challenged ms richards to a fistfight 
if she were a man everything she said is the greatest pack of 
lies ive ever heard he said 
ms richards a recovering alcoholic has refused in three 
debates to answer yes or no when asked if shed used illegal drugs 
she said if she answered it might discourage people with drug 
problems from seeking help 
a houston chronicledallas morning news poll published sunday 
showed richards favored by 28 percent of people who said theyd 
vote democrat the poll gave mattox 25 percent and white 24 
percent the margin of error was 45 points 
williams who describes himself as just a country boy 
warned his supporters against complacency after the final poll 
showed him leading no 2 republican kent hance 55 percent to 13 
percent two other gop hopefuls jack rains of houston and dallas 
lawyer tom luce received 8 percent each the margin of error was 
5 points 
ive been talking about those guys getting lost in my dust i 
want to be sure our voters dont get lost in the dust said 
williams his 8 million televisionsavvy campaign included nearly 
6 million from his own pocket 
voters were asked to choose nominees for dozens of other offices 
in the us senate primary republican incumbent phil gramm was 
unopposed and state sen hugh parmer faced harley schlanger a 
follower of extremist lyndon larouche on the democratic side 
state gop chairman fred meyer said his party was focusing on the 
democratcontrolled legislature which will control redistricting 
after the 1990 census the census is expected to add three or four 
seats to texas 27member congressional delegation

assured her nothing would happen ms averitte said weve got 
another group leaving for london today but theyre flying

switch train a locomotive use to move freight cars around yard he 
said the cars were being taken to a siding for cleaning and 
probably were empty 
most of the passengers boarded chartered buses en route to their 
destinations or to washington where they could board northbound

q my nicaragua question is you are not proposing to congress 
exactly where to cut in the defense budget youre basically 
leaving that to them why dont you tell them where they should cut 
specifically 
a on offsets 
q yes 
a from the defense budget 
q why dont you say heres a b2 take it and 
a we are we are doing that and what im saying to them is 
q where 
a well thats in negotiation up there but what ive also said 
here is if youre not willing to do it give me the authority on 
march 27 and itll be done like that i am willing to do it 
q where 
a were going to take the hits were negotiating with congress 
now 
q why not tell the american people 
a well tell them on march 27 if they turn it to me and right 
now i dont know how much of its confidential but ill let the 
secretary of defense answer the question but were theres i 
dont see any great secrecy in this what were trying to do is to 
give the congress the ball and say heres what we recommend 
now you you know tell us what you want to do but dont go 
making a lot of addons do it the way we feel is necessary to keep 
the focus on nicaragua and panama 
i think congress has a very legitimate role here but if theyre 
not willing to fulfill it lesley we have no problem giving you a 
list that would take care of it just like that but i think its 
the congresss role now to work with our people 
q why does gephardt get under your skin so much youve got an 
i dont know 80 percent approval rating he makes a speech 
attacking you and 
a well what have i said now what would make you think 
laughter that he gets under my skin 
q well he says youre not a strong leader 
a oh i know 
q and all the people around you at the white house 
a i know thats so discouraging but what laughter but 
what with a laugh but why do you think it gets under my skin 
q off mike 
a the honest answer is i know you wont believe this it 
doesnt it doesnt i think were going in the right direction 
were talking substance and policy i think the many in the 
congress think that we are being responsive but look i expect 
that i expect that kind of political criticism but i think if you 
want to talk about the substance of his ideas do i think its a 
good idea to loan money to the soviet union today no we have no 
request for food aid to the soviet union do you just want to put 
it on a ship and send it over there no i dont think thats a 
particularly brilliant idea but i dont want to knock the man 
maybe hell come upon a good idea one of these days yeah 
laughter 
q the nicaraguans and the panamanians are expecting aid very 
soon they are in urgent need of the aid 
a exactly 
q and the panamanians say that they cannot wait any longer 
what can you do besides congress when can they expect something 
a im going to have this question replayed on capitol hill 
because youre absolutely right there is a sense of urgency and i 
would like to take the opportunity here to encourage the movement 
in the congress we sent a proposal up on panama now lets get 
going on it now we are coupling it with nicaragua now lets going 
on it the there is an urgency in nicaragua too but panama 
very urgent and so we are going to were going to keep keep 
pushing but i think you are right on target with that hypothesis 
yes

a white wall of fog and papermill 
smoke was blamed for a flaming 52vehicle pileup that killed three 
people and injured 30 
it was just horrible terrible to hear the brakes squeal the 
gas tanks explode to hear the people screaming said harry 
suppanz 35 of sturgeon bay a passenger in a truck that crashed 
and burned monday morning 
the chainreaction collision took place on the tower drive 
bridge which carries interstate 43 over the fox river 
police lt bob boncher said an unprecedented combination of fog 
and smoke from three paper mills created a 100footlong white 
wall that reduced visibility to less than 10 feet 
it was just like driving into a milk bottle said fire capt 
rolland becker 
boncher said the crash started at 648 am when two cars and a 
truck apparently slowed down because the drivers could not see once 
they hit the cloud crashes continued for 3 to 5 minutes before the 
smoke and fog lifted 
five minutes after i got there you could see plain as day 
boncher said 
investigators said the combination of fog and smoke has never 
before occurred on the bridge which opened in 1980 
the line of smashed cars stretched about 450 feet 
there were tires exploding and occasionally a gas tank was 
blowing becker said 
deputy traffic chief robert kreuser said more cars than normal 
would have been on the bridge because one of the citys four other 
spans over the fox river was closed for repairs he said the closed 
bridge normally carries 20000 vehicles a day 
the victims were killed in separate cars and were in the middle 
of the pileup said brown county coroner genie williams 
i couldnt believe it when i saw only three did die she 
said it was amazing that many people got out 
police capt larry gille today said the victims had been 
identified as jennie m strnad 20 of green bay susan m chriske 
40 of green bay and terrance i mellberg 40 of manitowoc

q mr president last week we learned that you were so 
concerned about the hostages that you were willing to take a 
questionable call and it might have been from the iranian 
president and then of course you found out it wasnt in 
response rafsanjani made a statement saying that you have been 
trying to get a hold of him for a month did you actually then try 
to place a call t the real person or could you clarify 
a i dont know where he got that i saw that statement and it 
was it was there were no truth in it our trying to contact him 
for a month itd be very easy to do i responded to an incoming 
call i think the bottomline is you have to say would you do it 
again based on the information you had and id say yeah i 
probably would it may be difficult for somebody to get through 
again but laughter but whats wrong with reaching out and 
touching someone when the hostages are at stake the hostages are 
at stake here and whats wrong with trying and i look i feel 
this all the time ive talked about this that i will go the extra 
mile and when the whole story comes out on this you all are going 
to be very very fascinated with the details very fascinated 
q tell us 
q what is 
a but im just telling you that it is important it is very 
important to run down every avenue in terms of these hostages and 
i would be remiss if i didnt and there are things that go on 
going around in back alleys and trying to find out information and 
weve got to do that i owe it to the families of those people and 
to those people themselves that are held hostage 
q can i follow up mr president 
a yeah 
q if you didnt try to reach him for a month can you say 
whether you or anyone acting on your behalf did try to reach him at 
all 
a have we been trying to reach rafsanjani 
q have you tried yes 
a no other than this one one phone call that turns out to be 
a hoax 
q so as far as you can tell what he was saying just didnt 
make any sense 
a yeah its very much like the rhetoric that they use from 
time to time hes got some political problems at home and we 
understand that the main thing is can we move forward and get the 
hostages out and i will repeat good will begets good will and i 
think that i think that i am satisfied that even in this instance 
the officials there know that nobody is trying to set them up or 
anything of that nature i am interested in saving american lives 
q mr president i understand that tass is reporting this 
morning this morning that the soviet parliament has granted 
president gorbachev the expanded powers he wants and has been 
requesting i am interested sir if you side with those within the 
soviet union who fear that there are not sufficient checks and 
balances on this new presidential system that it could result in a 
more totalitarian soviet union how do you feel this might affect 
your dealings with gorbachev and whether you envision extending 
this fund for democracy perhaps one day to the soviet union 
itself 
a i speak i answer that by saying i stay out of the internal 
affairs and deliberations of the soviet union and they are going 
through a process of reform which we support in broad terms 
perestroika they are going through a process of glasnost which is 
openness which we support and it would be very inappropriate for 
the president of the united states to start passing judgment as 
that process of perestroika democratization if you will moves 
forward and so yes the soviets have created a new post of 
president i hear but thats their business and we will work with 
the in this instance president gorbachev as you know i think 
we have a reasonably good relationship there respectful one and 
im going to continue to work with him 
q can you say sir whether you think that as you continue to 
work with him that will be affected in any way by these changes 
that have taken place or is it going to be as it has been between 
you and mr gorbachev and would you see involving the soviet union 
in this fund for democracy 
a involving you mean asking them to give money to 
q no no no no no including them making them if not 
currently as gephardt has suggested perhaps one day a 
beneficiary of this fund for democracy

a i think the answer is to help in a technical way as best we 
can for moving helping the soviets move towards market economies 
and free markets and those kinds of consideration i think thats 
the next step we ought to take and i you know theres 
discussion of an eastern development bank the question is out 
there whether the soviets should be members of that bank or not 
and as a matter of fact we have some deliberations going on as to 
what the us position should be right now im not prepared to 
state it but ive been spending some time on this question 
but its thats an idea that was surfaced by francois 
mitterrand i believe so there are all kinds of ways in which down 
the road we could work with the soviet union but i think what they 
need now from us is knowhow and technical knowledge that kind of 
thing yeah dave 
q mr president after your meeting in palm springs with prime 
minister kaifu he took a real beating in the japanese diet and i 
wonder if in retrospect were there any misunderstandings in your 
conversations he was accused in japan by his critics of having 
made some concessions or reached a level of detail in your 
discussions that some in japan were unhappy with could you is 
there any clarification needed about what came out of palm springs 
a you know what i think those reports just highlight the 
sensitivity of the situation in japan and i think as far as im 
concerned the talks were very good we followed up incidentally 
with close to an hour with mr takeshita yesterday and covered the 
same broad agenda i didnt go into every specific but im 
convinced that both mr kaifu left palm springs and takeshita will 
leave washington with a far better understanding of the problems 
that we face and hopefully i have a better understanding of 
theirs so i think im aware of the criticism against him at home 
but i think that i would just go back to the statements he made 
when he left palm springs which i viewed as very constructive 
q just one followup you said in a speech the day after you got 
back to the electronics association that you had discussed 
telecommunications with him and that apparently came as a surprise 
to some people in japan was that a brief discussion a lengthy one 
a a broad discussion of several categories and the only i 
dont know in terms of the amount of time but all these were we 
left the details of all of these categories that are so wellknown 
as differences between the us and japan to the experts in fact i 
think bob mosbacher will be going there soon if hes not already 
on his way and so it was more broad in general but categories 
mentioned yes 
q do you still expect the summit with mr gorbachev will take 
place in washington the last two weeks of june 
a weve got to get that set soon in terms of pin down the dates 
and the place but in terms of expectation yes ellen 
q mr president the announcement no one wants to hear the 
delay of baseballs opening day is imminent is there anything that 
you as the first fan can do laughter to bring the sides 
closer together to prevent a tragic delay of the baseball season 
a you know i made a comment on that yesterday and i misspoke 
because i said strike and we understandably got some calls 
from some of the ballplayers saying hey thats not technically 
what the situation is please yes im a ball fan and i want to 
go to the opening game someplace last year i went to the american 
league this year i would like to the national league if possible 
i dont know whether its going to work maybe going to end up in 
baltimore 
but i want to see i dont want to intervene weve already 
taken a battle on that up there on another labor matter have the 
federal government intervene but i would simply appeal to both 
sides to get the matter resolved so the american people can hear 
that cry play ball again yeah ellen

anatoli karpov and jan timman 
adjourned their fourth game tuesday in the world chess championship 
candidates final match after 61 moves 
the two players will resume play thursday with timman to move 
grandmasters analyzing the game were divided in their assessment 
of the position ian rogers of australia believed timman playing 
black was in a better position but im ligterink and grandmaster 
oleg romanishin said it was unclear 
karpovs second believed timman had a slight advantage after 30 
moves the position was so complex that karpov was in serious time 
trouble after 51 moves 
the players had to make 40 moves each in the first two hours and 
another 20 moves in an hour although they managed to meet the two 
time controls experts believe the players missed the best possible 
continuations 
in the opening the two grandmasters followed the gruenfeld 
defense which they played in the second game 
karpov varied on move 9 by castling instead of moving bg5 this 
was seen as an improvement from the second game and timman had to 
defend a very difficult position 
but the dutch grandmaster managed to equalize on move 25 when he 
put his pawn on e5 offering a pawn on the dfile karpov declined 
apparently thinking it too dangerous to accept the sacrifice 
the winner of this match will move on to meet garri kasparov for 
the world title in lyons france in october 
karpov leads the series 21 having won the first game and drawn 
games 2 and 3 karpov and timman are to play a 12game match the 
winner will be the first player to reach a score of 6 points 
for wednesdays game 5 timman will play white

q i have a followup here sir im reminded by one of the 
senior correspondents back here 
a uhhuh 
q laughter that lyndon johnson used to lock up both sides 
and say dont come out until youve got a settlement is that 
a prospect here 
a not on this particular issue but on some issues that could 
well prove to be a prospect yeah kathy 
q mr president have you been in contact with president endara 
about his fast and do you view that as a useful means of 
expressing the plight of the panamanian people as they wait 
a well i have not talked to him since the fast began and i 
did note with interest some very supportive statements out of him 
after the fast began supportive of our administration and what 
were trying to do but thats a matter for him to determine yeah 
q how can you off mike 
q mr president in your opening statement you in your 
opening statement you appealed to congress to pass your aid 
program but you did not appeal to the american people and one of 
the problems a lot of congressmen say theyre having is that 
foreign aid at this time is not a high priority for a lot of 
people what do you do you think an appeal first of all to 
ordinary americans is necessary and what do you say to people who 
think that perhaps what may be seen as the first part of a peace 
dividend is going overseas 
a i think you put your finger on a good point however i 
believe that both nicaragua and panama have strong support from the 
american people in fact theres new information on that but i 
think they raise a good point i mean theres a lot of domestic 
problems but were sorting this out now and i am convinced that 
when the american people understand what were talking about about 
offsetting proposals in defense in other words not going in 
there and costing them more or taking it away from some other 
program that it will have strong support but im not im not 
unsympathetic to that argument but where i would differ is i think 
the american people would strongly support what were saying here 
i think they see a lot at stake for us in a totally democratic 
hemisphere and the success of democracy in nicaragua 
q do you feel we particularly owe it to the people of those two 
countries given our military activities in both nicaragua and 
panama 
a do we owe do we owe support 
q do we owe money 
a i dont think i think were well weve lifted the 
embargos and weve released the funds so to the degree theres 
anything owed were trying to comply with that but what im 
proposing here is an investment in democracy i dont think anybody 
would say you know argue have the american people try to 
believe that we owe it but its the right thing to do and we want 
to see violeta chamorro supported and we want to see the panamanian 
democracy succeed so thats the way id phrase it 
q mr president 
q let me ask you about one 
q mr president 
a i have a meeting with the congress at 1045 and i dont want 
to get i mean 945 945 sorry accept the correction please 
q its primary day in texas mr president can you tell us two 
questions one 
a now were talking laughter 
q for whom you voted in the republican primary and number 
two do you think it should be held against a candidate if perhaps 
at some point in the past they used drugs but no longer youve 
talked on that issue before can you go back over it for us 
a this is election day in texas i did vote in the texas 
republican primary i will not tell you who i voted for i hope 
everybody understands otherwise wed have a quiz around here of 
who we voted for earlier on its not a proper question to to 
reveal 
</TEXT>

<TEXT>
q but on the drugs issue which is an issue in the primary and 
certainly may be in the general election do you think it should be 
held against a candidate that at some point in the past they have 
used drugs 
a i think thats a matter for the voters to decide but in 
terms in my view if somebody used marijuana some time ago and is 
not into anything of that nature why no i dont think that 
should be held against them 
q what if it were more than marijuana sir 
a youre getting me involved in the texas primary something i 
dont want to do craig the polls are the polls opened down 
there about two hours ago and im not 
q youll be involved in the general election though wont you 
a ill be involved but im not going to fine tune that im 
not going to go into that 
q you read the reports of soviet noncompliance of the inf 
treaty in a number of instances in east germany do you think that 
that could throw a monkey wrench into the cfe and start talks 
a to the degree that there are differences on verification on 
inf weve got to work those out and weve got our experts working 
the problem and trying to eliminate any differences 
q what about the differences reported between secretary cheney 
and cia director webster over the threat assessment if 
a just a minute 
q in the event that gorbachev is thrown from power 
a just one minute on that one as i have said before 
laughter and the president laughs i dont see any real 
disagreement here laughter no laughs i tried to answer 
that yesterday and i expect i didnt didnt lay it to rest but i 
dont think anybody believes including cheney that the soviet 
system is going to go back to where it was in you know before 
1980 and the middle of the 80s 
but there are differences when you go to try to predict with 
accuracy based on intentions and so ive talked to them now and 
i feel that they are pretty close together and i its difficult 
when you have a fast changing world and yet you take a position 
like i do we must retain a credible defense then you get into a 
big debate well what is credible and i think thats what you 
are seeing here 
so i can tell you having talked to these gentlemen i dont 
think that there is this enormous defense difference between the 
intelligence community and i say community or and the 
secretary i think we have come up with a prudent well thought out 
defense plan and there will be changes i am sure after our 
cooperation with and consultation with congress but believe me 
these are not diametrically different views that you are reading 
about 
q mr president 
a shall we end with this one i really do have a 945 
q mr president here is a question that i please wish you 
would decide and i think only you can youre going to have to deal 
with billions and billions of surplus weapons what are you going 
to do with those there has been some indication that you have 
already given 1000 tanks from europe out of that surplus to 
egypt if you keep on giving these and selling them on credit 
these arms that we have youre going to keep on creating wars in 
the third world and other nations 
a one of the 
q mr president would you do this at the microphone 
a right here this is a depart laughter one of the things 
that is part of the negotiations on cfe is destruction of weapons 
and so that is and were talking about significant numbers and i 
had a meeting yesterday with jim woolsey our cfe negotiator and 
he was spelling out for me just the mechanical difficulties of 
doing this but nevertheless we are determined that that will be 
the approach thats taken with these massive numbers of weapons we 
still have security needs that we feel are enhanced by transfer of 
military equipment sales of military equipment to friendly 
countries but were so the policy will remain as it is but we 
will go forward with the destruction where that is a part of the 
policy 
thank you all very much thank you

the soviet congress of peoples deputies today 
approved mikhail s gorbachevs plan for a stronger presidency a 
post the soviet leader says is essential to hold the country 
together as his reforms go forward 
the congress the countrys top legislative body also scrapped 
the clauses of the constitution that guarantee the communist 
partys leading role in society which would create a multiparty 
system it also legalized private ownership of factories 
we are standing before the greatest most meaningful step in 
the history of our government gorbachev told the parliament 
this is the first step toward a western political system 
said deputy fyodor burlatsky 
later today the deputies were expected to nominate gorbachev to 
a fouryear term as president then decide whether the congress or 
the public would elect the new president 
it is expected that after the initial four years the term would 
become five years and the president would be popularly elected 
the lawmakers approved the measure on the presidency by a vote 
of 1817 to 133 with 61 abstentions the official tass news agency 
said a twothirds majority of the 2250member congress of 
peoples deputies was required for the motion to pass 
deputies broke into applause when the bill passed 
the measures on the presidency had earlier been approved by the 
supreme soviet the smaller parliament that handles daytoday 
business after making significant alterations 
the vote on scrapping the partys leading role passed in the 
congress by a vote of 1771 to 164 with 74 abstentions 
gorbachev has argued the more powerful presidency is needed to 
keep the soviet union intact as he presses ahead with his reforms 
while facing a crumbling economy and growing independence movements 
lithuanians had been so dismayed by the proposal on the more 
powerful presidency that they rushed to declare independence before 
it passed on sunday estonia latvia and georgia have all taken 
moves in that direction 
his victory on the proposal came despite a boycott by a group of 
progressive deputies worried about placing too much power in the 
hands of one person in a country with a history of dictatorship 
the vote on the presidency bill also was boycotted by 
representatives of several independenceminded republics who said 
the president would be too strong for the loose federation of 
independent nations they see as the future soviet union 
abstaining had the same effect as voting no because gorbachev 
was struggling to put together the twothirds majority needed for 
constitutional amendments 
to succeed today gorbachev backed off some demands that had 
disturbed legislators from some republics who felt he would have 
too much power those demands included the presidents right to 
declare on his own a state of emergency and to suspend the 
parliaments of the republics 
the presidency bill creates a chief executive who can propose 
legislation veto laws passed by the supreme soviet legislature 
declare war or martial law and overrule cabinet members vice 
president anatoly lukyanov said monday it also clearly separates 
executive and legislative powers for the first time 
the historic change in article 6 of the soviet constitution 
drops language defining the communist party as the leading and 
guiding force of soviet society and the nucleus of its political 
system of all state organizations and public organizations 
the new article reads the communist party of the soviet 
union other party trade union and youth organizations other 
social organizations and mass movements shall participate through 
their representatives elected to the soviets of peoples deputies 
as well as in other ways in shaping the policies of the soviet 
state and in running the state and social affairs 
an effort to drop the words communist party from the article 
entirely received 1067 votes in favor to 906 against but fell 
short of the necessary twothirds majority 
earlier today gorbachev said a legislative commission was 
studying the lithuanian independence declaration and that he would 
consider the status quo not to have changed until the entire 
situation is cleared up 
we welcome the fact that deputies from all the republics 
including lithuania are in attendance he said 
on monday another member of the communist partys ruling 
politburo yegor k ligachev said moscow would not use force in 
lithuania 
soviet vice president anatoly lukyanov introduced the latest 
draft of the presidency proposal monday by promising there is no 
reason to believe that the institution of the presidency would lead 
to alleged authoritarian power 
lukyanov said the bill creates checks and balances between the 
executive and legislative branches of power he said it allows 
congress to recall the president for breaking the law and restricts 
the passage of legislation to the congress and the supreme soviet 
the standing legislature 
the current constitution allows the leadership of the supreme 
soviet which gorbachev heads to issue decrees 
throughout monday deputies huddled with gorbachev and each 
other seeking compromises 
several of the independenceoriented republics have adopted 
constitutional amendments allowing them to suspend soviet laws on 
their territory 
gorbachev supporter sergei alexeyev argued that the soviet union 
is in a paralysis of power and the presidency is the only 
way to transfer the real power from the communist party to the 
government 
if the presidency issue is resolved positively we can get 
down to drafting a new constitution immediately which will confirm 
human rights democracy and conversion to a market economy 
alexeyev said 
but yuri afanasyev a leader of a group of progressive deputies 
urged that the presidency be adopted only in conjunction with a new 
constitution direct election of the president real opposition 
parties and freedom of the press

the central committee of mongolias 
communist party met late into the night on tuesday as a record 
number of members vied to make speeches on proposed sweeping 
political changes 
foreign ministry spokesman tepbishiin chimeddorj said most of 
the central commmitees more than 120 members had lined up to make 
speeches forcing its special plenary session into overtime 
the meeting which began monday was expected to continue 
through wednesday and possibly even thursday 
the committee is expected to ratify the ruling politburos 
decisions monday to abolish the partys constitutional guarantee on 
power replace the politburo and party general secretary jambyn 
batmonh hold early legislative elections and write a new 
constitution 
chimeddorj said reformists and conservatives in the leadership 
were debating the dramatic moves and those in favor far exceeded 
opponents 
mongolias fledgling opposition groups whose demonstrations 
since january accelerated this pastoral countrys retreat from 
staliniststyle communism held separate meetings tuesday to plan 
strategies and improve their organization in preparation for the 
expected legislaltive elections 
we have a lot of work to do said nandad orkmon a member of 
the executive committee of thte social democrat movement i am 
studying right now the american system i have some english books 
and i am also studying the systems of other western countries 
still we dont understand exactly how they work 
the social democrats along with mongolias two other opposition 
parties the mongolian democratic party and the national 
progressive party that was formed only tuesday said it was too 
early to name candiates for the legislature or presidency 
another social democrat leader r gonchigdorz said it was 
impossible to analyze what was going in inside the closed central 
committee meeting of the ruling party 
some opposition party members suggested it was only the aging 
members of the ruling communist party who were dragging their feet 
on reform however none was able to identify these members by name 
the internal workings of the party have been secret for so many 
decades that nobody is sure how the factions are lined up they 
said 
chimeddorj has said it too soon to give details on what form the 
new national leadership would take 
chimeddorj said central committee members had been arguing 
behind closed doors about the reform proposals and practically 
nobody opposed them 
in general we can say in the central committee there are 
radicals and conservatives they are arguing but the viewpoints of 
the conservatives also are changing 
the social democrats and other opposition parties are pressing 
for legislative elections to be held in june or july 
chimeddorj said the central committee was considering whether to 
ask the legislature the great peoples hural to hold a vote of 
confidence on batmonh who also is president and premier dumaagiyn 
sodnom 
both the new progressives and social democrats expressed support 
for batmonh continuing as president during what they referred to as 
a transition period during which democratic institutions are to be 
established 
a small group of members of the official communist partys youth 
league held a small demonstration tuesday outside the leagues 
headquarters speakers said they opposed the youth leagues close 
ties with the party 
about 200 people listened to the hourlong rally but there was 
little applause 
one demonstrator a student who identified himself only as 
batbold said all the young students and workers want radical 
reform in the youth league but the leagues central committee 
wants only to change the name 
he said he and many other youth league members planned to turn 
in their membership cards and form an alternative youth 
organization

president bush today lifted a fiveyear trade 
embargo against nicaragua and asked congress to provide 300 
million quickly to help speed the transition to democracy he said 
the funds should come from the pentagon budget 
bush also renewed his call for 500 million in assistance to 
panama where an american invasion force installed a new government 
last december he said both central american nations need our 
help to heal deep wounds after years of political and economic 
struggle 
bushs 45minute news conference coincided with a vote by the 
soviet congress granting mikhail gorbachev stronger powers as 
president bush said it would be very inappropriate for him to 
pass judgment on the process of reform in the soviet union 
it was the first time in 10 days that bush had met with 
reporters and in fielding numerous questions he said 
he remains opposed to higher taxes and social security 
limitations to eliminate the budget deficit but he said he was 
prepared to negotiate with congressional democrats over a 
deficitcutting plan 
every president wants to see interest rates lower but he 
denied the existence of a bubbling war with alan greenspan 
chairman of the federal reserve 
he was disappointed that the communist government in china has 
not made progress toward democratic reforms but said i have no 
regrets about the administrations china policy 
appealed to major league owners and ball players to settle 
their labor dispute so the american people can hear that cry 
play ball again 
said a longago use of marijuana shouldnt disqualify a 
political candidate the question arose in the context of a 
political flap in texas where ann richards who is seeking the 
democratic gubernatorial nomination has refused to say whether she 
ever used illegal drugs 
bush also showed his zest for political combat when he said of 
house democratic leader richard gephardt a frequent critic i 
dont want to knock the man maybe hell come up with a good idea 
one of these days 
bush was asked about the telephone call he held several days go 
with the man who he thought incorrectly was iranian president 
hashemi rafsanjani the president admitted it was a hoax but 
said whats wrong with reaching out and touching someone 
the hostages are at stake he said 
bush said things are going on in back alleys involving the 
fate of the eight american hostages he stressed his determination 
to do all he could to free them the longest held hostage 
associated press reporter terry anderson will mark his fifth 
anniversary in captivity on friday 
the president opened his news conference by announcing that he 
had lifted the fiveyear trade embargo that former president reagan 
had imposed against the sandinista government of daniel ortega 
ortega was defeated in last months elections by opposition 
candidate violetta chamorro ortega told vice president dan quayle 
in chile on monday that he would abide by the results of the 
elections and permit an orderly transition to democracy 
bush called for creation of a fund for democracy to assist 
nicaragua and panama 
he also said he will seek an additional 200 million in economic 
assistance for nicaragua in fiscal year 1991 which begins oct 1 
the 300 million would be for immediate use 
bush afterwards briefed republican congressional leaders on his 
aid package rep duncan hunter rcalif chairman of the house 
gop research committee said the president expressed concern on 
getting the us aid to those who need it the most 
defense department spokesman pete williams said 81 million of 
the money for nicaragua would come from deferral of construction at 
bases being considered for closing 83 million from a freeze of 
civilian personnel of the department 11 million from cancellation 
of repair work on the turret of the uss iowa 69 million from 
savings due to improvements in the engines of kc135 airplanes 30 
million from delay in submitting an antisubmarine warfare package 
18 million from not going ahead immediately with a proposed mobile 
armored reconaissance vehicle and 9 million from an abandoned 
plan for replacement of nato frigates 
the president never mentioned the contras the rebels who 
received millions of dollars from the united states during the 
reagan administration but his aid request includes about 45 
million to help pay costs of relocating some 10000 contra rebels 
and tens of thousands of family members from camps along the 
honduran border to homes inside nicaragua 
bush urged congress to speed the aid on its way by april 5 and 
to assist the administration in identifying pentagon programs that 
could absorb the needed reductions without having an unacceptable 
impact on national security 
at another point however he said he was prepared to submit a 
list of suggested pentagon cuts on his own it will be done like 
that he said snapping his fingers for emphasis 
bushs plan for aid to panama has been bogged down in congress 
over the issue of which programs would lose money to finance the 
assistance 
bush called mrs chamorro on monday to brief her about the aid 
package a source said 
the president paid tribute to the extraordinary worldwide move 
toward democracy in 1989 and said the drive for freedom leaves 
us with a new challenge how best to support newborn democracies 
these nations need our help to heal deep wounds he said 
on other topics bush responded with a blunt no when asked 
whether he would freeze social security benefits or raise taxes to 
reduce the federal deficit a senior house democrat made such 
proposals last weekend as part of a comprehensive deficitcutting 
plan 
bush said his administration had an encouraging response to the 
plan by rep dan rostenkowski dill because it showed evident 
goodwill he said that despite his distaste for some specifics 
he was prepared to negotiate with congress to reduce the 
deficit 
theres a lot of things that im not for that are in his 
proposal a lot including taxes the president said 
asked if the administration would recognize a drive for 
independence by the soviet republic of lithuania bush said we 
want to see the evolution of the control of the territory there 
bush said the soviet union had not requested direct us aid and 
he criticized gephardt for proposing such assistance 
responding to gephardts criticism that he was running an 
administration guided by public opinion polls bush said i dont 
want to knock the man maybe hell come up with a good idea one of 
these days 
on a sensitive economic issue bush also declined to be drawn 
into speculation about whether he would reappoint greenspan the 
chairman of the federal reserve whose term expires next year some 
members of the administration have said federal reserve concerns 
about inflation have kept interest rates relatively high 
look every president would like to see interest rates lower 
theres no question bush said theres no bubbling war with 
alan greenspan he said such disputes over economic policy are 
common in every administration 
asked about the major league baseball dispute bush said yes 
im a ball fan and i want to go to the opening game some place 
he said but he quickly added he didnt want to have the federal 
government intervene in the decision by owners to lock players 
out of spring training camps

threetime winner susan butcher pushed into 
the lead of the iditarod trail sled dog race again today during the 
treacherous crossing of icecovered norton sound on the bering sea 
and after a short rest she and her team took off on the final 
171 miles of the 11058mile race from anchorage to nome 
race observers expect the winner to reach nome on wednesday 
evening of the 70 teams that began the race in anchorage on march 
3 seven have scratched and another was disqualified because of 
sick dogs 
butcher left the shaktoolik checkpoint late monday eight minutes 
behind defending champion joe runyan but had passed him by the end 
of the nighttime 30mile ice crossing today and had built a 
55minute lead 
the mushers head out onto the ice of norton sound trying to save 
time and miles but it is one of the most dangerous segments of the 
race open water leads in the ice can force timeconsuming detours 
or swallow an unwary team 
once they get onto the bering sea ice they can expect 
sudden storms and an ample supply of wind gail somerville an 
iditarod spokeswoman in anchorage said monday night 
named for an abandoned goldmining town along the trail the 
iditarod was started in 1973 to commemorate the 1925 emergency 
delivery of lifesaving diphtheria serum from anchorage to nome by 
sled dog teams 
the winner will get 50000 and the rest of a 200000 purse 
will be split among the next 19 finishers

q mr president there was a report last week that you are so 
angry and upset at the feds failure to lower interest rates that 
you wouldnt reappoint chairman greenspan next year when his term 
ends can you comment on whether there is any thought youve given 
yet to the question of reappointing mr greenspan and the level of 
frustration you do feel about interest rates 
a no there is no discussion of that nature at all i didnt 
i sure i saw the report i saw some speculation someplace maybe 
it was on a on the tv but i have no thats never been 
discussed with me now if the question is am i happy with interest 
rates look every president would like to see interest rates 
lower theres no question i dont i dont knock the concern 
that some have on inflation 
a president has to be concerned about inflation too but there 
is no bubbling war with alan greenspan and thats what i got from 
what commentary i heard that there was but you know going back 
a few years here its ever been thus hasnt it when theres a 
when there are some differences its always built into a conflict 
between the president and the chairman of the fed and i dont want 
to get into that game because i dont i dont feel that way 
q but is there a particular feeling at this point that the fed 
is dragging its feet somewhat in getting interest rates down 
a i think some feel that way and i think some probably agree 
with the concerns of the inflationary concerns that have been 
expressed so but im not in a mode a fedbashing mode i also 
think its very sensitive in terms of markets and everything else 
for to even go as far as i have done trying to say very little 
scattered laughter and succeeding only moderately yes 
q mr president youve been at near historical public approval 
ratings now for well into your first term 80 percent or more and 
my question is whether you believe in spending some of this 
popularity on something controversial like say what specifically 
do you like about rostenkowskis proposal or just hoarding it you 
know whats the goal 
a i dont believe it is one thing i dont believe in polls 
that much 
q well i guess the question is you know are you saying 
a talk to nicaraguas man talk to ortegas man probably 
gainfully unemployed right now for missing it by a jillion points 
but these things come and go seriously and i learned this do 
you know where i learned it back in back in illinois in 1980 i 
dont remember why but i remember vic gold lecturing me on hanging 
your hat on polls thats not what what i thats not the way i 
try to call the shots on the policy 
you just raised the questions about china if i had my finger in 
the wind i might have done that one differently i might have done 
differently about going to cartagena if i had put my finger in the 
wind in terms of polls but thats not the way i run this 
administration and so i i know some think so but thats not 
thats not the point and so i am not going to dwell on them 
because tomorrow it may be very different and then ill have to 
constantly say hey wait a minute 
q inaudible along for one more question does it become a 
possibility though that when youre at like 80 percent that that 
almost becomes an end in itself at some point i mean at such an 
extraordinary level 
a you mean pull the rip cord and get out 
q well i mean laughter 
a what do you mean laughter 
q well when youre 80 percent it would be tempting i would 
think just to simply protect that lead sort of fall on the ball 
a no i dont that please believe me that doesnt 
doesnt guide the decisions we take and i have given you a couple 
of examples and im trying to do the best i can for the country 
and to work with the congress and i theres a lot of areas where 
i have not succeeded near as well as i would like to but i dont 
live by the polls yeah maureen

usbacked rebels attacked the 
strategic southern city of khost killing at least two soldiers 
and government troops responded with sovietmade scud rockets a 
government spokesman said tuesday 
it was not clear whether the attack was related to last weeks 
failed coup attempt by former defense minister shah nawaz tanai 
who is from khost located near afghanistans border with pakistan 
he is popular in the region 
east european diplomats said they were concerned tanai who fled 
to pakistan after his coup failed would unite with the usbacked 
guerrillas to take the city giving the rebels a foothold in 
afghanistan unconfirmed reports from pakistan said tanai began 
negotiations with the government commander for the khost region 
government spokesman naqib sameer said soldiers had been 
courageously defending three positions around khost for three 
days he also acknowledged the government suffered at least two 
casualties there was no word on guerrilla casualties 
sameer said rebel forces were attacking security posts from all 
directions and were shelling the city an indication the guerrillas 
might be closing in on khost 
witnesses said about six sovietmade surfacetosurface missiles 
were fired south from kabul over the last day sameer said some of 
the 45footlong missiles were aimed at khost 
the government also reported increased fighting near jalalabad 
the scene of an unsuccessful guerrilla assault last spring after 
the withdrawal of soviet troops from afghanistan 
again it was unclear whether the fighting near jalalabad was 
related to tanais coup attempt in a statement apparently released 
by tanai in pakistan the former defense minister said he was 
planning to unite with the guerrillas to topple president najib 
who was installed in 1986 
tanai is known as a shrewd commander and generally is considered 
responsible for afghanistans successful defense of jalalabad 
against guerrilla attacks 
soviet troops were stationed in afghanistan for about a decade 
and installed the current communistled government the last red 
army troops were withdrawn in february 1989 
soviet aid has increased following the coup attempt more than 
30 transport planes each loaded with 25 tons of weapons and 
medicine land daily at kabuls airport eastern european diplomats 
said 
the government also said 4200 tons of goods from the soviet 
union have reached kabul by land in the last three days

lithuania which has declared its 
independence from the soviet union wont be eligible to join the 
united nations for a long time un officials and diplomats said 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar said monday that he 
was monitoring the situation in the baltic republic and had no 
comment on the possibility of un membership 
the new lithuanian government has not made any moves to join the 
united nations and faces lengthy negotiations with the soviet union 
on secession lithuania still does not control its territory nor 
can it enter into international obligations until it is free from 
moscow 
both territorial control and the ability to carry out 
international treaties are considered by many observers to be 
qualifications for genuine statehood and un membership 
the soviet union does not recognize lithuanias declaration of 
independence and seeks more than 32 billion in compensation from 
it 
the world body has 159 members namibia which becomes 
independent on march 21 is expected to become the 160th state 
un membership is open to all peaceloving states which accept 
the un charter and are considered by the general membership to be 
willing and able to carry out its obligations 
a state shall be admitted to the united nations with a 
twothirds vote of the general assembly and the recommendation of 
the 15member security council the soviet union is one of five 
permanent members of the council with veto power and could block 
membership the other four are the united states britain china 
and france 
margers pinnis spokesman for the baltic appeal to the united 
nations said tuesday that un membership was unlikely until 
lithuania settled more pressing security and economic issues but 
he said his organization would help convey information between 
lithuania and the world body 
i remind members of the united nations he said that the 
nations of africa and the world in general were and are 
instrumental in establishing namibia as an independent state and in 
making many un members viable and independent 
i see no reason why the baltic states should not be recipients 
of similar political and moral support since there are many 
precedents in previous un actions he said in an interview

a leader of the romanian revolution predicts 
that for the next decade eastern europe will be a semicolony 
of western europe 
silviu brucan a leading member of the romanian national 
salvation front also says the us government is impotent to 
influence developments in the region 
in a speech monday night brucan described as peanuts the 
economic assistance the united states has given to poland and said 
western european nations were becoming much more involved in the 
region he drew a sharp distinction between the role being played 
by the us government and american corporations some american 
enterprises have announced major investments in the area 
brucan also said japan is the natural partner of the soviet 
union and could greatly contribute to its development if those 
countries normalize relations 
he said the soviet union should return the northern kurile 
islands to japan to pave the way for a peace treaty formally ending 
world war ii between the two countries the soviets occupied the 
kuriles in the last days of the war and this has strained 
relations between the two countries 
brucan said improved relations with japan would alter moscows 
balance of power with washington and enable the soviet union to 
strengthen its bargaining position with the united states by 
playing the japanese card 
he stressed the potential of japanese technical and economic 
assistance what japan could do in siberia nobody else could 
do he said 
speaking at a small private dinner with american businessmen and 
journalists brucan said the former oneparty communist countries 
of eastern europe had fallen behind technologically and for the 
next 10 years are doomed to be a semicolony of western europe 
he said this semicolonial status could be reduced or eliminated 
if the social democratic party wins the next election in west 
germany and the labor party wins the next elections in britain he 
said both would be more sympathetic to eastern european economic 
development than their conservative opponents 
brucan a former romanian ambassador to the united states and 
the united nations became one of the leaders of the provisional 
government that took over after the fall of dictator nicolae 
ceausescu last december he resigned from the fronts formal 
leadership in january but remains one of its leading figures 
brucan said romania and other eastern european countries should 
look at sweden and austria for economic models he said they should 
adopt a system in which the market sets productions but the 
state watches over the distribution of income to prevent vast 
disparities between the rich and the poor 
brucan a founding member of the romanian communist party said 
the dissolution of communist parties in eastern euriope and 
elsewhere is inevitable he attributed this to the 
scientifictechnical revolution that changed the class 
structures on which communism is based and reduced the role of 
manual workers in industry and society

mayor marion barry today publicly acknowledged 
a chemical dependency to alcohol and two prescription drugs 
but said he wont resign while fighting federal cocaine and perjury 
charges 
im back i feel good about myself the mayor said in his 
first extended public appearance since he was arrested and left the 
city for substance abuse treatment in florida and south carolina 
barry read a lengthy statement that made no mention of cocaine 
nor did he say directly whether he intends to seek a fourth term as 
mayor he said his campaign manager would make an announcement soon 
about this falls campaign 
my political organization is still intact notwithstanding 
some defections barry said several top barry campaign officials 
have switched their support in the mayoral race to walter fauntroy 
the citys nonvoting delegate on capitol hill 
barry did not answer reporters questions 
the mayor said he was diagnosed at a florida treatment center as 
being dependent on alcohol valium and xanax valium and xanax are 
both commonly prescribed to treat anxiety 
he said he would attend treatment sessions once or twice a day 
as well as therapy sessions with others who are addicted he 
implored the news media to respect my privacy and the privacy of 
other recovering people 
as for his trial barry said im going to turn the outcome of 
this over to god my attorney and the judge and jurors in the 
case the truth will come out in the trial he said 
he said i want to continue to serve this community 
barry was flanked by top city officials and attorney r kenneth 
mundy his wife effi whom he thanked for her support was not on 
stage as barry spoke 
the mayor was charged in january with one misdemeanor count of 
cocaine possession after a widely publicized arrest in an fbi 
sting operation at a downtown washington hotel 
he was indicted last month on three felony counts of perjury for 
allegedly lying to a grand jury about cocaine use and five 
misdemeanor counts of cocaine possession he is scheduled to stand 
trial on june 4 
barrys news conference was his first public appearance since 
his somewhat mysterious return to the capital city after seven 
weeks of treatment at rehabilitation facilities in florida and 
south carolina 
before barry began speaking supporters passed out buttons 
saying im with barry in the 90s as he began to speak some in 
the audience which included a large number of city workers 
chanted barry barry and four more years 
barrys political situation has deteriorated since his arrest 
the most visible evidence came when fauntroy announced march 3 that 
he would run for mayor in the democratic primary 
there are four other democrats in the race as well as former 
police chief maurice turner running as a republican 
barry spoke directly several times to the citys news media 
urging them to avoid the temptation of covering his every public 
move 
let me urge you not to treat this lightly you wouldnt treat 
cancer heart disease or diabetes lightly would you

chinas leading newspaper on tuesday called on 
communist party members to regain the faith of the masses 
indicating the party fears it has lost touch with a populace 
unhappy with the political and economic climate 
the peoples daily editorial followed mondays announcement of a 
party central committee communique that indicated the same fear 
with its call for the party to strengthen ties with the masses 
the first point in the lengthy document was a call for party 
organizations at all levels to pay special attention to the 
solution of those problems which the masses are most concerned 
with 
this has to be done as a practical move to bring close the 
ties between the party and the masses the official xinhua news 
agency quoted the communique as saying 
the communique was the only document released by the central 
committee at the end of its semiannual fourday meeting monday 
the unsigned editorial in the party newspaper said every 
communist especially leading cadres must read this document the 
communique and carry out a marxist mass outlook 
the party mass line is the partys lifeline the paper said 
the mass line was first outlined by revolutionary leader mao 
tsetung in 1943 in the principle of from the masses to the 
masses 
party leaders are supposed to mingle with the masses and gain an 
understanding of their thoughts and concerns to use that 
understanding in establishing policy and to take those policies 
back to the masses explaining and popularizing the ideas until the 
masses embrace them as their own 
in the past decade the importance of the mass line gave way to 
senior leader deng xiaopings economic reform policies but it has 
been resurrected since last springs massive movement for democracy 
and other political changes 
anytime the party mass line is carried out well the relation 
between the party and the masses will become more intimate and our 
undertakings will develop smoothly the editorial said implying 
that failure to follow the mass line was the cause of the 
prodemocracy demonstrations that occurred in more than 80 cities 
across china 
in addition to calls for democracy and freedom demonstrators 
criticized chinese leaders and officials who enjoy lives of special 
privileges and use their positions for personal financial gains 
the party lost even more respect among the masses after the 
bloody military attack on june 34 that left hundreds and perhaps 
thousands dead in beijing and marked the beginning of a nationwide 
crackdown on dissent 
the party is trying polish its tarnished image during the 
chinese new year holiday chinas top leaders traveled the country 
rubbing shoulders with coal miners and factory workers trading 
jokes and kissing babies 
party officials at all levels have been bombarded with calls 
to go down to the grassroots level to implement the mass line 
cases of corruption among officials have been uncovered with 
renewed fervor and in recent days the official media have 
reported the arrests of several officials including a vice 
minister for various economic crimes 
history has proven that as long as the party and the people 
stick together all obstacles will be surmounted mondays 
editorial said 
chinas economy which less than two years ago was afflicted 
with runaway inflation has added to the dissatisfaction with the 
party 
after battling skyrocketing prices chinese now are told to 
tighten their belts as the nation begins a threeyear austerity 
program that has resulted in the closures of thousands of 
enterprises and the layoff of millions of workers 
socialist economic construction cannot be carried out without 
the masses the editorial said

retail sales in february took their steepest 
fall in four months the government reported tuesday but analysts 
said the decline was due almost entirely to sagging automobiles 
sales 
the 09 percent decline is very deceptive said sandra 
shaber an economist with the futures group here its all cars 
virtually consumer spending elsewhere is holding up pretty 
well 
true automobiles sales fell but almost all other sectors 
experienced nice increases agreed william k macreynolds 
forecasting director for the us chamber of commerce 
the commerce department said retail sales totaled a seasonally 
adjusted 1465 billion the decline was the biggest since a 13 
percent drop in october and followed a strong 28 percent gain in 
january the january number originally had been reported at 16 
percent 
automobile sales plummeted 6 percent in february after jumping 
99 percent in january when sales incentives were restored it was 
the biggest drop since auto sales fell 265 percent in january 1987 
but excluding automobiles retail sales actually rose 05 
percent 
john silvia an economist with kemper financial services in 
chicago said the nonauto spending combined with the substantial 
upward january revision suggests that consumer spending is going to 
be fairly strong in the first quarter 
silvia said the level of spending is consistent with other 
recent consumer economic reports including employment growth and 
personal income 
when you put it all together you have a package that says 
that theres no economic recession he said 
retail sales represent about onethird of the nations economic 
activity 
it also suggests silvia added that the federal reserve will 
not act soon to lower interest rates further to stimulate the 
economy 
the construction and much of the manufacturing sector of the 
economy have been battered by high rates as the central bank sought 
to slow inflation prompting some economists and government 
officials to urge the fed to ease its grip on credit 
sales of durable goods bigticket interestsensitive items 
expected to last more than three years fell 3 percent in february 
after gaining 67 percent a month earlier 
except for autos however the durable categories rose 
building materials up 3 percent and furniture and other home 
furnishings up 05 percent 
silvia contended the volatility in auto sales is a pricing 
problem 
what seems to be happening is that in those months when we 
dont have incentives we seem to have stronger than normal 
nonauto sales he said and when we have the incentives put 
on then auto retail sales come up and nonauto retail sales come 
down 
most nondurable goods categories also posted gains department 
store sales were up 2 percent apparel 16 percent restaurants 
and bars 14 percent and grocery stores 05 percent 
declines were registered in drug store and gasoline station 
sales but the latter reflected price declines not volume 
analysts said both were down 08 percent 
for the three months from december through february overall 
retail sales were up 12 percent

the splendor of the paris opera house and the story 
of its troubled construction spanning half a century are the focus 
of an exhibition at the musee dorsay saluting the architectural 
genius of charles garnier 
with dozens of paintings architectural drawings blueprints 
photographs the show is likely to delight both opera lovers and 
history buffs 
with its ornate facade sumptuous marble staircase intricate 
and gilded mouldings and painted ceilings the paris opera is 
considered the most successful monument of the second empire 
the exhibition which runs through june 10 spotlights another 
garnier design the opera de montecarlo in the casino overlooking 
the mediterranean 
on display are opera memorabilia including costumes posters and 
miniature sets of the houses most remarkable productions 
garnier basking in the glory of the popular paris opera took 
on the montecarlo project in 1878 completing it nine months later 
opera is no longer performed at garniers theater in paris as 
the new hightech operabastille opened in july nonetheless it 
remains the home of the paris opera ballet company as well as a 
popular tourist attraction 
the idea for a paris opera house was conceived in 1820 but it 
took 40 years to organize an architectural competition there were 
171 contestants including the heavily favored eugene 
violletleduc 
the french music world went into shock when the winner was 
announced a 35yearold virtual unknown named charles garnier 
garnier was born in 1825 the son of a craftsman a frail 
nervous youngster he excelled in drawing and mathematics and 
entered the ecole des beaux arts 
there is no choice among the arts he once said you have 
to be either the good lord or an architect 
his project ran into trouble from the start baron georges 
eugene haussmann napoleon iiis urban planner who gave paris its 
broad sweeping boulevards chose the site for the new building 
over a network of underground springs 
construction was halted several times the project nearly 
canceled by changing regimes and political intrigue the opera 
finally opened on jan 5 1875 
garnier dreamed of creating a napoleon iii style much as kings 
louis xiii xiv xv and xvi had elaborate designs named for them 
but the style was too grandiose the emperor had his own 
entrance ramp wide enough for him to ride straight to the royal box 
in his horsedrawn carriage and never caught on as a school of 
its own

the efforts of lithuania and its baltic 
neighbors to regain their freedom are fully and uniquely 
justified the state department said tuesday 
the statement by margaret tutwiler the departments 
spokeswoman was the strongest us endorsement to date of the 
declaration of independence voted unanimously on sunday by 
nicaraguas new parliament 
president bush said we rejoice as people are permitted the 
free expression that we take for granted in this country but he 
said the united states was not immediately offering full diplomatic 
recognition to lithuania because we want to see the evolution of 
the control of the territory there and a peaceful resolution to 
this question 
if the lithuanian situation causes the soviet union concern ms 
tutwiler said those worries should be dealt with through 
constructive negotiations with the lithuanian people 
the us remarks followed strong criticism of the lithuanian 
move toward independence by soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
as he addressed the congress of peoples deputies in moscow 
gorbachev who on monday called the prospect of lithuanian 
independence alarming told the congress that the declaration 
of lithuanian independence was illegal and invalid 
but gorbachev also urged patience saying moscows relations 
with the baltic republic would continue unchanged for now and that 
a soviet commission was studying how to respond to lithuanias 
action 
gorbachev made clear that lithuanias independence drive is 
likely to encounter strong resistance 
we cannot talk about negotiations he said you carry out 
negotiations with a foreign country 
although several soviet lawmakers said it was likely gorbachev 
would soften his position he won applause when he said the kremlin 
would not give in to demands to negotiate independence with 
republics seeking independence including the other two baltic 
states latvia and estonia 
ms tutwiler noted that the united states has never recognized 
the forcible incorporation of lithuania and the other two baltic 
states into the soviet union in 1940 following a secret deal 
between josef stalin and adolf hitler 
that incorporation in our view was taken in violation of 
international law she said and added 
we believe that the efforts of these three states lithuania 
latvia and estonia to regain their freedom are fully and uniquely 
justified by any standard and the wishes of their peoples should be 
respected 
we urge the soviet union to address its concerns through 
constructive negotiations with the lithuanian people she said 
earlier president bush told a news conference at the white 
house that clearly i think theres a great deal of interest in 
this concept of lithuanians working it out with the soviets to 
achieve what they want 
but as for final diplomatic recognition of lithuania as a 
sovereign state bush said that must follow negotiations to give 
lithuania full control of its territory and full authority over all 
functions of government

house republican leader bob michel as the congressional leaders 
tried to speak over the din in the cavernous capitol rotunda 
after the congressmen left about 70 of the people with 
disabilities assembled in the center of the rotunda and began 
chanting in a planned attempt to provoke arrest capitol police 
standing nearby encircled the protesters and began taking them 
into custody 
outside the capitol a line of governmentowned vans were lined 
up and police began placing the protesters most in wheelchairs 
into the vehicles 
some of the protesters chained their wheelchairs together 
police used large snipping tools to break the chains 
the demonstrators were being charged with unlawful entry and 
demonstrating within the capitol said a spokesman for the capitol 
police officer gt nevitt the first charge carries a maximum 
sentence of six months in jail and 100 fine and the second six 
months in jail and a 500 fine 
it is a priority for passage in this session of the 
congress foley shouted over catcalls from some of the estimated 
150 people arrayed before him in their wheelchairs i am 
absolutely satisfied it will reach the floor we will have a 
conference with the senate and it will become law 
will it be on the floor in 24 hours no foley added in a 
statement greeted with a chorus of boos 
the speaker said i am not going to set an artificial deadline 
that prevents the committees from sending a bill to the floor that 
they can defend 
it was the second day of lobbying by the disabled on monday 
dozens of people crawled out of their wheelchairs and up the steps 
of the capitol to dramatize their demands 
ill take all night if i have to said the youngest 
8yearold jennifer keelan of denver as she pulled her small body 
up the steps 
come on jenny youre almost there said michael winter of 
berkeley calif who was making his own difficult journey up the 
83 stone steps of the capitols west front 
they were among 60 or so people who put on the demonstration 
monday following a rally at the base of the capitol steps by about 
1000 people supporting legislation to ensure rights to people with 
disabilities 
the focus of the protest was the americans with disabilities 
act which passed the senate last year but has bogged down in the 
house despite widespread predictions of its ultimate passage 
the measure would outlaw discrimination based on physical or 
mental disability in employment access to buildings use of the 
telephone system use of public and private transportation and in 
other uses the capitol building has ramps for wheelchair access to 
two of its entrances and ramps and elevators inside to enable 
people confined to wheelchairs to get around 
were not asking for any favors said i king jordan 
president of gallaudet university and the first deaf person to hold 
that position at the school for people with impaired hearing 
were simply asking the same rights and equality any other 
american has 
what we did for civil rights in the 60s we forgot to do for 
people with disabilities said rep patricia schroeder dcolo 
during the midday faceoff in the rotunda foley sought to assure 
the disabled that house leaders want to see that this bill has 
the greatest possible support and will reach the presidents desk 
in a way that he can sign it 
michel told the crowd he had broached the issue earlier today in 
a meeting with president bush at the white house of the 24hour 
deadline presented house members by the disabled he said thats 
unreasonable 
he acknowledged that the disabled community is getting a 
little bit impatient because the wheels of congress are not moving 
fast enough 
although the bill is supported by the bush administration and 
congressional leaders some have begun questioning the 
administrations commitment in recent weeks white house spokesman 
marlin fitzwater denied its support was slipping and said the 
administration was negotiating with key members of congress 
we do support the legislation fitzwater said were very 
supportive of their rights and their cause president bush has 
spoken out on that in the past

soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev rejected 
lithuanias declaration of independence and ruled out talks with 
the rebellious republic tuesday but lawmakers from the region said 
they were sure hed soften his stance 
gorbachev told the congress of peoples deputies he considers 
the lithuanian move illegal and invalid and said the kremlin 
would not begin wholesale negotiations with republics seeking 
independence 
we cannot talk about negotiations he said you carry out 
negotiations with a foreign country 
gorbachev however also urged patience and said moscows 
relations with the baltic republic would continue unchanged for now 
in the wake of sundays vote by lithuanian lawmakers to break away 
from the soviet union 
despite the soviet leaders tough line several deputies from 
the baltic republics of lithuania latvia and estonia said they had 
strong reason to believe moscow would nonetheless enter 
negotiations on independence for the three states which were 
annexed to the soviet union in 1940 
gorbachev is a realist said lithuanian deputy algimantas 
chekuolis hell change his stand 
estonian lawmaker endel lippmaa said estonia had already formed 
its delegation for independence negotiations and lithuanian deputy 
nikolai medvedev said he had been told talks might begin as early 
as saturday 
in its attempt to turn sundays declaration into reality 
lithuania must work out with moscow a daunting array of questions 
including matters of territory compensation the status of 
thousands of soviet soldiers ownership of factories and land and 
control of the police and kgb 
the tass news agency said lithuanian legislators declared monday 
that their sons no longer need serve in the soviet army they 
appealed to gorbachev to ensure the welfare of lithuanian soldiers 
until negotiations start on mustering them out 
lithuanian activist arunya contautaite said tuesday that 5000 
young lithuanian men out of about 15000 conscripts had refused to 
enter the army during this springs draft 
with so many issues to decide sajudis the lithuanian 
proindependence movement that now dominates the republics 
government wants to start talks right away but lithuanian 
communist party chief algirdas brazauskas who sounded out 
gorbachev last week said he did not believe moscow would agree 
i dont think moscow will go for that he said in an 
interview monday on the plane from the lithuanian capital of 
vilnius to moscow 
gorbachev opened the secondday session of the congress of 
peoples deputies on tuesday by giving the 2000 lawmakers an 
update on the governments reaction to the lithuanian vote 
i think it is illegal and invalid he said he won applause 
from the congress when he said the kremlin would not negotiate with 
republics seeking independence 
but he also added that a political and judicial evaluation 
was needed and said premier nikolai ryzhkov and a commission had 
begun studying the matter he also proposed charging the supreme 
soviet the congress working legislature with beginning 
discussion of the push for independence in estonia and lithuania 
within the next two days 
gorbachev did not appear overly angry at the lithuanians and 
even addressed a light joke in their direction at one point he 
referred to lithuanians as comrades then paused and said i 
think they are comrades 
lithuanian delegates who said they came as mere observers to the 
congress asked tuesday for recognition of their declaration of 
statehood and for the start of talks on their secession on tuesday 
night lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis appealed on 
national tv for understanding of the republics aims and assured 
viewers it would use only peacefl means and respect all minority 
groups within its borders 
among backlash lithuanians say they expect from moscow is a 
partial economic blockade including of crucial fuel supplies for 
which lithuania is dependent on the soviet union 
brazauskas said monday night moscow officials had told him they 
would undoubtedly start charging lithuania normal world prices for 
fuel instead of the subsidized price 
brazauskas said he also expected many soviet factories to use 
lithuanias selfproclaimed independence as an excuse to stop 
supplying it with goods or to provide them only for hard currency 
gorbachev demanded in talks with brazauskas a week ago that the 
republic pay 21 billion rubles about 34 billion in hard 
currency for soviet investment in factories and infrastructure in 
the past halfcentury 
he also suggested lithuania might have to hand over the baltic 
port of klaipeda a key city the independent republic would need to 
carry out foreign trade 
but chekuolis a sajudis leader said the kremlin should pay 300 
billion rubles about 500 billion to compensate for 300000 
people killed imprisoned or exiled by stalin and his successors 
and for economic havoc caused by a halfcentury of soviet 
mismanagement 
lithuania would not insist on convertible currency because the 
money spent on them was the soviet unions nonconvertible 
currency he said 
chekuolis said the figure takes into account a calculation of 
what the republics gnp would now be if it had continued to grow at 
the pace it had prior its absorption into the soviet union the 
republic had a 10 percent annual growth rate during independence 
and if independent would have an economy as strong as finland he 
said 
in paris the bank of france said tuesday it will return the 
prewar gold in its vaults to lithuania if the french government 
recognizes the new regime the gold is worth about 28 million at 
its current value

explosion she looked out the window and the hill behind my home 
was on fire

was still reported leaking at midday

president bush trying his hand at african 
peacemaking called today for early negotiations to end 
mozambiques 10year civil war 
bush issued the plea after talks with joaquim chissano the 
president of the former marxist state 
at a departure ceremony after talks in the oval office and over 
lunch bush said chissanos government has taken significant 
steps to heal divisions which threaten your nation and we urge all 
parties to talk at the earliest opportunity so as to avoid further 
suffering 
he praised chissano for strengthing ties with the united states 
and adopting reforms on voting property rights and religious 
freedoms but said more needs to be done 
we look forward to even further reforms the president said 
so we talked today of common concerns like refugee issues and 
mozambiques humanitarian concerns the crisis in humanitarian 
concerns i might add 
chissano said he assured bush that his government was ready to 
enter into direct talks with rebel forces as soon as possible he 
also said he expressed appreciation for the stand the united 
states has taken on the war in mozambique and for the positive role 
it has been playing in the peace process 
chissano appeared taken aback by the crush of television cameras 
on hand to witness the start of his oval office visit 
as the crews pushed their long boom microphones toward his face 
chissano asked what do you do with all these photos its too 
many 
the media people were ushered out as bush and chissano seated 
in wingback chairs by the fireplace began their talks in private 
a us official who briefed reporters about todays visit said 
the government of mozambique and the renamo rebels were nearing 
agreement on starting peace talks 
i believe theyre in a prenegotiating stage right now to 
determine the framework for their talks and were hoping that they 
will take the final step to get together said the official who 
spoke monday on condition of anonymity 
renamo an organization vilified by human rights groups for its 
brutality in the civil war has been demanding that the mozambique 
government abandon marxismleninism and establish a multiparty 
system 
mozambique which gained independence from portugal in 1975 has 
dropped its marxist ideology and turned to private enterprise and a 
freemarket economy in recent years as a reward bush recently 
struck the country from the us list of marxist states opening 
the way for lending and trade concessions 
it is our belief that because so many of renamos demands have 
been met already it should not be too difficult to enter into a 
negotiated settlement in the near future said the official 
attempts at getting the two sides to stop their war began last 
year with the presidents of zimbabwe and kenya mediating 
assistant secretary of state herman cohen and other us officials 
also have been trying to help 
the united states reportedly has a sevenpoint plan that would 
meet both sides preconditions for talks 
we have been acting as a facilitator and we will be wanting 
to consult with president chissano at this time to see what more we 
can do to help the start of direct negotiations said the 
official 
the war has been a costly one an estimated 32 million 
mozambicans have been driven from their homes either to internal 
or external exile the international community has had to give 
mozambique 300 million to buy food every year 
created originally by the white south african government to 
counter the mozambican governments support for the african 
national congress renamo has in recent months lost much of its 
ideological and financial support 
when president fw de klerk came to power in south africa last 
year he stopped assistance to renamo he since has dropped the ban 
on anc and has made overtures to its leadership designed to lead to 
talks about the future of the apartheid racial discrimination 
system 
renamo still gets money from sympathizers in portugal and brazil

the roman catholic archbishop of los angeles on 
tuesday defended his appeal to older nuns and priests to test an 
experimental aids vaccine saying that the common good 
sometimes requires taking risks 
archbishop roger mahony also said he had been questioned about 
his appeal by vatican officials but that they were not concerned 
after learning details of the plan 
critics say the prototype vaccine developed by dr jonas salk 
father of the polio vaccine could accidentally infect the 
volunteers with the deadly aids virus 
acting on a request from a scientist at the norris cancer 
institute at the university of southern california mahony sent a 
letter last month to 1400 priests and 2400 nuns in his diocese 
asking them to consider volunteering to test the vaccine he said 
if we wait to try something when every single risk or negative 
effect has been eliminated or reduced we would be immobilized as a 
human society he declared tuesday 
mahony spoke at a news conference called to discuss the appeal 
which has generated controversy the archbishop was on a visit to 
rome on separate vatican business 
he said his request to the clergy was reasonable and part of 
the churchs heroic tradition of outreach to the sick he said 
however that the move seemed unprecedented at least in the united 
states 
i thought this was a special opportunity for the church to 
make a contribution even though a small one in this battle 
against this terrible dreaded disease he said 
he added that the experimental vaccine seemed to be the only 
window of opportunity in fighting aids 
mahony said the appeal did not imply a change in the churchs 
teaching that homosexual behavior was wrong aids is most commonly 
transmitted through sexual activity or the sharing of hypodermic 
needles by drug abusers and many victims are homosexuals 
the archbishop rejected any suggestion that the church was using 
the experiment to improve its image on the aids issue declaring 
the church would not play games with peoples lives 
archbishop fiorenzo angelini the head of the vaticans pastoral 
council for health workers contacted mahony to ask about the level 
of risk of the experiment mahony said 
there had been some fears this was a highly risky venture 
mahony said he added that experiments with animals had had 
positive results and the vaccine was as safe as one can get 
angelini later said that mahonys appeal was a concrete 
example of solidarity and charity and a positive initiative 
california authorities have not yet granted permission for the 
study involving the prototype aids vaccine a key researcher on the 
project dr alexandra levine said mahony acted too quickly in 
sending the letters to the clergy and that he should have waited 
until the project was approved 
the archbishop said he had been asked to make the appeal by dr 
brian henderson another leader of the experiment and had followed 
his request and timetable 
mahony 54 also said he would consider testing the vaccine 
himself except that he was too young for the study 
the experiment is aimed at testing the salk prototype vaccine on 
10 uninfected individuals over age 65 with long complete medical 
records the scientists asked the clergy since the project involved 
risk mahony said 
at least six nuns and one or two priests have contacted 
henderson expressing interest in volunteering the archbishop said 
so far salks prototype vaccine called hivimmunogen has been 
tested only on people with the human immunodeficiency or hiv virus 
that causes aids the salk vaccine uses an inactivated virus which 
the scientist also used in developing the polio vaccine 
tests on noninfected people are controversial because critics 
say live strains of the virus could contaminate the vaccine and 
accidentally infect volunteers 
such a thing happened with early tests of the salk polio vaccine 
and many americans were infected the vaccine eventually saved 
thousands from the crippling disease 
levine said the tests would hopefully stimulate the immune 
systems of the healthy volunteers to produce large quantities of 
antibodies against the aids virus 
those antibodies would be removed from the volunteers purified 
and injected into the aids patients whose immune systems cannot 
produce antibodies 
the tests could also lay the foundation for use of hivimmunogen 
as a vaccine to prevent aids virus infection

east germany on tuesday donated a major 
collection of naziera artifacts and documents to the holocaust 
museum being built here as a museum official warned of a 
disturbing increase in antisemitic incidents in east and west 
germany 
east german ambassador gerhard herder turned over about 500 
objects related to nazi germanys slaughter of 6 million jews 
during world war ii saying he hoped the gift would remind all of 
us to ensure these kind of events will never happen again 
the artifacts include medical instruments used for lethal 
experiments at the sachsenhausen concentration camp judaic 
textiles recovered from a berlin synagogue during the fiery 
kristallnacht pogrom of 1938 and german v2 rocket parts 
produced in underground tunnels where more than 10000 slave 
laborers died 
the united states holocaust memorial museum is scheduled to open 
in the spring of 1993 
miles lerman the museums chief negotiator for holocaust 
memorabilia from foreign countries said negotiations with east 
european countries for artifacts began about three years ago long 
before communist governments were ousted and the agreements are 
being ratified by their democratic successors 
we deal with history and not with politics lerman said 
so it doesnt matter whether we negotiate with one individual or 
another the thought of preserving these artifacts transcends 
politics 
lerman congratulated the east germans for the courage to face 
up to the past and acknowledge the crimes committed by the 
generation that preceded them he said the world was jubilant 
over democratic changes sweeping the eastern bloc 
jubilant he said but also concerned with the increasing 
outbreaks of antisemitic acts with signs of more prevalently 
expressed wishes to turn the page and implement a historic 
amnesia 
lerman said there had been sporadic incidents of antijewish 
graffiti desecration of tombstones and incendiary remarks by 
neonazis in both east and west germany he called the incidents 
highly disturbing and especially alarming to the tiny community 
of 250 jews living in east germany 
he said the small but vocal resurgence of antisemitic 
sentiment though denounced by both german governments threatens 
to undermine the democratic society the two countries are trying to 
build as they prepare for reunification 
one of the prized acquisitions donated tuesday by east germany 
is an ibm hollerith machine for sorting and tabulating punch cards 
a mechanical forerunner of the modern computer the machine was 
used during national censuses of the 1930s to target jews gypsies 
and others for deportation to nazi death camps 
the machine was contributed by the museum of technology in 
dresden one of more than two dozen east german institutions and 
individuals that donated objects a formal agreement for transfer 
of the collection was signed in potsdam in august by museum and 
east german officials 
museum curators have received more than 10000 gifts and 6000 
loans of artifacts and documents from holocaust survivors or the 
families of victims and from several european governments 
after three years of negotiations museum officials have signed 
agreements with poland the soviet union east germany 
czechoslovakia and hungary to obtain holocaust materials for 
display talks with yugoslavia and bulgaria are nearing completion 
they said 
the 147 million complex will be the largest holocaust museum in 
the world surpassing the yad vashemn national holocaust center in 
jerusalem 
built with private funds the fivestory museum will stand on a 
19acre site donated by the us government near the national 
mall within view of the washington monument and the jefferson 
memorial the museum was chartered by congress in 1980

renegade gen michel aoun said tuesday he 
was prepared to negotiate with a rival christian warlord and the 
nations catholic patriarch called for government intervention to 
stop the bloodshed 
rival shiite moslem militiamen fought street battles in west 
beirut wounding 10 civilians and trapping passengers at beiruts 
airport and students in their schools police said 
the battles between the mainstream syrianbacked amal militia 
and the proiranian extremist hezbollah or party of god shut the 
main highway linking beirut with south lebanon trapping hundreds 
of people at the airport 
police said hundreds of students were forced to take cover in 
school corridors as the militias dueled with rocketpropelled 
grenades and machine guns in the dusty alleys of beiruts southern 
suburbs 
police also said south yemens ambassador was almost killed when 
four rocketpropelled grenades smashed into his embassy police had 
no other details and repeated telephone calls to the embassy went 
unanswered 
fighting eased after syrian troops intervened to separate the 
two sides 
amal and hezbollah have been fighting for the past two years for 
dominance among lebanons largest sect the 12 millionmember 
shiite community 
more than 1030 people have been killed and 3046 wounded in the 
clashes 
in a newspaper interview aoun appealed to his christian rival 
the leader of the lebanese forces militia samir geagea to end 
their monthlong conflict let us sit and negotiate without 
preconditions aoun said to the conservative daily addiyar 
newspaper 
maronite catholic patriarch nasrallah sfeir and the 
christianrun voice of lebanon radio station meanwhile appealed 
to president elias hrawis syrianbacked government to prevent 
further clashes for control of the 310squaremile christian 
enclave 
the legitimate government should spread its authority over the 
whole nation it should not wait for an invitation from anyone to 
do so sfeir told the leftist assafir newspaper 
geagea has demanded that aoun step down as commander of the army 
and recognize hrawis government 
recognizing president hrawi is aouns only way to political 
life assafir quoted geagea as saying 
aoun has refused to recognize hrawi and is holding out in the 
battered presidential palace in east beirut 
hrawis government controls 70 percent of lebanons territory 
and is backed by 40000 syrian troops it has no influence in the 
christian enclave 
syria has pledged to place its armed forces at hrawis disposal 
geagea aoun and hrawi are members of the christian maronite 
sect that has dominated lebanons politics since independence from 
france in 1943 
the appeals were made as aouns army troops and lebanese forces 
militiamen skirmished throughout the christian enclave threatening 
to shatter a wobbly 10day ceasefire 
police said three people were wounded by sniper fire in areas 
controlled by geageas militia raising the overall toll to 756

puzzled investigators probing the death of a man 
who ran into the landing gear of a boeing 727 jetliner while it 
accelerated for takeoff say they may never known what brought him 
onto the runway 
richard lee brown 40 of phoenix died sunday at sky harbor 
international airport after he confronted alaska airlines flight 
608 as it was taking off for tucson with 33 passengers and a crew 
of seven 
he was waving his arms around like he wanted to stop the 
plane police spokesman leo speliopoulos 
the jetliner was moving about 100 mph and might have gone out of 
control had pilot michael townsend tried to take evasive action 
airline spokesman lou cancelmi said 
although the plane had used up 2000 feet of runway townsend 
was able to abort the takeoff and stop the plane before it reached 
barriers at the end of the asphalt cancelmi said 
the captain said it was either the plane or him said a 
passenger the rev richard pollard of anchorage alaska 
after the airliner returned to the terminal browns body was 
found tangled in the landing gear 
cancelmi said the crew was shaken by the incident this is a 
tragedy one were inexperienced with he said 
cancelmi based in the airlines seattle office said crew 
members spent sunday night in phoenix talking to police and federal 
aviation administration officials and flew back to seattle on 
monday afternoon 
and nobody knows what brown was doing on the runway 
we could postulate it was a suicide but it could also have 
been a poor guy taking a shortcut said airport spokesman steve 
bigg we simply dont know

they hit the ceiling at the internal 
revenue service when somebody smelled a rat but the stink turned 
out to be a big dead snake in the overhead and figuring how it got 
there is taxing the irs 
maintenance workers found the decaying body of a 4footlong 
snake in the ceiling monday after irs workers on the sixth floor 
of the federal building called for help 
james carmody irs district director said the workers first 
thought the smell was natural gas then a dead rat irs agent donna 
lodholz who climbed a ladder to investigate found the snakes 
body and help was summoned 
the multicolored snake appeared to be a boa constrictor and 
carmody said a sinister motive for its presence had been ruled out 
the snake apparently was disposed of by the maintenance crew 
before it could be positively identified 
john groves curator of reptiles for the philadelphia zoo said 
the snake could have been a species found in pennsylvania that got 
inside to hibernate for the winter they dont make much noise 
he said 
groves said it is possible for a snake to survive in the 
building if it could find food and water 
ive never noticed any rats or mice around the building so 
maybe thats the reason carmody said

record high temperatures in the 70s and 80s made tuesday feel 
like a day in june across much of the east drawing winterweary 
people outside to sidewalk cafes and lunchtime strolls and 
boosting sales of outdoor toys 
thats the end of winter said danko orbanich sitting on 
the steps of st patricks cathedral in new york city 
not necessarily a storm hit colorado and wyoming with enough 
snow tuesday to snarl traffic and cut air traffic in half 
more in keeping in warmer seasons thunderstorms broke out 
across illinois and the southern plains and generated tornadoes 
that caused minor damage in kansas 
this is just a preview of spring david koehler a national 
weather service meteorologist in ann arbor mich theres still a 
possibility we can get some snow before the end of winter but if 
we do it wont stay around long 
most record high temperatures are reported in the heat of the 
afternoon but grand rapids mich started out the day with a 
recordtying 68 degrees at midnight 
some other early records were 85 degrees at new york city where 
temperatures a week ago were in the low 30s philadelphia and 
atlantic city nj 86 at newark nj and chicago tied its 
record of 70 
new yorks reading was 38 degrees above normal 14 degrees above 
the record for the date set in 1929 it also was the citys warmest 
day since sept 11 when the high was 91 and the earliest that the 
temperature has reached 80 degrees in central park since record 
keeping started in 1869 
its wonderful its great only problem is that if it gets 
cold again everything thats blooming now is going to die said 
mounted baltimore policeman david eastman 44 
the unseasonable heat wave was great for anyone whose business 
had anything to do with the outdoors like eddie morrocco whose 
morroccos italian restaurant in downtown washington dc opened 
up its outdoor tables 
on sunday morrocco said they had no business outside 
ive been doing outside business for at least 30 years and 
weve never been able to open outside in march never morrocco 
said 
merchants in south carolina reported increased sales of 
frisbees volleyball sets tennis supplies and baseball and 
softball equipment 
the way the weather has been lately weve been selling more 
walking shoes than anything else said kirk hackett assistant 
manager of a shoe store in fort mill 
the warm weather had people calling for service on their air 
conditioning or to get replacement air conditioners in north 
carolina 
were swamped said ben crabtree in charge of the service 
department at a heating and air conditioning company in knightdale 
outside raleigh 
but it wasnt good business weather for everybody 
the heating oil business is a dead soldier its deader than 
george washington said dick jones warehouse manager at an oil 
company in raleigh 
and some outdoor activities also suffered 
lenny and robin wayne tourists from los angeles visiting new 
york city took a few spins around the rockefeller center ice 
skating rink but left early its too hot to ice skate wayne 
said 
the hot air spawned thunderstorms that rained golfballsize hail 
on northwestern illinois and posed threats of new flooding in soggy 
vermilion county where 55000 residents remained without water 
service because flooding put water pumps out of action 
some of the 200 people forced from their homes because of 
flooding along the north fork river north of danville returned home 
to check damage an estimated 19 mobile homes and cabins along the 
river were destroyed 
in the west 5 inches of wet snow had fallen by midday at 
cheyenne wyo just a week after a storm shut down much of 
southeastern wyoming 
denvers stapleton international airport had 3 inches by morning 
and 13 inches had fallen at wolf creek pass in southwestern 
colorado rushhour traffic was slowed to a crawl and stapleton 
cut its departures by more than half because of winds and poor 
visibility 
on the plains thunderstorms battered parts of kansas oklahoma 
and texas with rain and wind 
kansas also had tornadoes that damaged some homes and buildings 
but caused no severe injuries authorities said at least 10 homes 
were damaged near topeka and power lines were down in other parts 
of shawnee and jefferson counties 
there were at least two homes that were a total loss and a 
number with varying degrees of damage such as roof damage and 
glass breakage said ken burgett director of emergency 
preparedness in shawnee county kan

jerusalem prime minister yitzhak shamir on tuesday dissolved a 
political alliance with the centerleft labor party in a crisis 
brought to a head by president bushs comments on the status of 
jerusalem 
shamir fired vice premier shimon peres the labor leader and 
the 10 other labor ministers submitted their resignations after an 
impasse was reached on whether to accept us proposals for talks 
in cairo with a palestinian delegation 
the two major parties immediately sought allies from among the 
small ultraorthodox religious factions that control the balance of 
power in advance of a noconfidence vote scheduled thursday in the 
parliament 
labor and the leftwing citizens rights movement appealed to the 
supreme court to change the parliament vote to wednesday the 
appeals were to be considered wednesday morning 
labors departure from the government wont take effect for 48 
hours leaving the door open for a compromise to preserve the 
coalition which has ruled israel through two stalemated elections 
since 1984 
shamir asked if he still wanted to save the coalition said on 
israel television if i could i would the whole world knows that 
the idea of a national unity government is precious for me but 
this does not depend on me 
avi pazner shamirs spokesman said that as long as there is 
life there is hope but i really am not very optimistic about a 
compromise 
peres who also held out little hope for patching up 
differences raised the possibility of avoiding new elections by 
forming a laborled government with ultraorthodox and leftwing 
parties 
we do hope to continue the peace process we think there is a 
chance but i cannot say this is certain to form a coalition to 
continue the peace process peres said 
the balance of power was held by two ultraorthodox religious 
parties who held seven of the 120 seats in the knesset or 
parliament labor and its allies control 55 seats while likud and 
its partners control 58 
one of the parties agudat israel announced that it would back 
labor in the noconfidence vote the other torah flag was 
undecided 
defense minister yitzhak rabin of labor who has favored trying 
to preserve the national unity government blamed the crisis on 
shamirs refusal to accept a lastminute compromise to join labor 
in accepting the proposals put forth by us secretary of state 
james a baker 
i am very sorry about it rabin said i believe we were 
close and we could have finished a resolution that included a 
positive answer to us secretary baker if the likud was ready to 
do so 
in an interview on israel radio shamir said jerusalem was the 
sticking point with labor and bristled at bushs equating of jewish 
neighborhoods in arab east jerusalem with west bank settlements 
the likud stands steadfast that jerusalem isnt part of judea 
and samaria the west bank said shamir adding he would not 
agree to the 140000 jerusalem arabs being involved in elections or 
a proposed selfrule plan for the occupied territories 
jerusalem he said is an issue about which we are very 
sensitive especially these days when we hear voices from the 
united states 
baker proposed palestinians from east jerusalem take part in a 
palestinian negotiating team and subsequent elections 
shamir opposed the involvement saying it would prejudge 
israels claim to east jerusalem which was captured from jordan in 
the 1967 middle east war 
aides said shamir was not adamant on the issue until march 4 
when bush said us aid to israel would be influenced by whether 
israel continued to build new settlements in the west bank or 
east jerusalem 
pazner a top shamir aide said differences between labor and 
likud over east jerusalem were brought to a head 
suddenly with president bushs statement jerusalem became the 
central and main issue of the whole peace process from there 
things started to snowball pazner said its a pity that 
president bush raised this issue at this very delicate time 
mark heller an independent political analyst at tel aviv 
universitys jaffee center for strategic studies said us 
officials had mishandled the jerusalem issue giving shamir backing 
for a hard line on an issue in which israelis were united 
in terms of tactics and timing bush and baker were badly 
advised heller said 
defying us policy likud housing minister david levy laid the 
cornerstone tuesday for a new 3500unit apartment complex in the 
new jerusalem suburb of east pisgat zeev which is being built on 
warwon land 
they are preaching to us about jerusalem casting doubt on our 
desire that in our capital another wall will not be erected that 
divides east and west levy said 
asked at a news conference in washington whether he regretted 
his statements bush said no i dont regret it but said he 
would not elaborate because the issue was so sensitive and its 
so emotional 
palestinians who also adopt a hard line in demanding east 
jerusalem as the capital of a proposed palestinian state described 
the israeli government collapse as a setback for peace 
in cairo plo representative saeed kamal accused shamir of 
futile actions aimed only a wasting time 
bethlehem mayor elias freij said i believe israel has killed 
its own peace plan and this will have very dangerous 
repercussions throughout the middle east 
freij alluded to predictions that without an active diplomatic 
process arabisraeli tensions would increase and result in 
violence both in the occupied territories and from radical 
palestinian groups abroad

the government said tuesday that the deficit 
in the broadest measure of us trade sank to a fiveyear low last 
year but the 1059 billion imbalance still pushed the country 
deeper into the hole as the worlds largest debtor nation 
americas current account balance narrowed by 16 percent over a 
1266 billion deficit in 1988 reflecting growth in exports 
higher overseas earnings of american businesses and increased 
spending by visiting foreign tourists according to the commerce 
department 
the year ended on a positive note as the octoberdecember trade 
deficit declined to 2057 billion down 102 percent from its 
third quarter level it was the smallest quarterly imbalance in 
almost six years 
but private economists were unimpressed contending that even 
with the improvement the current account deficit remained above 
100 billion for the sixth consecutive year as the united states 
plunged further into hock to the rest of the world 
the current account also known as the balance of payments is 
the most closely watched trade statistic because it measures not 
only trade in merchandise but also trade in services and 
investments it reflects the amount of money the united states must 
borrow annually from foreigners 
america began the 1980s as the worlds largest creditor nation 
it ran surpluses in its current account as the earnings on overseas 
investments were enough to offset perennial deficits in merchandise 
trade 
but as americans handed over billions of dollars to foreigners 
to pay for imported cars and television sets the investment 
cushion eroded and disappeared altogether in 1985 when the united 
states became a net debtor for the first time in 71 years 
the government calculates that the total debt stood at 5325 
billion at the end of 1988 tuesdays report indicates that it 
increased to close to 640 billion by the end of 1989 although the 
official accounting will not be made until june 
americas total debt is expected to top 1 trillion in the next 
few years as the current account deficit remains stuck around the 
100 billion level 
foreigners now own more in us assets than americans own 
overseas a development that has triggered debate over whether the 
united states is losing control of its economic destiny 
president bush like ronald reagan has insisted that the growth 
of foreign investment in the united states is a sign of strength 
showing that america remains an attractive place for investments 
many private economists fear however that americans living 
standards will be lowered in future years as more and more dollars 
flow into foreign hands to meet interest and dividend payments on 
the growing debt 
the united states is the worlds biggest debtor and that is a 
big problem for the country said allen sinai chief economist of 
the boston co increasingly the ravages of debt are showing up 
in this country 
sinai said that the need for the federal reserve to keep 
interest rates high enough to attract foreign capital had already 
translated into slower growth in the united states 
david wyss an economist with drimcgraw hill predicted that 
the current account would actually worsen in 1990 after two years 
of improvement reflecting slower growth in exports and a higher 
us oil bill 
most of the improvement in trade occurred in early 1988 and 
since then things have essentially stalled out and we expect them 
to stay stalled he said 
the 1989 current account deficit was the smallest since a 1042 
bilion deficit in 1984 it was down from an alltime high of 1437 
billion in 1987 
the merchandise trade deficit narrowed 11 percent to 11325 
billion as a 134 percent jump in exports offset a 64 percent rise 
in imports 
the surplus in the services and investment category jumped by 
413 percent to 2165 billion reflecting increased foreign travel 
in america and higher earnings by us companies operating abroad 
the third segment of the current account us foreign aid and 
pension payments to americans living abroad added 1428 billion 
to the deficit last year 
in the fourth quarter the 2057 billion deficit was the 
smallest since the first quarter of 1984 and compared to a 2291 
billion deficit in the third quarter 
analysts said much of the improvement in the final three months 
of the year came from a decline in the value of the dollar which 
increases the earnings of us companies operating abroad when the 
foreign currency earnings are translated back into dollars 
in a second report tuesday the commerce department said that 
retail sales dropped 09 percent to a seasonally adjusted 1465 
billion in february 
while the decline was the steepest in four months analysts said 
the weakness was confined to auto sales other retail 
establishments reported healthy gains

the recordholding guinness world recordholder 
muscled his way through another peculiar pastime tuesday cranking 
out 1551 squatthrusts in a single hour then he was ready for 
some exercise 
i feel fantastic said ashrita furman 35 who lost two 
pounds and almost fainted while performing before awestruck 
observers in a manhattan gym i want to go out running to kind 
of loosen up 
furman has walked hopped run rowed pogosticked 
somersaulted bent balanced and yodeled his way to a dozen entries 
in the us edition of the guinness book of world records 
squatthrusts once certified will make it 13 
the guy is amazing said robert fuchs owner of the natural 
physique centre who kept count and checked furmans form as the 
stuntman sweated out his routine i dont think hes human it 
was incredible 
hes phenomenal said david boehm us editor of the record 
book hes only one of a number of what you might call nuts 
setting these records but he wanted to have more records than 
anybody else and he does 
squatthrusts are produced by squatting with hands on the floor 
thrusting the legs out and back drawing them in then standing 
erect furman did more than one every two seconds resting after 
each 40 squats 
it looked like every muscle in the guys body was about to 
collapse said fuchs a 26year veteran of the bodybuilding 
business he was lying over the counter on his rests or hanging 
on the door to get fresh air you think hes going to pass out and 
then bingo he starts out fresh 
it was very intense allowed furman a health food store 
manager i almost fainted around 600 i have some bloody 
blisters on my hands it was such an intense thing i didnt 
feel the blisters until it was over 
sound like fun consider furmans earlier feats which include 
underwater pogosticking in the amazon river somersaulting 125 
miles running 50 miles while juggling three balls yodeling for 27 
hours doing 2550 deep knee bends in an hour and walking 329 
miles while balancing an open pint bottle of milk on his forehead 
when you edit this book youre never astounded at anything 
these people do sighed boehm if you met ashrita not knowing 
about the records youd say he was quite sane 
there is a method in fact to furmans peculiar pastimes 
sure some of these things are totally stupid he said but 
its the principle of the thing theres a lot of determination and 
concentration involved 
a former couch potato who now boasts 15inch biceps furman 
credits his prowess to meditation which he gently urges that 
others try im trying to show people they have much more 
capacity than they think they have he said 
theres personal satisfaction as well its such a fulfilling 
thing i love the intensity of it he said its like one of 
the most pure forms of experience you can have sort of like being 
out on the battlefield 
there are other wars to come furman plans this june to 
pogostick up the 1760 stairs of the cn tower in toronto and hes 
aiming to recapture the guinness runningwhileskippingrope record 
he recently lost 
furman also held and then lost the squatthrust record he claims 
to have regained tuesday and he has no illusions about 1551 
squats 51 better than the old record standing for long 
im sure this is going to be broken thats the point of 
this he said thats the point of humanity records were made 
to be broken

black groups fought with 
police and each other throughout south africa and 22 people were 
killed more than 100 wounded and 500 arrested police said tuesday 
police listed more than 60 incidents on monday and tuesday the 
largest number on the daily report since violence erupted last 
month in black areas across the country more than 200 blacks have 
been killed since early february most of them in factional 
fighting 
in the southeastern province of natal the site of four years of 
fighting between rival groups police said eight black men were 
stabbed shot or burned to death in three separate attacks 
elsewhere four black men were killed in separate incidents when 
police fired birdshot to disperse stonethrowers in the cape and 
orange free state provinces the report added 
also seven blacks were killed in a series of attacks in 
townships around johannesburg and the bodies of three blacks who 
had been fatally shot were found in the orange free state police 
said 
most of the injuries occurred in natal and the witbank township 
east of johannesburg those arrested were picked up at 
demonstrations in and around cape town and in the orange free state 
the unrest report also listed instances of arson and attacks 
against black policemen and their homes militant activists 
consider black police collaborators with the whiterun government 
and often target them for attack 
apart from natal where about 3000 blacks have been killed 
since 1986 there was relatively little unrest prior to last month 
when president fw de klerk legalized more than 60 black 
opposition groups and released black leader nelson mandela 
instead of bringing responsibility this freedom is being 
misused law and order minister adriaan vlok told parliament in 
cape town 
vlok compared the recent unrest to the nationwide violence of 
the mid1980s which led the government to declare a state of 
emergency in june 1986 
de klerk has said he wants to lift the emergency but wont do 
so unless the violence subsides 
some of the battles involve bitter political rivalries but 
elsewhere the conflict is between taxi groups battling for control 
of routes young gangs with no political affiliations and ordinary 
criminals taking advantage of chaotic circumstances 
the government has said the violence jeopardizes efforts to open 
negotiations on a new constitution that will include blackwhite 
power sharing 
constitutional development minister gerrit viljoen on tuesday 
urged black leaders to fulfill their responsibilities at the 
negotiation table 
we are waiting for you viljoen told the legislative 
assembly in the black homeland of kwazulu 
viljoen praised homeland leader mangosuthu buthelezi for his 
consistent contribution to the facilitation of the negotiation 
process 
the relatively conservative buthelezi whose supporters have 
been fighting more militant black groups in natal province says he 
is ready to begin negotiations with the government 
the african national congress guerrilla movement the countrys 
leading black opposition group said last month it would send a 
delegation as soon as possible from its exile headquarters in 
zambia to hold preliminary talks with the south african government 
the anc still has not set a date for the arrival of its delegation

president bush on tuesday saluted mozambiques 
march toward democracy and economic reform urging president 
joaquim chissano to begin talks at the earliest opportunity to 
end the 10yearold civil war 
chissano assured bush that his government was already taking 
steps to enter into a direct dialogue with the renamo rebels as 
soon as possible 
chissano whose african country has abandoned marxism and 
shifted its sights toward the west congratulated bush on us 
efforts to promote peace and democracy in southern africa 
especially namibia and south africa 
bush at a departure ceremony after talks in the oval office and 
over lunch offered a strong endorsement of mozambiques reforms 
which he said had also buoyed the mozambique peace process 
for that mr president i salute you yet we look forward to 
even further reforms said bush who expressed concern about the 
millions of mozambicans suffering from both the war and drought 
we urge all parties to talk at the earliest opportunity so as 
to avoid further suffering he said 
chissano who became president in 1986 after samora machel died 
in a plane crash said his government had put forward a draft 
constitution that would provide for universal sufferage including 
direct election of the president and the peoples assembly 
chissano called his reception at the white house another giant 
step forward for mozambique it came five years after a 
pathbreaking visit by machel to washington during the reagan 
administration 
chissano speaking english said he told bush of the decision 
of my government to enter into a direct dialogue with renamo as 
soon as possible and about the measures already taken to bring 
this decision into effect 
chissano expressed appreciation for the stand the united 
states has taken on the war in mozambique and for the positive role 
it has been playing in the peace process 
renamo an organization vilified by human rights groups for its 
brutality in the civil war has been demanding that the mozambique 
government abandon marxismleninism and establish a multiparty 
system 
mozambique which gained independence from portugal in 1975 
formally abandoned marxism last summer as a reward for embracing 
private enterprise and a freemarket economy bush recently struck 
the country from the us list of marxist states opening the way 
for lending and trade concessions 
attempts at getting the two sides to stop their war began last 
year with the presidents of zimbabwe and kenya mediating 
chissano expressed the hope the united states would spare no 
effort until peace stability and economic prosperity are achieved 
in the region of southern africa 
an estimated 32 million mozambicans have been driven from their 
homes either to internal or external exile during the civil war 
the international community has had to give mozambique 300 million 
to buy food every year 
mozambique on the southeast coast of africa has a population 
of 15 million 
renamo was created originally by the white south african 
government to counter the mozambican governments support for the 
african national congress however south africas new president 
president fw de klerk has cut off assistance to renamo and 
recognized the anc

president bush declaring that he has gone the 
extra mile to free american hostages said tuesday people will be 
very very fascinated when the whole story comes out about his 
hoax telephone call from a purported iranian leader 
bush refused to provide any details about efforts to free the 
hostages but said his administration has sought information from 
everywhere even going around back alleys to learn about the 
captives plight 
he told reporters at a white house news conference that his 
decision to accept a telephone call from an impostor claiming to be 
iranian president hashemi rafsanjani was an example of his 
willingness to pursue all leads 
i think the bottom line is you have to say would you do it 
again based on the information you had and id say yeah i 
probably would i will go the extra mile 
and when the whole story comes out on this you all are going 
to be very very fascinated with the details very fascinated 
the president took the call several weeks ago after a man 
identifying himself as an iranaian official contacted the white 
house to say that rafsanjani wanted to talk about the american 
hostages in lebanon the captives are thought to be held by 
proiranian moslem shiites 
at the state department meanwhile an official with knowledge 
of the hostage issue said he knew of no recent developments that 
could signal freedom soon for the eight americans and 10 others in 
lebanon 
the official speaking on condition of anonymity said we 
have been told numerous times from the highest levels that there is 
nothing 
asked what he knew about bushs telephone call the official 
said it came from tehran and it came from a government building 
but nobody knows who it was 
bushs aides have not ruled out the call was instigated by a 
faction within the iranian government 
peggy say the sister of terry anderson the longestheld 
american hostage said she wouldnt be surprised to see new 
developments about the hostages 
mrs say who recently went to the middle east on a mission to 
gain andersons release said she believes iran has started on a 
course that will eventually lead to freedom for the captives 
iran she said is under growing international pressure to do 
something about the hostages before it receives aid from the west 
to rebuild its country devastated economically by an eightyear 
war with iraq 
anderson chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press will mark his fifth year in captivity on friday 
bush denied rumors spawned in tehran that he or his aides had 
tried for a month to get in touch with rafsanjani 
hes got some political problems at home and we understand 
that the president said 
the bush administrations official policy on the hostages is 
that it will not negotiate with the hostageholders or their 
patrons at the same time officials say they are willing to talk 
with anyone about the hostages 
last week marlin fitzwater the presidents spokesman said the 
administration was encouraged by rafsanjanis reported statement 
that he would like to see the hostages freed soon

voters went to the polls tuesday to decide 
whether to recall the mayor who led last months unsuccessful drive 
to ban fur sales and three other city councilmen criticized as rude 
and hostile to growth 
the election came exactly one month after a record turnout of 
voters defeated by a 21 margin a proposal to make this rockies 
resort the nations first furrierfree town 
deputy city clerk jan carney predicted a turnout of about 60 
percent of the citys 3850 registered voters the feb 13 election 
drew 71 percent of voters 
morning turnout appeared to be lighter than in february but was 
difficult to gauge because there were more polling places this 
time she said a heavy snowfall would not deter many voters she 
said 
this is aspen carney said they should be celebrating 
that we have snow its not cold or nasty just a little sloppy 
the highly publicized antifur campaign by fourterm mayor bill 
stirling and three city councilmen attracted animal rights 
activists from as far away as sweden and england to the chic 
mountain town 
the targeted councilmen were steve crockett frank peters and 
michael gassman 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
those hoping to oust a majority of the fivemember council 
accused the recall targets of being rude and unresponsive to 
constituents concerns 
but the election involved more than personalities 
some longtime residents believe aspen has lost its soul in 
becoming a playground for the rich and famous but recall 
supporters said efforts to save aspen by limiting growth have 
become exclusionary and nasty 
aspens population is said to peak at about 20000 in the 
winter many property owners do not live here full time and real 
estate prices have skyrocketed during the past decade 
residents voted last month for growth defeating by 1561 to 
1051 a measure to reduce the size of a luxury hotel by 25 percent 
and approving measures to widen the highway leading into town and a 
bond measure to build affordable housing for employees 
the winners hailed the results as a victory for free enterprise 
losers said the mood in the town home of gonzo journalist 
hunter s thompson and other eccentrics had taken a lurch beyond 
the bourgeois 
aspen was the first us community to pass a tough antismoking 
ordinance and the first to declare itself a nuclearfree zone

president bush on tuesday dismissed the idea 
that his statements on jerusalem had contributed to the shattering 
of israels governing coalition while the administration postponed 
promoting mideast talks until israel forms a government capable 
of making these decisions 
bush and others in the administration declined to offer 
judgments on the israeli situation but the president held firm to 
his statements describing east jerusalem as occupied territory 
i dont regret it bush said of his statement that also 
declared the predominantly arab section of the city offlimits to 
jewish settlers 
i was reiterating us policy the president said 
he told a news conference his statement had been blown out of 
proportion by speculation and commentaries 
secretary of defense dick cheney asked by young jewish leaders 
about the us policy on jerusalem said the united states believes 
jerusalem should remain a united city but that the question of who 
controls it should be tackled as the last step of arabisraeli 
peace negotiations 
citing the dissolution a few hours earlier of the israeli 
governments political coalition bush said i will answer no 
more it is so sensitive so emotional any further speculation 
on this question would not be useful given what has happened in the 
last few hours 
the collapse of the israeli cabinet followed acrimonious debate 
about the us formula for talks with palestinian arabs and bushs 
march 3 statement in palm springs calif 
i dont want to look in any way like we are trying to mingle 
in the internal affairs of israel as they are going through this 
difficult period bush said tuesday 
on sunday amid acrimonious debate prime minister yitzhak 
shamir declined to put the us plan for israeli talks with 
palestinian arabs in cairo to a vote by the 12member inner cabinet 
with the collapse of the government on tuesday the state 
department acknowledged the us plan which included roles in the 
talks for a palestinian with a home in east jerusalem and another 
deported by israel from the west bank could not move ahead 
obviously there is a political crisis in israel and until 
that is sorted out israel wont be in a position to make a 
decision spokeswoman margaret d tutwiler said the government 
of israel is now working through its own political process and will 
sort out its own situation we obviously will be watching this 
process closely and i am not going to make any other comments on 
internal political developments in israel 
secretary of state james a baker iii who worked on the plan 
for eight months is committed to promoting negotiations the 
spokeswoman said 
but she added it is not our place to make decisions for 
israel and our ability to support and move forward on peace 
depends upon an israeli government capable of making these 
decisions 
bushs earlier statement was taken both by the likud coalition 
and the labor party as a challenge to israels retention of east 
jerusalem held by jordan for 19 years until it was won by israel 
in the 1967 mideast war 
asked if the statement contributed to the political crisis in 
israel spokeswoman tutwiler replied absolutely not 
she said baker would not abandon his effort and she invited 
anyone who has a better plan to implement shamirs proposal for 
elections on the west bank and in gaza to make it known

orange county jail officials have ended a 
practice of hogtying violent inmates and sandwiching them between 
mattresses since the death of a prisoner who was restrained for 
more than three hours 
jail director tom allison said a jail committee had recommended 
halting the mattress sandwich technique in august but that he 
ignored the advice until inmate ricky richardson 31 died dec 30 
obviously with the death of richardson we have reconsidered 
that allison said monday we are not using that system right 
now and probably will not use it in the future 
his family alleged in a federal court suit against orange county 
and the jail that richardsons death was caused by inhumane 
unjustifiable and grossly disproportionate treatment 
jail officials said they acted appropriately in hogtying and 
sandwiching richardson for 3 hours because he had bitten 
scratched and kicked guards during two violent outbursts he was 
found unconscious by jail guards and died less than an hour later 
an initial autopsy suggests richardson was not suffocated or 
beaten to death and did not die from an aidsrelated condition but 
was running a potentially fatal 108degree fever when he died said 
medical examiner thomas hegert 
in august the jails planning accountability and control 
committee recommended that an alternative method be used to 
restrain violent inmates 
allison said he did not follow the committees recommendation at 
the time because we really didnt see enough reason to 
discontinue the mattresses 
the alternative method which involves strapping an inmates 
wrists ankles midriff and head to a specially designed bunk is 
effective only for a short time because the straps can chafe or 
work loose he said 
allison said the best way to restrain violent inmates is to 
sedate them but only hospitals are permitted to do that he said 
he will ask state officials to let jailers forcibly sedate such 
prisoners

mayor marion barrys statement tuesday that he 
is chemically dependent on two tranquilizers valium and xanax 
would make him a member of a rather large group of americans who 
have abused the drugs experts say 
its quite common said dr rudolf hoehnsaric an associate 
professor of psychiatry at johns hopkins university both are 
quite addictive drugs 
valium and xanax have a variety of legitimate uses and are 
prescribed to relieve stress anxiety panic attacks and enhance 
sleep and relax muscles 
barry who commented after returning washington after treatment 
for chemical dependency did not say if the pills had been 
prescribed aides have said barrys major problem was alcholism 
the mayor who left washington seven weeks ago to begin 
treatment faces five misdemeanor charges of cocaine possession and 
three felony charges of perjury before a grand jury 
gene haislip deputy assistant administrator for the drug 
enforcement administrations office of diversion control says the 
two drugs are among the pharmaceuticals most frequently diverted 
from the legitimate market 
a total of 95 million americans surveyed in 1988 for the 
national household survey on drug abuse said they had used 
tranquilizers including but not limited to valium and xanax 
nonmedically at least once in their lives according to mona brown 
of the national institute on drug abuse 
in addition 12 million americans said they had used such drugs 
nonmedically in the 30 days before the survey was conducted brown 
said 
in 1988 use of valium was mentioned in 6082 emergency room 
cases and xanax was reported 3846 times according to nida 
one prominent case occurred in february 1987 when former 
presidential adviser robert c mcfarlane under investigation in 
the irancontra scandal attempted suicide with an overdose of 
valium 
valium and xanax are rarely fatal when taken alone but if you 
mix them with alcohol they can be deadly hoehnsaric said 
adding that valium is the more addictive 
it gives you a quick high he said people who are 
addicted are looking for that high 
xanax meanwhile is like a drink here and there to help 
relieve stress he said but if its used frequently like 
morning noon and night it becomes addictive 
hoehnsaric said valium withdrawal can mean sleeplessness and 
anxiety if the person has been taking high doses he said it 
could cause seizures if you withdraw too fast 
dr brian doyle a clinical professor of psychiatry at 
georgetown university hospital said it takes six to 12 weeks to 
get off the drugs for people who have been taking it under medical 
supervision in appropriate doses recreational users taking higher 
doses need longer he said 
in recent years physicians have reduced their prescriptions of 
valium as they became aware of the addiction potential hoehnsaric 
said 
the use of the tranquilizers were so widespread during the 1970s 
that it became part of the popular culture and a subject for humor 
in a memorable scene from the 1977 movie an unmarried 
woman starring jill clayburgh and alan bates a department store 
crowd is asked if anyone has a valium everyone in sight 
immediately reaches for his or her personal supply

opposition parties tuesday appealed 
for a postponement of romanias first free postwar elections 
saying the country is still crippled by oppression and unprepared 
for democratic balloting 
please tell us who is ready to take power today take it and 
go ahead interim president ion iliescu responded to opposition 
delegates at a parliament session to pass an election law for the 
scheduled may 20 vote 
minutes earlier during a break in the session iliescu had been 
handed a letter asking for the election delay the letter was 
signed by 23 opposition parties including the national peasants 
party and the national liberal party the two largest 
most of the parliaments work tuesday focused on taking steps to 
try to prevent a future president from becoming a dictator 
including barring candidates who committed abuses under nicolae 
ceausescus hardline communist government 
the letter was the boldest move yet by the opposition campaign 
to postpone the elections which would be the first free vote in 
romania since 1937 
iliescu had told delegates earlier tuesday that authority to 
change the election day rested with the government led by interim 
premier petre roman not with him 
the letter did not propose a new date but ion radu zilisteanu of 
the national democratic party suggested a threemonth delay 
the opposition has claimed a fair vote was not possible so 
quickly after the december revolution that toppled ceausescu 
especially with the continuing political dominance of the national 
salvation front 
the front seized power in the chaos of the revolution and formed 
a provisional government with iliescu as interim president it 
relinquished part of its power last month to the interim 
parliament known as the council of national unity after the front 
decided to become a fullfledged political party and run in the 
elections 
the electorate is not prepared for free and democratic 
elections because of the climate of insecurity and oppression that 
is maintained in the country fueled by illmeaning elements the 
letter said it did not identify those elements or give examples of 
oppression 
the process of socially and politically cleansing society from 
the active elements of the previous dictatorship is at an 
impasse the letter said 
it also said opposition parties had not had access to media to 
promote their proposals to solve the nations social economic and 
political problems 
however the opposition parties also stressed support for the 
governments efforts during the transition period to elections 
earlier tuesday parliamentary delegates voted to bar certain 
people in ceausescus regime from running for president they 
include anyone who committed abuses in political judicial or 
administrative functions violated human rights or took part in 
repression by the police or the securitate ceausescus hated 
secret police 
the draft electoral law provides for candidates to be challenged 
in court on their record under the former dictator 
another prime concern of the 258member council was preventing a 
future president from becoming a dictator 
the president does not have the right to become eternal 
said mircea dinescu president of the writers union and one of the 
first to announce ceausescus overthrow on dec 22 after 24 years 
of repressive rule 
ceausescu and his wife elena were executed on christmas day 
following a secret military trial 
the first role of the parliament that will be seated following 
elections will be to write a new constitution within a year from 
then iliescu said the parliament should pass a permanent election 
law to avoid any suspicion that somebody could take power for 
25 years 
the council delegates representing the 51 political parties 
created since the revolution as well as ethnic groups 
overwhelmingly approved the provision

the house government operations committee 
approved a bill tuesday that would elevate the environmental 
protection agency to cabinet level with creation of a department of 
the environment 
similar legislation earlier had been approved by a senate 
committee and now heads for floor action in both the house and 
senate 
president bush wants congress to pass the legislation in the 
coming weeks so that an announcement on creating a cabinetlevel 
department for environmental issues can be made in time for the 
celebration of earth day on april 22 
the legislation which passed the committee on a voice vote 
tuesday has widespread bipartisan support in both the house and 
senate 
supporters of the house and senate bills argue that creating a 
department of the environment will put the epa on equal standing 
with other agencies and departments in government and give the 
presidents chief environmental adviser more prestige when dealing 
with other countries 
the bills in both houses also would create a center for 
environmental statistics which would consolidate and improve the 
collection of environmental data 
congressional staffers said the legislation otherwise would not 
envision any sizeable increases in the size of the epa if it gains 
department status

a un monitor for nicaragua said tuesday 
he believes the contra rebels can be disbanded by april 25 when 
violeta barrios chamorro takes over as president 
elliot richardson an observer of nicaraguas election process 
for un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar said a un 
plan to disarm and resettle the usbacked rebels will guarantee 
their safety 
i think that practical safeguards for their demobilization can 
be provided he said at a news conference 
the contras have said they will remain armed to make sure the 
leftist sandinista government of president daniel ortega which 
they fought hands over control of the military and police as well 
as the presidency 
but richardson a former us attorney general said he believes 
the prospects are good the contras will be disbanded before the 
formal transfer of power 
he said the incoming and outgoing governments as well as the 
united states are willing to work together to ensure the contras 
can safely demobilize and reenter the society of nicaragua or 
for that matter if they choose to stay outside of nicaragua 
richardson said he could not provide specifics on the plan 
because it would be inappropriate to try to fill in details on a 
matter that is in fact actively being pursued now 
perez de cuellar plans to report this week to the un security 
council on proposals to expand the mandate of the un observer 
group in central america to include overseeing efforts to disarm 
and possibly repatriate the contras 
in november the security council formed the observer group to 
verify the cutoff of outside aid to rebel movements in the region 
it was also created to patrol international borders to prevent 
guerrillas attacks 
the original mandate called for a 625member force but un 
officials say the broader role involving the contras would require 
a substantial increase in personnel there have been estimates a 
force of 1000 would be needed 
last week ortega threatened to keep control of the military and 
the security police unless the contras disbanded before the 
swearingin ceremony on april 25 the sandinistas lost control of 
the government in feb 25 elections 
however ortega told vice president dan quayle at a monday 
meeting in chile that he would not block the smooth transfer of 
power 
president bush announced tuesday in washington he had lifted a 
fiveyear trade embargo against nicaragua and asked congress to 
provide 300 million quickly to help speed the transition to 
democracy 
the president never mentioned the contras who received millions 
of dollars from the united states during the reagan administration 
but his aid request includes about 45 million to help pay costs of 
relocating about 10000 contra rebels and tens of thousands of 
relatives from camps along the honduran border to nicaragua

program as well

the congress of peoples deputies on tuesday 
approved mikhail s gorbachevs proposals for a multiparty 
political system headed by a powerful president to replace 
decades of absolute communist party domination 
but opposition deputies charged that the soviet leader seriously 
violated parliamentary rules in ramming the proposals through a 
procedural muddle and demanded that the issues be brought up for 
one more vote 
failing that they said the congress likely would balk later 
this week at naming gorbachev the new president forcing him 
instead to face voters in the countrys first nationwide 
presidential election 
tuesdays vote if upheld will mark the definitive movement of 
the soviet union from more than 70 years of party leadership toward 
a more representative government system closer to that of many 
western nations it came five years after gorbachev took over power 
in the soviet union a tenure marked by growing economic 
difficulties and sometimesviolent ethnic unrest but also improved 
relations with the west 
i congratulate the congress gorbachev said simply after 
applause greeted the vote of 1817133 members of the nations 
highest parliamentary body for establishing the new post of 
president moments later the 2250member congress voted 1771164 
to approve a wideranging bill striking the communist partys 
leading role from the constitution legalizing some forms of 
private property and setting the presidential powers 
gorbachev has said the strong presidency is essential to hold 
the country together as it goes through economic troubles and 
ethnic disputes 
he picked up votes for his proposals during the day by offering 
a compromise on some of the most controversial presidential powers 
he gave up the right to appeal a veto override and promised that 
any bid to impose a state of emergency would be preceded by an 
official warning and prior approval of local authorities 
deputy fyodor burlatsky a top political commentator said 
gorbachev probably picked up 50 to 100 votes with the compromise 
each piece of legislation required 1501 votes a twothirds 
majority of all the members of the congress present or not 
gorbachev had been threatened by a boycott from some baltic 
legislators who consider their republics independent and 
opposition from radical reformers who considered the post of 
president too powerful and demanded a direct election 
the bill gives the president the power to propose legislation 
negotiate treaties veto legislation and decisions of the council 
of ministers appoint a cabinet declare war if the country is 
attacked and impose presidential rule 
we are standing before the greatest most meaningful step in 
the history of our government he told deputies shortly before 
they voted this is a major step in favor of democracy and the 
protection of democracy 
gorbachev opened tuesdays session in a relaxed manner even 
joking about lithuanias declaration of independence on sunday 
during the afternoon session however he was strongly in 
control he tapped a glass with his pencil and stabbed at the air 
to move the debate toward a votehe cut off debate at several 
points with a a curt thats enough or just a minute and 
several times resorted to a voice vote on whether the congress 
wanted to continue a particular debate 
at one point after the vote was taken on both the presidency and 
the constitutional amendments deputy arkady murashev a leader of 
the opposition interregional group of legislators took the 
microphone and said deputies were confused by the procedure 
gorbachev responded that each deputy spoke for himself in the 
congress and then asked youre talking about yourself you 
the soviet leader then added it was too late to be confused 
about a vote already taken when a question arises clarify it 
he told murashev in a belittling tone 
one reformminded deputy who is considered an expert on 
parliamentary procedure told reporters at the close of tuesdays 
session that gorbachev had absolutely distorted parliamentary 
procedure and that reformers would demand the issue come up again 
for a final ballot 
im not sure our leadership is ready to accept this demand 
about voting procedure said moscow deputy sergei stankevich 
but the official tass news agency said that while the congress 
endorsed the post of president and ended the partys leading role 
one more vote would be needed after all amendments are considered 
the congress began considering amendments to the two bills only 
after it approved them since presidential rule and a multiparty 
system already had been approved as amendments to the constitution 
the new amendments required a twothirds vote instead of a simple 
majority 
that meant that two amendments presented by radicals were 
defeated even though they received a majority of votes deputies 
voted 1067906 for an amendment that would have struck all 
references to the communist party from the constitution instead of 
adding a reference to other parties 
they voted by a wider margin 1303607 to make gorbachev 
choose between the post of president and a leading role in the 
communist party but both amendments like those approved earlier 
would have required 1501 votes to pass 
stankevich said he did not know whether gorbachev maneuvered the 
congress into a tight spot on purpose but that two of his top 
aides vice president anatoly i lukyanov and yevgeny m primakov 
chairman of the parliaments soviet of the union understand very 
well the situation 
if gorbachev grants a repeat vote he is likely to lose support 
because of frustration over how he handled the procedure 
stankevich said if he fails to he may fail to win approval to 
have the congress elect the first president this week 
asked for a prediction on gorbachevs bid to conduct an 
immediate presidential election in the congress stankevich said 
i think it will be rejected 
gorbachev has said he will run for the post and he faces no 
serious opposition in the congress however the outcome of a 
nationwide vote is less certain 
many soviets are increasingly frustrated with gorbachevs 
inability to improve the economy and have expressed their 
disappointment by turning out top leaders in other competitive 
elections

former white house aide oliver l north on 
tuesday undercut a defense attempt to show that john m poindexter 
was unaware of a 1985 missile shipment to iran saying he kept his 
boss apprised of the operation 
poindexters lawyer richard beckler took north through a 
halfhour series of questions about how the former national 
security council staff officer helped obtain a cia aircraft to ship 
18 hawk missiles owned by israel to iran 
at each stage beckler asked if poindexter participated with 
north in any of the discussions with israeli or cia officials that 
preceded the november 1985 shipment 
north testified that poindexter then president reagans 
national security adviser was not a participant in those 
discussions 
beckler was trying to show that poindexter wasnt lying when he 
told congress that he learned about the shipment more than a month 
after it occurred 
but his point was undermined when he asked north adm 
poindexter was not assisting you in carrying out this mission he 
was not working with you side by side was he 
i do not recall the admiral being on the phone with me as you 
just asked but i did keep admiral apprised of what i was doing 
north said 
north meanwhile disclosed that he urged a trip by a us 
official perhaps vice president bush to visit iran in 1986 as 
part of the effort to free american hostages 
there was no indication from the testimony that the proposal was 
seriously considered and north testified that poindexter opposed 
the idea 
beckler also produced a handwritten note by poindexter that 
stated that he had briefed reagan about a shipment of hawk missile 
spare parts that cost the iranians 15 million 
the document is the first indication that reagan may have been 
informed at the time of the iran initiative of the actual prices 
the iranians were paying for the weapons 
the prices were exorbitant and at least 38 million from the 
iran arms sales was diverted to the nicaraguan contras according 
to a report compiled by congress 
reagan maintains he didnt know there was any extra money being 
generated from the iran arms sales he most recently made that 
assertion last month in a videotaped deposition for poindexters 
trial 
poindexter is accused of obstructing congressional inquiries 
into the irancontra affair by making false statements and 
destroying documents 
among other things poindexter is accused of lying by telling 
congress he was not aware of the hawk missile shipment until more 
than a month after it occurred he is also accused of concealing 
the covert assistance to the nicaraguan contras and diverting 
usiran armssale profits to the rebels 
north said he discussed the proposal for a trip by american 
officials to iran in a feb 27 1986 memo to former national 
security adviser robert c mcfarlane then working as a white house 
consultant 
the proposal was for an advance trip to iran to arrange for a 
highlevel trip later on by a senior us official possibly even 
the vice president to meet with the leadership of iran north 
testified 
north said poindexter was not very enthusiastic about the 
idea so he had written mcfarlane to ask him to importune the 
admiral so this trip could be undertaken 
i thought the advance trip was worth the risk and the admiral 
didnt north said 
in may 1986 north and mcfarlane traveled to iran in an 
unsuccessful attempt to secure the release of american hostages in 
the middle east 
beckler produced norths message to mcfarlane to try to show 
that north sometimes went behind poindexters back the memo said 
have not told jwp that this note is being sent 
us district court judge harold greene voiced concern about the 
note saying it undercut norths prior assertions that he always 
kept poindexter abreast of what he was doing 
you are the one who keeps telling us and other tribunals and 
other juries that all you were doing was following orders here you 
are communicating with an outsider and you say your immediate boss 
would not be told about this 
was this consistent with your general method of operation 
the judge said 
north insisted that he was not trying to hide anything from 
poindexter merely trying to get mcfarlane to change poindexters 
mind about undertaking the mission to iran 
even though mcfarlane had left government he still stayed 
engaged in assignments for reagan north said 
you decided when to call him or did somebody tell you 
greene asked 
i dont know who decided north said i believe it was the 
president 
were you the one to decide when to send the message to 
mcfarlane greene asked 
i dont recall anybody telling me not to north replied 
nobody told me i shouldnt talk to him about this

irelands supreme court on tuesday 
refused to extradite two escaped prisoners to northern ireland 
saying there was a risk they would be assaulted by prison staff in 
the britishruled province 
the two men were freed after the hearing 
dermot finucane and james pius clarke escaped from belfasts 
maze prison in a mass irish republican army breakout in 1983 
both were serving 18year terms when they escaped finucane 30 
for firearms offenses and clarke 34 for the attempted murder of a 
member of the ulster defense regiment a mainly protestant 
parttime regiment of the british army 
irelands chief justice thomas finlay said finucane risked being 
assaulted or injured by illegal action by prison staff at the 
maze if he were returned 
i am satisfied that this court has to protect his 
constitutional rights he said 
the chief justices ruling was unanimously supported by a panel 
of five judges of the supreme court irelands final legal 
authority 
after the decision was read finucane was ordered released he 
was immediately ushered out of the court by supporters and sped 
away on a waiting motorcycle 
clarke was later released following a separate court action 
but on similar grounds he walked out of the court calling the 
ruling brilliant 
finucane had claimed in earlier hearings that other prisoners 
involved in the mass ira breakout from the maze prison were later 
subjected to harsh treatment by prison officers 
kenneth maginnis spokesman for the official unionists the main 
protestant party in northern ireland said the suggestion that the 
men risked assault in prison was absolute nonsense 
he said the supreme court decision spells the death knell 
for the angloirish agreement the 1985 accord which gives dublin a 
say in the running of northern ireland 
irrespective of how the two governments try to give it the 
kiss of life it is probably dead on its feet he said 
a spokesman for the northern ireland office a branch of the 
british government said we are obviously disappointed that 
finucane and clarke will not be returned to northern ireland to 
complete their sentences 
the two men were arrested in ireland in 1987 and have been 
battling extradition since 
sinn fein the legal political wing of the ira welcomed the 
court ruling calling it a victory for all those who have fought 
so valiantly against the extradition of political dissidents to 
britain 
the ira is fighting to end british rule of northern ireland and 
to unite the predominantly protestant province with the mainly 
roman catholic republic of ireland

japanese investment in us real estate which 
had been posting huge annual gains edged down 107 percent in 
1989 reflecting a higher japanese interest in europe a study said 
tuesday 
japanese real estate investment totaled 1477 billion last 
year compared with a record high of 1654 billion in 1988 
according to figures compiled by kenneth leventhal amp co an 
accounting firm that specializes in real estate 
the japanese have started to devote more attention to western 
europe both in terms of real estate as well as other investments 
the report said 
the study attributed the switch to an effort by the japanese to 
take advantage of the 1992 target date for the removal of trade 
barriers inside the 12nation european community 
hotels and resorts were the most popular real estate purchase 
for the japanese accounting for 28 percent of the total office 
buildings which had been no 1 with 50 percent of the total in 
1988 fell to second place accounting for 23 percent of spending 
last year 
three states california hawaii and new york accounted for 
81 percent of total investment up from 62 percent in 1988 
for the second year in a row california ranked no 1 with 36 
percent of real estate investment last year about twofifths of 
which was concentrated in los angeles hawaii accounted for 30 
percent of total investment followed by new york with 16 percent 
nevada jumped into fourth place with 482 million in investment 
last year reflecting primarily purchases of hotels and resorts in 
las vegas 
the focus of japanese interest remained in metropolitan areas 
by city los angeles accounted for 251 billion in investment 
in 1989 17 percent of the total followed by new york with 23 
billion 16 percent of the total 
other cities and their percentages of 1989 investment were san 
diego and honolulu both at 7 percent anaheim calif and las 
vegas both 4 percent san francisco washington dc houston 
and phoenix ariz all at 2 percent 
in a separate report tuesday the association for international 
investment said that total direct investment put the japanese in 
the no 2 spot at the end of 1989 behind the british they had 
begun the decade in fifth place 
the association which represents foreign companies with 
subsidiaries in the united states and us businesses with foreign 
operations said 35 percent of the japanese investment was in 
businesses engaged in wholesale trade while 23 percent was in 
manufacturing and 19 percent in real estate

martin marietta corp officials say 
all systems are go for wednesdays launch of a commercial titan 
rocket that will send an uninsured 140 million communications 
satellite into orbit 
we are delighted with the weather so far everything looks 
very good edward m browne president of martin marietta 
commercial titan inc told reporters tuesday 
we intend to push the button at 649 am in one millisecond 
and get that sucker off the ground 
it will be martin mariettas second commercial launch and only 
the third by an american company 
martin marietta entered the commercial launch business dec 31 
by thrusting into orbit british and japanese communications 
satellites with the big titan 3 rocket the type scheduled for 
liftoff wednesday the rocket went up on its 10th attempt following 
delays due to winds and a technical problem 
this time the titan will be carrying a 5ton intelsat vi 
communications satellite that will replace two satellites over the 
atlantic ocean the intelsat vi satellite nearly four stories tall 
with its antennas and solar panels deployed will transmit up to 
120000 telephone calls and three television channels for more than 
13 years 
the cost of the satellite and launch is estimated at more than 
270 million 
barring problems the rocket was scheduled to blast off between 
649 am and 704 am from the cape canaveral air force station 
there was a second launch opportunity an hour later lasting 29 
minutes 
martin marietta spokeswoman judy stowell said tuesday there was 
more than a 95 percent chance of favorable weather 
once the satellite reaches final geosynchronous orbit 22300 
miles above earth on sunday the satellite will be near the first 
intelsat vi which was launched in october by the european space 
agencys ariane rocket that satellite is undergoing inorbit tests 
before being placed in service april 7 
the second intelsat vi is scheduled to start service in late may 
frederick ormsby spacecraft mission director for the 
international telecommunications satellite organization or 
intelsat said last months explosion of an ariane rocket should 
not affect plans to launch two more intelsat vi satellites on 
ariane boosters next year 
the unmanned ariane rocket which was carrying two japanese 
communications satellites blew apart over the atlantic shortly 
after taking off from kourou french guiana the accident prompted 
arianespace which runs the program to suspend all ariane launches 
pending an investigation 
the third in the series of five intelsat vi satellites is 
scheduled to be launched aboard a titan 3 by martin marietta in 
june 
ormsby said intelsat had not insured the satellite being 
launched wednesday insuring such spacecraft is prohibitively high 
especially since the ariane explosion 
the titan 3 built at martin mariettas denver plant is the 
most powerful us commercial rocket and the second big american 
rocket to enter the commercial market mcdonnell douglas was the 
first with its delta rocket hoisting a communications satellite 
for british satellite broadcasting last august 
general dynamics plans to enter the competition in june with its 
atlas rocket 
intelsat a washington dcbased notforprofit commercial 
cooperative of 118 member nations owns and operates a global 
communications satellite system used by more than 170 countries 
wednesdays launch will be its 44th the first intelsat 
communications satellite was launched 25 years ago next month

president bush said tuesday he does not think 
past use of marijuana should be held against someone running for 
political office 
he declined further comment concerning other drugs or the texas 
governors race in which questions of drug use have been a major 
issue 
the question arose at bushs news conference when a reporter 
asked the presidents views on tuesdays gubernatorial primary in 
his adopted home state of texas 
democratic candidate ann richards the state treasurer said she 
was a recovering alcoholic and her addiction was alcohol but 
lost ground in public opinion polls after repeatedly refusing to 
say whether she had ever used illegal drugs 
asked if he felt past drug use should be held against a 
candidate bush said thats a matter for the voters to decide 
but the president added in my view if somebody used 
marijuana sometime ago and is not into anything of that nature 
why no i dont think that should be held against them 
he refused to elaborate when asked if he felt that way about 
harder drugs too 
youre getting me involved in the texas primary something i 
dont want to do he responded 
bush voted by absentee ballot in the republican primary 
i will not tell you who i voted for and i hope everybody 
understands he told reporters otherwise well have a quiz 
around here of who we voted for earlier on its not a proper 
question to reveal 
he promised to be less reticent come the general campaign 
ill be involved but im not going to finetune that said 
bush whose son george walker bush once considered seeking the 
gop nomination to succeed gov bill clements 
in 1987 during the reagan administration douglas ginsburg 
withdrew as a nominee to the supreme court after admitting he had 
smoked marijuana while a law professor william bennett then the 
education secretary and now bushs drug policy director played a 
role in persuading ginsburg to withdraw 
ms richards gained national prominence as the keynote speaker 
at the 1988 democratic national convention with a speech taking 
humorous jabs at republican presidential candidate bush 
in one of the most quoted she said he had been born with a 
silver foot in his mouth

police arrested disabled demonstrators who 
chanted slogans and chained their wheelchairs together in the 
capitol on tuesday in a protest demanding quick passage of a bill 
guaranteeing their civil rights 
the arrests came after deliberate acts of civil disobedience by 
the demonstrators and a confrontation in the capitols cavernous 
rotunda with house speaker thomas s foley and minority leader 
robert h michel 
police said 104 people were arrested 
removing the demonstrators and loading them into vans took 
police about two hours those who could walk were handcuffed and 
some in wheelchairs were strapped into their seats by police many 
of whom wore surgical gloves 
those arrested were charged with two misdemeanors unlawful 
entry and demonstrating within the capitol said police spokesman 
gt nevitt both carry maximum sentences of six months in jail 
in addition those convicted could be fined 100 for unlawful 
entry and 500 for demonstrating in the capitol 
the arrests marked the second day of dramatic lobbying by people 
with disabilities who are seeking passage of the americans with 
disabilities act on monday some 60 people crawled out of their 
wheelchairs and up the west steps of the capitol to underline their 
demands 
the senate passed the bill last year but the measure has bogged 
down in the house despite widespread predictions of ultimate 
approval 
while the demonstration was in progress the house energy and 
commerce committee approved the bill 403 at a meeting in another 
building but the measure still must go to two other committees 
before reaching the full house 
demonstrators gathered in the center of the rotunda and began to 
chant slogans including some from the civil rights movement of the 
1960s they also chanted ada now and access now referring 
to their demand for access to transportation and other 
accomodations 
access is a civil right the last protester who identified 
herself only as gail love shouted as she was taken out 
police used large snipping tools to break chains that some of 
the demonstrators had used to bind their wheelchairs together 
before the arrests foley assured demonstrators that he and 
other congressional leaders were pushing the bill his words were 
met with skepticism 
it is a priority for passage in this session of the 
congress the washington democrat shouted over catcalls i am 
absolutely satisfied it will reach the floor we will have a 
conference with the senate and it will become law 
will it be on the floor in 24 hours no foley added a 
chorus of boos greeted the remark 
a sponsor of the bill rep steny hoyer dmd also spoke to 
the group and urged them to be patient sixty days is not too 
long to wait he said he was met by shouts of weve waited 
too long already 
the bill would outlaw discrimination based on physical or mental 
disability in employment access to buildings use of the telephone 
system use of public and private transportation and in other uses 
it would require ramps or other means of access in all new 
buildings used by the general public including private businesses 
and offices 
the capitol building has ramps for wheelchair access to two of 
its entrances and ramps and elevators inside 
during the midday confrontation in the rotunda foley sought to 
assure the disabled that house leaders want to see that this bill 
has the greatest possible support and will reach the presidents 
desk in a way that he can sign it 
michel an illinois republican told the crowd he had broached 
the issue earlier today in a meeting with president bush at the 
white house he called unreasonable the demand by some of the 
protesters for passage in 24 hours some other protesters said they 
were seeking passage by may 1

a quick infusion of us aid and the 
end of a fiveyear economic embargo will give nicaragua the 
confidence to rebuild its warbattered economy authorities said 
tuesday 
this opens a lot of doors said ramiro gurdian leader of 
the most important private business organization in nicaragua the 
superior council of private enterprise 
investors will begin thinking about putting money into 
nicaragua because it now has access to the biggest consumer market 
in the world the united states 
president bush on tuesday lifted trade sanctions on nicaragua 
and asked congress to quickly approve 300 million in aid 
gurdian said those steps should encourage private banks and 
international lending institutions to begin looking favorably on 
nicaragua 
its like putting money in the pipeline and waiting for the 
faucet to open he said 
danilo lacayo a spokesman for the usbacked united national 
opposition alliance said the us assistance also could persuade 
other countries to increase their aid 
while uno looks to the united states to help it fulfill its 
campaign promises the leftist sandinistas blame washington for 
their resounding defeat in the feb 25 elections 
the uno candidate presidentelect violeta barrios de chamorro 
is to take office april 25 
the trade embargo imposed against the sandinista government 
their war with the usbacked contra rebels and poor management 
have turned nicaragua into one of the poorest countries in latin 
america 
about onethird of the work force is jobless and the economy has 
shrunk steadily the past six years 
vice president sergio ramirez told a news conference lifting the 
embargo is a long overdue act of justice 
the nicaraguan aid package appears to give the conservative 
usbacked uno almost everything its chief financial adviser 
francisco mayorga asked for during his recent trip to washington 
mayorga a yaleeducated economist said he would press for 
quick aid to help get crops in the ground before the may rains 
begin 
agriculture is the base of nicaraguas economy and gurdian said 
the end of the trade embargo means nicaragua will be able to get 
tractors fertilizer seed and other agricultural products cheaper 
by buying directly from the united states 
it will also be able to sell products like meat or sugar at 
better prices offered by the american market he said 
bush also took steps to let nicaragua resume shipping sugar a 
major export crop to the united states and to make nicaragua 
eligible for dutyfree treatment for a variety of other products 
nicaragua has 30000 sugar workers who would be affected by the 
opening of the us sugar market said labor leader alvin guthrie 
if we should get preferential prices it would be easier to 
attack certain problems like low wages he said recently 
lacayo said the aid package should improve the climate for a 
peaceful transition of power from the sandinistas to uno 
the sandinistas who are insisting on the demobilization of the 
contra rebels before mrs chamorro takes office have been sharply 
critical of the united states for not doing more to disarm the 
10000man guerrilla army 
bushs aid package includes 45 million to help repatriate or 
resettle the contras most of whom are in base camps in honduras 
near the border

a house committee voted unanimously tuesday to 
seek a court order granting immunity from prosecution to compel 
testimony from a former top official at the scandalplagued 
department of housing and urban development 
dubois gilliam now serving an 18month prison sentence for a 
hudrelated conviction is expected to testify in late april or 
early may before the house panel that has spent more than a year 
investigating scandals under the reagan administrations hud 
secretary samuel r pierce jr 
the house government operations committee voted 350 to approve 
a motion to compel the testimony after its investigations 
subcommittee voted 80 to seek the order from a federal court 
rep tom lantos dcalif chairman of the subcommittee said 
gilliam was being offered no reduction in his current sentence as 
an inducement or deal for his testimony 
gilliam formerly deputy assistant secretary and a top aide to 
pierce has been cooperating with the committee and was a key 
player in awarding grants under several hud programs according 
to lantos 
a special prosecutor arlin adams is looking into allegations 
of fraud and influence peddling in one of the departments programs 
if a judge approves immunity gilliam could not be prosecuted 
based on his testimony before congress or information derived from 
that testimony 
housing and urban development secretary jack kemp meanwhile 
defended his departments 237 billion budget and proposed housing 
bill under critical questioning from democrats in an appearance 
before the house banking committee 
kemp said the proposal is serious and responsible but he 
acknowledged it does not provide financing for construction of new 
subsidized housing 
kemp has labeled his housing proposal hope for home 
ownership and opportunity for people everywhere and the bill was 
introduced with bipartisan sponsorship monday 
as its centerpiece is kemps plan for encouraging home ownership 
among low and moderateincome families 
rep charles schumer dny called the proposal more hype 
than hope and long on words and short on action 
its a nice idea but its not going to create new roofs over 
peoples heads schumer said 
rep joe kennedy dmass said the bush administrations 
housing budget is woefully inadequate and by failing to provide 
new housing would allow and condone homelessness

crew back to los angeles over the weekend when the warm weather

us officials told congress on tuesday that 
increased corruption in thailand is the main reason for greater 
shipments of heroin to the united states 
melvyn levitsky assistant secretary of state for international 
narcotics matters said he had raised the matter in private talks 
in washington with thai representatives over the past six to eight 
months 
he said the increased corruption was centered on the border with 
burma now called myanmar and that it was connected with thai 
logging operations on the burmese side 
rep larry smith dfla who heads a task force on narcotics 
set up by the house foreign affairs committee was chairman of the 
hearing 
smith said half the heroin reaching the united states comes from 
the golden triangle which includes parts of thailand burma 
and laos thailand has not been able to stop shipments from burma 
he said 
levitsky called burma the key problem saying it had doubled its 
production of opium and heroin to become the worlds largest 
producer 
the state departments annual report on narcotics issued 
earlier this month said the members of the military who took over 
burma in 1988 have given minimum priority to fighting narcotics it 
estimated burmas production of opium from which heroin is 
derived at 2625 metric tons last year up from 770 to 1100 tons 
in 1986 
levitsky praised the thai governments cooperation with the 
united states but noted that president bushs listing of thailand 
among the countries certified as cooperating was accompanied this 
year by a special note 
we need to be honest he said 
afghanistan syria burma and iran have been removed from the 
list

east germanys prime minister believes the 
fears of naziera survivors about a resurgence of rightwing 
extremism in a reunited germany are justified the dean of the 
worlds leading holocaust research center said tuesday 
but west germanys leader says penal laws should allay such 
worries said rabbi marvin hier of the simon wiesenthal center for 
holocaust studies 
hier wrote prime minister hans modrow of east germany and 
chancellor helmut kohl of west germany to ask how they would 
preserve the memory of nazi crimes 
modrow agreed that hiers concerns were definitely 
justified saying there is some basis for fears about a 
resurgence of nationalism racism and antisemitism in east germany 
as the countries move toward reunification 
the rightwing republican party in west germany led by former 
waffen ss soldier franz schoenhuber is trying to gain a foothold 
here modrow said in a letter signed by his adviser karl heinz 
arnold 
but kohl dismissed the rabbis fears saying in a feb 28 letter 
that west germans had been informed without any taboo of the 
causes and consequences of the national socialist tyranny 
it has probably also escaped your notice that in our penal 
code precisely these crimes of hatred whose combating you 
recommend to me are punishable with fines or prison sentences 
kohl wrote 
to my mind there is no doubt that these provisions will also 
apply in a united germany this certainly does not require any 
special demand the chancellor added 
modrows letter also tried to assure that students have a 
remarkable knowledge of the events of the nazi period which can be 
conceptualized with the holocaust 
but hier said jews around the world simply cannot trust such 
assurances 
my point is that after auschwitz the holocaust should be 
institutionalized from cradle to grave he said for the last 
40 years it has been forbidden to talk about it it was completely 
ignored 
they may have a remarkable knowledge about the nazis but they 
may not have a remarkable knowledge about the jews he said 
there is hardly a word of the jew as victim 
hier said the west must guard against the resurgence of 
rightwing groups in a united germany and insist that the memory of 
nazi crimes be preserved as a warning to the future 
we should ask what will you do to institutionalize the 
memory of the holocaust not a single western leader not even 
president bush has brought that up to the germans said hier 
the victims of nazi germany have a right to ask 
the simon wiesenthal center named for the famed nazi hunter is 
the worlds leading research institute on the extermination of 6 
million jews by the nazis during world war ii 
hier also condemned the twoplusfour reunification formula 
worked out in ottawa last month the plan addresses economic and 
political aspects then discusses security issues with the united 
states britain france and the soviet union 
i cannot understand the policy of the leaders of the west who 
came up with twoplusfour hier said we are afraid of 
economic dominance and we are worried about military adventurism 
yet not a single leader has said to the germans what they intend 
to do about the memory of the holocaust 
i think we should force this issue on the public agenda we 
should ask what is the blueprint for the memory of the 
holocaust

way out of the island nations marxist system said the official 
traveling with quayle on his weeklong trip to south america 
quayle told reporters earlier tuesday that with the democratic 
elections last month in nicaragua castro will get a very clear 
message 
it will show the extreme isolation hes in quayle said 
he is the lone holdout in this hemisphere 
castro is all by himself he is a very intelligent individual 
and im sure recent events will not be lost on him but we see no 
indication hes going to change quayle said 
menem indicated he would speak to castro at thursdays 
presidential inauguration in brazil which quayle also will attend 
during their onehour meeting at the government house quayle 
and menem also discussed argentinas economic problems menem 
renewed his vow to take the hard austerity measures needed to get 
his countrys skyrocketing inflation under control said the quayle 
aide who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity 
quayle repeated us asssurances of support for menem and 
encouraged such austerity measures there were no indications the 
united states would come up with an aid package to help argentina 
a slide in argentinas currency against the dollar drastic 
price markups in stores and strikes by public workers have 
disrupted the countrys banks federal courtrooms and oil fields 
the country has been beset by demonstrations and strikes in 
protest over inflation which has soared more than 8100 percent in 
the last year 
quayle met earlier tuesday with paraguayan president andres 
rodriguez and they pledged greater cooperation between their 
governments in the fight against illegal drug trafficking 
quayle said he also spoke to rodriguez about human rights labor 
and us trade sanctions against the country 
rodriguez and quayle held their talks while sailing on the 
paraguay river in a small yacht when the vice president made a 
brief stop in asuncion en route to buenos aires

told reporters 
we got into a number of areas they know what requirements are 
necessary there is a good appreciation of what needs to be 
done 
in 1987 the united states excluded paraguay from the 
generalized system of preferences trading because the stroessner 
reigme did not comply with gsp worker rights standards 
rodriguez a military general overthrew stroessner in a violent 
coup in february 1989 rodriguez won the presidential election in 
may 
while he has made reforms in human rights problems still 
remain according to the 1990 state department report on human

the united states is ready to give 
australia total control of a spy base in the australian outback 
that is used to communicate with us submarines in the indian 
ocean foreign ministry officials said tuesday 
prime minister bob hawke said late monday he discussed handing 
over north west cape base in the far reaches of western australia 
state with us defense secretary dick cheney 
officials who demanded anonymity said tuesday it was pretty 
well agreed that australia regain control of the base which 
began operating 27 years ago they gave no details 
hawke said the base one of three operated jointly by australian 
and us personnel was increasingly important to australias 
defense security 
military analysts said the base was of less importance now to 
the us because the pentagon uses longerrange missiles that do 
not need to be deployed from the indian ocean which washes the 
north west cape 
hawke made the announcement toward the end of campaigning for a 
record fourth consecutive term for his labor government elections 
are march 24 
his opponents said the change amounted to a political ploy 
the government knew the us was planmning to pull out last 
year said bill smith whose trade and labor council represents 
the 200 australian workers at the base 
australia defense association chairman bill harding said the 
united states no longer needed north west cape because it had 
satellitebased submarine communications systems he said australia 
had no choice in taking over the base at an annual cost of 30 
million and that the announcement was timed as a political 
gimmick to attract more environmentalist votes

john easts widow testified in her lawsuit 
tuesday that the us senators health gradually worsened while 
navy doctors who were unaware he had a serious thyroid disorder 
insisted his problem was psychological 
the north carolina republican committed suicide in 1986 11 
months after being cured of the disorder 
priscilla east 58 of greenville nc contends her husband 
believed the doctors failure to diagnose his condition for several 
years had caused his mental and physical powers to deteriorate he 
left a suicide note blaming the doctors 
in 1984 east regularly saw a psychiatrist recommended by rear 
adm freeman cary the us capitols attending physician at the 
time mrs east said 
east told me i kept telling the admiral my problem is 
physical and he kept telling john it was a mental problem she 
testified 
her 35 million claim is believed to be the first wrongful 
death claim against the government by the family of a us senator 
the government contends that mrs east lacks medical proof that 
easts decision to end his life resulted from the late diagnosis of 
hypothyroidism east killed himself in june 1986 by filling his 
garage with carbon monixide 
doctors told east that his thyroid problem should have been 
detected sooner and that they had never seen such an advanced case 
as his mrs east testified 
in hypothyroidism the thyroid gland does not produce hormones 
necessary to keep the bodys metabolism working properly 
east suffering insomnia and slowness of speech became upset 
when newspapers in north carolina began to raise questions about 
his capabilities 
he was hopeful that he would snap out of this in time to run 
for reelection mrs east said but there began to be articles 
saying that north carolina needed two senators i remember 
one of them said is he dead is he gone where is sen east 
those hit below the belt 
east was hospitalized at the bethesda naval medical center in 
april 1985 after collapsing at the couples home he was put under 
a suicide watch on the psychiatric ward but when blood tests 
detected hypothyroidism he was transferred to an internal medicine 
ward with no watch 
a few days later he tried to kill himself by jamming a chair 
leg down his throat mrs east testified she said no one at the 
hospital could explain to her why east had been left unguarded 
he was hospitalized several more times in succeeding months for 
other health ailments and became deeply depressed she said he 
had always been vigorous and athletic despite being confined to a 
wheelchair by polio she said east was particularly unhappy about 
his lack of ability to concentrate and to understand written and 
spoken words 
he said you remember the old john east i said sure he 
said im not the old john east i used to be im just a shell of 
my former self she testified 
her attorney james hourihan showed us district court judge 
walter black jr videotapes of easts appearances on news shows in 
1981 1983 and 1984 in the 1981 clip east seemed articulate and 
selfpossessed the later interviews showed him speaking more 
slowly and with less animation 
assistant us attorney susan ringler said in opening arguments 
monday that the anger east felt against navy doctors before he 
committed suicide was unjustified ringler also disputed the claim 
that hypothyroidism dulled easts mental abilities saying he led 
an active life until his death

nelson mandela told swedish lawmakers 
tuesday that south african whites have elected their last apartheid 
government 
the black leader on an international crusade for his 
antiapartheid organization also appealed for massive amounts 
of foreign aid to bolster his group 
asked earlier if he thought the next south african president 
would be black mandela said that is a possibility but we must 
leave that to the future 
speaking to the swedish parliament mandela said there is not a 
climate yet in south africa for blackwhite power sharing but a 
negotiated settlement to the conflict is not far off 
the road we still have to traverse will not be long mandela 
said it may not be smooth and easy but clearly the racist 
tyranny is on its way out 
white south africa has elected its last racial parliament and 
its last apartheid president said mandela deputy president of 
the african national congress he was freed last month after more 
than 27 years in south african jails 
mandela was in sweden to visit african national congress 
president oliver tambo who is being treated for a stroke he 
suffered late last year he arrived monday and was expected to stay 
five days 
mandela told the swedish legislators that the possibility of a 
negotiated settlement in south africa depends on the government of 
president fw de klerk 
as yet it has not even completed the process of creating a 
climate conducive to negotiations he said we shall be meeting 
president fw de klerk and his colleagues to address this issue as 
soon as the necessary arrangements have been completed 
mandelas anc has demanded the government free all political 
prisoners remove soldiers from black townships and lift the state 
of emergency before talks begin 
we have a vision of south africa as a united democratic 
nonsexist nonracial country mandela said we see ourselves 
as not aligned to any military blocs 
mandela said the international community should provide more aid 
to the anc and tighten sanctions against south africa 
he stopped short of a direct rebuke to british prime minister 
margaret thatcher whose conservative government became the first 
to ease economic sanctions following conciliatory steps by de 
klerk mandela said it was up to anc leaders to decide whether he 
should meet mrs thatcher who has invited him to visit britain 
we expect all countries to intensify sanctions against south 
africa mandela said 
he said countries should also cut diplomatic ties with south 
africa 
mandela is scheduled to meet in stockholm on thursday with neil 
kinnock leader of the british opposition labor party which 
supports antiapartheid sanctions 
in a twohour meeting with swedish prime minister ingvar 
carlsson on tuesday mandela said he reported on the need for 
massive amounts of assistance from sweden and the international 
community

schedule his current trip has also taken him to tanzania zambia

an expert defense witness testified 
tuesday that a delay in a bloodalcohol test made it virtually 
impossible to determine whether exxon valdez skipper joseph 
hazelwood was drunk when his tanker ran aground 
the test wasnt performed until 10 hours after the 987foot 
tanker ran aground march 24 in prince william sound spilling 
nearly 11 million gallons in the nations worst oil spill 
the prosecution contends that hazelwood was drunk 
michael hlastala a physiology professor at the university of 
washington in seattle rebutted a prosecution experts claim that 
he could tell hazelwood was drunk when his ship ran aground by 
doing calculations based on the blood test 
once you are beyond a few hours its impossible to make any 
sense of an extrapolation hlastala testified in hazelwoods 
superior court trial 
the professor said he was familiar with the technique of 
retrograde extrapolation which seeks to establish blood alcohol 
levels at a time distant from when blood tests are taken 
he said there would be numerous variables in hazelwoods case 
such as the rate at which the body absorbs and eliminates alcohol 
and the times the captain started and stopped drinking testimony 
hasnt established conclusive numbers for any of the variables 
hlastala showed jurors a graph in which he calculated a wide 
range of possible bloodalcohol levels that could be deduced from 
the test they ranged from 10 the alaska standard for drunken 
driving to 50 where the expert said a person would be near death 
he said the calculations are further complicated because to 
reach these levels a person would have to consume 77 standard 
drinks which he defined as oneounce shots of 80proof liquor no 
one has alleged hazelwood drank that much 
hlastala said his calculations proved only one thing its 
virtually impossible to go back and get meaningful information 
about bloodalcohol levels 
earlier judge karl johnston cleared the way for the prosecution 
to suggest hazelwood was a heavy drinker and was able to hide the 
effects of alcohol despite objections from the defense 
johnstone said he felt the prosecution had the right to 
explore all the possibilities of blood alcohol and its effect on 
the defendant 
in remarks to assistant district attorney brent cole johnstone 
warned its thin line that youre walking here and added that 
he wasnt yet giving permission for cole to present such a theory 
in final arguments 
under crossexamination by cole defense expert thomas burr said 
experienced drinkers were better able to hide the effects of 
alcohol but added the person would have to be used to drinking 
routinely to become adept at it 
some people do it better than others asked cole 
yes said the witness an alcohol and drug testing 
consultant from minneapolis 
cole asked whether an intoxicated person who didnt want others 
to observe his drunken state might go somewhere nobody could see 
him 
i guess so the witness said with a laugh 
like go below cole asked referring to the captains 
quarters on the exxon valdez 
the answer was blocked by a defense objection 
according to earlier testimony hazelwood left the bridge in 
command of his third mate and went to his cabin before the tanker 
ran aground 
burr also disputed the validity of calculating the amount of 
blood in hazelwoods system by calculating backwards 
if there was any alcohol consumption during this period of 
time theres absolutely no validity no validity whatsoever 
burr said 
there have been suggestions during the lengthy trial that 
hazelwood drank some lowalcohol beer in his cabin after the 
grounding 
hazelwood 43 of huntington ny was the only crew member of 
the exxon valdez charged criminally in the accident he is accused 
of criminal mischief reckless endangerment operating a vessel 
while intoxicated and negligent discharge of oil if convicted he 
faces a maximum penalty of 7 years in prison and 61000 in fines 
on questioning by defense attorney dick madson burr said a 
person showing no visible signs of intoxication was unlikely to 
have a bloodalcohol reading as high as the one calculated for 
hazelwood by the prosecution expert 
burr added he never has seen anyone with a blood alcohol level 
of 015 who did not show some signs of intoxication 
burrs expertise in the field was challenged by cole who noted 
the witness had no advanced degrees and is not a toxicologist 
burr said his 22 years in the st paul minn police crime 
laboratory gave him ample knowledge

investigation is being conducted into what was described as an 
imminent danger watkins was advised the memo contained no

oklahoma on thursday by antinuclear protesters in two cars the 
note indicates that authorities looked into the police records of

plant was arrested sunday in aurora colo on suspicion of 
burglary assault and rape the employee was suspended 
the memo was signed by stephen ronshaugen in the office of the

bruno bettelheim a psychologist and prolific 
author who studied under sigmund freud and gained fame for his work 
with emotionally disturbed children killed himself tuesday in a 
maryland nursing home a medical examiner said he was 86 
marylands chief medical examiner dr john e smialek said 
tuesday night that one of his deputies who examined bettelheim had 
determined the cause of death was suicidal asphyxiation 
smialek declined to give details 
bettelman lived at the charter house nursing home in silver 
spring md a secretary who did not give her name referred calls 
tuesday night to bettelheims family but declined to provide a 
telephone number 
bettelheim who was also known for his freudian interpretations 
of fairy tales ran the sonia shankman orthogenic school for 
disturbed children at the university of chicago from 1944 to 1973 
and was a professor of psychology and psychiatry at the university 
he was like such men great men a whole combination of 
things he could be extraordinarly charming but very authoritarian 
so that one could easily tremble at the sight of him said 
jacquelyn sanders who took over the school in 1973 he also was 
fascinating very cultured 
perhaps his most famous book love is not enough related 
the ideas he practiced at the school he advocated giving disturbed 
children roundtheclock attention from professionals instead of 
leaving them to a caretaker staff after a few hours of therapy 
said benjamin wright a professor of education and psychology at 
the university 
bettelheim was at the school from early morning to after 
midnight nearly every day said wright who worked at the school 
from 1950 to 1957 
it was a miracle of devotion to the cause of providing a 
better life for these childen he was superhumanly devoted to it 
wright said i think that his greatest moment were those years at 
the school 
dr raymond fowler chief executive officer of the american 
psychological association in washington said love is not 
enough influenced his decision to become a psychologist 
he was an incredibly articulate person fowler said much 
of his impact was simply because of his writings because he wrote 
so brilliantly 
bettelheim was born aug 28 1903 in vienna austria he was 
educated in vienna where he studied under freud the famous 
psychoanalyst 
in 1938 the nazis arrested bettelheim a jew and sent him to 
the dachau and buchenwald concentration camps he was released in 
1939 and came to the united states he gained early fame for his 
study of death camp prisoners 
he took over the orthogenic school in 1944 and brought it to 
world prominence 
to me his most significant work was at the orthogenic school 
where he created a kind of environment for kids for very complete 
failures sanders said 
wright said the schools success stories included several 
college professors two successful authors and a stockbroker 
many schools have been formed on the principles bettelheim used 
at the orthogenic school but none have duplicated his success 
because no one has been willing to put in the time he did wright 
said 
bettelheim became professor emeritus at the university of 
chicago in 1975 but continued to write 
rudolf ekstein a longtime colleague and friend spent weekends 
with bettelheim after he moved to california during his retirement 
years 
in a way it was my good luck that he spent the last couple of 
years herem so we would come together on weekends to discuss not 
only treatment of children but the way the world turns you know 
russia and eastern europe because we were both refugees ekstein 
said in a telephone interview 
in addition to love is not enough which was published in 
1950 bettelheims workds included dynamics of prejudice 
1950 truants from life 1955 the informed heart 
1960 the children of the dream 1969 and the uses of 
enchantment 1976 with karen zelan

millionaire oilmanrancher clayton williams 
jumped to a wide lead in early returns from the republican 
gubernatorial primary tuesday state treasurer ann richards led in 
a battle among three mudslinging democrats that appeared likely to 
end in a runoff 
with 1 percent of precincts counted williams a political 
newcomer who spend 8 million on the race led a sevenway gop 
field with 57511 votes or 63 percent railroad commissioner kent 
hance a former democratic congressman was a distant second with 
12363 votes or 14 percent followed by tom luce a lawyer for 
billionaire h ross perot with 10151 votes or 11 percent former 
secretary of state jack rains of houston was fourth with 9214 
votes or 10 percent 
on the democratic side richards led with 42615 votes or 42 
percent followed by attorney general jim mattox with 31097 votes 
or 31 percent and former gov mark white with 24358 votes or 24 
percent four other candidates divided the remaining vote 
richards who dodged repeated questions during the campaign 
about whether she had ever used illegal drugs accused mattox and 
white of profiteering from public service she was bidding for a 
chance to become the states first woman governor since miriam 
ma ferguson left the office in 1935 
white and mattox called ms richards a liar and the bitterness 
appeared likely to continue until april 10 if none of the three 
polled more than 50 percent of the vote the top two would meet 
then in a runoff 
williams who calls himself just a country boy and admits to 
occasional fistfights spent 6 million from his own pockets in the 
campaign 
a confident williams wearing cowboy boots voted at saddle club 
south clubhouse near his midland home theres a good chance we 
can win without a runoff williams said 
he said earlier that if that happened and the opposition was 
forced into a runoff he would relax and have some fun watching 
each of the democrats murdering on each other 
election officials reported brisk turnout throughout the day 
around the state the secretary of states office predicted a 
turnout of 21 million to 26 million of the 83 million eligible 
voters who can vote for either party 
absentee balloting was expected to account for up to 25 percent 
of the vote it was the first gubernatorial race in texas since the 
state allowed people to vote absentee without stating a reason 
also on the gop ballot were ed cude of houston wn otwell a 
fort worth preacher and royce x owens an elementary school 
custodian from merkel 
other democrats running were stanley adams of austin a former 
executive with a failed savings and loan theresa hearnhaynes of 
spring who described her occupation as doctor of law hawkins 
retiree earl holmes and ray rachal of stafford 
texans also voted on the us senate seat held by republican 
phil gramm who has no gop opponent in his bid for a second term 
state sen hugh parmer a 50yearold fort worth lawyer sought the 
democratic nomination and was piling up a better than 31 margin 
against his only opponent harley schlanger a houston follower of 
extremist lyndon larouche 
jim hightower the state agriculture commissioner who raised 
controversy at every turn was pulling in 69 percent of the vote in 
early returns as he defended himself against six democratic 
opponents supported by the texas farm bureau 
hightower bills himself a friend of the small independent 
farmer but brought the wrath of some ranchers with his support of 
hormonefree beef republicans last year failed in their bid to 
have the legislature abolish hightowers job

spending in the gubernatorial races topped 25 million a state 
record 
ms richards won prominence as the keynote speaker at the 1988 
democratic national convention where she said president bush was 
born with a silver foot in his mouth 
she saw an early lead in polls slip amid charges of racism and 
for her refusal to say yes or no when asked during three 
televised debates whether shed ever abused drugs a recovering 
alcoholic she said her addiction was alcohol and she didnt 
want to discourage others from seeking treatment 
her opponents said they never used illegal substances and called 
on ms richards to answer mattox warned that the republicans would 
bust our party if she wouldnt answer as the democratic nominee 
ms richards in turn asked how white could move from a 
government salary to a 13 million mansion in houston right after 
leaving the governors office mattox she charged took campaign 
contributions from people doing business with the state 
white called her charges a pack of lies mattox said her 
attacks had become rather scurrilous 
williams attracted some criticism early in the campaign when 
opponents said hed been in two fistfights during the past eight 
years but he said both fights were justified and turned the 
criticism to his advantage by saying texans would prefer a governor 
who fights for whats right 
republicans are especially determined to hold onto the 
governorship this year because of reapportionment in which texas 
is expected to gain three or four congressional seats based on the 
1990 census 
the legislature almost certain to remain in democratic control 
will draw the new lines but a gop governor could veto the plan 
the current governor republican bill clements is retiring

president bush lifted trade sanctions against 
nicaragua on tuesday and asked congress to swiftly approve a 300 
million down payment for rebuilding the nations ravaged economy 
and speeding a transition to democracy he said the money would 
come from the pentagon 
rushing to shore up the incoming government of presidentelect 
violeta chamorro bush also pledged to seek an additional 200 
million in fiscal 1991 which begins oct 1 
bush coupled the request for nicaragua with a challenge to 
congress to approve a stalled aid package of 500 million for 
panama where the united states installed a new government after 
deposing manuel antonio noriega last december bush also is seeking 
70 million in refugee assistance in panama 
the president urged congress to complete work by april 5 on 
money for both countries all the funds would be diverted from the 
pentagons budget perhaps the first real peace dividend from 
the receding cold war 
these nations need our help to heal deep wounds inflicted by 
years of strife and oppression years of loss and deprivation 
bush said and we must act and act soon 
congress appeared receptive 
rep david bonior dmich a member of the house leadership and 
among the foremost foes of past us policy in nicaragua predicted 
congress would approve the aid before recessing next month for 
easter 
for years weve been hearing speeches about what america could 
do if only noriega and ortega were gone said senate minority 
leader bob dole rkan referring to the former panamanian ruler 
and to nicaraguan president daniel ortega who lost the election to 
mrs chamorro last month 
well ortega and noriega are history its time for congress 
to deliver dole said 
senate appropriations chairman robert c byrd dwva promised 
quick consideration of bushs request but pointed out that congress 
is still in dispute over the presidents ability to channel 
pentagon funds into the package 
byrd in a letter to secretary of state james a baker iii 
noted that the general accounting office has contested the 
administrations authority to delay spending 22 billion in 
defense funds that had been approved by congress 
bush announced his requests in a 41minute news conference 
during which he also fielded questions on topics ranging from the 
budget and foreign policy to baseballs labor dispute that 
threatens to delay the seasons opener 
he made these points 
he does not support a tax increase or a freeze in social 
security benefits as proposed in a deficitreduction package 
offered by rep dan rostenkowski dill nevertheless bush said he 
did not want to appear inflexible and was willing to negotiate with 
the democrats 
he is not happy with the status quo in china where a 
crackdown remains in force against advocates of democracy even so 
bush said he had no regrets about us policy toward beijing 
it would be very inappropriate for him to comment on the 
soviet parliaments approval of a new powers for president mikhail 
s gorbachev i think we have a reasonably good relationship 
there a respectful one and im going to continue to work with 
him he said 
there is no bubbling war with federal reserve chairman alan 
greenspan despite differences over interest rates look every 
president would like to see interest rates lower bush said 
he did not regret getting involved in a telephone call with a 
person he believed to be iranian president hashemi rafsanjani but 
who turned out to be an impostor whats wrong with reaching out 
and touching someone when the hostages are at stake he said 
he said a longago use of marijuana shouldnt disqualify a 
political candidate the question arose in the context of a 
political flap in texas where ann richards who is seeking the 
democratic gubernatorial nomination has refused to say whether she 
ever used illegal drugs 
opening his news conference bush announced he had lifted the 
fiveyearold economic embargo against nicaragua one of the tools 
used by the united states to undermine the leftist government of 
ortega 
the president also took steps to allow nicaragua to resume 
shipping sugar to the united states and to make that nation 
eligible for dutyfree treatment for a variety of other products 
while acknowledging some concern about the reluctance of the 
usbacked contra rebels to demobilize in nicaragua bush said 
im less concerned than i was about the peaceful transfer of 
power including the military 
money for panama and nicaragua will be drawn from money allotted 
to the pentagon requiring a decision on which defense programs 
will be cut bush said that if congress cant make up its mind 
about cutbacks by march 27 it should let him do the job himself 
of the money for nicaragua 75 million would be earmarked for 
economic restructuring 60 million for critical agricultural 
supplies petroleum and medical supplies another 60 million for 
development projects and 50 million to help with foreign debts 
some 10 million would help pay for emergency employment 
programs including ones designed to help turn soldiers into 
farmers in addition 45 million would go toward helping speed the 
repatriation and resettlement of the usbacked contra forces and 
other refugees 
the nicaraguan embassy issued a statement in the name of mrs 
lenor a huper charge daffaires saying we express our support 
for both the end of sanctions and the aid package and inviting 
us experts to inspect nicaraguas economic situation at first 
hand 
on another subject at his news conference bush was asked about 
the baseball dispute and the decision by owners to lock players out

pledged at her inauguration tuesday to clean the face of haiti 
with a provisional civilian government that will lead this country 
to its first free elections 
mrs pascaltrouillo who took a leave of absence as supreme 
court justice is the first female president in the 186year 
history of this impoverished caribbean island nation 
she was sworn in a day after military ruler lt gen prosper 
avril fled following a week of violent demonstrations against his 
18month regime that left at least 24 dead in haiti late tuesday 
radio stations reported the deaths of six people in a coastal 
village following a land dispute 
i have accepted this heavy task in the name of haitian 
women she told hundreds of political and civic leaders 
diplomats and army officers at the national palace ceremony my 
government will be what you want it to be 
mrs pascaltrouillot 46 will govern along with a 19member 
advisory council until elections are held possibly in three to six 
months 
in the short time i have i will work to clean the face of 
haiti she promised 
she spoke in both french and creole the island patois 
mrs president of the republic the armed forces of haiti are 
at your command said maj gen herard abraham who led a 
caretaker government for 72 hours after avril resigned saturday 
the army is returning and staying in the barracks 
the audience wildly cheered abrahams words 
after the ceremony thousands of haitians outside the domed 
whitestone palace filled champ de mars plaza and cheered when she 
came outside 
a strike and fear had left this capital of 1 million people 
deserted for days 
businesses reopened tuesday and portauprince was calm except 
for northern delmas sector where gunfire sent hundreds fleeing 
indoors in the early morning it was not clear who did the shooting 
an hour after the ceremony mobs stormed the twostory suburban 
home of a prominent land owner they stole furniture destroyed 
belongings and shattered windows 
there were hundreds of them they came and destroyed 
everything said candelon lucas who was a deputy in the national 
assembly from 195780 through most of the 29year duvalier dynasty 
dictatorship 
six people meanwhile were killed in deluge a village 37 miles 
north of portauprince according to roman catholic radio soleil 
and haitiinter a private tv station they said the deaths 
occurred when sheriffs tried to evict peasants squatting on the 
property of an absentee landowner 
the reports said four peasants a sheriff and his deputy were 
killed in addition 400 huts were reportedly burned leaving 2000 
people homeless 
after avril flew into exile monday on a us air force jet the 
bush administration urged all haitians to work together in a 
spirit of reconciliation to achieve free elections and respect 
for human rights as rapidly as possible 
unity assembly an opposition coalition comprising 11 political 
parties and one civic organization chose mrs pascaltrouillot as 
interim president on monday 
the coalition was instrumental in leading nationwide protests 
against avril who came to power in a soldiers coup in september 
1988 
since a slaves revolt ended french rule here in 1804 
establishing haiti as the first independent republic in latin 
america most of haitis 38 presidents have been military 
the new president will lead the first government controlled by 
civilians since jeanclaude baby doc duvalier fled to exile in 
france in february 1986 his departure ended the 29year 
dictatorship begun by his father the late francois papa doc 
duvalier 
haitis last civilian president leslie manigat came to power 
in january 1988 in elections widely regarded as fraudulent but the 
army controlled his administration and he was eventually toppled 
by lt gen henri namphy in june 1988 namphy was ousted three 
months later in the coup that brought avril to power 
this government is the product of the unanimous will of all 
political parties and social sectors rene theodore leader of 
the communist party and a major player in the military transition 
of power said of the new government 
abraham the major general agreed monday to accept mrs 
pascaltrouillot as provisional president the opposition refused 
the army choice of supreme court president gilbert austin an avril 
appointee 
the state council that will help mrs pascaltrouillot govern is 
comprised of civic church labor and rights groups as well as one 
army member appointed by the opposition until elections are held 
the council will approve the presidents cabinet and reportedly 
will have veto power over her decisions 
mrs pascaltrouillot said she would hold the reins during the 
electoral period until the installment of a definitive government 
that the people will choose in complete freedom 
members of the state council include dr louis roy main author 
of the 1987 constitution who returned monday from exile in 
montreal avril sent him there in a harsh crackdown against the 
opposition in january 
even if the haitian people havent decided exactly where they 
want to go they have clearly said what they no longer want 
dictatorship roy said 
coalition coleader victor benoit said the group chose mrs 
pascaltrouillot because other justices declined he said the army 
high command has promised us that the presidential guard will be 
kept under control 
but there are still duvalierist death squads who oppose 
change theyre armed and we know theyre very angry about this 
change he said 
avril commanded the loyalty of much of the 1100 presidential 
guard throughout last weeks unrest

west germany said tuesday that it will 
allow poland to participate in international talks on german 
unification so that it can argue the issue of maintaining its 
current border with east germany 
chancellor helmut kohl said meanwhile that east germans with 
moderate savings will be able to exchange their money for west 
german marks on a onetoone basis according to media reports 
a foreign ministry statement issued in bonn indicated france and 
west germany had settled their differences over giving poland a 
place in unification discussions the talks begin wednesday between 
the two german states and the world war ii victors the united 
states soviet union france and britain 
the foreign ministry statement said france and west germany 
agreed that poland should participate when the question of 
polands western border is discussed 
france backed polands demand to be included west germany had 
said the concerns of all interested nations would be addressed but 
had resisted widening the socalled twoplusfour sixnation 
talks 
it was not clear however whether poland would actually have a 
seat at the discussions or be consulted in some other way when the 
border question arises 
poland has demanded a role to protect its border with east 
germany formed by the oder and neisse rivers about onethird of 
presentday western poland belonged to germany before world war ii 
french president francois mitterrand declared after meeting 
polish leaders friday that unification could not go forward unless 
both germany signed binding accords recognizing the border and its 
inviolability 
it was a rebuke of kohl who had stopped short of making a firm 
recognition of the border stating that only a unified germany 
could do so 
mitterrand termed insufficient a declaration passed by the 
west german parliament thursday that promised to respect the border 
but failed to mention the oderneisse line 
the leader of kohls conservative party acknowledged tuesday 
that international concerns are slowing german unification and 
said the process could take three years to complete 
volker ruehe general secretary of kohls christian democratic 
union said unification cannot be completed as long as the 
external questions are not settled 
he was referring to how german unification will affect the 
european balance of power and other nations security 
kohl has come under intense international scrutiny for trying to 
push unification at a pace that has worried the soviets as well as 
some of west germanys friends and neighbors 
but kohls handling of unification has worried european nations 
that their security interests could be overlooked during the 
process and the soviets have made it clear they think kohl is 
being too hasty 
one of the most complex unification issues facing the german 
states is how to protect the estimated 10 billion in east german 
savings once the german economies are joined 
federal chancellor kohl said this evening at a campaign 
gathering in cottbus that moderate savers in east germany will get 
a onetoone exchange rate the zdf television network said 
without elaborating 
west german economics minister helmut haussmann made similar 
comments at an international trade fair in leipzig 
the report came as a german commission met in east berlin to 
hammer out recommendations for forming a monetary union horst 
koehler a state secretary in west germanys finance ministry and 
finance expert walter romberg a minister in the caretaker 
government of communist premier hans modrow led the meeting 
the two sides have met twice before in bonn and east berlin to 
discuss forming a monetary union but no decisions on unification 
are expected until after the east german elections on sunday 
a statement issued after the monetary talks gave no indication 
of whether the commission reached agreement an economic union 
can be completed quickly with the corresponding will of the 
partners the statement said 
the current official exchange rate is three east marks for one 
west mark for tourists and visitors but onetoone for commercial 
transactions 
the east german state bank has called for a parity exchange 
rate there are concerns however that if west germany were to buy 
up savings at a onetoone rate the huge increase in money supply 
would increase inflation 
in frankfurt the west german central bank said that starting 
wednesday east germans could freely deposit and withdraw deposits 
in west german marks from their bank accounts in both east and west 
east germans had been limited to withdrawing not more than 5000 
west german marks at a time in the west and 300 west german marks 
per month in east germany said east germanys official adn news 
agency

indian troops pulled out of an eastern 
town tuesday under a withdrawal that is scheduled to be completed 
by the end of this month officials said 
the troops have moved out of trincomalee town to china bay 
5 miles away an indian high commission or embassy official said 
the official speaking on condition of anonymity did not say 
how many troops were stationed in trincomalee 150 miles northeast 
of colombo before the withdrawal and gave no other details 
china bay a sri lankan naval base with a deepwater port is 
one of the three points being used by indian troops to leave sri 
lanka 
sri lankan military officials in colombo said trincomalee had 
been taken over by guerrillas of the liberation tigers of tamil 
eelam the largest rebel group that fought the indian troops for 
more than two years 
indian troops were stationed in sri lankas northern and eastern 
districts to enforce a july 1987 accord that aimed to end a tamil 
separatist campaign by giving the ethnic minority limited autonomy 
the soldiers were supposed to supervise an arms surrender by the 
dozens of tamil militant groups 
but the tamil tigers after an initial acceptance resumed the 
guerrilla war and the accord collapsed india sent more soldiers to 
put down the rebellion and at one point more than 70000 troops 
were deployed in the northeast 
the tamil tigers started their own peace talks with the sri 
lankan government in may 1989 and a month later president 
ranasinghe premadasa asked india to withdraw all troops by july 27 
1989 the second anniversary of the indiasri lanka accord 
after bitter disagreements and a prolonged diplomatic deadlock 
the two countries agreed in january on the latest pullout deadline 
of march 31 
the withdrawal had sparked fears of fighting between the tamil 
tigers and a former rebel group the eelam peoples revolutionary 
liberation front which gave up arms in 1987 to join mainstream 
politics the front was elected to head the northeastern provincial 
council in november 1988 
a prominent tiger leader stanley dominic said tuesday there 
will be no factional fighting 
the indians have taken their bootlickers the eprlf with 
them so we do not have to fight them dominic commander of the 
northern jaffna area said in an interview in the town 
there have been reports that eprlf members were fleeing to india 
fearing reprisal killings by the tamil tigers 
vartharajah perumal the northeastern provincial council chief 
minister also was reported to have fled to india on sunday 
trincomalee residents said perumal and his family left aboard an 
indian air force plane 
residents in jaffna said indian troops were leaving every day 
indian officials have refused to say how many troops remain in 
sri lanka 
tamil militants began fighting for a separate homeland in 1983 
alleging discrimination by the majority sinhalese in jobs 
education and the use of sinhala language 
about 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people are tamils 
most of whom live in the northern and eastern regions sinhalese 
make up 75 percent of the population 
at least 11000 people including 1100 indian soldiers have 
been killed in the tamil rebellion 
also at least 6000 more people have been killed in a leftwing 
sinhalese extremist campaign the movement which centered in the 
southern and central districts was launched in 1987 to protest the 
peace accord and the presence of indian troops in sri lanka

new proposal and was unsure if the company would modify its stance 
we are delighted that the company is returning to the table 
said union spokesman jeffrey nelson we sincerely hope that they 
will negotiate in good faith 
greyhounds executive vice president and chief labor negotiator 
p anthony lannie will still meet in washington on wednesday with 
bernard delury head of the federal mediation and conciliation 
service gravley said delury met with union officials monday 
the strike began march 2 when 6300 drivers and about 3000 
office and maintenance workers walked off the job in a dispute over 
wages and job security 
ohio gov richard celestes office said greyhound had agreed to 
equip company buses traveling through his state with citizensband 
radios and provide route lists to the state highway patrol to help 
ensure public safety celeste recommended both actions last week

the public its the working conditions 
the strike has been marked by scattered violence including a 
striker crushed to death by a bus operated by a replacement driver

the white house limousine pulled up to a 
gleaming service station tuesday and out popped president bush to 
pump a little methanol fuel and pitch his clean air program 
bush surrounded by auto and oil executives helped inaugurate 
the new methanol fuel pump at daves sunoco 
daves boasts it is the first commercial gasoline station 
outside california to sell the cleanerburning fuel a mix of 85 
percent methanol and 15 percent unleaded gasoline 
bush as part of his plan to clean americas air originally 
proposed requiring use of alternative fuels in 1 million vehicles 
by 1997 in the nine cities with the worst pollution 
in a compromise with senate leaders he recently backed away 
from that requirement opting instead for allowing cars to use a 
variety of fuels not specifically nongasoline type fuels 
environmentalists charge that compromise weakened the clean air 
package the white house disagrees 
while bush spoke demonstrators a block away carried placards 
spelling out clean air hypocrisy 
bush defended his compromise saying nobody ever does it 
exactly the way i want it done but what we have is a sound strong 
environmentally secure compromise 
were never going to placate those on the extreme side of the 
equation that want to do nothing or want to just shut down this 
country and throw every american whos got a job out of work 
said bush 
only specially equipped cars can burn the methanol fuel the 
white house had one at the ready in the form of a commodious ford 
crown victoria normally used to chauffeur w henson moore to work 
as deputy secretary of the energy department 
bush after pumping the fuel into hensons car with an assist 
from station owner david robinson turned the key in the ignition 
then listened to the sun oil co chairman robert mcclements and 
ford motor co chairman harold poling explain how the alternative 
fuel worked 
a chart indicated that the methanol mix cuts smogcausing 
hydrocarbons and nitrous oxides in half 
poling said flexible fuel vehicles such as the crown 
victoria can burn methanol ethanol gasoline or any mix 
the presidents picturetaking session at the gas station 
coincided with an announcement by ford and a sun oil subsidiary of 
a joint testing program to study use of methanol fuel outside the 
mild climate of california 
ford will provide a fleet of 30 mid and fullsize cars and 
fullsize vans to be powered by a mixture of 85 percent methanol 
and 15 percent gasoline called m85 provided by sun refining and 
marketing co 
bush said cleanerburning fuels can help to reduce urban smog 
and toxic air emissions and still reduce the regulatory 
burden on small businesses 
the availability of methanol in a metropolitan area like 
washington is an important step toward the widespread use of clean 
fuels he said 
environmental protection agency administrator william reilly 
said the compromise is a better deal for the environment 
because it will lead to less overall auto pollution in the nine 
cities 
robinson 56 said he is very high on his new offering 
which will sell for 107 a gallon at daves sunoco a penny less 
than regular and two cents more than his cheapest fuel 
methanol contains less energy per gallon than gasoline and the 
107 price works out to about the equivalent of 188 for the same 
energy contained in a gallon of gasoline 
its advantage 
clean air very clean air the station owner said

you can tell the dancers in august pace 
because theres a scorecard in the program and each dancer has a 
number on the back of his or her running suit 
the local premiere of august pace which consists mainly of 
duets opened the march 13 through 25 season of the merce 
cunningham dance company at the city center on tuesday night

musician with the company since 1985 he often performs at 
contemporary music festivals he and four musicians made pops 
bongo drum and oriental stringed instrument sounds heard from 
speakers at the back of the city center sometimes when music was 
the fastest and most excitable cunningham slowed down the dancers 
and played against the musics mood 
afrika a 24yearold soviet painter did decor and costumes 
august pace isnt striving for thrills its organization 
pushes the boundaries of ways bodies can stretch while dancing 
its a hypnotic dance partly because of the nonmelodic music but 
there are definite changes of mood 
in the first duet victoria finlayson lifts one leg and bends as 
far to her side and back as she can while robert swinston at a 
distance from her moves in unrelated patterns carol teitelbaum 
stretches in fascinatingly athletic angular ways kimberly 
bartosik and chris komar dart quickly several make big jumps 
around the stage 
helen barrow and robert wood exhibit solemn and serious body 
language as they reach and stretch patricia lent trustingly falls 
forward and alan good catches her 
all dancers looked inspired 
the work was commissioned by cal performancesuniversity of 
california at berkeley and the cunningham dance foundation its 
first performance was last september in berkeley 
also danced during the evening were fabrications which had 
its premiere in minneapolis in 1987 and cargo x first danced

an apartment fire killed five children 
tuesday and neighbors accused police of stopping civilians from 
attempting to rescue them even though one youngster was seen 
screaming at an upstairs window 
the whole neighborhood is upset said christine lashore a

police shouldve let them try i wouldve tried i wouldve died if 
i had to to save my kids 
police chief wayne romeis defended his officers actions 
people dont have any idea how intense it gets i think the 
response time was appropriate and the actions were appropriate 
he said if those people would have gone in there there probably 
would have been more victims 
romeis said at a news conference that authorities received no 
reports of screaming children from the first officers and 
firefighters on the scene 
i would bet you those kids were dead before we even got 
there romeis said 
the five brothers and sisters ranging in age from 5 months to 9

the steps of st patricks cathedral in new york city 
not necessarily a storm hit colorado and wyoming with enough 
snow tuesday to snarl traffic and cut air traffic in half 
the heat generated tornadoes in kansas nebraska and oklahoma 
that killed a 6yearold boy injured 15 other people damaged 
scores of homes and derailed a 24car freight train in nebraska 
thunderstorms broke out across illinois and the southern plains 
this is just a preview of spring david koehler a national 
weather service meteorologist in ann arbor mich theres still a 
possibility we can get some snow before the end of winter but if 
we do it wont stay around long 
temperatures hit record or recordtying highs in connecticut 
delaware georgia illinois indiana maryland massachusetts 
michigan minnesota new hampshire new jersey new york north 
carolina ohio pennsylvania rhode island and the district of 
columbia

keeping started in 1869 just a week ago the city had temperatures 
in the low 30s 
its wonderful its great only problem is that if it gets 
cold again everything thats blooming now is going to die said 
mounted baltimore policeman david eastman 44 
the unseasonable heat wave was great for anyone whose business 
had anything to do with the outdoors like eddie morrocco whose 
morroccos italian restaurant in downtown washington dc opened 
up its outdoor tables 
on sunday morrocco said they had no business outside 
ive been doing outside business for at least 30 years and 
weve never been able to open outside in march never morrocco

glass breakage said ken burgett director of emergency 
preparedness in shawnee county kan 
onethird of lawrence neb a village of 350 people was damaged 
by a twister there were two minor injuries the weather service 
reported 
the hot air spawned thunderstorms that rained golfballsize hail 
on northwestern illinois generated winds that blew down power 
lines and a barn at malta and posed threats of new flooding in 
soggy vermilion county where 55000 residents remained without 
water service because flooding put water pumps out of action 
some of the 200 people forced from their homes because of 
flooding along the north fork river north of danville returned home

testing of an experimental vaccine on 
california aids patients will be expanded and extended to 
individuals who are infected with the aids virus but have not 
developed symptoms of the disease 
the food and drug administration on monday granted permission 
for further testing of the vaccine developed by dr jonas salk 
the vaccine which uses an inactivated virus is being tested as 
a treatment for aids rather than as an agent to prevent someone 
from acquiring the fatal disease which destroys the bodys ability 
to fight infection 
researchers are trying to find out whether the inactivated virus 
will cause the body to produce specific cells called t cells that 
destroy other cells infected with the human immunodeficiency virus

this is the city that says it knows how 
the one where tourists love to leave their hearts 
but while most of the physical damage from the oct 17 
earthquake has been repaired community leaders are not sure how to 
fix the damage done to san franciscos reputation for warm if 
eccentric hospitality 
from cable cars to chinatown fishermans wharf hotels to 
theaters and museums commercial and cultural business has been 
reported way down since the quake 
that may be changing thanks to time and fading memories 
promotions ad campaigns and a realization by the business 
community that it must also deal with skyrocketing air fares 
recession fears and increasing competition 
the earthquake is a very good excuse for everything said 
john marks president of the san francisco convention and visitors 
bureau but there are many other factors that are causing the 
momentary bump in tourism many touristoriented cities across 
the country are experiencing similar sluggishness he said

the government said tuesday that the deficit 
in the broadest measure of us trade sank to a fiveyear low last 
year but the 1059 billion imbalance still pushed the country 
deeper into the hole as the worlds largest debtor nation 
americas current account balance narrowed by 16 percent over a 
1266 billion deficit in 1988 reflecting growth in exports 
higher overseas earnings of american businesses and increased 
spending by visiting foreign tourists according to the commerce 
department 
the year ended on a positive note as the octoberdecember trade 
deficit declined to 2057 billion down 102 percent from its 
third quarter level it was the smallest quarterly imbalance in 
almost six years 
but private economists were unimpressed contending that even 
with the improvement the current account deficit remained above 
100 billion for the sixth consecutive year as the united states 
plunged further into hock to the rest of the world

lyrics from the notorious 2 live crew album as 
nasty as they wanna be tell the story 
when they say 2 live 
your mama gets worried 
when they speak of us 
the negatives get mentioned 
negatives abound with the popular rap group whose sexually 
explicit and misogynist songs have inflamed parents church groups 
and legislators 
some stores refuse to stock the album or carry only a sanitized 
version as clean as they wanna be it contains eight fewer 
songs than the other album and only one of them is a version of a 
song from the unexpurgated lp the hit me so horny 
and a committee in the florida state legislature is considering 
a bill that would require retailers to label records deemed to have 
socalled offensive material and restrict sale to those over 18 
about a dozen other states are considering similar measures 
luther campbell a member of 2 live crew as well as the groups 
producer and owner and president of its record label luke 
skyywalker records resents what he sees as attempts to censor his 
work by keeping it out of the record stores 
you dont have to buy it he said you just walk right on 
by its sad to see walls coming down letting people out of jail 
in south africa and were starting to tell people what they can 
listen to and look at if they stop that i mean whats next this 
is america 
however campbell who calls himself luke skyywalker in the rap 
group said the company would offer retailers a sticker to warn 
about language and offer parental discretion 
there are 18 dirty sassy tunes on as nasty as they wanna 
be as lewd and disrespectful of women as many of the lyrics are 
production values are equally high the sound is crisp and clear 
the sampling and scratching expert 
we made our own style up campbell said it is raunchy 
but its really funny its no different than what andrew 
dice clay does no different from redd foxx eddie murphy the 
three standup comics are known for their offcolor and sometimes 
offensive material 
in 1988 tommy hammond a record store owner in alexander city 
ala was convicted of violating the citys obscenity ordinance for 
selling an earlier 2 live crew effort move somethin the 
conviction was overturned on appeal feb 22 
three days later a broward county judge ruled as nasty as 
they wanna be is probably obscene but would have to consider a 
specific case involving the lp to determine if it is obscene 
according to state laws 
the platinum doublealbum nasty attracted the attention of a 
judge in lee county fla who found probable cause to consider the 
lyrics obscene the album was pulled from store shelves 
dade state attorney janet reno also is checking to see if minors 
are being allowed to buy the album she was the subject of a record 
by female rappers anquette also on the miamibased luke 
skyywalker label praising her offices efficiency in obtaining 
child support payments from reluctant fathers 
they dont recognize us for the clean stuff that we do said 
campbell who doesnt smoke or drink 
though the crew has a welldeserved reputation for raunch the 
group is not without concern for its fans since 1988 they have 
endorsed homeboy brand condoms an arrangement they initiated 
according to skyywalker spokeswoman debbie bennett 
they figured since they were talking about sex so much they 
should talk about safe sex she said 
while some are up in arms about the possible effect 2 live 
crews work may have on the young campbell is proud of his efforts 
as an entrepreneur and the example he sets for black youngsters 
a lot of black kids know of me and a lot of them want to be 
like me he said they see some light down the tunnel very 
seldom do they see the business blacks because those people arent 
widely known 
the miamiborn campbell 29 went from spinning records at high 
school dances as a youngster to a corner office with a view of 
biscayne bay and a staff of 25 he established luke skyywalker 
records in 1985 after not getting paid for an earlier record 
several rappers record for skyywalker including professor griff 
of public enemy campbell also owns the skyyline label which 
records a few rhythm and blues artists 
its 5050 he said of his dual life as record company 
executive and rap star i work at night as an artist and in the 
day time im a businessman 
today he still seems a bit awed by his own success 
knowing the business as i know it now and seeing as many 
people fail but i guess thats how i do a lot of things he 
said 
i just decide to do them

are you going to die asks charlie brown 
when janice his little friend in the hospital bed says she has 
leukemia 
good grief charlie brown cries linus what kind of 
question is that 
a blunt one asked in a different kind of peanuts special 
that cbs is showing friday night rest assured though that the 
ending is upbeat in keeping with medical fact and the nature of 
charles m schulz 
schulz who has drawn the wise and whimsical characters of his 
peanuts cartoon strip since 1950 and did his first tv special 
in 1965 hadnt thought of making his next one about a child who 
develops leukemia 
what became fridays why charlie brown why began he 
says with an idea from sylvia cook a nurse in california who 
works with young cancer patients at stanford childrens hospital 
she proposed a fiveminute film for them in which cancer and its 
treatment were explained by the peanuts gang he recalls that 
he pointed out a few problems including that animation is 
expensive 
that didnt stop cook schulz says 
gradually her idea changed and she finally decided that itd 
be more important if we could do a film that would show the people 
around the person who was ill just what is going on he says 
wth the aid of the american cancer society thats ultimately 
what happened it helped that schulz came to believe the film would 
make a good peanuts special for tv and shouldnt be limited to 
hospital showings 
the gentle lessons of fridays show include the early symptoms 
of leukemia and what can be expected in treatment of the disease 
a key part of the program the survival rate of children 
stricken with leukemia is only obliquely noted mainly because a 
mass of statistics would be as out of place in a peanuts 
special as a visit from the simpsons 
little janice in chemotherapy treatment that she notes will 
cause her temporary hair loss quotes her doctors as saying she 
should get well 
the survival rate for children is high according to acs 
spokesman david lehmann he says the society estimates 2500 
children will be stricken with leukemia this year 1900 of them 
with its acute form 
however thanks to advances in treatment 71 percent are 
expected to survive he says 
schulz who worked with the society in preparing fridays 
special downplays his role in it 
i didnt go into making this thing because i wanted to teach 
the world all about this he says this was the idea of the 
cancer people it was their project my only job was to make it 
palatable to give it some kind of story and try to tell the things 
they wanted told yet make it so that people wouldnt turn it off 
schulz 67 who lives in santa rosa calif about an hours 
drive north of san francisco estimates fridays is his 25th tv 
special since a charlie brown christmas 
he still draws the sevendayaweek peanuts strip that by 
cbs estimate appears in more than 2200 newspapers worldwide he 
reckons hes drawn 15000 of the strips since he began them 40 
years ago 
more than a few cartoonist have groused that the constant 
pressure of a daily strip at times has put them up against the 
wall if not under it no such gripes are heard from schulz 
no quality is the only thing that worries me he says i 
dont worry about getting them done im always worrying that ill 
just end up doing the same things over and over 
just to try to keep the thing alive and be trying new things 
thats the hard part just getting it done is nothing i think 
cartoonists who say its hard to keep up the schedule are just 
lazy thats all

years of plummeting land values low grain 
prices and a scorching drought made tractor dealer dick rupiper 
uneasy about his chances for survival after 10 years in 
farmmachinery sales 
but rupiper gambled last year and moved his business now he is 
planning to expand his staff to handle steadily increasing demand 
the drought of 88 set everybody back rupiper said in 
1989 we had decent crops farmers had a decent year and it was the 
first year in a long time they felt comfortable spending money 
i think 1990 will be even better i expect things to pick up a 
little more 
rupipers experience parallels that of the tractor and 
farmmachinery industry which is earning solid profits and hopes 
to increase sales this year 
last year rupiper was struggling to keep afloat in illinois 
1500 tractor dealers have gone out of business since 1949 leaving 
about 400 according to figures compiled by the illinois retail 
farm equipment association 
theres just too many dealers in this area and i was worried 
about our survival rupiper said 
so he liquidated his inventory which included equipment from 
four smaller manufacturers closed the farm dealership he owned in 
henry and bought a deere amp co dealership across the illinois river 
in this town of 2100 about 25 miles north of peoria 
business prospects are looking up 
were thinking about hiring a couple people to help out in the 
shop rupiper said i expect things to continue to improve 
he also expects farmers to show increasing concern about soil 
conservation and environmental protection but the process of 
changing to meet those concerns will be slow and expensive 
notill farming for example a soilconservation method that 
involves shallow plowing and leaves more crop residue in fields 
requires an investment in costly new tilling planting and mulching 
equipment 
farmers must be convinced theyll still get maximum yields and 
will be able to pass along the higher equipment costs to consumers 
before theyll invest rupiper said 
molinebased deere the nations leading producer of tractors 
and farm machinery is promoting a line of minimumtillage 
equipment 
but the traditional moldboard plow is far from obsolete and 
implements designed for notill farming remain a small part of 
deeres product line 
conservation in farming is here to stay says deere 
spokesman robert combs but were not even close to replacing the 
tractor or combine 
the evolution to more conservationminded ecologically aware 
farming is not expected to hurt sales of farming equipment in 1990 
the us department of commerce says higher crop prices 
improved land values and reduced farm debt will combine with the 
need to replace aging equipment for a 6 percent increase in sales 
this year 
a 7 percent sales increase was predicted by both the farm and 
industrial equipment institute in chicago an industrysupported 
think tank and starks offhighway ledger a chicagobased 
newsletter that analyzes the industry 
combs said deere projects solid sales increases noting 
production schedules are 5 percent higher than last year 
deere recorded 380 million in profits in 1989 its second 
consecutive recordbreaking year 
steve koep marketing director for case ih of racine wis said 
his companys 1989 rebound should continue into the 90s 
koep said case reported earnings of 288 million in 1989 its 
first profit since 1981 when the company earned 70 million 
factors pointing to higher sales include pentup demand among 
farmers who kept old equipment during the farm crisis of the 1980s 
rather than risk going deeper in debt to buy tractors which 
average 60000 or combines which average 110000 
we see a generally improving economic picture for farmers 
across the board said emmett barker president of the farm and 
industrial equipment institute

composer john corigliano planned to use his 
chicago symphony orchestra commission to write a virtuoso piece 
showcasing its musicians but when his best friend was diagnosed 
with aids he found new inspiration 
coriglianos tragic first symphony incorporating remembrances 
of musicians who have died from disease brought on by aids will 
have its world premiere thursday at the chicago symphony with 
daniel barenboim conducting 
the difference between the concerto for orchestra i was going 
to write and the symphony i did write is largely a question of 
emotional depth and content corigliano said in a recent 
telephone interview from his home in carmel ny the deaths of 
friends the loss the frustration and anger inspired me to 
write it 
i just turned 52 and my mother lives in a retirement 
community to me its a major upset in the natural order that 
my friends should be dying off faster than hers 
it took me two years to put the symphony together and i wrote 
the end of it first he said i had to find where i was going 
find peace perhaps before i could describe the journey 
barenboim who is succeeding sir georg solti as music director 
of the chicago symphony praised coriglianos work 
im very pleased to be doing the world premiere of a 
substantial american piece so early in my time in chicago 
barenboim said it is wonderful that composers such as john 
corigliano write music that is not disassociated from our society 
but reflects our everyday life and the problems we face as human 
beings 
chicago composer william russo whose jazz and rockinfluenced 
works often touch on social themes cited it as probably the first 
aids symphony 
many other people have written works inspired by the epidemic 
but no one of johns scope musically has done anything like 
this he said 
central to the symphony is the image of the aids quilt which 
corigliano first saw in washington several years ago 
i was overwhelmed he said it managed to combine vastness 
with extreme intimacy each of the thousands of squares was crafted 
individually by the loved ones of the victim 
to create his own patchwork effect for the third movement 
corigliano gave the names of acquaintances who had died to william 
h hoffman librettist of coriglianos opera the ghosts of 
versailles hoffman wrote brief poetic epitaphs for the 
symphony 
i took the epitaphs composed melodic fragments for each of 
them discarded the words and wove the melodies together the 
composer explained they are played against one of the main 
themes of the movement 
corigliano composerinresidence at the chicago symphony since 
1987 fit his main themes to several close friends from the new 
york musical world who died from aidsrelated diseases 
i knew each of them for more than 25 years he said 
although the music refers to real people their full names are 
never given 
unfortunately there is still a stigma attached to aids 
corigliano said even when people die of its complications the 
obituaries often give the cause of death as something else theres 
a bitter irony that that still has to be the case 
the first movement of rage and remembrance reflects 
coriglianos distress over the death of a concet pianist friend and 
begins in a manner he describes as ferocious 
midway through though an offstage piano plays a 
turnofthecentury tango that was a favorite of the dead musician 
the rest of the movement alternates between the tension of 
anger and the bittersweet nostalgia of remembering corigliano 
said 
the second movement tarantella recalls a gifted amateur 
musician who became an executive in the music industry and is 
based on a jaunty little piece corigliano wrote for him in 1970 
theres savage irony and nightmare in it said the composer 
my friend was a brilliant witty man but he concealed the 
fact that he had aids until dementia set in just before his death 
you would sit at lunch with him and realize that he was slipping 
off into insanity 
in italian folklore the tarantella is a dance that is 
supposed to cure the insanity caused by the bite of the tarantula 
but in this case its a dance that descends into madness said 
corigliano who earlier used nightmare material in his score for 
the 1985 movie altered states 
the third movement giulios song takes one of its main 
themes from an improvised melody used by giulio an amateur 
cellist while playing with corigliano in 1962 
the giulio theme eventually leads to memories of his cello 
teacher another aids victim and then into the quilt material 
for other departed friends 
eventually the underlying rhythm is revealed as that of a 
funeral march 
the symphony ends peacefully corigliano said with repeating 
waves of chords from a brass choir that partly encircles the 
orchestra 
to me the sound of ocean waves conveys an image of 
timelessness he said

sir david lean can only laugh at how calmly 
hollywood is taking this years foreign invasion of the academy 
awards 
my left foot from ireland five nominations including best 
picture camille claudel from france two nominations including 
best foreign film henry v from england three nominations 
including best director 
yet its business as usual at the oscars there are of course 
the usual arguments over who made it and who didnt but nothing 
like the press conference called by samuel goldwyn in 1946 when 
leans brief encounter and laurence oliviers henry v were 
among several foreign films enjoying critical and commercial 
success 
hollywood is facing a challenge said goldwyn producer of 
such films as wuthering heights and the little foxes 
today it is by the british tomorrow it may be the french or 
the italians or the russians to maintain its place hollywood 
must set aside the old formulas it must find honest stories 
stories with something important to say stories that reflect these 
disturbing times in which we live 
lean was amazed by goldwyns warning because he was sure brief 
encounter would flop after all the film had closed down after 
three days in one italian city because the british filmmaker had 
heard leading man trevor howard was too ugly 
so when brief encounter was previewed at a tiny screening 
room in manhattan lean did his best to slip in and out unnoticed 
it didnt work 
i waited until the lights went out and snuck in the back 
because i just wanted to see what sort of print would be there 
lean said in a recent phone interview from los angeles where he 
received the american film institutes annual life achievement 
award 
when the lights went up i sneaked out i got a few steps down 
the passage and a voice said hi excuse me it was the critic 
from time he said tell me did you direct that and i said 
youre right i did thinking he was going to say god knows what 
he said let me shake your hand that was marvelous 
and that was the first time i knew i was going to get a break 
in america 
brief encounter received three nominations but won no 
oscars and lean eventually felt right at home at the academy 
awards totaling 56 nominations and 27 awards for such films as 
great expectations a passage to india the bridge on the 
river kwai and lawrence of arabia 
since 1932 when charles laughton won best actor for the title 
role in a british production of the private life of henry viii 
oscar has had an ambivalent relationship with foreign movies 
hollywood preferred american products to win but constantly 
recognized worthy foreign efforts 
foreign films especially british have won various prizes from 
cinematography black narcissus to best picture hamlet 
from screenwriting the search to costume design la dolce 
vita 
in 1956 foreign language film became a separate category 
italys la strada won that year but that didnt stop the 
academy of motion picture arts and sciences from nominating foreign 
films and filmmakers in other categories in 1966 the french film 
a man and a woman won a screenplay oscar and was also named 
best foreign film in 1973 sven nykvist won the cinematography 
award for swedens cries and whispers 
the british have dominated the oscars on several occasions 
including lawrence of arabia in 1962 tom jones in 1963 
chariots of fire in 1981 and a room with a view in 1986 
the academy awards in some ways is the absolute tops for a 
moviemaker you cant do better lean said its terrific to 
get and i never thought i would get one 
leans favorite of his own films is lawrence of arabia 
which was released in 1962 and earned seven academy awards 
including best picture and director 
an adventure of a lifetime is how lean remembered the 19 
months of location work for the film anybody who can go out and 
live in the desert for a year is a lucky man he said of the 
title character 
for the starring role he wanted albert finney one of britains 
hottest young actors at the time but after four days of testing 
finney turned him down lean took a chance and cast a then unknown 
peter otoole 
i was desperate because i didnt have a leading man lean 
said i went to a theater in the west end and i saw a film called 
the day they robbed the bank of england and in it was peter 
playing a small part i had never seen him before as he came on 
the screen i thought wait a minute thats a star 
but its not as much fun anymore insists lean who has made 
just two films in the past 20 years ryans daughter and a 
passage to india theres too much talk about money and ever 
since easy rider in 1969 producers have been looking for hit 
films that cost little to make 
the director even longs for the return of bosses such as 
goldwyn tirades and all 
hollywood was something special lean said those chaps 
like goldwyn they were uneducated but all of them however tough 
whatever they were they just loved movies and sought quality now 
its how much 
lean spoke of a recent dinner with billy wilder another 
oscarwinning director and afi honoree who has struggled to find 
work they talked about the problems of being part of hollywood 
history in a business thats always looking ahead 
when you get over 80 the pressures are worse than they ever 
were said lean who turns 81 on march 25 the day before the 
academy awards presentation 
billys bright as a button really entertaining and really 
quick you would think by the way hes treated hes just 
beginning anybody who makes the apartment and some like it hot 
should be up in the highest position 
fortunately lean said he likes the young directors who greeted 
him so warmly on his recent trip he is especially enthusiastic 
about oliver stone and predicts that stone and other directors will 
eventually take control of hollywood from the agents and lawyers 
stone recently won the directors guild award for his born on 
the fourth of july which has received eight oscar nominations 
including best picture 
the filmmakers in hollywood i think are very special theyre 
really keen and theyre all bright and intelligent and theyve got 
a sense of humor they are full of enthusiasm that doesnt seem to 
be at all envious of others lean said 
they just give it to you on a plate its very nice for an old 
bird to get that

syrian soldiers guard gateways of two 
shiite moslem slum districts in south beirut in case kidnappers try 
to smuggle out terry anderson or other western hostages police say 
i am sure they are all alive sheik mohammed mehdi 
shamseddin spiritual head of lebanons shiite community said 
recently that much i can safely ascertain 
other senior shiite sources who claimed to know also said that 
the captives were alive and that most were in south beirut all 
agreed to talk about the situation only if granted anonymity 
police said syrian troops had tightened control around the 
hajjaj and hay madi districts syria has 40000 soldiers in lebanon 
under an arab league peacekeeping mandate issued in 1976 the year 
after the sectarian civil war began 
they are searching everything coming out from both 
neighborhoods where most of the hostages are thought to be 
imprisoned even funeral processions and caskets said a police 
spokesman whose name cannot be used under standing regulations 
syrian soldiers have not tried to storm any suspected hideouts 
of kidnappers apparently for fear of killing hostages 
seventeen westerners are missing in lebanon and believed to be 
hostages including eight americans 
anderson chief middle east correspondent of the associated 
press has been held longest he was abducted five years ago on 
march 16 1985 
the captives have been moved often in car trunks or coffins 
either to escape fighting among shiite factions or to avoid 
detection 
french journalist jeanpaul kauffmann freed in 1988 said he 
nearly suffocated in a box that was slung beneath a truck 
anderson 42 was said to have been chained to a basement wall 
of a ruined beirut hotel during his early days as a captive 
freed hostages have said they too were held in basements or 
sometimes in upperfloor apartments with no access to windows 
all said they heard jet planes landing and taking off which 
supports the belief that most hostages are in the southern slums 
near beiruts airport 
shiites claiming to be close to the kidnappers often have 
approached news agencies in beirut offering to help free anderson 
or anglican church envoy terry waite in return for as much as 1 
million for each hostage none of the offers was believed to be 
legitimate 
waite 50 disappeared jan 20 1987 after leaving his hotel in 
moslem west beirut to negotiate for the freedom of anderson and 
other americans 
president hashemi rafsanjani of iran has asked proiranian 
factions in lebanon grouped under the umbrella of hezbollah or 
party of god to free the hostages but the shiite sources in 
beirut believe rafsanjani has little influence with the militant 
hezbollah wing that controls the hostageholders 
hezbollah militants are loyal to ali akbar mohtashemi the 
hardline former interior minister of iran who helped found 
hezbollah while he was irans ambassador to syria in the early 
1980s anderson is held by a group calling itself islamic jihad or 
islamic holy war 
rafsanjanis hostage behests are a cry without an echo said 
a senior shiite source rafsanjani wants a deal with the united 
states to unblock tehrans frozen assests to cope with irans 
economic crisis which is generating antigovernment public 
sentiment 
mohtashemi and other hardline opposition leaders have a stake 
in maintaining the crisis so they can agitate against rafsanjani 
so no hostages are likely to be released in the near future 
the united states holds billions of dollars in iranian assets 
that were frozen after the storming of the us embassy in tehran 
in 1979 fiftytwo americans were held 444 days 
rafsanjani and other iranian leaders have said iran would help 
get the hostages in lebanon released if the united states freed the 
assets 
this week mohtashemi said some of the captives were spies and 
argued against freeing any of the mercenary us hostages 
support for the hardliners came march 6 when a group holding 
american hostages joseph cicippio and edward austin tracy broke a 
sevenmonth silence to say no captives were about to be freed 
there is no intention to release hostages said the 
revolutionary justice organization which also threatened suicide 
attacks on us interests 
shiite sources said the next hostage release might come from 
islamic jihad for the liberation of palestine which holds american 
college teachers robert polhill alann steen and jesse turner 
hussein mousawi a prosyrian activist based in the bekaa valley 
of east lebanon now controls the group the sources said 
mohtashemi loyalists recently removed mousawi from the hezbollah 
leadership

from a helicopter the wavewashed 
beach looks as if the worst oil spill in us history had never 
touched it 
silvery sticks of driftwood poke through a deep blanket of snow 
and smooth gray pebbles roll in the surf under the gaze of a bald 
eagle perched in a shoreside spruce 
but the view doesnt impress joe bridgman of the alaska 
department of environmental conservation dashing out as the 
chopper lands he digs into the cobble beach and quickly finds what 
he knew he would 
oil he says smell it 
the pungent odor of petroleum wafts through the air as the hole 
turns black with crude oil an oozing remnant of the 108 million 
gallons spilled into prince william sound last march 24 by the 
tanker exxon valdez 
bridgman scoops up a shovelful of gravel lugs it to the waters 
edge and dumps it in a rainbow sheen of oil spreads across the 
water 
hundreds of gallons of oil are locked up under this beach 
he says and this isnt isolated there are hundreds of beaches 
all over the sound that are still oiled and the oil is slowly 
bleeding out 
the beaches can look beautiful at the surface but you can dig 
down in this case just a few inches below the surface and find 
lots of oil now is that a threat or isnt it 
a year after the wreck of the exxon valdez the question clings 
like the oil under this perry island beach certainly the worst is 
over thousands of dead birds no longer wash up on shorelines as 
they did last summer 
but assessing the continuing damage wrought by the nations most 
extensive and expensive oil spill has just begun as a growing 
slick of lawyers haggles over who is to blame exxon corp and 
government agencies debate how to clean up whats left and 
scientists track wildlife populations first steps on the long road 
to recovery 
any hope of a quick solution faded last summer as oil from the 
exxon valdez spread across 1100 miles of alaskas wild southern 
coast 
a cleanup army of 12000 workers polished rocks by hand blasted 
beaches with hot water and sprayed fertilizer to promote the growth 
of oileating microbes 
but when exxon suspended its 2 billion cleanup in 
midseptember it had recovered only 5 percent to 9 percent of the 
oil spilled state officials estimate about 20 percent to 40 
percent is believed to have evaporated that leaves 50 percent to 
75 percent of the oil in the water on the ocean bottom or on 
beaches 
some was soaked up by unwilling sponges the seabirds eagles 
and sea otters whose carcasses now lie frozen in five vans in an 
anchorage storage yard awaiting their day as physical evidence in 
court 
workers found more than 1000 dead otters a sizable chunk of 
the spill areas total population of 15000 to 22000 
many of prince william sounds 3000 bald eagles also suffered 
at least 151 died most poisoned by scavenging the oily remains of 
some of the 34400 dead seabirds recovered 
those numbers alone make the valdez spill the most lethal ever 
but scientists say the actual death count is much higher 
estimating that up to 90 percent of the seabirds caught in oil sank 
from sight or drifted out to sea 
exxon notes the spill did not wipe out any species and says 
surviving animals and birds will rebuild populations but that may 
take up to 70 years for some hardhit seabird colonies us fish 
and wildlife service researchers say 
we never claimed that the spill put any animal on the 
endangered species list but thats missing the point said fish 
and wildlife spokesman bruce batten its still the greatest 
humancaused wildlife disaster that this agency knows about 
oily carcasses were an obvious measure of the spills impact 
but victims also included less visible members of the ecosystem 
such as young salmon and tiny intertidal creatures 
assessment studies for these populations are not finished and 
even preliminary findings are hard to come by researchers have 
been told by lawyers to save their findings for court where it 
seems nearly everyone involved in the spill is headed 
capt joseph hazelwood skipper of the exxon valdez is on trial 
this month in anchorage on charges including criminal mischief and 
drunken driving of his vessel and a federal grand jury recently 
issued criminal indictments against exxon starting a case that 
could take years to finish 
exxon already faces more than 150 civil lawsuits 
fishermen sued because of lost seasons tourboat operators sued 
because fewer people wanted to cruise an oiled sound the state 
sued claiming the company was negligent in responding to the 
spill only to be countersued by exxon which claimed state 
officials hindered the use of chemical dispersants that could have 
broken up large quantities of oil early on 
information about the spill is filtered through this litigious 
atmosphere making much of it suspect exxon distributes 
beforeandafter pictures of cleaned beaches bridgman and other 
state officials accusing exxon of mythmaking eagerly make 
room for journalists on flights to oiled beaches 
state officials cite an october survey that showed 117 miles of 
shoreline remained moderately or heavily oiled with oil more than 
two feet deep in some spots they say observers flying over the 
sound still report 15 to 20 oil sheens bleeding off beaches daily 
exxon officials meanwhile say their winter monitoring of 64 
sites shows wind and waves have scoured away on average more than 
half the surface oil left in september and up to 80 percent of the 
buried oil 
from a laymans point of view whats left out there is really 
insignificant said exxon scientist andy teal

both the state and exxon figures may be accurate but even the 
best studies of the spills effects are mere snapshots of a rugged 
sparsely populated region the size of new jersey maryland and 
delaware combined 
the coast guard has declared some sort of cleanup must resume 
may 1 but nobody has committed to how much or what kind decisions 
will be made after another survey of beach conditions next month 
in general exposed beaches eroded by winter storms appear to 
have fared the best but surface oil remains thick in many 
sheltered coves and estuaries 
areas with oil hidden beneath the surface such as the perry 
island beach bridgman visited may prove the most troublesome 
state officials believe many of those beaches would benefit from 
intensive work such as digging up gravel tumbling it in 
rockwashing machines and replacing it 
while that would kill nearly all living organisms it would 
provide a clean slate for populations to rebuild said steve 
provant the department of environmental conservations spill 
coordinator 
but exxon officials say such intrusive techniques could do more 
harm than good 
some federal authorities are inclined to agree recalling last 
summers heavyhanded invasion of the alaska wilderness 
frightened animals had to flee repeatedly from buzzing 
helicopters and cleanup crews left behind tons of plastic boom 
material absorbent pompons and other litter on previously pristine 
beaches even scientists made their mark painting rocks with 
flourescent paint and tying orange plastic flagging to trees 
you can see these things a mile away and theyre in areas 
where people otherwise would be having a quality wilderness 
experience said nancy lethcoe a sailboattour operator in 
valdez 
lethcoe remembers a prince william sound where you could stand 
on a lonely beach and feel you were the first human ever there it 
was a place where the world still felt big now the world seems 
suddenly smaller civilizations reach extended by the greasy 
fingers of an oil spill 
lethcoe said shell leave the blaming to the lawyers when she 
goes out on the sound these days she focuses on natures 
recuperative powers it works until she discovers that oil has 
found another of her favorite hideaways 
when i know an area is oiled i can brace myself she said 
but when i find an area that wasnt supposed to be oiled it 
brings back the whole trauma of the spill it brings back the 
pain

guns drugs ethnic violence and 
fractious politics have infected the largest city in pakistan some 
fear the new democracy will not survive 
political parties fight pitched battles in the cramped 
alleyways 60 people were killed and hundreds wounded feb 7 
paramilitary forces still patrol karachi and a curfew continues in 
some districts 
the universities are closed and gangs of student extremists have 
turned them into armed camps kidnappings and torture are 
commonplace 
unemployment is rampant government officials say they have no 
way to count the people looking for work 
a gram of heroin costs less than 2 a decade ago the drug was 
hardly found in pakistan now karachi has 300000 addicts 
onethird of the nations total 
automatic weapons used to be rare in karachi today you can rent 
a kalashnikov assault rifle for 5 a day bands of robbers roam the 
countryside and car thieves operate throughout the city 
many residents say the police are either corrupt or incompetent 
police say they are outnumbered and outgunned wih one officer to 
458 citizens one of the lowest ratios in south asia 
karachi once a city of peace tranquility and affluence has 
turned almost into beirut mahmood ali malik a noted 
psychologist wrote in the pakistan times 
the army is certainly waiting in the wings said ahmed ali 
khan editor of the dawn the largest englishlanguage newspaper 
increased chaos could threaten our democracy 
eleven years of martial law ended two years ago after gen 
mohammed zia ulhaq the president was killed in a plane crash 
prime minister benazir bhutto elected in november 1988 presides 
over a shaky government 
any problem pakistan has karachi appears to have in greater 
measure because of its size and importance karachis problems 
have national scope 
eight million people live in the city which sprawls on the 
sunbaked coast of the arabian sea it is pakistans economic 
center and the only major port 
three layers of interwoven troubles weigh on the city and the 
rest of sind province which surrounds karachi ethnic strife 
social breakdown and a newer phenonmenon called the heroin and 
kalashnikov culture 
guns have been plentiful in pakistan ever since soviet military 
forces entered afghanistan in december 1978 and the ussupported 
afghan rebels moved their bases to pakistan 
millions of dollars in us aid to the rebels helped finance a 
huge arms trade in northern pakistan simultaneously the making of 
heroin became an important source of income for afghan refugees and 
indigenous tribes in the area 
weapons accompanied the narcotics south to karachi a main 
conduit for heroin to western europe and the united states about 
6000 pounds of heroin were seized in karachi in the last half of 
1989 more than double the total for 1986 and 10 times the amounts 
of earlier years 
shootings of law enforcement officers are frequent a ranking 
customs agent was shot six times in the face and leg as he left his 
home last june on what was to be a secret raid he survived 
drugs and guns in the city combine with increasing crime in the 
surrounding countryside disputes formerly resolved by a village 
headman now are settled with guns historian hamida khoura said 
we face an institutional breakdown throughout the province 
said fakhruddin ibrahim governor of sind province chaos is 
ruling and police can do little to stop it 
the police in pakistan have always been a political tool he 
said in an interview years of martial law taught them that i 
dont see it changing 
add ethnic strife and the situation becomes increasingly 
volatile 
ever since the subcontinent was divided into india and pakistan 
in 1947 at the end of british colonial rule karachi has been 
pakistans closest thing to a melting pot 
pathans and punjabis moved south to make a fast rupee in the 
port city sindhis came from the countryside to sell their produce 
immigrants called mohajirs flooded into moslem pakistan from 
predominantly hindu india 
nothing melted in the pot however and trouble between rival 
ethnic groups began in the 1950s 
ethnic strife acquired political overtones in 1985 with 
formation of the mohajir qaumi movement which sought to represent 
the interests of immigrants from india 
mohajirs say they are discriminated against by the provincial 
government which sindhis dominate they want more jobs and 
official recognition of their ethnic group 
their movement has become an important political force because 
mohajirs are more numerous than any other group in the cities of 
sind province including karachi 
altaf hussain leads the movement the former pharmacy student 
known for strirring speeches everpresent sunglasses and opulently 
ringed fingers has adopted sell your tv and buy a gun as his 
battle cry 
we are a new phenonmenon a party of destiny hussain said 
in an interview we are the first party to represent the 
oppressed and suppressed masses i am the chosen leader 
karachi politics went national when hussain united with the 
national opposition in an attempt to bring down the bhutto 
government 
ms bhuttos pakistan peoples party based in sind had an 
alliance with hussain during the campaign but tended to ignore 
mohajir interests after winning the election 
in november she barely defeated a noconfidence vote in the 
national assembly when the 14 members from the mohajir movement 
voted against her 
on feb 7 hussain called for a general strike in karachi to 
protest what he described as persecution by her party scores of 
people were killed in clashes between police and gunmen of both 
parties 
more than 200 kidnappings were reported victims were tortured 
with electric drills castration and multiple cigarette burns 
on march 2 talks began between hussains group and the bhutto 
party 
we all realize that things have gotten as bad as they can 
get said nafees siddiqi a top official of the pakistan peoples 
party in sind if things get worse the army could roll back in 
structural problems stand in the way of political peace 
pakistan has been under martial law for 20 of the last 30 years 
and now has an extremely centralized system many observers say 
violent politics will continue until some authority devolves to 
cities and provinces 
now everybody can be an extremist because none of them has 
real authority said ibrahim the provincial governor give 
them a budget and theyll become moderates 
ansar burney who fights for prisoner rights and against drug 
abuse in karachi says few residents have the national interest at 
heart 
no one in karachi thinks about the public good he said 
theyre just obsessed with power and guns

an angry college dropout has formed a 
strong political movement in the streets of pakistans biggest city 
and taken as his battle cry sell your tv and buy a gun 
altaf hussain a 36yearold former student of pharmacy has 
maneuvered into a key position in pakistans politics tapping 
ethnic anger and alienation among the lower and middle classes of 
karachi 
we are the new phenonmenon hussain said in an interview at 
his headquarters we are the new revolution 
the great leader as he is known is a charismatic man famed 
in the cities of sind province as a stirring speaker hussain also 
is known for the sunglasses he always wears opulently ringed 
fingers and volcanic temper 
his main weapon is the ability to shut down karachi which has 
more than 8 million people and is pakistans economic center 
he ordered a citywide strike feb 7 scores of people were 
killed and hundreds injured in street battles between his 
supporters rival political group and police 
we represent the oppressed and suppressed masses he said 
we work only for their interests 
hussain leads the mohajir quaim movement mohajirs immigrated 
from predominantly hindu india to moslem pakistan after 1947 when 
the british turned the subcontinent into two nations and granted 
them independence 
the mohajir movement claims its people are discriminated against 
by sindhis the majority in sind province sindhis dominate the 
provincial assembly and hold most of the top government jobs 
mohajirs generally are better educated than the sindhis and 
many feel they have been denied opportunities to advance 
i give expression to my peoples feelings hussain said i 
know what they want 
a clint eastwood classic the outlaw josie wales played on 
a videocassette recorder behind him hussian fingered a huge yellow 
sapphire on his middle finger 
like many leaders of ethnic political movements hussain does 
not follow a strict ideology 
we are not socialists or capitalists he said we believe 
in practicalism and realism he did not elaborate 
his wellarmed men are known as the black shirts of karachi 
testimony to the strict discipline imposed by his lieutenants 
western diplomats estimate hussain has about 8000 men under arms 
in karachi and 4000 more in hyderabad sinds second largest city 
the movements headquarters dominates the azizabad section of 
karachi a lower middle class area of cement block houses and 
serpentine alleys hussains bodyguards armed with automatic 
rifles stand at the huge steel gates 
hussain is the son of a laborer and dropped out of college in 
the early 1980s to be a fulltime political organizer 
he allied himself with the pakistan peoples party of benazir 
bhutto duirng the november 1988 election campaign supplying the 
future prime minister with important votes but ms bhuttos party 
generally ignored mohajir interests after winning

charmaine neville isnt bitter but she 
admits she hasnt forgotten those bad old days before her father 
and uncles were famous when her family was broken up and she was 
fighting for survival in one foster home after another 
being a neville is great now but it was a hard trip getting 
here for the neville brothers the neville nieces and nephews and 
especially this neville i think one reason our music is so 
important to all of us is because we had such a hard hard time 
hanging on to it she said 
long before the neville brothers became grammy winners long 
before aaron neville teamed up with linda ronstadt long before 
charmaine began working clubs and making movies and commercials 
the family was poor and scattered 
neville 34 doesnt remember meeting her father charles 
neville of the neville brothers until she was about 5 years old 
from the time she was 2 until she was 12 she spent her life in a 
series of foster homes 
i was abused just about every way you can be during that time 
sexually mentally physically she said i was bitter for a 
long time a very long time im not anymore i know now my parents 
couldnt help it they were young they didnt have any money or 
any way to take care of us 
in those days the neville brothers were scratching for gigs and 
singing for next to nothing 
they were young and inexperienced getting known outside of 
new orleans wasnt easy then its still not but its easier now 
than it was them she said 
little by little the neville family came back together she met 
one of her four sisters in school another when they took the same 
bus to her aunts house and arrived together her four brothers 
turned up over the years as a teenager she also got to know her 
father and uncles 
i adore my father always did i love my family including my 
last set of foster parents and all 52 of my foster sisters and 48 
of my foster brothers now that were back together its ok 
neville said 
through it all music was a part of her life and her family she 
said 
id always sung in the church choir my family always made 
music together i didnt really get serious about it until i was 
about 17 though neville said 
my dad hurt my feelings we had been playing in new york when 
he said call me when you get serious about your music because 
music is very serious to me and youre not being serious about it 
 
thats when she went to work learning to read music learning 
to control her voice learning to put her own mark on a song she 
said 
up until then i just opened my mouth and sang neville said 
now she jumps on stage in a swirl of motion and music hands 
clap hips sway long slim fingers pop the mass of thin braids 
whip back and forth 
i dont like to classify my singing neville said if i 
say im a jazz singer then people ask why i do pop or rock or 
country and western and i do all of those i prefer to think of 
each song as a little oneact play i think of myself as an 
entertainer and not just a singer 
like the neville brothers nevilles musical blend of new 
orleans rhythms mixes in jazz cajun rock and old time blues 
particularly popular with audiences is her impersonation of louis 
armstrong 
its really not that hard she said of the gravelvoiced 
satchmo she does for several numbers its just like singing 
falsetto really it started as a joke someone asked me if i could 
do louis armstrong and now people request it all the time 
her music is different from that of the neville brothers but it 
is a product of their teaching she said 
from aaron she learned voice control 
hes just phenomenal his range the things he can do he 
really showed me how to use my voice and get more from it she 
said 
from cyril she learned her stage presence 
hes the wild neville brother he taught me to not just stand 
there but to open up and have fun with the audience she said 
from art she learned music 
he showed me the parts of music that you can use when you know 
what youre doing how to take it apart and put it together 
again she said 
and from charles she learned to work 
dads the coolest of the neville brothers hes the one who 
just stands there on stage but hes also the one who showed me how 
much work you have to do to be that cool 
neville works about 360 days a year mostly in clubs although 
she is a regular at the new orleans jazz and heritage festival and 
has made numerous commercials and appeared in several movies and at 
least one television pilot 
in june she will perform in moscow in july shell be in paris 
in the fall she hopes to return to milan italy 
she doesnt often work with her famous family these days she 
said 
weve all gotten too busy now it seems like we are always 
passing each other in airports when we do get together its a 
trip i was in a club called delta 88 in new york and dad and uncle 
aaron and uncle arty came in we really tore up the club it was 
great she said 
with her own career building and the sudden interest in new 
orleans artists such as her uncles harry connick jr and dr john 
neville said things look great now 
i just hope this isnt a fad like blackened redfish she 
said i mean why now the music has been here forever people in 
the rest of the world may not know about new orleans music but 
theyre about to get lessons i just want to be one of the 
teachers

stephanie vaughn would like to point out that 
her short stories are fiction she made up the good parts 
her real father would have never walked on a frozen pond in the 
middle of the night her grandmother is much nicer than the one 
depicted in able baker charlie dog the stories about winter 
were written during heat waves the summer stories came in cold 
weather 
but she really did grow up in a military family as a teenager 
the author actually mistook puberty for a fatal disease and she 
was encouraged to speak carefully as a child and be precise a 
style she eventually mastered in written form 
i dont think its natural for anybody to write insists 
vaughn whose first collection of stories is called sweet talk 
random house 1695 
i think its natural to speak and everybodys a storyteller 
you go through your life telling stories its hard to write 
sometimes things come out funny when you dont want them to at that 
moment youre always in danger of destroying your story and 
turning it into a joke 
the laughter comes in different shades i grew up in the 
army vaughn writes at the start of kid macarthur 
about the only kind of dove i ever saw was a dead dove resting 
smallboned upon a dinner plate the theory of the universe 
shares space with a local car crash premature death is just a few 
pages from a sales pitch for the triple gripper vegetable ripper 
having lived around the world as a child vaughn is an authority 
on the unexpected she knows writing is as predictable as driving 
on an icy road that a straight line is not the quickest path 
between two points 
dog heaven begins on a new york city sidewalk a women 
dreaming of her dogs death 25 years ago and ends with the 
narrator remembering her childhood at fort niagara saying the 
following incantation it was a good day it was a good day it 
was a good day 
yeah i didnt know it was coming vaughn said i knew 
what was going to happen to the dog but i didnt know how i was 
going to get out of the story you often dont know how youre 
going to get out of the story until you get there i think if 
youre not surprised by your writing you should probably get out 
of it 
vaughn was born in millersburg ohio but also lived in new 
york oklahoma texas the philippines and italy writing first 
interested her in australia in the 1970s and she eventually 
attended the university of iowa 
i liked living near cornfields the town itself iowa city 
was just full of writers full of painters full of filmmakers 
its a good place because there are so many other people doing art 
and you talk about everything all the time with those people 
vaughn notes that sweet talk is crammed with advice that 
isnt always useful theories on love language and disease are all 
offered but only sometimes accepted in kid macarthur a boys 
father imposes his own code of honor advice for a world that only 
some experience 
the father is trying to give his son masculine skills the 
author said he values language and gossip and he also values 
guns he wants him to be a good marksman and not show his 
vulnerabilities when hes out shooting 
i suppose being a good marksman is useful if youre on your 
way to vietnam but its not necessarily useful at home 
from other writers vaughn learned the importance of revision 
sentence rhythms to sacrifice favorite lines if they dont fit the 
story and the words have to flow as relaxed as conversation but 
as formally structured as a high school term paper 
you have to invent she said you have to discover on the 
page a voice its very difficult to define what a voice is but 
you know it when its speaking back to you from the page you just 
hit something that sounds comfortable 
vaughn is now working on a novel but firmly declines to discuss 
it presenting a theory she wouldnt dare offer to any writer but 
herself dont discuss a story until its finished the surest way 
to lose your literary voice is to talk about it 
if you talk about something thats not finished than youre 
giving it a spoken form and therefore theres no reason to give it 
a written form since i never talk about them they come out 
better now with these short stories its almost as if someone 
else has written them

mark miller of the popcountry band 
sawyer brown feels reassured when he looks out at concert crowds 
and sees people holding up signs with numbers like 70 and 
52 
the figures represent the number of sawyer brown concerts the 
fan has attended 
ive seen some in the hundreds but no 200s yet miller 
said a lot of them are over 50 
miller said the signs are a tradition started soon after the 
band began touring fans who were proud of the number of concerts 
they had attended would hold up a sign 
sawyer brown which has five members has developed a legion of 
loyal fans since the group won on the syndicated tv show star 
search in 1983 
the fans keep returning to the concerts as evidenced by the 
signs even though the band has weathered a monumental problem 
little radio air play 
the group named after a nashville street is too pop for 
country music stations and too country for rock n roll stations 
so the five have relied on their frenzied pulsating unpredictable 
stage shows to maintain their popularity they ignite audiences by 
dancing jumping and whirling across the stage with supercharged 
energy 
they play upbeat goodtime music with a driving rhythm and 
tight vocals all set off by brightly colored clothing 
after winning star search and splitting the 100000 prize 
money five ways the group began recording for capitol records a 
year later shortly after that they were the opening act at kenny 
rogers concerts for 1 years performing live for millions 
the nashvillebased band has had hit records along the way 
including step that step the race is on shakin and 
leona they have released six albums including the current 
the boys are back 
miller reflecting on the bands career said winning star 
search was their breakthrough but the aftermath posed a 
formidable challenge 
when you hit that big that quick people start asking whether 
you are a flash in the pan it was like when the beach boys first 
came out some people thought they were a fad in our case some 
people felt we would be too so there were some serious storms we 
had to weather 
i think everybody wants you to succeed until you succeed and 
then they start gunning for you and the guns came out real quick 
on us he said 
we are a legitimate act that drew people month after month and 
year after year regardless of whether we had a hit record out 
people knew they would see a show as entertainment value 
basically we sold our records going door to door doing 250 dates 
a year 
he described their concerts as intense very intense a friend 
of mine said its like being part of an event like a huge party 
thats what we try to make it 
before winning star search the group polished its act for 
two years as a bar band at various nightclubs throughout the 
country on good nights they played five sets and on bad nights 
they did seven they often had a rowdy table contest where the 
most uproarious table won a pitcher of beer 
for miller it was a new experience and a valuable one 
i had never been in a bar until i played one he recalled 
you learn that you can be a jukebox or you can demand their 
attention by entertaining them 
exposure on a much wider basis came when they joined rogers on 
his concert tours 
when we first got the call i was so excited miller said 
it was a dream come true i was also scared to death 
i remember the crowd going crazy and on the second night kenny 
came out to see what all the commotion was about he came in the 
dressing room and said we had a job as long as we wanted one 
sawyer brown is one of the few bands that sign autographs after 
every show 
we do them as long as it takes miller said we feel like 
we owe it to the fans as the least we can do people remember 
things like that

ever since john huston with more than a little help from 
dashiell hammett invented the private eye movie with the maltese 
falcon in 1941 the genre has thrived in many manifestations 
raymond chandler added a cynical note with his philip marlowe best 
portrayed by dick powell in murder my sweet 
comic gumshoes have rarely succeeded though steve martin tried 
in dead men dont wear plaid and peter falk in the cheap 
detective now comes love at large which proves that a 
private eye satire can be funny and involving at the same time 
the feat was accomplished by the most improbable of filmmakers 
alan rudolph a disciple of robert altman rudolph has made films 
welcome to la made in heaven the moderns that 
seemed quirky remote and humorless in making love at large 
he seems to be saying ok ill make a movie thatll grab em 
rudolphs hero harry dobbs tom berenger is a dense philip 
marlowe with a columbo voice harry cant seem to get anything 
right he agrees to an investigation for a sultry lady of mystery 
anne archer then follows the wrong man 
dobbs uncovers an interesting though irrelevant case a 
successful man with two families one in the city and one on a 
ranch he is followed on his quest by another private eye 
elizabeth perkins hired by his jealous girlfriend ann magnuson 
the wayward detective finally gets back on track and the film 
reaches a violent though unexpected finale the plot is rambling 
and inconclusive but the enjoyment comes from the characters most 
of them cast against type 
berenger the demonic sergeant of platoon is a comic 
delight with his sandpaper voice and well meaning klutziness 
anne archer the wronged wife in fatal attraction plays a 
humanoid jessica rabbit a gorgeous parody of a 1940s femme fatale 
elizabeth perkins the sharp executive of big is sympathetic 
as dobbs fallible partner 
the strong cast also included annette otoole ruby dee neil 
young and kate capshaw rudolph gives all his actors a chance to 
shine 
inflation note harry dobbs charges 500 a week retainer plus 
expenses wouldnt sam spade and philip marlowe be envious 
the orion picture was produced by david blocker and is rated r 
for language violence and sexual byplay running time 110 minutes

chocolat orion vhsbeta 7998 rated pg13 
 
france and protee have a special relationship they communicate 
spiritually silently their imaginations intertwine 
but they are adrift in a political and social stew it is the 
ebbing days of french rule in cameroon france is white protee is 
her familys black houseboy 
their world is shattered when a group of white travelers with 
plane problems arrive and become house guests there is betrayal 
and a painful coming of age 
isaach de bankole is excellent as protee bringing just the 
right reserve to the role mireille perrier is haunting 
the french movie is directed by claire denis though her pacing 
is sometimes slow she moves her story with feeling

an innocent man touchstone vhsbeta 8995 rated r 
 
whats the story every convict tells im innocent 
only this time its true tom selleck stars as jimmie rainwood 
an ordinary guy who services aircraft whose ordinary life becomes 
a horror show when two corrupt cops frame him for drug dealing in 
order to cover up their mistake 
he of course pleads not guilty at his trial is convicted and 
shipped off to the big house where he meets the usual herd of 
prison animals theres the usual prison challenges and violence 
seen in just about all jail movies only this time an innocent man 
must prove himself in order to survive he does this by murdering 
another prisoner 
when hes released he seeks his vengeance 
an innocent man directed by peter yates who did so well 
years ago with bullitt is a good idea and plays just fine as 
far as it goes but its missing a toughness an edge the drama 
and tension that could make it a far more compelling movie 
the problem unfortunately might be selleck although he gives 
a fine performance as the wronged citizen hes simply too nice a 
guy the two cops are predictably sleazy and telegraph their moves 
but what the movie lacks in excitement is made up for in its 
realistic prison scenes and prison lingo f murray abraham is a 
delight as the prisons respected lifer 
the video is worth a look

the cactus album columbiadef jam 3rd bass 
 
yeeoww rap for the new generation 
on 3rd bass the cactus album there are beats more 
effective than mike tysons uppercut and rapping more fresh than a 
daisy 
but hold on now 3rd bass is white and they leave the beastie 
boys in the dust the beasties come off as a bunch of middleclass 
white brats trying to pull one over on the recordbuying public 
however 3rd bass mc serch 22yearold michael berrin and 
prime minister pete nice 22yearold peter nash grew up in the 
new york borough of queens and hung out in allblack housing 
projects and city parks getting bashed around but learning to rap 
hard 
their debut album is a slammin mix of vocals quirky recordings 
and sampled music that like de la souls 3 feet high and 
rising will have you playing name that tune they take bits from 
pink floyds time the 70s hit dream weaver and mutate the 
melody from blood sweat and tears spinning wheel 
while some rap music is just tedious thumpthumping with 
shouttalking vocals the cactus album shows raps power to 
create postrock postpop hybrid music 
this record is a stew cooked in the melting pot of new york 
with a load of ingredients as large as the empire state building 
words they got words lots of them and yeah some of those 
words arent too nice 
but mc serch and pete nice also have wordz of wizdom like 
black cat is bad luck bad guys wear black mustve been a white 
guy who started all that on the gas face 
on product of the environment they comment pushin a 
drug i cant understand destroying a life with a buck in the 
hand 
these boys have fun too the album opens with a bit of the 
little rascals theme and closes with abbott and costello doing a 
scratchin version of their whos on first routine only 
theyre asking whos on 3rd 
3rd bass punches a knockout dense form of rap that goes way 
beyond their peers

jim croce live the final tour saja jim croce 
 
nostalgia for the 1970s appears inevitable so we might as well 
learn to deal with it one simple way would be to avoid ripoffs 
such as the new disc jim croce live the final tour 
singersongwriter croce died in a plane crash in 1973 this new 
live recording doesnt serve his memory at all well despite ingrid 
croces role as executive producer 
for one thing the package is cheap theres one picture of 
croce and no liner notes theres a whole generation of music 
buyers out there who werent born when croce died they should be 
told a little about his life and music 
basic facts are ignored who played with croce where was the 
performance recorded when was this an entire show or just a 
portion 
the 16cut disc includes an appalling 18 minutes of croce 
talking to the audience hes mildly amusing though occasionally 
dated when was the last time you heard jokes about the maharishi 
one stretch is remarkably ghoulish croce apparently months 
weeks or days from dying in a burning plane talks about trips on 
allegheny airlines which later became usair he jokes about a 
whiteknuckle flight 
the worst thing about the dialogue of course is its much 
better to hear croce sing than talk unfortunately you wont hear 
him sing some of his bestknown songs including bad bad leroy 
brown time in a bottle or i got a name couldnt a few 
minutes of talking be sacrificed 
a couple of songs could be sacrificed too one potential victim 
is the dated roller derby queen with the 528 minutes of 
roller derby queen dialogue preceding it the lewd limerick 
ball of kerrymuir is tasteless 
operator thats not the way it feels and the poignant 
these dreams which bookend the disc are croces best musical 
moments elsewhere a lack of balance in the recording the voices 
too loud and guitars too soft is an annoyance 
with so many wellresearched and welldocumented reissues coming 
out these days its disheartening to see such a shabby package 
vinyl buyers can take heart though jim croce live the final 
tour is available only on cassette and compact disc

in the late 1950s george stevens decided to 
make a movie version of the tony awardwinning play the diary of 
anne frank based on the stirring journal of a teenagers loss 
of innocence and the destruction and horror wrought by the 
holocaust 
only one actress he thought could breath life into young anne 
franks words of hope and selfknowledge audrey hepburn 
she was a fresh face for american audiences and had captured the 
best actress academy award for her 1953 hollywood debut in william 
wylers roman holiday she was fragile yet strong innocent 
yet worldly elfin childlike sensual and quietly elegant she was 
the indestructible waif 
like anne she had lived in the netherlands during the nazi 
occupation hepburn had first read the diary in 1946 when she was 
16 i was deeply affected by it when i first read it she 
recalled in a recent interview it paralleled so much what i had 
experienced 
anne frank and i were the same age and she recorded 
everything she had heard about which i had experienced on the 
outside plus her own deep feelings the development of her 
adolescence and her relationship with her parents and her feelings 
about life all of which were very typical of a sensitive girl of 
that age 
hepburn reread the diary when stevens made his offer it brought 
back a flood of memories and she turned him down the part went to 
millie perkins 
i was so destroyed by it again that i said i couldnt deal 
with it hepburn said i suppose its very hard to explain 
its a little bit as if this had happened to my sister i couldnt 
play my sisters life its too close and in a way she was a 
sister soul perhaps i could not exploit for what i considered 
entertainment the suffering and experience she had gone through 
anne frank died at the bergenbelsen concentration camp in 1945 
after contracting typhoid fever today she would be 60 like 
audrey hepburn 
and today hepburn is finally ready to read annes words she 
will do so on sunday at the world premiere performance of michael 
tilson thomas musical based on the diary of anne frank the 
concert is a special benefit for unicef for which hepburn is the 
goodwill ambassador 
now im very happy to read her words hepburn said from her 
home in switzerland im thrilled to do so because i think its 
something very important theyre very deep and theyre pure 
becuase she was a child and she wrote them from her heart and i 
think its a lovely opportunity to relay her thoughts once again 
her spirit 
anne franks words she herself a child will be used to 
bring solace to children it would have made her very happy 
since leaving the film business about two decades ago to 
concentrate on being a mother to her two sons sean now 29 and 
luca 20 hepburn has spent some of her time working with unicef 
the international organization didnt suddenly float into 
hepburns life because she needed some sort of social cause as for 
politics she describes herself as totally unpolitical 
ive never known anything about politics she said i just 
care terribly because i saw so much as a child about suffering and 
the suffering of children 
rather she first encountered the organization that would grow 
into unicef shortly after the germans surrendered when she and 
others who had survived the harsh winter months of 194445 with 
little food and inadequate clothing received relief 
i somehow feel ive been connected with unicef all my life 
she said they were there right after liberation so i benefitted 
from their help like millions of other children then over the 
years ive been constantly in contact for some reason or another 
hepburn was born in belgium her parents divorced when she was 6 
and she went to live with her mother the baroness ella van 
heemstra in holland as a youngster she studied ballet she later 
went to london to pursue dance and eventually found herself in 
british films lavender hill mob young wives tales 
she first got the attention of broadway and hollywood while 
filming monte carlo baby at the hotel de paris in monaco she 
was spotted by the french writer colette who thought she would make 
an excellent gigi for the play based on her novel hepburn an 
unknown opened as the lead at the fulton theater in november 1951 
she jumped from broadway to star in roman holiday with 
gregory peck 
hepburn quietly glided out of film work in the late 60s after 
wait until dark and two for the road she reappeared with 
sean connery as the aging robin hood and his maiden in robin and 
marian in 1976 and shocked fans with her graying hair and hint of 
wrinkles she appeared in the thriller bloodline with its 
allstar cast in 1979 and made a tv movie with robert wagner in 
1987 then late last year she popped up on the screen in steven 
spielbergs always as an angel guide 
always was such a surprise she said i got a divine 
phone call from steven spielberg and i was just thrilled to death 
it took me one second to decide it was such wonderful fun and 
therapy and montana was so beautiful it was a marvelous 
experience 
and yes she would definitely do another movie if its steven 
spielberg 
holly golightly meets et 
holly in breakfast at tiffanys was one of hepburns most 
memorable roles she was endearing extreme and elegant all of 
hepburns characters mirrored the actress herself there was always 
a humanity and quiet grace and bursts of elfin charm 
in sabrina with humphrey bogart and william holden she was 
charming as the chauffeurs daughter who falls in love with the 
wealthy playboy in the nuns story she demonstrated her 
talent for drama and she matched albert finney line for line as 
the young lovers who become a troubled married couple in two for 
the road 
but hepburn never thought of herself as a star or a talented 
artist 
i never had this huge talent or a great technique she said 
but somehow i may have had something that contributed this 
extraordinary run of fortune 
i dont know its something about personality an enormous 
joy perhaps that i had in doing what i was doing and being able to 
convey that and a sort of affection for what i was doing and for 
the people around me and the story i was doing and the parts i 
was playing and the people who would be watching me 
it was all sort of a big love affair

venezuelan artists once labored in 
obscurity gaining recognition only after their deaths 
today however such artists as reveron an eccentric who lived 
in a shack he built along the venezuelan coast francisco narvaez 
whose monumental sculptures grace many public parks and plazas the 
kineticist jesus soto and abstract sculptor marisol are attracting 
investors from around the world 
venezuelan and latin american art is hotter now than it has ever 
been last november world records were set in auctions of latin 
american art at the two largest art auction houses in new york 
christies sold 262 works for an unprecedented total of 95 
million while sales at sothebys netted 55 million 
i can definitely say there is a boom in venezuelan art said 
axel stein sotheby house representative in venezuela and colombia 
before 1975 people only talked about latin american art we 
thought a painting by reveron for example mujer con mantilla 
would fetch about 100000 and it sold for 300000 in november 
there is a growing interest on the part of informed collectors 
artists in venezuela have usually been relegated to a second 
tier on the international scale with only a few breaking into the 
ranks of the greats 
but all that is changing as differences in world culture 
rapidly shrink and art work becomes a commodity a calculated 
gamble on its future financial worth 
one person who has done her share in promoting world art within 
venezuela and venezuelan art abroad is sofia imber founder of the 
caracas museum of contemporary art 
the museum which opened in 1974 has an international 
reputation for the quality of its expositions and permanent 
collection that includes such artists as picasso braque moore 
herbin chagall and calder 
nothing is easy sometimes im amazed when i look back and see 
where weve come from imber said in an interview in her offices 
below the museum 
besides her museum work imber is host of a popular tv talk show 
and writes regularly about cultural affairs in venezuelan 
newspapers she was also married to carlos rangel the conservative 
intellectual and writer who died three years ago 
imbers interest in art came as an adolescent she recalled 
seeing one of armando reverons paintings on display when she was 
about 11 or 12 years old 
in those days he was an unknown i sat and cried in front of 
the painting i dont remember which one now it was then i 
discovered my vocation to work for art she said 
imber sees no essential differences between latin american and 
european art the best horses run with the herd of the great 
ones i dont believe in regionalism she said 
however one of the problems confronting latin american artists 
is a lack of regional unity not only in art but in culture 
generally just as latin american economies must integrate in order 
to survive in the modern marketplace latin american artists must 
strive to know each others work better she said 
we know less of what happens in bogota colombia than what 
happens in paris or new york imber said 
but contemporary artists are doing much to polish venezuelas 
international art reputation 
its a good moment for the younger generation people like 
jesus soto jacobo borges and arturo cruzdiez she said 
but contemporary artists still suffer from slow acceptance on 
the part of european and north american art lovers 
sure there is some chauvinism said stein but its just 
as difficult for a north american contemporary artist to be 
accepted here theres too much competition there are many people 
trying to break the barriers but its hard 
stein said it was important that private foundations artists 
and collectors get together in order to promote contemporary latin 
american art 
the colombians did an outstanding job promoting their younger 
artists in the 70s he said there were many colombian artists 
in new york and paris with the help of the government the 
colombian embassies businesses and foundations they tried to 
identify artists and move them along with oilrich venezuela on 
the other hand the tendency was to be satisfied with the internal 
market 
but local collectors of which there are a select few in 
venezuela can also be important in sustaining and promoting local 
art stein said 
in the 60s and 70s you could buy young artists work for 
10000 bolivars about 2325 at the exchange rate then you 
couldnt get anything today for less than 200000 bolivars about 
4000 at current exchange rates but it still might be a good 
investment he said 
one young venezuelan sculptor carlos mendoza shares his 
contemporaries enthusiasm 
i think the local market is a good one and it will keep 
growing despite the economic crisis we are living through but i 
want to break through internationally as soon as i can it doesnt 
happen overnight but people are buying more art not just because 
of their taste but because they see it as an investment said 
mendoza who is installing a piece of sculpture outside a caracas 
metro station

william farley is seeing his share of troubles as 
he puts the finishing stitches on his 3 billion acquisition of 
west pointpepperell 
its been a little more than a year since the pepperell board 
agreed to his 58ashare offer for the georgiabased maker of such 
popular products as martex and lady pepperell sheets and towels 
but farley has faced multiple obstacles to acquiring the last 5 
percent of the textile giant and unloading some of pepperells 
assets to reduce the debt he incurred in the takeover 
because of farleys failure so far to complete the financing 
two major credit rating agencies have downgraded the debt of farley 
inc and pepperell 
and there is speculation that farley may be forced to sell fruit 
of the loom one of the crown jewels of his corporate empire to 
cut debt further 
farleys troubles have come amid and some say have reflected 
the waning of the junk bond and debtfinanced takeover era in which 
he and others prospered during the 1980s 
with the retrospective of 12 months it is clear he paid too 
much for west point said kay c norwood a textile industry 
analyst with interstatejohnson lane in charlotte nc 
certainly he paid way too much 
ms norwood however isnt ruling out the chance that farley a 
former encyclopedia salesman who has talked about running for 
president will come out on top and she is not alone in that view 
things looked better for farley last year when he outlasted 
thenchairman joseph l lanier jr in a fourmonth battle for 
control of pepperell 
despite an undercurrent of anxiety over possible mass layoffs at 
local mills west point ga and the surrounding communities near 
the alabama line welcomed the man who during the takeover battle 
had been derided as a carpetbagger out to get a company that for 
generations was locally run 
welcome to a new beginning farley town usa read a banner 
hung at the entrance of a west point bank at the time 
farley paid 16 billion in april 1989 for 95 percent of 
pepperell assuming more than 1 billion in debt in the process 
his problems with debt magnified his problems financing the 
buyout said joseph e mccann an associate professor at emory 
universitys business school in atlanta 
so youve got a situation where you dont have just one deal 
youve got to make a lot of deals to consummate the original 
one mccann added the more complex the deals the easier it is 
to fall apart 
he needed to do a onestopshopping financial transaction 
and he did not 
contributing to farleys problems was his association with 
drexel burnham lambert inc which raised 905 million for the 
acquisition through the sale of junk bonds since drexels recent 
bankruptcy court filing farley has hired new investment bankers to 
restructure the pepperell financing 
farley also has a 103 billion bridge loan which has been 
extended through the end of this month 
the proposed sale of three of pepperells cluett peabody amp co 
divisions to bidermann industries usa a subsidiary of a french 
company was considered crucial to cutting farleys takeover debt 
but the deal announced in october has not been closed and the 
sale price reportedly has dropped to 430 million from the original 
600 million 
farley officials did not return telephone calls 
ms norwood said she thinks farley will complete the pepperell 
deal but he may not like the results 
some divisions are going to be sold at prices he doesnt 
like she said the banks are going to want the sales very 
quickly the banks dont want to end up owning a textile 
company 
despite his predicament with the buyout farley has gotten high 
marks for some of the things hes done as pepperell chairman 
many of laniers executive allies left with the former chairman 
farley has hired the respected charles a lieppe a veteran 
executive with procter amp gamble co as pepperells new president 
and chief operating officer 
also pepperell has pruned the executive suites and added 800 
people at five plants in the past year more than 80 million has 
been invested in plant improvements

nl industries inc chairman harold simmons 
waging a proxy battle for control of the lockheed corp board 
contends he can increase the firms returns by concentrating on its 
core defense and aerospace businesses 
simmons the companys largest stockholder with a 19 percent 
stake told securities analysts monday that if he wins control of 
the lockheed board at the firms annual meeting march 29 he also 
would force the companys smaller divisions to turn an acceptable 
level of profits 
the dallasbased investor shrugged off reminders that many proxy 
fights by prominent takeover specialists have ended in failure 
calling himself a manager not a corporate raider simmons also has 
a 11 billion takeover bid outstanding for georgia gulf corp 
simmons pointed to his successes with nl and other companies as 
proof he is qualified to run and improve lockheed however he 
had no answers about how he would go about redeploying lockheeds 
assets and reducing its overhead and said he would not know until 
after he had control of the board 
you dont snap your fingers overnight he said 
simmons and nl president j landis martin criticized lockheed 
management for placing more than 2 billion in assets in its 
technology services and electronic systems divisions that produce 
little profit 
they portrayed lockheed chairman daniel m tellep as unable to 
get a handle on the firms problems and use its assets properly 
tellep hearing a description of the analysts meeting 
responded that the assessment reflects a lack of understanding of 
lockheed and said simmons and martin were stating lockheeds 
record in a way to make their case 
martin criticized tellep for calling lockheeds 1989 performance 
when the companys earnings fell to 2 million from 624 million 
in 1988 the results of a transitional year as the company took a 
number of large writedowns 
even without the writedowns which included 300 million for 
unexpected design changes on a navy plane lockheeds earnings were 
down except for its missile and aerospace business martin said 
martin also disputed a statement by tellep that lockheeds stock 
price which closed monday at 3550 a share on the new york stock 
exchange reflected an industrywide malaise 
during the session with analysts martin said lockheed sales 
growth was running behind other defense contractors and that the 
firms stock price which is down from a high of 5475 over the 
past year was running behind the standard amp poors index of 
defense and aerospace firms 
analysts showed some skepticism of nls arguments one analyst 
noting that the standard amp poors index includes the atypical 
performance of boeing co said lockheed is running on a par with 
other defense contractors including northrop corp 
others pressed simmons and martin for more specifics on how they 
would accomplish their goals if they won their fight 
martin called the companys 1988 restructuring plan a failure 
saying lockheed has been unable to complete the planned sale of 
four of its noncore businesses has not disposed of the real 
estate it wanted to sell and suspended its stock buyback plan 
tellep responded in a telephone interview that after selling 
three divisions lockheed withdrew its calcomp unit when it did not 
receive fair offers now however the division has more value at 
present time retained as part of lockheed and is returning to 
profitablity tellep said 
the real estate sales have not been completed because of 
environmental concerns and lockheed suspended its stock buyback in 
response to simmons stock purchases tellep said

the new chairman of bank of new england corp says 
he will cut the work force sell off more assets and consider 
selling subsidiaries as part of his rescue plan for the troubled 
bank 
but lawrence k fish offered few specifics monday about his 
blueprint for change except to say the bank now valued at 25 
billion would be significantly smaller when he gets through with 
it 
in time i hope well be thought of by how good we are not 
how big we are fish said but that will take time larry fish 
cant make all of this happen in weeks or months 
on friday fish a former bank of boston executive was named 
chairman and chief executive officer of the bank holding company 
and its bostonbased subsidiary he replaces walter j connolly 
jr who was ousted this year after the bank suffered massive 
losses mostly in real estate lending 
analysts have largely approved of fishs appointment citing his 
aggressive image and his management experience which includes 15 
years with the bank of boston he spent last year as president and 
chief operating officer at columbia savings amp loan association in 
beverly hills calif 
but fish begins his new job hampered by the troubles at bank of 
new england which last year was the regions secondlargest bank 
federal consent orders have restricted how the bank can do 
business and the bank has struggled under huge debt and a flood of 
outgoing depositors 
fish said his priority is to complete the planned sale of 6 
billion in assets 
he said the bank was in the process of selling its home equity 
lines for over 1 billion the bank also is selling its lease 
assets and other commercial lending assets 
the sale of the banks affiliates in maine and rhode island is 
also being considered there are no immediate plans to sell the 
connecticut bank and trust co which fish called a part of the 
core franchise 
fish said personnel cutbacks were inevitable although he said 
he did not know how many layoffs would be necessary 
last month the bank of new england announced its 1989 losses 
were 111 billion nonperforming assets are estimated at more 
than 2 billion the bank has also lost some 5 billion in deposits 
in recent months but fish said the bank still retained about 98 
percent of its depositors 
the losses in deposits have forced the bank to borrow an 
estimated 1 billionplus from the federal reserve bank of boston 
many of the banks troubles stem from real estate loans were 
made during the regions construction boom in the 1980s and turned 
sour when the market softened 
the federal consent orders which cover the bank holding company 
and its bostonbased affiliate require the bank to tighten lending 
practices as well as get federal approval to declare stock 
dividends and conduct financial transactions with its subsidiaries 
fixing the bank may not be wholly under fishs control however 
said gerard cassidy an analyst with tucker anthony inc 
it depends on how many loans go bad cassidy said each 
step down the economic ladder we go down as a region more and more 
loans go bad and bank of new england does not have the room or the 
flexibility to withstand continued decline in their loan 
portfolio

the nynex corp has asked the federal 
communications commission to throw out more than 36 million in 
fines and refunds to be paid by two subsidiaries because they did 
not pass along to ratepayers the inflated cost of equipment 
in legal papers filed monday nynex said telephone ratepayers 
were not overcharged as a result of transactions between materiel 
enterprises co an unregulated nynex affiliate and new york 
telephone co and new england telephone and telegraph co 
last month the fcc levied fines totaling 14 million against 
new york telephone and new england telephone and telegraph and 
ordered them to refund about 35 million to customers 
the fines were the largest federal penalty ever imposed on a 
telephone company and involved 1185 million in alleged 
overcharges made to the two subsidiaries by material enterprises 
which was established in 1983 to provide equipment and services to 
the two phone companies 
but nynex said the prices paid to materiel were generally lower 
than the phone companies would have paid in the open market 
plus the telephone companies were not required to buy from 
materiel and spent less than half their purchasing dollars with 
it nynex said 
nynex also said it followed fcc accounting practices regarding 
how telephone companies recorded purchases from affiliates 
prior to 1988 the only requirement was that carriers be able 
to demonstrate if requested to do so in a ratemaking proceeding 
that affiliate transaction charges were reasonable nynex wrote 
in its response to the fcc the nynex telephone companies have 
always been prepared to do this 
the fcc had no immediate reaction said spokeswoman maureen 
peratino 
the commission will review nynexs response and issue a further 
order which could uphold reduce or do away with the fines she 
said nynex if it is still dissatisfided may seek court review 
she added 
the fcc said the three companies engaged in a series of 
transactions from 1984 to 1988 designed to increase the overall 
profits of nynex at customer expense 
the commission conducted an audit which found that new york 
telephone and new england telephone purchased supplies and 
equipment from materiel at prices that were inflated by 1185 
million approximately 35 million of these extra costs were passed 
along to interstate customers the fcc said 
but on monday nynex said its subsidiaries earned some 350 
million less than they were authorized under applicable federal 
tariffs 
thus interstate ratepayers have suffered no overcharges as a 
result of the materiel transactions nynex said 
thus the refunds can only be viewed as further penalties said 
morrison des webb nynexs vice president for government affairs

walt disney co hopes to use its talent 
for enchantment by turning 4000 acres of swampland and cow 
pastures in central florida into the planned community of adult 
dreams 
the giant entertainment and theme park company unveiled plans 
monday to build a massive upscale shopping mall office complexes 
and thousands of singlefamily homes and apartments as part of a 
development project that could take the next 25 years to complete 
outlining the companys plans at an annual public meeting 
disney attractions president dick nunis said the project would be 
as new and innovative as the opening of disneyland and walt 
disney world adding that construction could be under way within 
five years 
the development which would be disneys first on property it 
owns in osceola county is located about halfway between downtown 
orlando and tampa and is surrounded by 6000 acres of greenbelt 
nunis said 
details however were sketchy the mall expected to be central 
floridas largest at about 15 million square feet would house 
exclusive department and specialty stores

office space to be developed were not disclosed 
county officials said last week that disney told them it plans 
to build up to 6000 middleincome and executivetype houses with a 
starting price of 90000 
but nunis said i dont have a crystal ball that those other 
guys do he also declined to comment on reports of office space 
totaling 7 million square feet the equivalent of ten 35story 
buildings 
in addition to that space local officials said they were told 
the plans include more than a million square feet of 
lightindustrial office and manufacturing space one or two golf 
courses and recreation areas 
the property would be deannexed from disneys 27400acre 
resort in central florida and turned over to osceola county which 
would be a partner in its development nunis told an audience of 
government officials businessmen and local residents 
that way disney would pay for the first time county impact 
fees for water sewers roads and other services so far all disney 
development has been controlled by the companys own reedy creek 
improvement district a special district created by the 1969 
florida legislature that gives the company much autonomy over its 
acreage 
disney has been criticized by local government officials who 
contend the companys property taxes are not enough to pay for the 
impact it is having on mushrooming growth surrounding its theme 
parks hotels and resort sites 
nunis figures a regional impact review would take about a year 
and a half after that we will make an announcement on 
groundbreaking and proceed from there 
most county officials were enthusiastic when they first heard of 
the plans last week 
this allows us to plan for development now instead of 20 
years from now and to be sure that we can pay for the services 
that are going to be needed said county commissioner jim swan 
nunis also said the project would have plenty of room for a 
multimodal transportation station that can include a highspeed 
train planned by the state and other forms of transportation 
he said disney was a strong supporter of higher gas taxes and 
tolls to pay for florida roads and said he did not believe that 
this would hurt tourism

oil minister mana saeed 
alotaiba called tuesday for maintaining opecs current 
18abarrel reference price 
current oil prices are now fluctuating between 18 and 20 and 
that is the ideal level i myself like to see the united arab 
emirates minister told an oil seminar in abu dhabi 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries of which the 
uae is a member has been adjusting production ceilings for its 
13 member states to stabilize prices around 18 a 42gallon barrel 
some opec member states led by iraq favor an increase of the 
reference price to 20 but iraqi oil minister issam alchalabi 
also said in a recent interview that the issue was unlikely to come 
up at the march 16 opec market monitoring committee meeting in 
vienna 
otaiba said that fixing price levels at current rates along 
with respecting opecs production quota would give the market the 
chance to consolidate and allow opec after 1991 to raise prices to 
a very reasonable level otaiba said 
the uae however is the only country that rejected its daily 
quota of 1095 million barrels for the first half of 1990 and has 
pledged to produce at the rate of 2 million barrels per day 
the cartels production level of about 235 million barrels per 
day is above the opec target

president bush declared today he is prepared 
to negotiate with congressional democrats for a comprehensive 
package to cut the federal deficit but insisted he wont abandon 
his opposition to tax increases 
bush praised rep dan rostenkowski dill for making a very 
broad proposal in coming out with a farreaching package that 
would include both higher taxes and a freeze on social security 
the administration surprised some democratic lawmakers monday by 
being unexpectedly receptive to the proposal by the democratic 
chairman of the house ways and means committee 
i was in being receptive somewhat colored by the way in 
which chairman rostenkowski approached this the evident good will 
on his part to break the ice and move the process forward bush 
said today 
congressional democrats had welcomed the white houses 
conciliatory words about rostenkowskis dramatic deficit reduction 
plan while claiming outright administration support is what is 
really needed something they didnt get from bush 
the president told a news conference in the white house briefing 
room he would not embrace rostenkowskis plan for new taxes im 
not for a tax increase he said adding that there were many 
other parts of the rostenkowski package he also did not support 
asked if he could assure the american people that taxes would 
not be raised as part of a deficitreduction scheme bush said 
im only one player but you know my position i have no 
intention of changing that position 
when pressed and asked under what circumstances he might support 
a tax increase the president retorted too hypothetical nice 
try 
i dont want to appear inflexible but im not about to stand 
here and give him dan or the congress the idea that im going to 
accept everything in their approach bush said still he added 
were prepared to negotiate 
summing up action on the deficit bush noted that rostenkowski 
had proposed his plan weve thrown our idea out with the 
fiscal 1991 budget and now wed like the budget leaders on the 
hill to throw theirs out 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater on monday said we want 
to consider this plan 
richard darman president bushs budget director called the 
package a courageous initiative a serious initiative 
speaking on public televisions macneillehrer newshour 
monday night darman said at least theres a whole package here 
to start a serious debate with 
the white house reaction to the illinois democrats proposal 
produced the first glimmer of hope that real progress could be made 
this year in shrinking the budget deficit the congressional budget 
office projects the shortfall in fiscal 1991 which begins oct 1 
will be 161 billion 
the administrations words left a hopeful but wary feeling among 
democrats who have been sensitized to the dangers of leading the 
way in advocating tax increases by three consecutive presidential 
election defeats 
citing bushs ability to veto rostenkowskis package and 
embarrass democrats who backed it house speaker thomas s foley 
dwash said without assurances it will be signed it will be 
difficult to pass 
rep leon panetta dcalif chairman of the house budget 
committee said two components of rostenkowskis proposal tax 
increases and a oneyear freeze on costofliving increases in 
social security benefits would be very huge political 
barriers to overcome 
those are very sensitive political issues that would be very 
difficult to accomplish within congress unless theres a clear 
recognition that the president will join hands with them on the 
issue panetta said 
nonetheless lawmakers of both parties said they hoped this 
could eventually lead to serious efforts to reduce the federal 
deficit 
dan rostenkowski has correctly challenged congress the 
administration and the american people to face up to public enemy 
no 1 the federal deficit said senate minority leader bob dole 
rkan 
in testimony this year the presidents representatives 
have suggested that there may be room to negotiate on deficit 
reduction said sen lloyd bentsen dtexas chairman of the 
taxwriting senate finance committee if thats right nows the 
time for them to come forward 
on sunday rostenkowski whose committee oversees taxes social 
security and other federal benefit programs suggested a package 
he said would reduce next years deficit to 106 billion and lead 
to a 2 billion surplus by fiscal 1994 
over the five years ending in 1995 he said the plan would save 
512 billion from currently projected deficits 
there are some political mine fields here theres no question 
about it acknowledged rostenkowski who appeared on the same 
program as darman 
rostenkowski would shrink the defense budget by 3 percent 
annually about 1 percent more than current administration plans 
he would freeze domestic spending for one year including 
costofliving increases for the 39 million recipients of social 
security but exempt many benefit programs for the poor 
the 33 percent income tax rate would be extended to the nations 
600000 wealthiest taxpayers who now pay a 28 percent rate 
federal taxes on cigarettes beer wine and gasoline tax would 
increase among other steps 
darman conceded that the administration differed with elements 
of rostenkowskis plan especially its tax increases and social 
security reductions 
but he added this plan has only been out here 24 hours now 
and i dont think its constructive on our part to sit around and 
pick at parts 
others werent reluctant to be negative 
sen james sasser dtenn chairman of the senate budget 
committee chided the administration for its unserious 124 
trillion budget released in january 
this newfound desire on the part of the white house to 
negotiate on the basis of a lone democrats call for tax increases 
and domestic spending cuts should be taken for what it is 
political opportunism sasser said 
sen william v roth jr rdel a member of the finance 
committee called rostenkowskis plan dead on arrival adding 
its just more or less a warmedover version of whats been 
proposed in the past

the deficit in the broadest measure of us 
trade declined to 10589 billion last year the smallest in five 
years aided by higher merchandise exports and increased foreign 
travel the government said today 
the commerce department said that the current account deficit 
shrank 163 percent from a 12655 billion imbalance in 1988 
however even with the improvement the current account deficit 
remained above 100 billion for the sixth consecutive year the 
1989 total was the lowest since a 10419 billion deficit in 1984 
the year ended on a positive note as the octoberdecember 
deficit declined to 2057 billion down 102 percent from the 
third quarter and the smallest quarterly imbalance in almost six 
years 
the current account also known as the balance of payments is 
the most important trade statistic because it measures not only the 
flow of merchandise across borders but also trade in services and 
investments 
the united states ended the 1980s in a far different position 
than it began the decade in 1980 there was a small surplus in the 
nations current account america was the worlds largest creditor 
country and its earnings on overseas investments were enough to 
offset perennial deficits in merchandise trade 
however as americans transferred billions of dollars into 
foreign hands to pay for merchandise imports the investment 
cushion shrank rapidly and disappeared altogether in 1985 when the 
united states became a net debtor for the first time in 71 years 
americas debtor position stood at 5325 billion at the end of 
1988 and todays report indicates that it grew to around 630 
billion last year the exact accounting of this figure will not be 
released until later in the year 
the growing foreign ownership in america has triggered a heated 
debate over whether america is losing control of its economic 
destiny to foreigners 
some economists predict that the current account deficit could 
actually begin rising again this year reflecting a higher 
dependence on foreign oil and more sluggish sales of us exports 
that development would spell bad news for the bush 
administration which is counting on further improvements in trade 
to bolster americas flagging industrial sector and add to domestic 
economic growth this year 
for 1989 the merchandise trade portion of the current account 
shrank by 11 percent to 11325 billion as growth in us exports 
outpaced a continued rise in imports 
the surplus in the services and investment category jumped by 
413 percent to 2165 billion up from 1532 billion reflecting 
increased foreign travel in the united states and higher earnings 
by us companies operating abroad 
the third segment of the current accountus foreign aid and 
pension payments to americans living aboard added 1428 billion 
to the deficit last year 
in the fourth quarter the 2057 billion deficit compared to a 
2291 billion deficit in the third quarter 
the 102 percent improvement reflected a slight improvement in 
merchandise trade where the deficit narrowed by 09 percent to 
2881 billion there was a big 392 percent increase in the 
surplus in the services and investment category which climbed to 
1271 billion 
this increased reflected in large part a drop in the value of 
the dollar during the quarter which boosted the foreign earnings 
of american companies operating abroad when that income was 
translated back into dollars foreign aid and pension payments were 
up 28 percent in the quarter to 448 billion 
despite the improvement last year and in the fourth quarter in 
particular many economists believe that the us net debtor 
position will climb above 1 trillion sometime in the 1990s 
analysts fear that this will cause a decline in us living 
standards as financing the growing foreign debt burden will make 
less money available in this country for productive investment

saatchi and saatchi co plc today announced 30 
percent salary cuts for founders charles and maurice saatchi and 
several other steps designed to help turn around the troubled 
british advertising agency 
maurice saatchi who is chairman of saatchis board of 
directors and charles saatchi a director will see their annual 
salaries cut to about 699000 from 1 million

us agency mccaffrey and mccall to its management for an 
undisclosed price 
madison avenue has been speculating about the mccaffrey and 
mccall sale for the past several months 
saatchi also confirmed its strategy of focusing on its 
communications business and disposing of those consulting 
businesses which it has been trying to do for about a year so 
far its has sold four small firms for 38 million 
saatchi said dismantling the communications group with the 
exception of the mccaffrey and mccall sale would not be in the 
interest of shareholders 
there has been speculation in the british press that saatchi 
might reluctantly sell off chunks perhaps its us ad agency 
backer and spielvogel which it bought in 1986 for 56 million 
maurice saatchi told shareholders this is a difficult time 
in any difficult situation one has a choice fight or flight we 
are determined to win

its share price has fallen sharply in recent months 
saatchi shares were trading at around 230 on londons stock 
exchange by late tuesday down sharply from its 12month high of 
674 
analysts blame the companys problems on its expensive 
diversification into consulting during the mid1980s weak 
financial controls and a period of slow growth in the advertising 
industry

japans trade surplus fell 30 percent in february 
to 5 billion from 723 billion a year earlier the ministry of 
finance reported tuesday 
it was the 10th consecutive month of yearonyear declines in 
japans trade surplus but was substantially higher than januarys 
revised surplus of 338 million 
japans surplus with the united states shrank 285 percent to 
296 billion in february from 414 billion a year earlier the 
ministry said 
in recent months higher international oil prices and strong 
domestic demand have boosted the value of imports while growing 
overseas production by japanese manufacturers has helped hold back 
export growth 
in february exports fell 19 percent from a year earlier to 
219 billion for the fifth consecutive decline the ministry said 
imports rose 119 percent to 169 billion it said 
officials of the ministry of international trade and industry 
attributed the rise in imports largely to increased purchases of 
food products raw materials and industrial products 
the decline in japans trade surplus with the united states 
resulted from a 59 percent drop in exports to the united states

trade group survey released tuesday

federal government to do more to help small firms export 
federal spending on export assistance is so modest its

seeking to get the word out about its latest 
promotion soft drink cans stuffed with prizes cocacola co 
this week sent 200 reporters the real thing samples containing 5 
bills 
newsrooms are frequent recipients of promotional items sent from 
companies trying to get a little publicity but cash from a major 
corporation is unusual 
the magic summer campaign to promote cocacola classic will 
include 750000 randomly distributed cans which appear to be 
regular cans of coke but when opened reveal a mechanism holding up 
to 200 in cash or a certificate for a variety of other prizes 
bob bertini a spokesman for cocacola usa said the company on 
monday sent the reporters cans with 5 bills the smallest 
denomination in the campaign merely to demonstrate the promotion 
we sent it to a very small group of national writers the 
reporters cant write about it without seeing it bertini said 
many news organizations have policies against reporters 
receiving gifts of value from news sources 
bertini said the company is urging reporters who received the 
money to donate it to charity

saatchi amp saatchi co plc took steps tuesday to 
reassure its shareholders that it was working to overcome its 
recent financial problems announcing 30 percent salary cuts for 
its founders naming two americans to its board and saying it was 
close to selling its consulting businesses 
maurice saatchi who founded the company with his brother 
charles and serves as its chairman told some 400 shareholders at 
their annual meeting this is a difficult time in any difficult 
situation one has a choice fight or flight we are determined to 
win 
analysts reaction to the strategy was mixed with some saying 
the company was weak and others saying it was taking proper steps 
the company has been battered by an expensive diversification 
into consulting during the mid1980s weak financial controls and a 
period of slow growth in the advertising industry for its fiscal 
year ended sept 30 saatchi suffered an aftertax loss of 585 
million pounds or 94 million 
saatchi already has taken measures to turn itself around 
including naming a new chief executive and finance director and 
slashing hundreds of jobs 
founders maurice and charles saatchi who serves as a director 
will see their salaries cut to about 437000 pounds or 699000 
from 625000 pounds or 1 million a year 
other members of the boards of directors also are to take 10 
percent salary cuts as part of the effort to raise 
costconsciousness at the company saatchi said 
the two americans appointed to the board are harvard university 
business professor theodore levitt and tom russell chairman of 
applied bioscience international inc of east millstone nj 
robert louisdreyfus who replaced maurice saatchi as chief 
executive at the beginning of the year said saatchis attempts to 
sell the hay group its largest consulting division and cpc 
corporate planners and coordinators inc were well on the way to 
completion 
saatchi also is in serious negotiations on all of the 
consulting companies he said 
total proceeds from the sales are expected to be about 80 
million pounds to 100 million pounds 128 million to 160 million 
this year he said 
saatchi confirmed its strategy of focusing on its communications 
business and disposing of its consulting businesses which it has 
been trying to do for about a year so far its has sold four small 
firms for 38 million 
saatchi also said it has reached an agreement to sell the us 
ad agency mccaffrey and mccall to the agencys management for an 
undisclosed price at an undetermined time the sale has been 
rumored for months 
in new york robert cherins mccaffreys chairman and chief 
executive said some issues remain to be resolved before the 
sale can be completed he declined to elaborate 
the agency based in new york handles about 300 million a year 
in ad billings and employs more than 300 people it was acquired by 
saatchi in 1983 and its clients include mercedezbenz automobiles 
air canada tiffany jewelry bacardi rums and the consumer products 
division of burroughs wellcome co 
saatchi said dismantling the communications group would not be 
in the interest of shareholders except for the mccaffrey and 
mccall deal 
there has been speculation in the british media that saatchi 
might sell other parts of its ad empire 
the new chief executive also said i want to stress that we 
are not looking for an injection of new equity from a friendly 
outside party

monday 
the retail sales drop was the steepest in four months but 
analysts said the decline was due almost entirely to sagging 
automobiles sales and that other segments experienced healthy 
increases 
the report was seen as a sign of economic health and as such a 
signal that the federal reserve was unlikely to move interest rates 
lower anytime soon

a year and a half after leaving a career as one 
of general motors corps brightest stars roy s roberts is coming 
back 
roberts who left the automaker to head navistar international 
corps truck manufacturing operations returns to gm april 1 as 
general manager for manufacturing at the cadillac division 
roberts 50 left gm in august 1988after an 11year career in 
which he earned a reputation as a dynamic leader with respect for 
human values and a position as the highestranking black executive 
at the industrial giant 
at navistar roberts was the no 3 executive of the fortune 500 
manufacturer in charge of a truck division that was the north 
american leader 
but he couldnt bypass the opportunity presented at gm 
my business roots are at gm roberts said when i was 
there i spent most of my time in operations thats where most of 
my abilities are concentrated 
when this job came open i realized it was where i wanted to 
be he said monday from navistar headquarters in chicago roberts 
did not return a telephone message left for him tuesday at navistar 
headquarters 
gm reportedly is considering consolidating all manufacturing of 
its luxury cars at its plant in the detroit enclave of hamtramck 
all cadillacs now are assembled there except the brougham which is 
made in arlington texas and the de ville and fleetwood sedan 
which are made near pontiac mich 
as director of manufacturing roberts would be centrally 
involved in any move of cadillac production to one location 
all my life ive wanted to make sure i was doing a job that 
had challenges roberts said you look at the luxury car 
business and its getting to be one of the most competitive turfs 
in this country and we want to take that on 
roberts joined gm in 1977 as a salaried employee in training at 
the former diesel equipment division in grand rapids mich in 
1981 he was promoted to plant manager in grand rapids and two 
years later was transferred to rochester ny as rochester 
products divisions eastern operations manager 
he rose through plant management ranks to take charge of gms 
north tarrytown ny assembly plant in december 1985 he has been 
credited with saving that plant and about 4000 jobs by convincing 
upperlevel management to build gms new plasticbody minivans 
there 
on april 1 1987 he was named vice president for personnel 
administration at a time the company was in the process of laying 
off 40000 whitecollar workers that promotion largely at the 
urging of gm executive vice president elmer johnson jumped him 
across half a dozen management levels and made him the 
highestranking black at gm 
roberts became vice president for truck operations at navistar 
in august 1988 a few months after johnson quit gm to go into 
private law practice 
gm spokeswoman patricia malloy said tuesday that as general 
manager of cadillac manufacturing roberts will be among the 
highestranking blacks in the company but will not be an officer 
of the corporation as he was while one of more than three dozen gm 
vice presidents 
it doesnt make any difference roberts said what i care 
about is the challenge and the opportunity the title has nothing 
to do with it 
roberts was one of 10 children born to a family in magnolia 
ark his mother died when he was 2 and his father moved the family 
to michigan where roberts began his career on the factory floor at 
grand rapids auto parts supplier lear siegler inc in 1959 
roberts worked nights so he could go to school and earn a 
business administration degree while also supporting a family

president bush said tuesday that an ambitious 
deficitcutting plan by democratic rep dan rostenkowski could help 
break the ice toward reaching a longrange budget pact with 
congress 
neither bush nor budget director richard darman offered much 
encouragement that the administration would support the plans two 
most controversial elements a social security freeze and a tax 
increase but darman appeared to open the door a crack to a 
possible compromise that might include some form of higher excise 
taxes 
rostenkowski proposed an increase in taxes on the highestpaid 
americans along with a boost in excise taxes on gasoline tobacco 
and alcohol 
we are willing to discuss any proposals on the merits even 
tax increases darman told reporters 
darman said the administration still believes deficitreduction 
can be achieved without having to go to income tax increases 
but he added you cant go into a negotiation and say its 
absolutely totally completely forever inconceivable that your 
view of the merits wouldnt change 
at a white house news conference bush asked are we prepared 
to negotiate he then answered his own question absolutely 
on another economic policy matter bush denied he was 
considering replacing alan greenspan as chairman of the federal 
reserve board in a dispute over interestrate policy 
theres no bubbling war with alan greenspan bush said 
im not in a fedbashing mode 
he said he and greenspan have had differences over how high 
interest rates should be adding every president would like to 
see interest rates lower 
the los angeles times reported last week that bush was so 
unhappy with greenspans tightcredit policies that he likely would 
replace him when his term as chairman expires in 1991 
there is no discussion of that nature at all bush said 
both bush and darman seemed to go out of their way to praise the 
deficitreduction plan put forward several days ago by 
rostenkowski the democratic chairman of the house ways and means 
committee 
it is the first serious proposal that has been put in the 
public domain by democrats darman said 
the administration darman said has serious disagreements 
with parts of the plan including the social security freeze and 
call for higher taxes but he generally praised its proposal for a 
freeze on other programs for using defense savings to trim the 
deficit and for restraining medicaid payments 
he denied the administration was trying to shortcircuit the 
congressional process by reacting to rostenkowskis plan before the 
house and senate budget committees come up with their own proposal 
the committees he said are just not close to being able to 
put together a budget resolution and its important that there be 
something there to negotiate with 
darman said that while the administration remains steadfast in 
its opposition to higher income taxes it does not categorically 
reject higher excise taxes so long as the increase can be 
justified as a user fee in which the person paying the higher 
tax benefits from the spending 
however he said rostenkowskis suggestion of a gasoline tax of 
20 or 25 cents a gallon was too high to merit administration 
support 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash said he thought some of 
the administrations kind reaction toward rostenkowskis proposal 
was because of their personal friendship 
that doesnt speak of any substantive change on the part of 
the president to consider new taxes he said 
foley declined to endorse rostenkowskis plan although he 
repeated his assertion that any serious deficit reduction program 
would have to include both spending restraint and new taxes 
rostenkowskis plan which would replace the grammrudman act 
for chopping the deficit in stages would raise taxes on the 
highestincome wage earners from 28 percent to 33 percent and 
increase taxes on cigarettes alcohol and tobacco it would also 
freeze most federal programs including social security at present 
levels for one year 
that would deny some 39 million americans a social security 
costofliving increase scheduled for next january 
the illinois democrats plan would also rechannel some of the 
peace dividend defense money saved because of reduced 
eastwest tensions into further reducing the deficit 
while making it clear he was not embracing the package in its 
present form bush praised rostenkowski for putting forward the 
bold initiative with evident goodwill and determination to try to 
break the ice and move the process forward 
asked if he was for a tax increase at this time bush said 
no im not for a tax increase but he stopped short of 
making the same pledge on social security 
when asked if he would oppose a freeze on social security 
benefits bush said well there are a lot of things im not for 
in his proposal a lot including taxes 
bush who in the past has threatened to have his veto pen ready 
for any proposed tax increase passed by congress on tuesday 
offered a much milder response when asked if he could assure 
americans that there would be no new taxes this year 
im only one player but you know my position and i have no 
intention of changing that position bush said 
when a reporter pressed further and asked bush under what 
circumstances he might support a tax increase he shot back too 
hypothetical nice try 
summing up action on the deficit bush noted that rostenkowski 
had proposed his plan weve thrown our idea out with the 
fiscal 1991 budget and now wed like the budget leaders on the 
hill to throw theirs out and then perhaps we can talk 
the congressional budget office projects the budget shortfall in 
fiscal 1991 which begins oct 1 will be 161 billion the white 
house office of management and budget says it will be 1005 
billion if existing programs are left unchanged 
rostenkowski whose committee oversees taxes social security 
and other federal benefit programs says his package would reduce 
next years deficit to 106 billion and lead to a 2 billion 
surplus by fiscal 1994 
rep leon panetta dcalif chairman of the house budget 
committee has said that rostenkowskis proposal for tax increases 
and a oneyear freeze on social security increases would be very 
huge political barriers to overcome

rorer group inc announced tuesday 
it will work jointly with the consumer products giant procter amp 
gamble to develop and market prescription and overthecounter 
pharmaceutical products 
the move comes one day after the suburban philadelphiabased 
company announced a 17 billion agreement to merge with the 
pharmaceuticals operations of rhonepoulenc sa of paris 
the alliance between rorer and cincinattibased procter amp gamble 
gives rorer a major worldwide distribution system for its main 
product the antacid maalox in addition to maalox procter amp 
gamble obtains exclusive us marketing and distribution rights to 
rorers line of overthecounter pharmaceuticals which include 
ascriptin and perdiem 
rorer which will continue to manufacture the drugs will gain 
rights to develop and market denol an antiulcer drug and other 
prescription gastrointestinal compounds that procter amp gamble has 
been developing 
procter amp gamble is still negotiating for international rights 
to market and distribute some of rorers overthecounter 
pharmaceuticals 
rorer will retain ownership of its brands while procter amp 
gamble will receive royalty payments for the prescription products 
both companies will share in the growth of the business 
pampg gains entry into a core overthecounter category with a 
leading antacid brand with no major upfront capital investment 
procter amp gamble chairman edwin l artzt said in a statement 
rorer chairman robert e cawthorn said the alliance further 
promotes rorers strategic objective of becoming a worldclass 
pharmaceutical company through research internal growth and 
business alliances 
this agreement maximizes the potential of maalox he said 
maalox and our other overthecounter products will gain wider 
distribution by utilizing procter amp gambles extensive distribution 
system 
samuel d isaly of mehta amp isaly pharmaceutical specialists 
said the deal is a lovely transaction for both companies 
in the hands of rorer maalox had a pretty bad future he 
said 
new brunswick njbased johnson amp johnson has heavily 
advertised a competing antacid mylanta he said and the 
government is considering allowing a variety of prescription ulcer 
drugs to be sold over the counter 
with procter amp gambles better distribution system maalox will 
be more competitive he said 
as for procter amp gamble this gives them an extra brand name 
they can promote said isaly who noted the company already 
distributes metamucil and peptobismol 
under tuesdays agreement procter amp gamble also has received 
the rights to purchase rorers overthecounter pharmaceutical 
company if rorer decides to sell it 
thats pretty important said ron nordmann of painewebber 
group inc it is perhaps an indication that the newlyformed 
rhonepoulenc rorer might want to focus more on prescription drugs 
and research 
igor landau president of rhonepoulencs health sector said 
the agreement with procter amp gamble is consistent with the newly 
combined rhonepoulenc rorer incs strategy of developing and 
strengthening its us market 
access to us markets was considered a major reason for the 
merger with rorer although rhonepoulenc is in the top 10 in the 
european pharmaceutical market it had no direct marketing in the 
united states or japan 
procter amp gamble with sales of 214 billion last year 
manufactures and markets health care products as well as a wide 
range of laundry and cleaning products personal care products 
food and beverage products 
rorer group inc had 12 billion in 1989 sales 
rhonepoulenc rorer inc is expected to have annual sales 
exceeding 3 billion 
that merger will progress in stages with rhonepoulenc 
eventually obtaining 68 percent of rorer by june 1990 in exchange 
rorer will take on 265 million of rhonepoulenc debt and acquire 
the french groups existing us pharmaceutical subsidiary for 20 
million

rh macy amp co inc on tuesday reported a 39 
million loss in its most crucial quarter following a disappointing 
christmas shopping season increasing the financial pressures on 
the debtburdened retailing chain 
macy which went private in a leveraged buyout in 1986 said 
markdowns the company was forced to take to compete with price 
cutting at campeau corps department stores took a heavy toll on 
its balance sheet 
the secondquarter loss which translated to 2767 per share 
compared with the 726 million or 3985 per share macy earned 
in the same period a year earlier 
sales during the quarter ended jan 27 totaled 244 billion up 
from 228 billion a year earlier 
pamela stubing a retail industry analyst with moodys investors 
service inc said many of macys stores in the northeast had stiff 
competition from campeaus federated department stores and allied 
stores units macy choosing to defend market share rather than 
profit margins cut prices to keep its customers she said 
federated and allied which were on the brink of a chapter 11 
bankruptcy court filing slashed their prices during the holiday 
season to bring in cash 
the loss could not have come at a worse time macys second 
quarter the fourth quarter for most other major retailers is 
when the company hopes to earn half its annual profits 
the company also is dependent on its cash flow to pay down the 
remaining debt from its leveraged buyout macys earnings statement 
reported nearly 454 billion in longterm debt as of jan 27 and 
189 million in interest charges during the second quarter 
walter loeb a retail consultant and analyst said macy also was 
hurt by overstocking its private label merchandise to reduce 
inventory the company again was forced to cut its prices he said 
but the company succeeded in cushioning the shock about the 
dismal quarter having signaled to investors and its suppliers some 
time ago that it expected to report a sharp loss loeb said 
loeb said macys will continue to have problems in the near 
term but he said there were signs the retailer would fare better 
during the spring because of warmer weather and because the company 
is going into the season with a leaner inventory 
in a letter to its investors dated monday macy said it was 
prepared for the economy to remain flat during the spring and fall 
seasons indicating the retailer does not expect a burst of 
consumer spending 
ms stubing predicted the retail environment would be less 
promotional meaning fewer markdowns to draw customers during 
macys second half although the company still faces tough 
competition 
for the first six months of its fiscal year macy lost 722 
million or 5158 per share compared to earnings of 536 
million or 2475 per share in the same period a year ago 
sales for the first half rose to 415 billion from 39 billion 
loeb said the financial and retail industries have confidence in 
macy chairman edward finkelstein who shaped the companys buyout 
and its retailing strategy 
besides its flagship macy stores located mainly in the east and 
texas the company owns i magnin and bullocks stores in 
california and the west it also owns specialty stores including 
charter club and aeropostale which are stocked with macys private 
label apparel brands

a proposed nicaraguan aid package and the lifting 
of a us trade embargo will help awaken the nations decimated 
manufacturing and agricultural economies but political stability 
is the key to a full recovery business leaders and economists said 
tuesday 
the 300 million aid request announced by president bush may 
give nicaraguans needed hard currency to upgrade factories and 
purchase parts for machinery and farm equipment which have fallen 
into disrepair during the fiveyear trade embargo 
but experts predict foreign investors will not likely return 
until the sandinistas prove they will not violently oppose the 
government of presidentelect violeta chamorro winner of last 
months elections 
the aid is the first critical step to bring nicaragua back 
from near bankruptcy said manuel lasaga a senior economist at 
southeast bank in miami the longterm prospects for the country 
depend heavily on the political situation there will be no big 
investment until nicaragua proves its a place where business can 
be done 
the embargo established by president reagan against the 
sandinista government cut off nicaragua from lucrative us 
markets for products such as sugar coffee and bananas it also 
effectively blocked the nation from receiving loans from aid 
organizations such as the international monetary fund and the world 
bank 
lack of money and investment coupled by high inflation and the 
costs of fighting the usbacked contras caused the economy to 
founder nicaraguan exports which reached 650 million in the 
1970s are presently less than 200 million meanwhile the 
nations foreign debt has grown fourfold to 8 billion since 1980 
bush said tuesday he will ask congress to appropriate 300 
million immediately for nicaragua and said he will also seek an 
additional 200 million in economic assistance in fiscal year 1991 
which begins oct 1 
in miami home to 50000 to 100000 nicaraguan exiles there is 
optimism among business leaders that commerce with nicaragua will 
resume soon 
carlos perez a former us house candidate and wellknown gop 
supporter said he may reestablish his banana import business 
we have to take advantage of this to show that there is an 
atmosphere in in nicaragua where business can thrive said perez 
who was cited by reagan as an immigrant success story it will be 
a slow process but at least its beginning 
ties with miamibased nicaraguans should also help integrate 
nicaragua into the global marketplace said roberto arguello 
founder of the miamibased nicaraguan bankers and businessmans 
association 
arguello however does not foresee many nicaraguans returning 
permanently to open businesses 
i see a strong link between miami and managua said 
arguello there are a lot of people here who have made money in 
america and know how the system works we can be an invaluable 
assistance to those starting up in nicaragua 
but several major obstacles stand in the way of nicaraguas full 
economic rebound several experts say 
the embargo destroyed the north american distribution network 
for most nicaraguan products particuarly highly perishable crops 
also nicaragua is not part of the caribbean basin initiative 
which provides member nations with dutyfree entry into the us 
market for most products 
its obvious that nicaragua could not compete unless its a 
member of cbi said gordon studebaker director of the us 
department of commerce office responsible for caribbean business 
development but i think its in everyones best interest to work 
quickly to bring nicaragua into the program 
panama will officially return to the 7yearold cbi next week 
bringing the total to 23 nations 
the decision to offer direct loans to nicaragua has a 
psychological effect on private lenders and international 
businessmen said dario moreno an assistant professor at florida 
international university who specializes in usnicaragua affairs 
it shows the bush administration is giving its approval to the 
new regime and says this is a regime we can trust business 
people watch this closely private money tends to follow public 
money 
a more cautious tone is sounded by ambler moss a former us 
ambassador to panama and dean of the university of miami graduate 
school of international studies 
you have to look behind all the happy talk and see what 
really is going to happen with the aid and how quickly the 
sanctions will be lifted he said nicaragua still has a long 
way to go

a house committee approved tuesday an overhaul 
of the nations hazardous materials transportation law including 
controls on using the same vehicle to ship both wastes and food 
the measure won approval from the energy and commerce committee 
on a voice vote a key provision would place controls on 
backhauling carrying food drugs or cosmetics in vehicles 
used to ship wastes or hazardous materials 
lawmakers introduced the backhauling provision after learning 
that shippers with food products from the midwest were picking up 
garbage on the return trip from the east where landfill space is 
scarce 
the same vehicles would then ship food again without proper 
cleaning 
the panel approved the backhauling measure as a separate bill 
and also attached it to its broader hazardous materials legislation 
before voting that out of committee 
it would require federal officials to set standards for which 
materials could be shipped in the same vehicle 
a backhauling bill applying only to highway vehicles and not 
railroads has been passed by the public works and transportation 
committee the energy and commerce version embraces the key 
provisions of that bill and extends its coverage to railroads 
the energy and commerce version sponsored by rep thomas a 
luken dohio also gives standardsetting authority to three 
government agencies transportation department department of 
health and human services and the environmental protection agency 
the overall hazardous materials bill approved by the committee 
seeks to tighten controls over an estimated 4 billion tons shipped 
annually 
the bill calls for 
new regulations governing the marking and registration of 
hazardous shipments with ready availability of emergency 
information 
new regulations on training requirements and response 
procedures for fire department crews and others who deal with 
hazardous materials 
detailed registration statements by those involved in shipping

brazils central bank late tuesday 
closed the nations banks for the rest of the week in an attempt to 
calm markets before presidentelect fernando collor de mello 
announces an emergency economic package 
the central bank the equivalent of the us federal reserve 
also announced the cruzado the national currency would be 
devalued 107 percent effective monday when the banks reopen 
the threeday bank holiday was decreed by zelia cardoso de 
mello the nations new economic minister who is to take office 
thursday with the new president 
she said in a brief statement the bank holiday was declared 
to preserve the stability of markets until the whole package of 
measures is announced in the past few days there has been a great 
deal of speculative activity and we wanted to calm the market 
down 
ms cardoso de mello no relation to the presidentelect 
offered no further information about the new economic proposals 
which are expected to be announced when the presidentelect 
addresses congress friday morning 
the move took many locals and economists by surprise because 
only a day earlier ms cardoso de mello had said a bank holiday 
is absolutely not necessary 
analysts said the bank holiday was in response to largescale 
withdrawals from the 60 billion that rolls over every day on the 
overnight shortterm deposits paying interest rates of up to 
100 percent that the government uses to finance its burdensome 31 
billion public deficit 
its public deficit contributes a large portion to brazils 114 
billion foreign debt which is the developing worlds largest 
followed by mexico and argentina most of its debt is to us and 
european banks 
investors uneasy about collor de mellos economic plans have 
used withdrawals from the overnight to speculate in gold and 
the illegal but widely tolerated black market for dollars causing 
wild swings in their values in recent weeks 
collor de mello brazils first directly elected president in 
almost 30 years has promised freemarket economic reforms to try 
to bring down the debilitating inflation rate 2700 percent the 
past 12 months februarys inflation was 73 percent 
collor de mello is to replace jose sarney who took office in 
1985 but by law could not run for reelection 
the new economic package is rumored to include privatizations of 
inefficient state companies layoffs of thousands of public 
employees and widescale spending cuts 
business leaders have expressed concern about a possible 
wageandprice freeze the basis of four failed antiinflationary 
plans by the sarney administration 
bank holidays are not common in brazil the last was jan 15 
1989 when sarney decreed his fourth austerity package popularly 
known as the summer plan which froze wages and prices on basic 
goods 
both the presidentelect and ms cardoso de mello have denied 
they will implement a freeze 
by tuesday evening lines stretched for blocks at automatic bank 
machines in major cities with people trying to get cash for the 
next several days withdrawals were limited to 47 per person per 
day 
the population can remain calm there will be enough money for 
the entire weekend said getulio mota manager of a bradesco bank 
branch in rio de janeiro quashing rumors of cash shortages 
privately owned jornal do brasil radio in rio reported the new 
administration was planning to create a new currency but central 
bank spokesman petro kleinberg said he knew nothing of such a plan 
the devaluation was much larger than normal officials have been 
devaluing the cruzado about 2 percent daily to keep up with 
inflation 
brazil with about 150 million residents has been wracked for 
years by persistently high inflation and an active labor movement 
that wages debilitating strikes for higher salaries and benefits 
the unions in particular are strong 
of brazils 60millionmember work force the leftist central 
workers union and the more moderate general workers center claim to 
represent close to 35 million workers 
waves of strikes from schools to hospitals have rocked the 
economy in recent months including february when 60000 petrobras 
oil workers staged an eightday strike paralyzing oil production 
and refineries 
brazils per capita income in 1986 the latest figures 
available was about 1740 but real wages have declined for 
several years due to raging inflation

a federal judge on tuesday refused to order 
reuters to continue a picture exchange agreement with united press 
international 
the judge said upi had not shown it would be irreparably harmed 
if the arrangement were discontinued 
us district judge peter k leisure made the finding in denying 
upi a preliminary injunction that would have barred reuters from 
carrying out its plan to pull out of the contract between the two 
news services 
the judge extended until monday an earlier order that bars 
reuters from canceling the contract so upi can appeal his decision 
obviously were disappointed we didnt get the preliminary 
injunction said milt capps upis senior vice president of 
corporate affairs however we do take some encouragement from 
the fact that the judge feels upi will not be irreparably harmed 
and we are going to do everything possible to prove him right 
lawyers for upi said at a hearing monday that they would appeal 
if leisure denied the injunction 
the simple loss of customers is not sufficient to justify 
the action sought leisure said in a written opinion while 
there may be some injury to upis business due to the loss of 
reuters service the court finds that such a loss could be 
compensable in monetary terms 
the request for the injunction stemmed from a counterclaim by 
upi to a reuters federal lawsuit that seeks to void the picture 
exchange reuters said the agreement was not living up to 
expectations 
the contract was entered into in 1984 and called for upi to 
supply reuters with pictures from the united states while reuters 
provided upi with pictures from other countries the international 
pictures were to come from a global service that upi had set up and 
sold to reuters the agreement was to run for 10 years beginning in 
1985 
in legal papers filed tuesday upi asked the court to return the 
international photo service to upi capps said 
leisure cited testimony monday by the upi chairman dr earl 
brian who said some newspapers indicated they would drop the upi 
photo service if the reuters contract is canceled 
brian also said upi had been negotiating a photo exchange with 
the french news service agence francepresse but that afp only 
agreed to give upi a supply of photos for three months 
while the court does find it likely that some upi customers 
may not be content with the replacement of reuters by afp and may 
choose to disconnect upi the loss of these individual customers is 
simply not sufficient for the drastic relief sought by upi 
leisure said
