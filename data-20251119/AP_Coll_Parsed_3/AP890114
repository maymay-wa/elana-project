dennis elmore figures he proved hes an 
american by serving in vietnam so he refuses to document his 
citizenship to keep his job 
that refusal got the 40yearold machinist fired friday the 
deadline his boss set for filling out a government form employers 
have to keep to prove all their workers are citizens or legal us 
residents 
when i was 18 years old they sent me a draft notice they knew 
i was a citizen then elmore said 
his boss dick fisher of sampd specialties said he wishes he could 
keep elmore in the 12anhour job making parts for hydraulic 
cylinders but if he did the company would risk a 500 fine for 
failing to keep the new form required by the immigration and 
naturalization service 
they didnt give me a lot of options its a federal law 
fisher said 
the law is part of the immigration reform and control act of 
1986 which extended amnesty to illegal aliens who can prove theyre 
longtime us residents the law also imposed the employer penalties 
in hopes of cutting the influx of new illegals 
elmore acknowledged the government didnt want much he was 
supposed to fill out the form and supply drivers license and social 
security numbers 
its a matter of principle all right he said 
he ignored the form during the six months hes been working in 
this town 50 miles east of los angeles but fisher decided he had to 
set a deadline and the men agreed friday would be elmores last 
unless he did the paperwork 
elmore went to vietnam as an army enlisted man in 1969 and said 
the government should have taken military service into account 
immigration and naturalization service spokesman ron rogers in 
los angeles said the service cant make exemptions for veterans 
does he want to cooperate and help us control our border 
rogers asked he did serve his country and this is another way of 
helping his country 
elmore doesnt have any firm plans for a job hunt one things 
for sure he wont take a job if they ask him to fill out the 
immigration form 
i dont think i will he said i really dont

a 27yearold italian researcher has begun 
months of isolation in a plexiglas enclosure inside lost cave as 
part of an experiment 
ciao stefania follini called out friday as she grinned 
waved and descended a 20foot ladder 
pioneer frontier researches and explorations an italian team of 
speleologists and researchers under the direction of maurizio

effects of longterm space travel 
joining her underground for a brief farewell party were 
montalbini team physician andrea galvagno us bureau of land 
management representative jim goodbar and several friends 
they shared wine and ms follini sang a few songs and played the 
guitar before her guests left her alone in the cave and its 
entrance was sealed

100squarefoot enclosure she had not seen before friday the room 
in which she plans to study english and practice judo is sparsely 
furnished with a red metal chair and a table holding two computers

rising demand and easier federal curbs are 
encouraging the nations wheat farmers to boost production this 
year beginning with nearly 6 million acres more of winter wheat for 
the 1989 harvest 
the agriculture department said friday that winter wheat 
plantings last fall totaled 545 million acres up 12 percent from 
488 million acres seeded for last years harvest 
winter wheat is planted in the fall and harvested the following 
year it accounts for about threefourths of the total us wheat 
output 
production was cut last year by drought and brisk export demand 
has helped reduce stockpiles with greater demand prices have risen 
substantially the past year 
also farmers are being required to idle only 10 percent of their 
wheat base acres for 1989 in order to qualify for government price 
supports compared with 275 percent previously 
all states increased acreage from 1988 except arizona the 
dakotas mississippi montana nevada new jersey and wyoming the 
departments agricultural statistics board said in its report new 
mexico and tennessee are unchanged 
in kansas the largest producer wheat plantings jumped 22 
percent to 124 million acres 
nationally the 545 million acres of winter wheat planted for 
1989 is the largest acreage since 578 million acres were planted 
for the 1985 harvest according to usda records 
in a supplyanddemand analysis officials said the us total 
wheat stockpile on june 1 the beginning of the 198990 wheat 
marketing year could be whittled to around 534 million bushels 
less than half the 126 billion bushels in the june 1 1988 
inventory it was more than 182 billion bushels on june 1 1987 
export subsidies and other government programs have helped boost 
wheat sales to the soviet union china and other foreign buyers 
total shipments in 198889 are expected to be around 15 billion 
bushels more than double the 700 million bushels needed to cover 
us domestic food requirements 
meanwhile wheat prices at the farm have risen to a predicted 
range in the current marketing year of 360 to 375 per bushel on 
the average compared with 257 in 198788 and 242 in 198687 
a comparable situation has developed for some other grains hit by 
last years drought corn prices for example were forecast at an 
average of 230 to 270 per bushel in the 198889 marketing year 
that runs through august compared with 194 last season and 150 
in 198687 
another report showed the dec 1 inventory of corn at 707 
billion bushels down 28 percent from a year earlier the wheat 
inventory at 171 billion bushels was down 32 percent from dec 1 
1987 
soybean stocks as of dec 1 were reported at 137 billion 
bushels down 22 percent from a year earlier 
a review of overall 1988 crop production showed relatively minor 
adjustments in usdas previously announced harvest figures with the 
exception of corn last years corn harvest was reported at 492 
billion bushels up from 467 billion bushels estimated last 
november 
even so the 1988 corn harvest was down 30 percent from 1987 
production with the droughtreduced yield averaging 846 bushels 
per acre compared with the record level of 1194 bushels per acre 
in 1987 
the 1988 harvest of all wheat was a decade low of 181 billion 
bushels down 14 percent from 1987 and soybeans last year totaled 
154 billion bushels 20 percent below 1987 production cotton 
output at 154 million bales was up 5 percent from 1987 and was 
the most in seven years

the transportion department is taking a second 
look at a plan it introduced last month that would force some small 
airlines to eliminate unprofitable routes in sparsely populated 
areas 
dot cited budget restraints when it proposed sharply curtailing 
its essential air service program under the program the 
federal government subsidizes flights to and from about 150 small 
cities that would probably not otherwise have air service because 
the routes are not moneymakers 
on friday transportation department spokesman hal paris said an 
announcement could be made as early as the beginning of next week 
about changes in the dot plan 
he would not elaborate but another department official speaking 
on condition of anonymity said there is something under 
consideration there is movement to responding to a congressional 
request 
he added nothing has been signed yet and its not a decision 
until somebody signs it 
the original proposal was swiftly attacked by lawmakers from west 
virginia kansas and other states that would be especially hard hit 
sen jay rockefeller dwva said the reductions would be a 
fatal blow to the economic growth efforts of some communities and 
rep pat roberts rkan said the plan could mean the end of 
commuter air service in rural kansas 
the original dot action was in response to a 66 million 
shortfall in the air service programs appropriation for the 1989 
fiscal year 
the department proposed four likely plans for coping with the 
cuts one of them considered the harshest by some would cut 53 
cities entirely out of the program onethird of those cities are 
more than 100 miles from the next nearest airport 
in defending the cuts the department has pointed to littleused 
flights that receive subsidies in remote areas 
for example the government spent 379000 in georgia last year 
to keep flights going between atlanta and moultrie that averaged one 
passenger the route would probably be eliminated if the subsidy 
ends 
but rockefeller said ending subsidies to west virginia cities 
could do more than simply inconvenience passengers who would have to 
travel to another airport further away 
for rural areas there is a direct link between adequate air 
service and economic development rockefeller said one of the 
first questions business leaders ask when they come to look at rural 
areas is whats the air service like 
in west virginia the cutbacks could mean the end of flights in 
and out of beckley clarksburgfairmont elkins and morgantown 
in releasing the plan on dec 14 the dot said it hoped it could 
take effect on march 1 following a public comment period 
exec express ii airlines which operates in texas said in a 
letter to rep marvin leath dtexas from our standpoint any cut 
in the essential air service program would be devastating exec 
express ii has been rebuilding air service in communities which have 
not had adequate service in the past

president reagan and presidentelect bush are 
challenging subpoenas from oliver north while prosecutors say 
norths continued demand to use classified information is an effort 
to torpedo his upcoming trial on charges stemming from the 
irancontra affair 
the government filed a motion in federal court friday to quash 
the subpoenas for reagan and bush whose testimony is being sought 
by north as part of the fired white house aides defense 
attorney general dick thornburgh said north has not made the 
requisite showing of relevance materiality and need for 
specifically identified information that he seeks to obtain from 
reagan and bush 
thornburgh said that in accordance with an offer made last sept 
28 the president will consider furnishing appropriate information 
with written answers to reasonable written questions from north 
and that bush joins that offer north served the subpoenas dec 
22 
the spectacle of a former or sitting president being subjected 
to peremptory judicial process may chill foreign governments in the 
way they deal with the president now and in the future the 
government said in the motion to quash the subpoenas for reagan and 
bush to appear at the trial 
norths lawyers meanwhile served the justice department with 
subpoenas for reagan and bush to turn over various personal papers 
for use by the defense said department spokesman loye miller 
earlier in the day us district judge gerhard a gesell 
dismissed the two central charges alleging that north illegally 
diverted more than 14 million in usiran arms sale proceeds to 
the nicaraguan rebels 
walsh had filed a motion jan 5 seeking to have the two charges 
dropped citing norths insistence on introducing classified 
information in his defense and the reagan administrations refusal 
to release material the judge ruled that north would need at trial 
norths attorneys said proof of their clients innocence is 
contained in classified material 
twelve criminal charges remain against north and the issue of 
dealing with classified information in open court remains a problem 
attorneys for both sides held closeddoor morning and afternoon 
sessions with gesell on classified information as it relates to the 
remaining counts the attorneys will resume the closeddoor 
discussions next tuesday 
walsh said in a court filing thursday that the remaining charges 
can be tried without opening the door for north to use reams 
of classified information and that north should be barred from 
seeking to prove a host of irrelevant matters for the sole purpose 
of scuttling the entire case by using national security grounds to 
do so 
however defense attorney brendan sullivan said last week 
classified information pervades the remaining charges as well 
nine of the counts focus on charges that north concealed from 
congress and former attorney general edwin meese iii his efforts on 
behalf of the contras four of the nine deal with alleged 
concealment of a diversion of money to the cntras from the 
administrations secret arms sales to iran 
north also is accused of illegally accepting a 13800 security 
system at his home from codefendant richard secord converting to 
his own use at least 4300 in travelers checks from contra leader 
adolfo calero and conspiring to defraud the treasury of tax revenue 
in connection with charitable contributions supporting the contras

outgoing commerce secretary c william verity 
says many american products are below world standards of quality and 
the japanese are two years ahead in developing salable products from 
american inventions 
blaming antitrust laws for a large part of the problem verity 
urged presidentelect bush to prepare for economic warfare in 
the 1990s 
whats going to be on the top burner of the 1990s for the bush 
administration is trading and how is america going to make sure it 
will be the number one player verity said friday in a last speech 
for export now a campaign he has pressed in his 18 months in 
office 
as president reagan retires next week verity will follow an old 
friend of bush from the texas oil industry robert mosbacher has 
been named to succeed him 
the reason that many american products are not selling abroad 
is very simple because they dont have sufficient quality to do 
it he said 
he told how his family company armco inc had been a big 
supplier of sheet steel to the american auto industry but had to 
work five years to produce steel that would meet the standards of 
honda the japanese automaker 
verity says antitrust laws discourage cooperation of american 
companies creating a barrier to more effective competition 
it should be possible for high technology companies or other 
companies to get together not only just research together but 
develop and produce together and market together and then compete 
he said 
thats what has to happen if were going to stay in some very 
important markets including the semiconductor market or high 
definition television or superconductivity and theres much more 
coming down the path 
this country has some marvelous technology but it is less expert 
at transforming theoretical discoveries into products that can sell 
he complained 
the japanese can do this two years quicker than we can he 
said 
this is a serious problem if we develop a technology but if the 
japanese take our technology and use it and were two years delayed 
in getting into the marketplace thats going to be disastrous to 
this country 
veritys criticism of us industry was not the first from a high 
figure in the reagan administration richard g darman who was 
deputy to former treasury secretary james a baker iii has 
criticized what he called a corpocracy in american business for 
what he saw as lack of initiative 
baker is to be secretary of state under president bush and 
darman will head the office of management and budget

authorities have identified iran as a 
possible destination for a planned illegal shipment of nerve gas 
but the final arrival point may never be known a customs service 
official said 
we dont have to know it to make a case against two men 
charged thursday with trying to export the deadly gas said richard 
f mercier head customs investigator in newark 
prosecutors must only prove that the koreanamerican and british 
business men tried to circumvent licensing requirements in exporting 
restricted materials he said friday the charge carries a maximum 
fiveyear prison term and a 250000 fine 
im hopeful that through investigation or whatever else the 
destination would be positively determined mercier said but he 
pointed out that the deal never went through 
its not as though theres a trail for us to follow he said 
authorities said friday they are trying to learn the identities 
of two other people accused of plotting with the suspects 
juwhan yun 48 was arrested thursday at what he thought would be 
a meeting with an arms supplier who was actually a customs service 
undercover agent 
he has been ordered jailed pending a bail hearing tuesday on 
charges of conspiring to illegally export sarin a nerve gas 
an arrest warrant was issued for charles caplan a london 
businessman who authorities said was seeking to obtain the gas 5 
million worth in the form of 500 quarterton bombs from yun the 
possibility of his extradition is being studied us prosecutors 
said 
the complaint filed in federal court accusing caplan and yun said 
the men met jan 9 about the gas deal with two other people in 
london 
during the course of the meeting yun called the undercover 
agent twice and asked him for more detailed information about the 
sarin the complaint said 
the complaint also detailed discussions between yun and ky joo 
identified as a close business associate of yun and the head of 
kwang jin trading co in seoul south korea 
authorities said yun and joo discussed at least three missile and 
military radar equipment deals that apparently involved iran as a 
destination authorities also said that at one point during 
negotiations iran was to be the recipient of the sarin 
the complaint said that during a meeting jan 4 between yun and 
the agent the agent asked yun if a final destination is the 
country with the i in it and yun answered yes 
but that could not be verified said first assistant us 
attorney michael p chertoff 
caplan identified as president of domino associates and domino 
avionics was described in british court as a former military 
consultant 
caplan could not be reached for comment messages left at his 
london offices were not returned 
yuns attorney stephen n dratch also failed to return phone 
messages

rural interstate highway accidents killed 352 
more people than a year earlier in states where the speed limit was 
raised to 65 mph while death tolls on other roads decreased 
slightly according to a government report 
the 19 percent increase in deaths occurred over a period that 
varied for each state depending on when drivers were allowed to go 
faster said the report friday by the national highway traffic 
safety administration congress authorized the increased limit 
beginning april 2 1987 and 38 states have adopted it for their 
rural interstates 
highway deaths in those states on urban interstates and other 
roads where the 55 mph limit remained totaled 21366 for the same 
period in 1986 and 21231 in 1987 the report said 
fatalities in states that raised the speed limit increased by an 
average nearly three times as high as in 10 states that kept the 
limit at 55 on all roads the report showed 
but the safety administration in releasing the first of three 
planned annual reports said there were substantial variations 
among the states and some such as california actually showed fewer 
deaths on rural interstates after new speeds were posted 
the report also said there was not enough evidence to determine 
the speed limits longterm impact on highway safety 
critics of the higher speed limit said the increased death toll 
was enough reason to return to the 55 mph limit nationwide 
this report can be summed up in two words speed kills said 
sen frank lautenberg dnj chairman of the senate appropriations 
transportation subcommittee who has opposed the increase 
overall 373 more people died on rural interstates in 1987 than 
in 1986 the report said of those 352 were in states that raise 
the speed limit and 21 in states that did not 
the highway safety agency in its 67page report said rural 
interstate fatalities account for only 5 percent of americans killed 
in road accidents and the increase had only a small impact on 
overall traffic fatalities which total about 46000 a year 
the report noted that 24000 people are killed each year in 
crashes where alcohol is involved and 8000 are pedestrians hit by 
vehicles 
nhtsa continues to believe that setting speed limits is a 
matter for state legislatures to decide based on their review of 
available fatality and injury data actual experience and local 
conditions the report said 
it noted that arizona and new mexico experienced large increases 
in fatalities after raising the limit to 65 but states that did not 
also had significant increases they include connecticut georgia 
hawaii maryland massachusetts new jersey new york pennsylvania 
rhode island and virginia 
states that increased the speed limit to 65 and had overall 
decreases in traffic fatalities included colorado florida indiana 
maine new hampshire montana oklahoma and oregon

more than 200 retirees of us news amp world 
report have lost another round in their court claim that they were 
underpaid 100 million in profitsharing benefits 
the us court of appeals on friday upheld a lower court decision 
that said the retirees were paid a fair value for their company 
stock before 1982 even though employees who held stock when the 
news magazine was sold two years later received much more per share 
the 230 plaintiffs who retired between 1974 and 1982 were paid 
an average of 100 a share said their attorney alan raywid the 
magazines 1984 employees got 2842 a share when us news was 
sold according to court papers 
we think the opinion is wrong said raywid who added there 
is a substantial likelihood it will be appealed the 
threemember court effectively said companies can sacrifice the 
interests of past employees and retirees to benefit current and 
future employees and maintain employee ownership he said 
under the us news profitsharing plan when an employee retired 
the company could exercise its option to buy the employees stock 
shares 
according to court papers employees who retired in 1973 received 
65 a share while the value rose to 470 for those who retired in 
1981 
the magazine was sold for 176 million in 1984 to media and real 
estate magnate mortimer zuckerman 
raywid said the plaintiffs had received a total of 55 million 
for their stock but believed they would have gotten 100 million 
more if they had been given full value 
the plaintiffs contended the company that appraised the 
magazines value improperly classified retirees stock as a minority 
interest rather than a majority interest which would have carried a 
higher premium 
in addition the plaintiffs said the appraiser placed an unfairly 
low value on property us news owned in washington dc 
however the court of appeals upheld the decision to give the 
retirees stock a minority status saying it was entirely 
consistent with the profitsharing plans rules and with federal 
law 
the court also affirmed the property valuation saying much of 
the land was being used as a parking lot and development had not 
been expected at the time 
a major objective of the profitsharing plan was the perpetuation 
of employee ownership the appellate court said adding that the law 
does not set an exclusive goal of maximizing benefits 
the plaintiffs were not the only beneficiaries of the plan 
the judges said indeed the worst that can be said of the plan is 
that it was administered to favor a rolling class of future 
beneficiaries over those present and past 
ruling in the case were circuit judges harry t edwards james l 
buckley and stephen f williams

president reagans helicopter landed at the 
white house minutes after a bomb threat was received by a white 
house operator an administration aide said 
reagan returning late friday from new york on the last working 
trip of his presidency landed on the south lawn on schedule at 
1115 pm est after the secret service went over the area with 
bombsniffing dogs 
the president entered the executive mansion without incident 
white house press aide scott sowry said 
about 15 reporters and television crew members on the south lawn 
to cover the usuallyroutine helicopter landing were removed to the 
white house press office moments before the presidential helicopter 
arrived 
press officials on duty had no information about the exact nature 
of the threat or whether it was actually directed at the white house 
complex 
reagan was returning from new york where he had spoken at the 
annual dinner of the knights of malta a roman catholic civic 
organization that helps the poor it was his last official working 
trip out of washington as president 
aides at the white house did not know if reagan had been informed 
of the threat secret service officials could not immediately be 
reached for comment 
several minutes before the helicopter was supposed to land the 
white house operator received a bomb threat and passed that on to 
the uniformed division of the secret service sowry said when

had a package for the president was detained at the waldorfastoria

others in his car

route after it was determined that no explosives were present said 
new york police capt dan mccormick

fearing a loss of the nations competitive edge 
a group of college officials is seeking ways to double the number of 
students studying abroad and include more business and science 
majors 
members of the council on international educational exchange met 
privately in new york on friday to discuss ways to expand 
studyabroad opportunities for lessaffluent youngsters and 
encourage students to attend programs in places other than just 
england or france 
the meeting followed release of a council report in december 
which found fewer than 5 percent or about 50000 of us college 
students studying abroad each year while some 350000 foreign 
students attend us schools 
citizens of other nations are learning more about us than we 
are about them and each year are doing so in increasing numbers 
said the 28page report educating for global competence 
we have quite rightly welcomed these students to our own shores 
but have failed to encourage our own students to go abroad it 
said 
the report warned that failure to expand studyabroad 
opportunities would mean we will irreversibly diminish the world 
status of the united states 
robert l woodbury chancellor of the university of maine system 
said in an interview that the council decided to establish a 
committee on unrepresented groups to help schools develop 
studyabroad opportunities for such groups as business and law 
students and poor and minority youngsters 
we plan to get poor students better information on what the 
costs are woodbury said after the meeting theres a common 
belief that studyabroad progams will cost more in fact many 
programs do not involve extra cost 
according to the report only 3 percent of us high school 
graduates and 5 percent of college graduates have meaningful 
proficiency in a second language thirtythree states dont require 
foreign language study in high school and 34 states dont require 
world history the united states is one of the few industrialized 
countries where students can graduate from college without studying 
a foreign language 
if you look at the attitude of colleges here international 
study has never been a very big part of the curriculum its just a 
good thing to do rather than a part of the mainstream said 
woodbury 
the majority of students studying abroad are white affluent 
females from highly educated families according to the report most 
are liberal arts majors and spend less than six months in foreign 
programs 
relatively few students majoring in business public health 
science or math take part in such programs said the report 
woodbury said his own school started an exchange program with the 
soviet union in 1987 involving 15 soviet and 15 us students each 
year the university of maine system is also trying to establish an 
exchange program in which business students could work as interns in 
japanese companies he said 
the council established in 1947 is a nonprofit organization 
based in new york which fosters student exchange programs former 
arkansas sen j william fulbright serves as honorary chairman

crosswiring found in cargo hold emergency 
systems of two boeing 757 airliners prompted federal aviation 
authorities to order inspections of all the aircraft within the next 
three days 
the order late friday was similar to one issued for boeing 737s 
48 hours earlier involving critical engine fire and vibration 
warning systems the two airworthiness directives were 
unrelated however 
the earlier order was prompted by speculation the pilot of a 
british midland airways 737 that crashed sunday killing 44 people 
might have been confused by false wiring into shutting down his only 
good engine 
the times of london reported friday however that investigators 
were certain there was no wiring problem and neither us nor 
british airline officials reported finding such a problem on any 
other aircraft tests of us 737s have to be completed by sunday 
morning 
the latest airworthiness directive by the federal aviation 
administration gives airlines 72 hours to check whether crosswiring 
in cargo holds might cause sprinklers to go on in the wrong cargo 
area in the event of a fire 
the problem had been discovered in two of the aircraft said faa 
spokesman fred farrar he said no details were available on how the 
problem was found or on which airliners but he said neither 
involved an actual fire or accident 
the order involving 757s is not really relevant to the british 
crash except that the subject is also miswiring farrar said 
the faa said 205 of the 757s are in service worldwide with 119 
of them used by four us airlines america west delta eastern and 
northwest 
the miswiring means that if the flight crew got a warning 
indicating a fire in the forward cargo compartment and pushed the 
button to activate the fire extinguishing system for that 
compartment it would activate the system in the aft cargo 
compartment and viceversa said an faa statement 
the checks were not expected to disrupt any scheduled flights

district of columbia del walter fauntroy is 
denying he has been contacted by the house ethics committee chairman 
over putting the son of an illinois representative on the 
congressional payroll while the son was running for state office in 
chicago 
the associated press citing a congressional source reported 
thursday that rep julian dixon dcalif chairman of the ethics 
committee had written fauntroy asking him to explain his hiring of 
thomas john savage the son of rep gus savage dill 
according to the source who spoke only on condition of 
anonymity dixon asked fauntroy what duties savage performed and if 
savage had regularly reported to work 
a federal investigation into the case began last month after the 
ap reported savage was on fauntroys payroll at the same time he was 
running for the illinois legislature 
according to sworn affidavits submitted to illinois board of 
elections officials savage said he had fulfilled state requirements 
by living continuously for two years in the legislative district he 
sought to represent that period covered the time he was on 
fauntraroll 
house rules meanwhile require a congressional employee to 
report regularly to work 
fauntroy in a statement he issued to the washington post on 
friday disputed the portion of the story that described dixons 
letter 
according to the post fauntroy asserted that dixon had not 
written him about the savage affair 
but the congressional source contacted again by the ap after 
fauntroy iso denial on friday reconfirmed and amplified his 
original description of the letter 
the source stated a letter from dixon was received by fauntroys 
office during the last week of december and added that johnny 
barnes fauntroys staff director had been preparing a response 
however it could not be learned whether barnes completed his 
letter whether fauntroy had seen it or whether a response had been 
sent to the ethics panel 
fauntroys staff refused repeated efforts by the ap which 
included several telephone calls to fauntroys office and a visit 
there by a reporter to obtain the statement 
repeated efforts to reach dixon friday were unsuccessful pat 
miller the staff director of dixons los angeles office said the 
congressman was traveling out of state and would not return to 
california until wednesday she said he had not left a telephone 
number where he could be reached and had not been calling in for 
messages 
savage earned 21398 while on fauntroys payroll from september 
1987 through june 1988 
the fbi is conducting a preliminary investigation into the case 
a justice department official confirmed thursday 
in the prepared statement fauntroy also said his staff had been 
told by members of dixons personal office staff and ethics 
committee officials that no such letter existed 
ethics committee officials were unavailable for comment friday 
afternoon neither gwendolyn brown legislative director in dixons 
capitol hill office nor andrea holmes his washington press

hundreds of nicaraguans and other central americans 
seeking a promised land are pouring into this haven for immigrants 
but some who settled in the area after the 1979 sandinista 
revolution are wary of the newcomers 
some of the nicaraguans here have mixed feelings about those 
who stayed with the sandinistas said maritza herrera head of the 
nicaraguanamerican foundation 
they are people from the farm areas with a different 
orientation said the rev leon pallais a nicaraguan priest who 
runs the nicaraguan assistance center in little havana 
the central americans began arriving from southern texas by the 
busload thursday and friday following a federal judges ruling that 
the government could not keep them there while their applications 
for political asylum were being processed 
since the judges decision monday some 400 people have come 
here bringing the twomonth total to about 2000 most of them 
nicaraguans officials expect about 100000 more over the next 18 
months 
pallais said the new group is different from the first wave of 
nicaraguans that settled in southern florida 
roberto arguello head of the nicaraguan bankers association 
disagreed saying the time has come to forget the differences that 
separate the first group from the second 
the bottom line is we are all nicaraguans he said back in 
nicaragua there was no inbetween here we just have to forget it 
the objective is to help all nicaraguans 
the latest group is coming to town with no guarantee of food 
shelter or social services and officials are warning there will be 
very little support once they arrive 
isidoro cuevas the cubanborn mayor of sweetwater a heavily 
nicaraguan city in western dade county said his city will have 
trouble absorbing the aliens 
weve been trying to gather clothes and food to pass it on to 
them he said but there are many dwellings shared by more than 
one family already people are sleeping on the front porches 
sleeping on the couches 
in miami about 250 immigrants have been staying in a sports 
stadium but the baltimore orioles baseball team arrives jan 25 for 
spring training and the immigrants will have to be relocated most 
likely to private shelters and churches 
mayor xavier suarez sought an emergency meeting with president 
reagan and other officials urged presidentelect george bush who 
is fishing in the florida keys this weekend to come to see the 
situation for himself 
bush told reporters he would examine immigration policy when he 
takes office he said the newcomers are causing an overburdening 
of facilities like schools and hospitals and this is a sorry 
commentary on whats happening in central america and nicaragua 
the united states has to be generous but no one community can 
suffer an overload without some support in some way he said 
a delegation of community leaders visited southern texas on 
friday to warn those awaiting transportation to miami 
if people come down there miami they need to know that 
theyre going to have to fend for themselves dade county 
assistant county manager tony ojeda said in harlingen texas 
he estimated the miami area has 75000 to 125000 nicaraguans 
along with thousands of other recently arrived central americans 
more than 30000 central americans passed through south texas in 
1988 seeking political asylum according to the us immigration and 
naturalization service 
the best way for miami to deal with the influx would be to allow 
more of the immigrants to get work permits arguello said 
with work permits for every nicaraguan the private sector can 
step in and help he said we dont want to create a welfare 
society

a teamsters international vice president 
convicted of embezzling union funds in an alleged ghost employee 
scheme returns to court tuesday to learn whether he must relinquish 
his many union positions 
indicted in may 1986 with the late teamsters president jackie 
presser harold friedman 66 was convicted in us district court 
on friday of embezzlement labor racketeering conspiracy to commit 
racketeering and filing false statements with the labor department 
he could be sentenced to up to 46 years in prison and fined up to 
70000 
anthony hughes 52 recording secretary of local 507 in 
cleveland pressers home local was convicted of labor 
racketeering conspiracy to commit racketeering and embezzlement he 
faces a penalty of up to 45 years imprisonment and a fine of up to 
60000 
presser who became president of the 16million member union in 
1983 died of brain cancer july 9 and was never tried 
friedman and hughes declined comment after the verdict 
ohios most powerful teamster friedman is president of the ohio 
council of teamsters leader of teamsters joint council 41 in 
northeast ohio and president of teamsters local 507 and bakery 
workers local 19 the two locals share offices and have a combined 
membership of about 12000 people 
judge george w white dismissed the jury until tuesday at that 
time attorneys say the jurors will be asked to consider whether 
the two men have to forfeit their union posts no sentencing was 
scheduled 
union officials convicted of any of several felonies including 
embezzlement are required to relinquish their union positions for 
13 years according to dick crino area administrator for the us 
labor department in cleveland but paul j cambria attorney for 
friedman said other things are considered and that the jury will 
deliberate those points tuesday 
presser friedman and hughes had been accused of being involved 
in embezzling 700000 from the union between 1972 and 1981 to pay 
socalled ghost employees who didnt work for the money 
cambria said the verdict is puzzling because under the 
racketeering counts friedman was convicted only of keeping two of 
four alleged ghost employees on the payroll for three pay 
periods 
the racketeering counts that friedman was convicted of accused 
friedman and presser of embezzling up to 43500 to pay hughes and 
up to 8800 to pay george argie hughes was accused of being a 
ghost employee and argie was an unindicted coconspirator who 
testified he did little if any work 
i cant really make sense of the verdict at this point 
cambria said were going to have to determine if it the verdict 
can be set aside because it was internally inconsistent 
presser and hughes were fbi informants court documents 
indicated pressers former attorney john r climaco has said that 
pressers defense would have been that he was authorized by the fbi 
to hire the ghost employees to enhance and protect his image as 
an fbi informant 
during the trial white rejected cambrias motion asking that 
documents regarding pressers fbi informant activities be released 
we were deprived from putting in the entire fbi aspect of this 
because jackie took that with him and the agents who are still alive 
declined to testify cambria said 
one of hughes attorneys rocco russo said he thought there were 
several inconsistencies in the verdict and declined to elaborate

a west german company that us 
officials contend exported goods to libya to help it build a 
suspected chemical weapons plant is being investigated by a black 
forest prosecutor 
the new probe compounds official embarrassment over a scandal 
that has dominated west german politics for two weeks 
the social democratic partys vice chairman gerhard baum called 
friday for a federal criminal probe 
government officials conceded friday they had received 
intelligence reports in october that indicated german companies may 
have helped build the plant in rabta about 40 miles outside the 
libyan capital of tripoli 
chancellor helmut kohls spokesman friedhelm ost had said 
earlier bonn knew nothing of alleged west german complicity in the 
project until us secretary of state george p shultz brought it up 
during kohls visit to washington in november 
the united states contends the plant is on the verge of 
fullscale production of poison gas libya claims it is a 
pharmaceutical plant 
at the same news conference at which ost spoke finance ministry 
spokesman karlheinz von den driesch said investigators had found no 
evidence against west german companies that would stand up in court 
werner botz chief prosecutor for the offenburg region in the 
black forest area told the associated press that he opened the new 
investigation into imhausenchemie of lahr after reading a detailed 
report in this weeks stern magazine 
the hamburgbased magazine cited what it said were official 
documents and witnesses in its article which accused 
imhausenchemie the now defunct ibi engineering of frankfurt and 
pen tsao medical supply of hamburg of being deeply involved in the 
libya project 
stern alleged that imhausenchemie provided everything that is 
needed to build a chemical plant to ibi which the magazine 
said in turn shipped the materials to libya under forged bills 
the article also mentioned involvement by the cross link nv firm 
of antwerp belgium the director of that company jozef gedopt was 
arrested in brussels on wednesday and charged with forging shipping 
documents on goods delivered to libya 
a woman who answered the telephone at imhausenchemie on friday 
said the company would have no comment on the new developments 
attempts to reach the companys owner juergen 
hippenstielimhausen were unsuccessful 
news reports have said imhausen is on a foreign business trip 
kohl on thursday said authorities had uncovered new documents 
implicating west german companies and said investigators were giving 
them a thorough look 
west german law requires companies exporting hazardous materials 
arms or their components to obtain licenses from the economics 
ministry however officials from that ministry have said the legal 
situation regarding transfer of technology or consultation varies 
from case to case 
a west german delegation was in the united states the past week 
to examine washingtons evidence on the plants purpose and alleged 
west german involvement 
nearly two weeks ago us officials said they suspected 
imhausenchemie the finance ministry audited the company and 
announced last week it had found no evidence of illegal exports 
on wednesday government sources confirmed a criminal 
investigation of ibis activities and said customs authorities 
had seized company documents

this is a world theyd like to change and make more peaceful

the mural depicts indian peace leader mohandas gandhi king a 
sign saying end segregation in public schools and two hands 
shaking one black one white 
in arizona federal and city offices will be closed monday but 
all state offices will remain open 
kings birthday was a state holiday in arizona for a brief time 
former gov bruce babbitt a democrat created the holiday by 
executive order in 1986 after the legislature refused to act but 
as one of his first official acts as governor evan mecham rescinded 
the order before the first holiday could be celebrated the action 
touched off the first major controversy of his shortlived 
administration 
mecham said he acted because attorney general bob corbin a 
fellow republican had said that babbitts order was illegal because 
a holiday requires legislative approval as well 
democratic gov rose mofford who succeeded mecham following his 
impeachment and removal from office last year is on record in favor 
of a king holiday although she has not followed babbitt in creating 
one by executive order

bernhard goetz who was sentenced to one year in 
jail for shooting four black men in a subway with an unlicensed gun 
says the violence resulted from the deterioration of society 
the 41yearold electronics engineer was also ordered friday to 
pay a 5000 fine by state judge stephen crane who said goetz had 
shown no remorse for his actions 
i do feel this case is really more about the deterioration of 
society than it is about me said goetz whose 1984 shootings of 
the men he said were trying to rob him prompted debates on racism 
selfdefense and vigilantism 
assistant district attorney gregory waples seemed im sorry to 
say to believe that society needs to be protected from me goetz 
said 
well i dont believe thats the case he said i believe 
society needs to be protected from criminals 
goetz fled to new hampshire after the shootings and later 
surrendered he told police he fired the 38caliber revolver in 
selfdefense because he felt he was about to be robbed the men 
claimed they were panhandling 
three of the four all 19 at the time recovered from the 
shooting one darrell cabey was left braindamaged and partially 
paralyzed 
goetz was acquitted of attempted murder and other charges in his 
june 1987 trial an appeals court upheld the gun possession 
conviction last year but threw out the original sixmonth jail 
sentence saying it did not meet the requirements under state law 
which mandates a oneyear sentence 
under the oneyear jail sentence goetz gets credit for the nine 
days he served immediately after his arrest becoming eligible for 
parole in 51 days 
goetz who faced a new sentence of up to seven years decided to 
go ahead with the sentencing even though he has asked the us 
supreme court to review the case because he wants to get the jail 
time over with said his attorney mark baker 
his other attorney barry slotnick had asked the judge to limit 
goetzs sentence to the nine days he already served pleading let 
him go home where he belongs he has lived in a fish bowl and he 
should not go to jail 
the prosecutor said goetz richly deserves to be punished and 
called him a potential danger to himself and new york society 
waples sought a oneyear sentence with supervised parole so goetz 
would be forced to undergo psychiatric treatment 
crane said goetzs failure to show remorse for the crime gave 
me concern he might recidivate in possessing a firearm and added 
that a jail term would not be unduly harsh 
goetz left immediately for the rikers island jail the correction 
department agreed to a defense request that goetz be kept in 
protective custody there said baker 
two jurors from goetzs trial attended fridays sentencing 
catherine brody a college librarian and diana serpe an airline 
reservations clerk 
we felt we were so intensely involved and we had to follow it 
through said brody the problem is it is the law and as it is 
the law we feel it has to be followed or a signal is sent that the 
law doesnt mean anything 
ron kuby a lawyer representing cabey in a multimilliondollar 
lawsuit against goetz called the sentence an outrage and said it 
gives license to bigots and lunatics all over the city of new york 
to go out and blast people who they hate and fear 
i have spoken to mrs cabey darrells mother kuby said 
she expected this but she is disappointed she was hoping a stiff 
sentence would prevent other people from going out and doing to 
black youth what bernhard goetz did to darrell cabey unfortunately 
thats not going to happen

ten years after their avantgarde exhibition in 
a beijing park shook up the chinese art world a group of pioneering 
artists has reunited in this british colony for their first 
retrospective 
the youthful chinese artists known as the stars gained 
prominence in 1979 when they marched through beijing to protest 
police interference in a show they had set up without official 
approval 
the authorities gave in and permitted the exhibition 
unprecedented in communist china which featured onceforbidden 
topics such as nudes abstracts and works of aesthetic rather than 
political content 
after a 1980 show however the 30member group disbanded while 
some remained active in beijing others settled in europe japan and 
the united states 
the retrospective featuring the work of 12 group members opened 
friday and is scheduled to run five weeks before moving to taipei 
taiwan and paris 
before the stars earlier art was all the same said 
sculptor wang keping one of six members in hong kong for the 
exhibition the stars showed artistic activity in china need not 
be organized or approved by the ruling party he said 
individuality was the driving force behind the group said 
gallery owner chang tsongzung who organized the retrospective 
the only common aim of the artists when they first started was 
that they wanted to be different from each other 
bo yun a teacher at beijings academy of arts and design whose 
abstract scroll paintings are part of the retrospective claims 
artistic freedom in china has advanced since the groups 1979 
exhibition though limitations remain 
there is no problem he said if you use a work of art to 
satirize an opponent of the government but if you mock the 
government im afraid that will pose a problem 
the stars also say beijing no longer allows them to exhibit 
as a group thwarting attempts in 1983 and 1986 the reason 
believes bo is that the groups name has become a symbol of the 
democracy movement 
the retrospective includes works from the late 1970s including 
wangs buddhalike bust of chairman mao tsetung signifying the 
deification of the communist leader during the ultraleftist 196676 
cultural revolution it is called the idol 
other pieces adopt current themes including the mixedmedia work 
safe sex by ai weiwei that features a prophylactic attached to a 
rain coat 
the works which cost up to several thousand dollars are as 
different as the paths the artists have taken since they disbanded 
wang 39 a softspoken man with a small goatee moved to paris 
in 1984 convinced he could not develop further in china largely 
because of political pressure 
art freedom is only possible in a democratic country with human 
rights he said 
wang recently wrote a play titled the retrial of wei 
jingsheng who led a prodemocracy movement in china before being 
sentenced to a 15year prison term in 1979 
bo 40 has remained in beijing supplementing his 40 monthly 
salary by selling his paintings to foreigners and at overseas 
exhibits 
other stars on display in the retrospective include huang rui 
and ma desheng the two leaders of the group and li shuang who was 
arrested in 1981 and sentenced to two years of labor reeducation 
for incitement to debauchery when she was arrested she was 
living with a french diplomat but had yet to marry him 
although the stars have scattered across the globe they have 
stayed in touch with one another from the heady days of 197980 was 
forged a feeling of brotherhood that has not diminished bo said

the defense rested in the murder trial of joel 
steinberg accused of beating to death his illegally adopted 
6yearold daughter without introducing an insanity defense and 
without calling him to testify 
during 11 weeks of testimony the jury heard 39 prosecution 
witnesses and 13 defense witnesses 
state judge harold rothwax scheduled the defense summation for 
next thursday he told the jurors the government would sum up next 
friday and they would get the case on jan 23 after receiving the 
judges instructions 
with the jury absent rothwax again asked steinbergs lawyers 
ira d london and adrian diluzio am i correct you do not intend 
to introduce an insanity defense 
you are 100 percent correct your honor diluzio replied 
rothwax had repeatedly pressed steinbergs lawyers to tell him if 
they intended to argue that steinberg was not responsible for lisa 
steinbergs death by reason of mental defect or disease 
in case they did the judge had ordered the defendant to be 
examined by a prosecution psychiatrist to determine his mental 
condition on nov 1 1987 the night he is accused of fatally 
beating lisa 
the examination was completed thursday night 
the judge said if the defense made any reference in their 
summation next week to steinberg being motivated by cults 
staring or that he heard electronic mousetraps in the walls of his 
apartment that would be tantamount to introducing an insanity 
defense 
if that happened the judge said he would reopen the trial and 
let the prosecution psychiatrist testify 
the decision by the defense not to use an insanity defense leaves 
the jury with a circumstantial case in which no one said they saw 
lisa killed 
hedda nussbaum steinbergs former livein companion testified 
that steinberg told her he struck lisa because the child was 
staring at him and trying to place him in a hypnotic trance 
both steinberg and ms nussbaum 46 were charged with 
seconddegree murder for depraved indifference to lisas life 
charges against ms nussbaum were dismissed in october at the 
request of the prosecution which says she was too battered and 
emotionally crippled to harm lisa but the defense challenges that 
contention 
london told reporters outside the courtroom that the prosecution 
had not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that steinberg 47 a 
disbarred lawyer inflicted the injuries that killed lisa 
he continued to suggest that the injuries could have been 
inflicted by ms nussbaum we hope that issue has been squarely 
raised and will be considered by the jury he said

fortyeight policemen will have to 
settle for a job well done instead of the expensive watches they 
received from the president of the united arab emirates in gratitude 
for guarding him 
it was not deemed correct that officials receive extra 
compensation for fulfillment of their normal duties said an 
aachen police spokesman 
the president sheik zayed bin sultan nahyan gave the swiss 
watches to the policemen who guarded him during an august 1987 
visit said the spokesman on condition of anonymity 
the watches are worth several thousand marks more than 1000 
each and officials are questioning the propriety of accepting the 
gifts he said 
the new police chief heinrich boenninghausen has decided the 
watches should be auctioned off with the money to go to charity the 
spokesman said 
two of the policemen have filed a court complaint asking that 
they be allowed to keep their watches he said 
the administrative court has issued a restraining order on the 
auctioning off the watches to study the case the spokesman said

doctors at the nations leading transplant 
center have stopped doing multipleorgan abdominal transplants until 
they can find a better way of keeping the body from rejecting the 
organs 
were in no sense foreclosing the thing said dr thomas e 
starzl who pioneered the surgery we have an operation thats 
fundamentally sound but we dont quite yet have the capability of 
bringing it off in a predictable and reliable way 
starzls recommendation friday to childrens hospital of 
pittsburgh not to perform any more of the experimental operations 
until antirejection drug therapy is improved came a week after the 
death of 3yearold rolandrea rolly dodge of fruitland nm 
the toddler died jan 6 in childrens hospital six weeks after 
receiving a liver pancreas stomach small intestine and part of a 
large intestine 
preliminary laboratory tests revealed similarities between the 
new mexico childs death and that of tabatha foster the only other 
person to receive five transplanted organs in a single operation 
the madisonville ky girl survived six months before dying last 
may of a blood infection 
we probably need better tools starzl said were looking 
ahead to getting better methods of controlling organ rejection 
starzl said doctors deliberately waited a year before proceeding 
with a second transplant involving multiple abdominal organs they 
decided on rolly who was born with a disorder that prevented her 
intestines from absorbing food and liquids 
based on their experience with tabatha surgeons gave rolly less 
cyclosporine a potent antirejection medication but her name was 
placed back on the transplant waiting list jan 4 when tests showed 
her small intestine was being rejected by her bodys immune system 
a suitable donor was never found and she died of multipleorgan 
failure 
tissue analyses on rolly are incomplete but doctors believe she 
and tabatha suffered from a dangerous proliferation of white blood 
cells 
the same problem also plagued michael steward 10 months of 
rockford ill who died last may following a fourorgan transplant 
at rushpresbyterianst lukes medical center in chicago 
this really troubles us a lot that this has popped up now in 
three of three cases starzl said 
starzls concerns were not unanimous 
dr james w williams director of transplantation at the chicago 
hospital said last week that he intended to procede with his 
multiple organ transplant program williams has performed two 
similarly surgeons at the university of wisconsin hospital and 
clinics in madison have shown no inclination of stopping their 
intestinal transplant program 
the first person to undergo a multipleabdominal organ 
transplant a 6yearold girl lived only a few hours after starzls 
1983 operation the second patient a 17monthold boy survived 
three days in 1986 at the chicago hospital 
the string of failures is reminiscent of the early days of liver 
transplantation said starzl who performed the worlds first 
successful liver transplant in 1967 
the oneyear survival rate for liver transplant patients has 
since climbed to about 70 percent according to brian broznick 
director of the pittsburgh transplant foundation 
the only surviving multiple organ recipient 14monthold calvin 
oliveira of deerfield beach fla received a small intestine and 
liver dec 31 at the wisconsin hospital he was in critical but 
stable condition friday at the madison hospital 
organ transplants are the only option for children like calvin 
with short gut syndrome a potentially fatal intestinal deformity 
according to starzl tabatha also had short gut syndrome

japan may postpone a visit by 60 chinese war 
orphans from world war ii who are scheduled to arrive the same day 
as emperor hirohitos funeral officials said today 
the health and welfare ministry is concerned that their arrival 
on feb 24 would focus attention on world war ii tragedies while 
more than 100 foreign dignitaries take part in a state funeral for 
hirohito news reports quoted ministry officials as saying 
hirohito died of cancer one week ago at age 87 
the war orphans the offspring of japanese nationals who resided 
in northern china and manchuria during japans invasion of east 
asia were left behind as infants in the turmoil following japans 
defeat in 1945 
since 1981 about 18 groups of orphans from china have come to 
japan to search for their japanese relatives 
officials at the national olympics memorial youth center where 
the orphans would stay said the government ministry had asked them 
if the facility would be available at a later date if the visit 
originally scheduled for feb 24march 10 is postponed 
under a 1988 agreement between china and japan about 100 orphans 
are scheduled to visit this year

opec secretarygeneral subroto said 
solidarity among the cartels 13 member nations was the main reason 
for a recent rise in oil prices a saudi arabian newspaper reported 
today 
the newspaper alnadwa quoted subroto as saying in an interview 
that cooperation from nonopec oil producers along with dwindling 
stockpiles as demand rises partly because of winter also 
contributed to the increase 
solidarity of opec member states after the last opec conference 
is the most important reason for the hike but this strength 
hinges primarily on the extent of adherence to the terms of the last 
agreement subroto was quoted as saying 
middle east oil prices have risen more than 3 a barrel from a 
range of 1115 a barrel since the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries introduced a jan 1 production quota of 185 
million barrels a day 
because of a glut on the world market oil prices plunged as low 
as 10 a barrel in price swings over the past two years that rarely 
reached opecs target of an 18 benchmark price 
subroto told alnadwa the price fluctuations were caused for 
reasons within and outside opec in a reference to 
overproduction by some cartel members in defiance of the quota 
system 
it is when opec is hit by weakness and confusion that the 
stockpiles are used to aggravate the glut and this affects the 
price but that rises the minute solidarity returns he was quoted 
as saying 
subroto admitted it was hard for opec to determine the quantities 
stockpiled in order to balance the market with its output but said 
all member nations were hopeful the 18 a barrel benchmark would 
prevail 
subroto left the sultanate of oman today after holding talks with 
oil minister saeed alshanfari in advance of a jan 26 meeting in 
london where opec and nonopec producers will try to coordinate 
policy on stabilizing prices 
subroto earlier had visited egypt which along with oman is a 
nonopec producer that cooperates with the cartel

the powerful oil workers union has been left 
with a leadership vacuum after the jailing of its longtime leaders 
on homicide and weapons charges leading analysts called the arrests 
a political move 
government sources speaking on condition of anonymity have 
indicated more arrests are expected 
the arrests this week of union boss joaquin hernandez galicia and 
50 others including its secretarygeneral carried a message from 
new president carlos salinas de gotari for other unions the 
newspaper excelsior said in a frontpage column friday salinas was 
inaugurated last month 
the dramatic arrest of hernandez galicia and his closest 
associates should be seen not as a normal legal action as the 
attorney general is uselessly depicting it but as a presidential 
decision 100 percent political which is covered by a thin veil of 
legality wrote columnist lorenzo meyer of the prestigious 
colegio de mexico a graduate school and think tank 
with the fall of hernandez galicia all the labor and union 
leaders who emerged and prospered in the shadow of the state are 
placed at the disposition of the government and in quite a 
vulnerable position 
gaston garcia cantu a government supporter wrote in a column in 
excelsior its not a legal but a political problem not between 
the judicial power and the delinquents but between the old and new 
society in our country most of mexicos unions have been closely 
tied to the government 
hernandez galicia and salinas have been at odds since salinas as 
budget secretary began cutting into the 200000member unions 
control of contracts with pemex the state oil monopoly 
the union long has been known to have weapons meyer said 
the attorney generals office said 200 uzi submachine guns were 
found when soldiers and federal agents burst into hernandez 
galicias home tuesday in the northeastern city of ciudad madero and 
arrested him 
a federal agent was killed in the shootout 
the excelsior news service reported friday that the attorney 
generals office has asked interpol the international police 
agency to help find and arrest the former mayor of reynosa across 
the rio grande from mcallen texas

a canadian jewish group has asked the soviet union 
to set up an international commission to trace a swedish diplomat 
who disappeared in soviet custody after saving thousands of jews 
from the holocaust 
many believe raoul wallenberg credited with saving 103000 jews 
in world war ii is still alive in a soviet prison if so he would 
be 77 
were not confident we know everything that could be known 
david matas vice president of bnai brith canada told reporters 
friday this would be a true test of the new soviet policy of 
glasnost 
when soviet troops liberated hungary in january 1945 wallenberg 
was arrested for espionage and sent to moscow the soviets say he 
died of a heart attack in a moscow jail in 1947 but various soviet 
dissident sources have reported seeing him this decade 
matas discussed the issue friday with alexei makarov 
ministercounselor of the soviet embassy matas said makarov called 
wallenberg a hero and said he regrets what happened to him 
bnai brith asked the soviets to appoint a commission of 
historians from canada hungary israel sweden the soviet union 
and the united states the commission members would interview 
surviving witnesses review soviet archives and make a public report 
in 1944 wallenberg volunteered for a mission to save jews in 
budapest from nazi death camps and is credited with saving the jews 
from nazi death camps by giving some swedish passports putting 
others in safe houses and pleading with nazi officials to spare 
their lives 
an estimated 6 million jews were killed by the nazis during their 
193345 rule 
if wallenburg is alive he would have been in captivity 43 years

gay and lesbian groups say they will seek 
other ways to oust a judge who said he gave a lighter sentence to a 
killer partly because the victims were queers if a state 
comission doesnt take action 
the state commission on judicial conduct began its inquiry into 
state district court judge jack hampton of dallas on friday the 
11member commission of judges and private citizens meets behind 
closed doors and does not discuss pending cases 
we at this point are going to let the commission do its job 
said glen maxey executive director of the lesbian gay rights lobby 
of texas but he said the commissions secret deliberations were a 
hideous situation 
about two dozen protesters gathered outside the building where 
the commission met and called for hamptons removal from the bench 
but said should that fail they could always find other ways 
hampton a republican is up for reelection in 1990 
last month hampton said he sentenced 18yearold richard 
bednarski to 30 years in prison instead of a maximum life sentence 
because the two men he killed were homosexuals 
these two guys that got killed wouldnt have been killed if 
they hadnt been cruising the streets picking up teenage boys 
hampton told the dallas times herald 
bednarski was convicted of the murders of tommy lee trimble 34 
and john lloyd griffin 27 who were found shot to death in a dallas 
park 
i dont care much for queers cruising the streets picking up 
teenage boys ive got a teenage boy hampton told the newspaper 
his remarks sparked continuing protests from homosexual and civil 
liberties groups 
its absolutely intolerable to have a bigot use that kind of 
language when hes supposed to be in the business of dispensing 
equal justice said tom doyal who heads one of several groups 
that have filed complaints against hampton with the commission 
how can you preside and be fair to everyone if you do not have 
the same respect for all individuals said pellegrino one of the 
protesters 
the commission could dismiss the case or it could impose 
sanctions ranging from a private warning to appointment of a special 
master by the texas supreme court to conduct a removal hearing 
commission chairman william junell a judge on the houston 
appeals court said were here to do the job that the law calls 
on us to do 
hampton who was not called to appear at the meeting did not 
return telephone calls to the associated press 
the texas civil liberties union the texas human rights 
commission the national lawyers guild and the lesbian gay rights 
lobby of texas have filed complaints with the commission on the case

is competent to make his own decisions 
he will remain at southwest general hospital until he wants to 
leave donnelly said 
the judge said he will decide after the evaluation whether the 
court has jurisdiction to appoint sadlers mother as guardian 
if he is competent maybe we dont need a guardian said 
donnelly adding that sadlers 24yearold son thor would be 
allowed to visit his father 
davidson county probate judge james everett of nashville tenn 
on tuesday appointed the younger sadler as temporary guardian but 
donnelly said everett agreed friday to the psychiatric evaluation 
sadler who was shot in the head in guatemala city in september 
checked out of clevelands veterans administration hospital sunday

a court overstepped its jurisdiction in 
finding the american television series falcon crest too degenerate 
for egyptian viewers said a government lawyer who was appealing the 
case today 
if the plaintiff didnt like the series all he needed to 
do was to switch off his television set said ragaee ahmed issa 
the technical department chief of the state litigation authority 
usually shown weekly the series about a california winemaking 
estate is highly popular in this moslem country the series stars 
jane wyman and lorenzo lamas 
a court in the nile delta town of shibin elkom banned the series 
last month after lawyer mustafa hamed khalifa argued that scenes in 
falcon crest are against morality and the constitution and incite 
debauchery 
the court ordered the information ministry which controls the 
television and radio authority to stop screening the series 
television ignored the ruling on sunday it rebroadcast the last 
two episodes of the series seventh season and a day later showed 
the first episode of the new season 
issa said the litigation authority which represents the 
government in civil court cases appealed to a higher court at 
shibin elkom 
we expect to win issa said we expect the appeal court 
to rule that the ban order was outside the jurisdiction of the 
court 
disputes with the government must be litigated only in the 
cairobased administrative court issa said 
issa also objected to the ruling because the judge accepted the 
plaintiffs allegations without making an independent court 
assessment 
falcon crest began appearing several years ago and quickly gained 
popularity television censors routinely cut kissing scenes they 
consider too passionate

an attorney has moved to consolidate all the 
lawsuits filed in the crash over scotland of pan am flight 103 for 
trial in us district court in cincinnati 
stanley m chesleys motion was filed friday with the judicial 
panel on multidistrict litigation in washington which decides where 
to send cases after related lawsuits have been filed in two or more 
federal jurisdictions 
this court is set up to do it chesley said this court and 
its staff are accustomed to handling complex cases 
pan ams jet was en route to new york on dec 21 when a bomb 
exploded and the plane crashed killing all 259 aboard and 11 people 
on the ground a number of the victims were americans 
chesley urged the panel to ask chief judge carl b rubin if he or 
another judge in cincinnati would take on the trial 
it would be a challenge to prove that a court system designed 
in the 19th century to try one case at a time could adapt and handle 
something like this rubin said 
two highprofile multidistrict cases have been sent to rubin in 
recent years 
one consolidated hundreds of lawsuits filed on behalf of 
youngsters whose birth defects were blamed on the morning sickness 
pill bendectin made in reading ohio by merrell dow 
pharmaceuticals inc 
this year rubins court heard thousands of farmers lawsuits 
concering rain insurance policies they were denied last year by the

a team of visiting us legislators has 
proposed that brazil convert portions of its foreign debt payments 
to protect the amazon jungle from deforestation a foreign ministry 
spokesman said 
the spokesman ruy nogueira said the american commission made 
its proposals friday to brazilian president jose sarney during a 
private session at his official residence in brasilia 
the team composed of sens timothy wirth richard shelby john 
heinz and reps gerry sikorsky and john bryant is in brazil on a 
factfinding mission that will include visits to the western states 
of amazonas rondonia and acre 
the proposals show an increased willingness on the part of 
creditor nations to link new credit proposals with environmental 
protection packages 
nogueira said the american delegation made no official 
declarations but sketched several proposals in which brazil would 
use portions of its foreign debt payments to create environmental 
preservation projects in the western amazon 
brazil is the third worlds leading debtor nation with a foreign 
debt of 115 billion 
but in a meeting friday at the foreign ministry one government 
representative told reporters it was unreasonable to insist that 
brazil pull back its development programs in the name of protecting 
the environment 
a developing country that has to create 17 million new jobs 
per year and service debt cannot forgo the occupation of its 
territory said the subsecretary of foreign relations paulo 
tarso flecha de lima 
he said brazil is studying how best to commercially develop the 
amazon without causing widespread ecological damage 
but without debt relief from industrialized countries occupying 
the amazon in a rational manner would be difficult 
the international community must assist us with debt relief 
technical assistance and financial support said flecha de lima 
the issue of how to develop the amazon jungle an expanse of

a highranking vietnamese official arrived in 
beijing tonight for talks apparently aimed at settling the conflict 
in cambodia 
the arrival of the man believed to be vice foreign minister dinh 
nho liem marked the first time in more than nine years that 
highranking chinese and vietnamese officials will meet to discuss 
peace in southeast asia 
beijing arms guerrillas opposing vietnams occupation of cambodia 
the official was greeted by vietnamese and chinese officials at 
the old beijing airport an airstrip reserved for senior government 
officials from china and abroad 
the man then ducked into a chinese foreign ministry car which 
sped away vietnamese ambassador nguyen minh phuong followed in 
another car 
vietnamese embassy officials and chinese officials at the 
ministry of foreign affairs refused to comment on the arrival 
but liems name was on the flight log of air china flight no 974 
which flew out of bangkok today and japanese journalists reported 
seeing him at the bangkok airport 
a top cambodian resistance official said this week that china at 
the request of the soviet union agreed to its first highlevel 
talks with vietnam since late 1979 
the deal also involved the soviet union opening direct talks with 
cambodian resistance leader prince norodom sihanouk according to 
sihanouks son and representative in thailand prince norodom 
ranariddh 
ranariddh made the disclosures in a broadcast over the resistance 
radio wednesday he said either the vietnamese minister of foreign 
affairs or a vice minister would travel to china in early february 
it was not clear why vietnam and china had decided to hold the 
meeting earlier than scheduled 
thai officials said they knew about the meeting but would give no 
details 
on thursday a chinese foreign ministry spokesman li zhaoxing 
said china would consider direct talks with vietnam at an 
appropriate time he refused to elaborate 
the direct talks between china and vietnam follow the initiation 
of talks in august between china and the soviet union on the 
cambodian question a major stumbling block for improving 
longstrained ties between the moscow and beijing governments 
in the 1960s and mid70s china provided major assistance for 
north vietnams war against the united states and south vietnam 
chinas relations with vietnam have been cold since late 1978 
when vietnam toppled the prochinese khmer rouge in cambodia 
the ultraradical khmer rouge had ruled cambodia since 1975 in a 
bloody reign that left at least 1 million people dead 
beijing and vietnam fought a border war in early 1979 vice 
ministerial talks were held in may 1979 in hanoi and december in 
beijing and then cut off 
beijing now arms guerrillas opposing vietnams occupation of 
cambodia one of the guerrilla groups is the khmer rouge 
china has long said that the first step to a solution to the 
conflict in cambodia is for vietnam to withdraw its troops and had 
refused to open direct talks with hanoi until vietnam moves to end 
its decadelong occupation of cambodia in recent months signs have 
pointed to improved relations 
on jan 7 china said a vietnamese proposal to withdraw all of 
its troops from cambodia by september was a step forward 
earlier vietnam facing serious economic problems at home set a 
target of 1990 for leaving cambodia 
in a speech jan 6 heng samrin the vietnameseinstalled 
president of cambodia said vietnam would be out of cambodia by 
september if a political settlement to the conflict can be reached 
in his proposal heng said his government still wanted measures 
to prevent the khmer rouge from returning to power 
china has refused to exclude the khmer rouge from a future 
cambodian government but has said it is willing to reduce its 
assistance to the khmer rouge and other guerrillas forces as vietnam 
pulls out 
vietnam claims it has made partial troop withdrawals each year 
since 1982 but china says vietnam actually has only rotated forces 
in and out 
vietnam claims it has about 50000 troops in cambodia western 
diplomats in beijing say the actual number is far larger

presidentelect bush headed back out on 
the waters of the florida keys today on the last weekend before his 
inauguration intent on capturing what he called pound for pound 
the worlds most formidable fighting fish 
bush reeled in a 13lb bonefish on friday in his first foray 
this trip out on the everglades side of the keys and regaled 
reporters with details of the exploit today as he pulled away from a 
private dock in a police boat 
it really is excellent just wonderful said bush who is on 
his third fishing or hunting trip since his election 
the bonefish stripped off 150 yards of bushs line before he 
reeled it in took a picture and threw it back from the 17foot 
skiff the backlash that he fished from in the shallow waters 
these are pound for pound id say as fighting a fish as 
there is in the world said bush 
spotting tourists sitting on a narrow dock where reporters and 
photographers were recording his departure bush asked where they 
were from 
england replied maggie arnold a 52yearold hairdresser 
from bournemouth 
england are you said bush think margaret thatcher would 
like a little of this bonefishing action 
the british visitor called the next president fantastic 
bush said he would leave work on his inaugural speech until he 
returns to washington sunday night not here he said when i 
get back well get to more seriousness on that 
bushs 13pounder was just three pounds off the world record for 
bonefish said spokesman stephen hart 
the vice president an avid sportsman told reporters at an 
impromptu news conference after air force two landed friday at the 
airport in marathon fla that he hoped to enjoy 48 hours in 
splendid isolation to clear the mind for the decisions that 
lie ahead 
he blamed a flood of refugees from nicaragua on tyranny in 
that marxist state and he promised a hard new look at immigration 
policy to help communities in texas and florida overburdened with 
the refugees 
bush also said he is determined to focus all through my 
presidency on my determination to help get rid of chemical and 
biological weapons he said the furor over the libyan plant at 
rabta has enhanced worldwide understanding of the problem 
west german officials are now investigating a german company the 
united states believes helped libya build a plant capable of making 
poison gas 
i think the germans had a chance to analyze this evidence but 
i have never doubted chancellor helmut kohls commitment to the 
control and the elimination of chemical weapons bush said 
bushs fishing buddies including treasury secretary nicholas f 
brady sen alan simpson rwyo fred zeder a transition adviser 
dr burton lee a new york cancer doctor and irish businessman and 
raconteur alphonse obrien a local guide george hommel was 
leading the hunt from 17foot shallowwater skiffs 
the threeday vacation is his third hunting or fishing trip since 
the election but bush said he has no plans for a winter white house 
here in fact he said there will be no winter or summer white 
houses anyplace 
bush said he envisions getting to his to his ocean home in 
kennebunkport maine sometime but the president is so 
beautifully taken care of with camp david and other arrangements 
that i have no intention of building something else 
bush said he probably wont get back to the keys this winter but 
intends to fish often over the next eight years proving im one 
of the classic fishing conservationists and demonstrating my 
keen personal interests in going after the wily bonefish or the 
elusive tarpon or the redfish or the snook that may be lying up 
under that branch in the river up the everglades 
asked if he favors a ban on oil leasing in the florida keys 
bush a former oilman said what does that have to do with 
fishing 
he said he was committed both to the environment and to prudent 
development of our offshore resources the country cannot risk 
dependence on imported oil he said he said any development would 
be done with total compatibility to our marine life and to other 
environmental considerations 
bush promised he would make no news while holed up here at a 
private condominium development until sunday but he did offer one 
domestic scoop millie the family spaniel is pregnant we expect 
puppies in the white house he said

soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
promised that his nation will give afghanistans beleaguered 
government continued allaround assistance tass said today 
the official soviet news agencys report on talks between 
shevardnadze and afghan president najib appeared to indicate 
afghanistan will keep getting soviet military aid even after all 
red army troops leave the country 
shevardnadze flew friday to kabul afghanistans capital as 
soviet officials continued working for a political solution 
permitting them to withdraw their remaining 50000 soldiers by feb 
15 
soviet diplomats have hinted the red army may not complete with 
withdrawal by the deadline which was set at unbrokered 
negotiations in april 1988 
western diplomats however say the departure of soviet troops 
from afghanistan which was halted during the fall has resumed 
on friday reporters said 500 soviet soldiers laden with military 
equipment lined up before transport planes at kabul airport waiting 
to fly home 
the soviets tried but failed to involve rebels fighting najibs 
government in peace talks with government representatives rebel 
leaders say the soviets only wanted to secure a place for afghan 
marxists in a new afghan government 
shevardnadze renewed the call for peace talks during his 
discussions with najib but also clearly aligned himself with the 
afghan government the tass report indicated 
the soviet side confirmed its intention to continue playing an 
intermediary role in launching a general dialogue in afghanistan 
tass said 
the soviet side confirmed its full support for the afghan 
leaderships policies and said the soviet union will continue 
extending the republic of afghanistan allround assistance under 
treaties and agreements concluded by the two countries the news 
agency said 
since the soviets committed themselves to an afghan withdrawal 
they have transferred millions of dollars worth of armaments and 
military supplies to their afghan allies western observers say 
the afghan government and the soviets blame the guerrillas for 
continuing hostilities because they have refused to join a 
ceasefire proclaimed by najib on jan 1 
soviet troops marched into afghanistan in december 1979 to 
preside over the replacement of one marxist leader by another and 
the 100000 soldiers stayed on to prop up the government against a 
nationwide insurgency

when george carlins comedy routine on the 
seven dirty words was broadcast by a radio station in 1978 it 
prompted a us supreme court ruling on indecency 
a decade later a character on the hit network sitcom designing 
women used a derivative of one of those words in describing 
another character who was obsessed with enlarging her bosom 
no it isnt just imagination network standards are loosening up 
the networks are being more lenient and i think the reason is 
a fiveletter word cable said harry thomason executive 
producer of designing women 
sexually explicit language and situations on network television 
have produced occasional complaints but audiences are apparently 
rather blase after being presented a variety of rrated cable fare 
not to mention videocassettes ac nielsen co estimates that 622 
percent of us homes with televisions also have a vcr 
the networks faced with remotecontrol grazing cable 
options and videocassettes are having to loosen up or lose viewers 
nbc the no 1 network broadcast favorite son a political 
potboiler spiced up with scenes of sexual bondage 
in an episode of abcs thirtysomething a wife crawled around 
on the floor in search of a fumbled diaphragm 
last season saturday night live executive producer lorne 
michaels complained about his battle with network censors over a 
sketch whose purpose was to see how often actors could say the word 
for the male sex organ on network tv this season the sketch got on 
the air 
the average family in a major urban center can have access to 
30plus different television signals not to mention home video 
where they can see explicit language full nudity and simulated 
sex in far more graphic and strong ways than youve ever seen on 
network television says alan gerson nbc vice president for 
program marketing and administration 
he says networks are loosening standards but carefully keeping 
back from the cutting edge of change 
were not changing first gerson said 
do viewers mind 
i get a lot of discussion on it but really when you sit down 
and look at it and hear whats said i dont really hear anybody 
complaining said art chapman of the fort worth startelegram 
president of the television critics association 
the fact is he said whether you like it or not it does 
produce ratings which means that people are watching it 
there are three groups of viewers out there said dorothy 
swanson head of virginiabased viewers for quality television 
theres your group that would really like to see more explicit 
material they enjoy that its interesting and its entertaining 
and its fun 
then theres another group that are your prudes who really feel 
that there shouldnt be a single dirty word no openmouthed 
kissing no bedroom scenes those people are going to always object 
and they must be just screaming right about now 
and then theres the group that just accepts it and keeps their 
eye on it and turns the dial if they dont like it 
when the radio station broadcast carlins seven dirty words 
routine carlin was explaining that there are seven words not 
allowed to be broadcast a complaint to the federal communications 
commission prompted a lawsuit that led to the supreme court ruling 
the fcc does not get involved in network standards but investigates 
complaints against the stations that it licenses 
a complaint about a network show would have to meet the fccs 
definition of indecency before action would be taken indecency is 
described as patently offensive as measured by contemporary 
community standards for the broadcast medium 
for network censors community standards apply to a global 
village where a community can be a time period or a demographic 
group the changing expectations of television audiences have 
changed the stereotypical scissorwielding censor into something of 
ad hoc sociologist 
tv is a dynamic medium it has to stay in touch with society 
it has to grow as society grows and deal with subjects that are 
relevant to peoples lives said matthew margo cbs vice president 
for program practices 
i think the objective here is not to go too far its to be 
willing to grow to be willing to take prudent risks but never to 
do anything thats going to offend a significant portion of our 
viewing audience or advertisers or affiliates 
all three networks have cut back their standards and practices 
departments to save money but insist nothing has gotten on the air 
that would not have before 
the cutbacks have however increased the possibility of 
risk said alfred r schneider abc vice president for broadcast 
standards and practices because you dont have an overview and 
backup system that existed 
cbs and abc have eliminated one level of censors and put a bigger 
workload on supervisors nbc eliminated its standards and practices 
department completely reassigning most of its functions to the 
entertainment division which may be akin to the fox guarding the 
henhouse 
but nbc was no doubt chastened by its experience with geraldo 
riveras twohour special devil worship exposing satans 
underground 
though the sensationalistic special ranked no 5 in the nielsen 
ratings for the week nbc said it lost money because so many 
advertisers pulled out gerson says the show was actually a 
triumph for the remnants of the standards department in view of 
how much gruesome material was eliminated 
during a recent presentation to television critics meeting in los 
angeles nbc entertainment president brandon tartikoff was accosted 
by an actor dressed as a priest and forced to swear on a stack of 
bibles that he would not air another geraldo rivera special 
devil worship was attacked by television critics in part 
because of its early time period 8 pm est when presumably 
children could be watching in fact much of the shift in standards 
has taken place after 9 pm when networks assume mostly adults are 
watching 
an episode of nbcs 10 oclock program la law opened in the 
setting of a fertility clinic where a patient providing a sperm 
sample moaned loudly from behind a bathroom door it turned out he 
was having trouble getting the lid off the specimen jar in an 
episode of the 9 pm cheers on nbc sam the bartender was 
stranded behind a table because of his state of sexual excitement 
the standards really relate to the kind of program youre 
dealing in said schneider what may work in a 10 oclock 
program like thirtysomething would be totally inappropriate 
to an 8 oclock program 
one way standards departments have cut their workload is by 
paying less attention to such grated shows as murder she wrote 
but even designing women which often tackles sexual 
subjects has found the going easier of late said thomason whose 
wife linda bloodworththomason writes most of the scripts 
thomason said the show has had a good relationship with the 
censors but he nevertheless was surprised that the questionable 
breast word was approved the censor after seeing the script 
wanted to reserve judgment 
a lot of times if we disagree with them well say look why 
dont you let us shoot it and well shoot an alternative and see 
how its used and how it looks in the context of the show 
thomason said fortunately i dont remember a time when weve 
done that they didnt come back later and say ok we see what you 
were going for and its ok

more than one person died in a gangrelated 
killing for every day of 1988 in los angeles county said 
authorities who blamed the record number of deaths on turf and drug 
battles fought by wellarmed street hoods 
altogether there were 452 gangrelated slayings in the county 
according to statistics compiled by all area law enforcement 
agencies and released by the sheriffs department on friday 
its staggering sheriffs sgt wes mcbride said were in 
a crisis theyre still killing as fast as ever i dont see any 
indication itll go down 
theres more than one a day said vg guinses a gang 
counselor that doesnt include kids on life support or people 
handicapped or paralyzed by bullet wounds 
the slayings surpassed the previous record of 387 gangrelated 
murders reported the year before mcbride said 
earlier in the week the los angeles police department reported 
that gang slayings in its jurisdiction reached a record 257 in 1988 
compared with 205 the year before 
some authorities blamed the increased carnage on the more 
sophisticated weapons that gang members are purchasing with profits 
from illegal drug sales 
more semiautomatic militarystyle assault weapons are being 
confiscated from gang members authorities say 
i think the major factor is the weapons said los angeles 
police deputy chief william rathburn these are dangerous weapons 
theyre good for one thing killing people there are a lot of them 
out there an enormous number

six former us marines landed in vietnam 
on saturday in peace 24 years after the first american combat 
troops hit the beaches of da nang in war 
man it brought so many memories looking out at them rice 
paddies said frank noe a 40yearold firefighter from stoughton 
mass 
just seeing the children to me when i was real young here 
18 19 years old i always felt for the children and i think thats 
what brought me back here too i had a real warm feeling for all 
those people its an honesttogod feeling 
gazing at the mountains in the distance nate genna a 
41yearold maintenance man from boston thought of his days as a 
19yearold marine under fire from north vietnamese gunners hidden 
in similar mountains in south vietnam they look awfully 
familiar he said theyre not the same ones but they look the 
same 
the former marines are selfstyled unofficial ambassadors of good 
will hoping their 10day visit will bring other veterans back and 
better relations between the two countries 
as long as we can get veterans back over here to see whats 
going on here and to let the world know that these are fantastic 
wonderful people and they need help if we can get that across to 
the american people id be happy said mike wallace a 41yearold 
farmer from langdon kan 
the other former marines include gene spanos 39 a rosemont 
ill police lieutenant william johnson 41 of manchester conn 
a maker of electric signs and robert dalton a 54yearold 
freelance writer from davidsonville md 
their patrol into the past a journey to heal their own pain as 
much as to look their former foes in the eyes will take them to 
what is no more the demilitarized zone along the 17th parallel 
that once divided vietnam into north and south 
the 11th marine battalion 3rd marine division in which all of 
the men except dalton served planted about 100000 land mines to 
protect a string of us outposts along the dmz named cam lo con 
thien gio linh and dong ha 
after north vietnam defeated the south in 1975 it reunified the 
country vietnamese officials say thousands of civilians were killed 
clearing the land mines for farming and housing in postwar vietnam 
but they say all the mines are gone 
the marines are not so sure concerned that the mines are still 
causing civilian casualties they want to attempt to verify the 
vietnamese claims 
its a sense of accomplishment given a chance to come back to 
a country where we fought said spanos were looking forward to 
meeting the vietnamese soldiers 
johnson said he was unsure of himself when he arrived at hanois 
international airport as i remember vietnam you had to be 
looking over your shoulder and thats history now but still youre 
very unsure when youre going through customs everybodys in 
uniform 
his anxiety soon vanished wiped away by the charm and 
friendliness of the vietnamese children 
im glad i came said johnson 
none of us can describe what the emotion we feel is said 
wallace its different now said noe nothing wrong is 
happening

machine guns jut from the walls of col 
moammar gadhafis compound the army is building roadblocks and 
antiaircraft batteries point north toward the mediterranean in case 
the americans come again 
officials and ordinary libyans in the streets express fear of 
attack the bombshattered former french embassy in the heart of 
tripoli is a daily reminder of american ability to strike 
some diplomats say the mood reminds them of the days before the 
us air raids on tripoli and benghazi in april 1986 intended as 
punishment for libyas alleged support of international terrorism 
gadhafi speaks defiantly about the possibility of a us attack 
but the diplomats believe he has genuine fear of one 
they said gadhafi believes the decision has been made to attack a 
plant at rabta 60 miles outside tripoli and other targets the 
americans say the plant is to manufacture chemical weapons libya 
says it will make pharmaceuticals 
a western diplomat said his first impression had been that libyan 
officials were not really worried that their talk about the 
american menace was for domestic consumption later after talking 
with them day after day i became convinced they are really scared 
he and the others spoke on condition their names not be revealed 
in downtown tripoli heavy machine guns manned by soldiers in 
olive fatigues rested on the white walls 25 feet high around the 
leaders fortified compound diplomats said the number of guns had 
been increased 
camouflaged tanks and antiaircraft batteries were positioned in 
a line of trees behind a high brown wall a few blocks from the 
compound 
reporters taken by bus to the desert southwest of tripoli near 
the rabta plant saw surfacetoair missiles aimed northward toward 
the sea radar scanned from a barren ridge and troops manned 
roadblocks on the highways 
one diplomat said the army might be keeping tabs on dissident 
moslem fundamentalists returning from tunisia and sudan but another 
said roadblocks were common in tense times and these could be linked 
to the fear of attack 
they seem to be afraid the americans could pop up in a jeep 
somewhere along the highway said an envoy from western europe 
i dont know why they think a roadblock could catch a convoy of 
american troops 
european and arab diplomats say libya has asked their governments 
repeatedly in the past few weeks to use their influence with the 
americans 
some feel the momentum of accusation and tension between the 
united states and libya will be difficult to stop a european said 
for example that washington had maneuvered itself into a 
difficult position by talking so loudly 
several europeans expressed the belief president reagan was 
obsessed with gadhafi 
every american president has his own favorite top enemy one 
said for reagan it is gadhafi although i cant imagine anybody 
really takes gadhafi seriously as a no 1 enemy 
they agreed the libyan leader could be counted on to play into 
reagans hands with bluster and threats of terrorist reprisal as 
one put it gadhafi is the worst spokesman for his country 
despite all this the europeans said they felt gadhafi was 
serious in requesting direct negotiations with the incoming 
administration of george bush they also said more moderate members 
of his government were encouraging such proposals 
people in the government believed that the policy of 
confrontation in the mind of gadhafi would lead to disaster one 
said 
in the past year libya has tried to improve relations with 
europe and its north african neighbors according to the diplomats 
most shops and cafes in tripoli were closed a year ago now they 
are open although poorly supplied 
a few blueandwhite sack dresses from tunisia hung in a clothing 
store the next window held a sparse display of faucets and other 
plumbing supplies cans of pepsicola rested on nearly empty cafe 
shelves 
libyans now can talk and travel more freely but diplomats and 
others said the slight liberalization has created problems for 
gadhafi they said a growing more organized opposition worries him 
and there are signs of greater activism among moslem fundamentalists 
the moslem brotherhood a fundamentalist group the government 
says tried to overthrow gadhafi in 1984 has held demonstrations at 
al fateh university in tripoli antigadhafi slogans appeared on 
campus walls recently but were painted over quickly said a source 
associated with professors at al fateh 
european diplomats say gadhafi remains the only powerful man in 
libya and will allow only so much openness and dissent before 
cracking down 
the reforms can only go so far only what he can control one 
said then he will put a stop to it

nato and the sovietled warsaw pact agreed 
today to hold new talks to reduce conventional forces in europe 
diplomats said the agreement came after greece and turkey settled a 
territorial dispute 
negotiators from the worlds two most powerful military alliances 
initialed the agreement calling for the new arms talks said a 
western diplomat who attended the closeddoor session he spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
diplomats also prepared to sign a landmark human rights accord 
later today that was informally accepted friday by the east and west 
blocs and 12 neutral nations resolution of the greeceturkey 
dispute paved the way for the signing 
us secretary of state george shultz and soviet foreign minister 
eduard shevardnadze will join 33 other foreign ministers at a 
threeday meeting starting tuesday to wind up the 35nation 
helsinki review conference 
one western diplomat said the greekturkish dispute was resolved 
after lastminute telephone calls between vienna and the turkish 
capital ankara 
another western envoy also speaking on condition of anonymity 
indicated the dispute was settled after the soviet union and three 
unidentified nato countries submitted letters to turkey their 
content was not disclosed 
the arms talks dubbed the negotations on conventional armed 
forces in europe could start as early as march diplomats say 
the call for the talks will be included in a 35nation agreement 
designed to ensure freedom of religion and travel by citizens of 
east bloc nations and to boost eastwest contacts at all levels 
the greekturkish dispute over a strategic corner of turkish 
territory close to the border with syria had threatened to unravel 
both the call for new eastwest arms talks and the helsinki 
conference accord 
the balkan nations deadlocked over the possible inclusion of a 
strategic region of turkey the eastern mediterranean port of 
mersin in the new arms talks on reducing conventional forces in 
europe 
greece insisted that the port be included in those talks athens 
had insisted that mersin is a key port for shipping supplies to 
northern cyprus which is controlled by turkey 
it was not immediately clear how the two nations had reached a 
compromise on their dispute but the compromise reportedly put off 
the question of whether mersin would be included in the new talks 
western diplomats have praised the human rights accord which 
contains landmark provisions on human rights including enhanced 
religious freedoms clearer regulations on travel and emigration 
from the east bloc more freedom of information and an end to the 
abuse of psychiatry 
western diplomats also hailed as a triumph the achievement for 
the first time of a mechanism allowing helsinki signatory states to 
raise human rights affairs with one another 
the 1975 helsinki final act was signed by the soviet union the 
united states canada and all european nations except albania 
many of its human rights provisions have been violated in the 
past by the east bloc western diplomats noted the new vienna 
accords had been made possible by the recent reforms in the soviet 
union but stressed the test would come in whether the easts 
communist nations adhere to it 
human rights are to be discussed at annual followup conferences 
in paris this summer in copenhagen next year and in moscow in 1991 
the moscow conference was disputed into the last weeks of the 
helsinki review forum the united states and britain eventually 
agreed to go but only if soviet reforms continue and are 
institutionalized

the smoot marks are vanishing from the 
massachusetts avenue bridge and the 30year legacy of oliver r 
smoot jr and his fraternity brothers may soon be just another mit 
legend 
theres no item in our contract concerning the replacement of 
smoots said ed mcinnis superintendent for modern continental 
construction co the general contractor on the bridge repair job 
late one night in october 1958 members of lambda chi alpha at 
massachusetts institute of technology used smoot to blaze a new 
trail in distance measurement and fraternity prankdom 
smoots 5feet7 frame was manhandled length by length to 
measure the distance of the span crossing the charles river which 
is also known as the harvard bridge the idea was to let strollers 
know how far they had to go 
the fraternity brothers painted smootmarks on the bridge walkway 
10 smoots 20 smoots and so on reporting that the distance 
they measured was 3644 smoots plus one ear 
successive fraternity members have repainted the smoots twice a 
year but the work to replace the cracked and corroded bridge has 
already destroyed the smoots on the bridges west sidewalk if the 
repair timetable goes as expected the east smoots will be gone by 
fall 
the construction crew says the remaining smoots could be saved if 
someone foots the bill labor steward henry troville said the smoots 
could be cut out of the old concrete and implanted in the new 
but he didnt think much of that idea saying the 60 or so coats 
of paint make the smoot lines very slippery ive seen many 
bicyclists brought down by the smoots he told the boston globe 
smoot now 48 an executive vice president of a washingtonbased 
computer and business equipment association said he is optimistic 
about the ultimate fate of the smoot 
he said there may be a future for a microsmoot or a kilosmoot 
i understand that the yard got its start as the length of the 
kings arm and the inch was the width of a knuckle he said 
but there is a move among students to resmoot the rebuilt 
bridge using the originals son stephen r smoot 21 an mit 
junior he has not yet committed himself to the project 
the junior smoot also cautioned that his height 5feet11 would 
result in a different calibration 
but resmooting the bridge would correct an error the original 
group overlooked a bridge section that spans storrow drive on the 
boston side of the river 
so they were off by approximately 2687 smoots give or take an 
ear mcinnis said

the flagdraped casket of an american pilot killed in 
the 1986 bombing raid on libya was put aboard a us air force 
transport plane that left for the united states today a day after 
libya released the body 
us embassy spokesman mark dillen said the body was identified 
friday night as that of air force maj fernando ribasdominicci who 
died during the raid on libya in the early hours of april 15 1986 
dillen said the plane was headed for a us military base at 
dover del the hometown of the pilot who was 33 at his death is 
utuado puerto rico 
during a brief ceremony at the military airport us ambassador 
maxwell rabb and charge daffaires james f creagan placed hand over 
heart as six marines carried the casket past them to a c141 
aircraft rabb is ambassador to italy and creagan is assigned to the 
vatican 
dillen said he did not know why the libyans said the body they 
flew to rome on friday was that of capt paul lorence 31 of san 
francisco the other airman aboard the f111 
ansa the italian news agency today quoted an italian forensic 
expert who helped identify the body as saying the identification 
was made possible on the basis of the comparision of teeth with 
documents provided by us authorities three italian and three 
american medical experts conducted the examination said ansa 
the bomber was the only plane lost in the raids on tripoli 
libyas capital and benghazi another coastal city 
libyan authorities in what they called part of humanitarian 
initiatives presented the body to the vatican on friday in the 
rubble of the former headquarters of libyan leader moammar gadhafi 
a target in the raid according to libyas jana news agency the 
tripoli site never was rebuilt 
ribasdominiccis body was flown by military aircraft to rome 
where italian authorities took possession of the goldtrimmed white 
coffin in a simple ceremony at ciampino airport a libyan soldier in 
green fatigues gently laid a wreath of red flowers atop the casket 
before italian air force officers carried it to a mortuary van 
the gesture came during a period of international debate over a 
libyan plant that the united states says can produce chemical 
weapons and nine days after us fighters shot down two libyan jets 
over the mediterranean us officials said the libyan fighters 
acted in a threatening manner libya claimed the planes were unarmed 
and were downed in a premeditated attack 
jana monitored in rome and london said us fighter planes 
buzzed a libyan airlines plane flying to istanbul on tuesday the 
pentagon said it had no information about the incident 
in washington state department spokesman charles redman welcomed 
the return of the remains and said the action was part of libyas 
humanitarian obligations 
gadhafi was quoted as saying in a dec 24 dispatch that he was 
returning the body especially since this occasion coincides with 
the end of the rule of the reagan administration 
reagan ordered the 1986 attack in retaliation for what he called 
libyas support for terrorists 
the other 17 us air force bombers involved in the raid returned 
safely after dropping about 100 tons of bombs on the cities

elliott abrams returns to private life next 
week after 3 tumultuous years as president reagans top aide for 
latin america and much of the citys foreign policy establishment 
is abuzz over the question of who will succeed him 
outside the cabinet itself few presidential appointments have 
generated more interest and curiosity about who presidentelect bush 
will select for what is widely regarded as one of the toughest jobs 
in government 
the job carries an imposing title assistant secretary of state 
for interamerican affairs a spacious paneled office on the sixth 
floor of the state department and enough headaches to keep a 
mediumsized pharmaceutical company in business the task involves 
dealing with issues ranging from drugs to debt in 33 hemispheric 
countries 
the bush transition team is said by several sources to have 
reduced the list of candidates to replace abrams to five four of 
whom are foreign service officers 
the only nondiplomat is robert helander 67 a new york lawyer 
who has had a longtime association with rockefeller family business 
interests in latin america 
but state department officials said helanders prospects seemed 
to fade when he left an unfavorable impression on capitol hill 
staffers during getacquainted sessions earlier this month 
the other candidates said to be on bushs short list for abrams 
job are 
deane hinton ambassador to costa rica and a former ambassador 
to el salvador one of his strengths is knowledge of economic issues 
facing the hemisphere 
everett briggs ambassador to honduras who dealt with central 
american issues at the state department during the early reagan 
years he also was ambassador to panama 
john negroponte a former ambassador to honduras who serves as 
deputy to national security adviser colin powell some conservatives 
oppose his appointment contending his support for the nicaraguan 
contras is only lukewarm 
craig johnstone a former ambassador to algeria who was the top 
adviser on central america under abrams predecessor tony motley 
johnstone has been actively pursuing the assistant secretary post 
and has told friends he will leave the foreign service if the job 
goes to someone else he also has detractors in the conservative 
camp 
much of the interest in the identity of abrams successor stems 
from the uncertainty about the course bush will follow on the two 
dominant hemispheric issues central america and latin americas 
420 billion foreign debt 
bush is expected to pursue a policy of continuity in most areas 
of the world but he is considered by most experts as likely to try 
new directions on latin policy 
the air of uncertainty has been fueled by the almost total 
absence of discussion about central america particularly nicaragua 
since well before the fall presidential election campaign 
once an issue of highest priority for the administration reagan 
made no mention of nicaragua or central america in his summation 
this past week of his eight years in office 
abrams in a speech thursday about the reagan legacy in latin 
america gave only a passing reference to nicaragua and did not 
mention the contras at all 
bush will take office with the bulk of the contra force stationed 
at camps inside the honduran border surviving on usdonated food 
and other humanitarian supplies congress cut off military aid last 
february and bush has left unclear what plans he has for the contras 
some transition team members have indicated privately that the 
new administration may open talks with the sandinista government a 
clear break with the reagan policy of giving managua the diplomatic 
cold shoulder 
one possible option for bush would be to abandon the reagan goal 
of seeking a democratic outcome in nicaragua and instead seek an 
accommodation with the sandinistas in return for promises of a 
reduced sovietbloc role there 
on the debt question bush has left the impression he will seek 
new approaches that will have the effect of easing latin repayment 
obligations

an airline apologized to a double amputee 
passenger after employees put him on a baggage dolly like a sack 
of potatoes verbally abused him in front of other passengers and 
treated him so roughly that at one point they pulled off his pants 
fred hankin 66 had a firstclass ticket aboard a pan american 
airlines flight on jan 9 from his former home in new york to san 
jose 
but hankin was so mistreated by airline personnel that his 
nostalgic trip home became a memory of bitter humiliation said his 
daughter sheila byers of san carlos 
its hard to believe that people could be so insensitive and we 
will take whatever measures are needed said pan am official 
gustavo serrano who acknowledged that hankin was mistreated by 
employees 
hankin had both his legs amputated at the groin because of a 
circulation problem he developed in the army he has no tailbone and 
no hips so balancing in a chair without help is difficult for him 
his daughter said 
but despite special arrangements made prior to the trip hankin 
ran into trouble byers said 
after transferring to an alternate flight because of a sixhour 
delay hankin was placed on a baggage cart like a sack of 
potatoes and wheeled onto the plane where he waited 45 minutes as 
other passengers stared at him byers said 
when byers protested the lack of firstclass seating she said 
she was told by the gate agent if hes that sick he shouldnt be 
on a plane he should be in a hospital 
after a passenger offered hankin his seat near the more roomy 
bulkhead an airline employee transferred him in such a way that his 
pants fell off byers said 
and when byers explained that she needed a seat next to her 
father to help him use a handheld urinal she said the agent 
ordered the rest of the crew if she opens her mouth again i want 
her kicked off the plane 
serrano said pan am would offer hankin compensation but he did 
not elaborate

a month after his kidnappers said they 
would kill him the fate of marine lt col william r higgins who 
turns 44 on sunday remains a mystery 
the last word on the american kidnapped in south lebanon 11 
months ago came dec12 when his proiranian shiite moslem captors 
said they had sentenced him to death for spying for israel 
no body has been found 
the organization for the oppressed on earth which claimed 
responsibility for higgins abduction has also claimed 
responsibility for kidnapping 12 lebanese jews since 1984 and has 
said it killed eight of them four bodies have been found 
however a shiite source familiar with the thinking of 
proiranian factions said he did not believe higgins has been slain 
hes too valuable a card to be wasted said the source 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
hes an american officer who had held sensitive posts in the 
united states he also served with the united nations this makes 
him an american national security interest and an international 
interest the source said 
higgins is one of 15 foreigners including nine americans held 
hostage in lebanon the hostage held longest is american journalist 
terry anderson chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press who was kidnapped march 16 1985 
higgins of danville ky led a 76man un military observer 
group monitoring the lebanonisrael border when he was kidnapped 
feb 17 1988 
two days later the organization of the oppressed on earth issued 
a statement claiming the abduction and charging that higgins spied 
for the satanic cia 
the united states and the un interim force in lebanon to which 
higgins observer group was attached denied he was a spy 
the kidnappers originally said they would release higgins if 
israel withdrew from territory it occupies in south lebanon if all 
lebanese and palestinians held by israel and its militia allies were 
freed and if the united states halted alleged involvement in 
efforts to crush a palestinian uprising in israelioccupied 
territories 
five days after the kidnapping the group released a 70second 
videotape of higgins in which he repeated his captors demands 
on feb25 about 10000 people demonstrated in moslem west beirut 
chanting death to higgins 
the proiranian group hezbollah believed to be the parent 
organization for shiite factions holding most of hostages declared 
its support for higgins kidnapping april 11 
hezbollahs chief spokesman sheik ibrahim elamin told a beirut 
news conference that higgins was not kidnapped but detained 
we havent been involved in his detention but we support it 
he said 
in a statement april 21 the kidnappers dropped their offer to 
free higgins and said he would be stand trial for the crimes he 
has committed 
it accused him of taking part in american conspiracies 
against moslems and supervising a pentagon team to combat lebanese 
and palestinian islamic organizations 
the organization of the oppressed on earth said in a statement 
issued in december we have issued the irrevocable sentence to 
execute this american spy

on interstate 80 on christmas eve have been returned to a couple by 
a state roads worker who tracked them down through a department 
store label 
michael and julianne wiegel of lafayette colo lost the 
christmas presents as they drove through nebraska but did not 
discover the gifts were missing until they arrived at the home of 
relatives in wisconsin 
i was in tears mrs wiegel said at that point i figured 
a nebraska wheat farmer probably would find them in his field next 
spring 
david luusua a maintenance worker for the nebraska roads 
department found the packages that same day strewn along the 
shoulder of interstate 80 about a mile west of the platte river 
bridge between omaha and lincoln 
jerry johnson maintenance office supervisor said the workers 
called the state patrol but no one claimed the gifts over the next 
week or so johnson then began some detective work 
some of the packages had skidded on the pavement and i noticed 
the wrapping on one had torn johnson said i saw a label on one 
of the boxes from a department catalog store and it was addressed to 
a lady in lafayette colo 
johnson said he called the woman and told her what he had found 
and she identified them 
i was really surprised mrs wiegel said

tass said today the story it ran about six men 
rescued from a collapsed building 35 days after the armenian 
earthquake may have been a hoax 
on thursday the official news agency quoted aikaz akopyan 50 
as saying he and five other men were rescued wednesday after 
surviving on canned goods in a building that collapsed in leninakan 
during the dec 7 earthquake 
on friday tass reported it could not confirm akopyans story 
and today the news agency said akopyans sister indicated the story 
was made up to get akopyan into a good hospital in yerevan the 
capital of armenia 
however tass said akopyan was sticking to his story that 
doctors could not rule it out and that reporters were still 
checking details of the case 
tass said akopyan had threatened to jump out the window of his 
hospital room if journalists continued to question him about his 
story and that doctors were taking the threat seriously 
reporters of the armenian news agency armenpress found akopyans 
sister julietta who allegedly had met him as he was rescued 
wednesday but then disappeared tass said 
at first the sister denied being related to akopyan but then 
admitted that she took aikaz to the yerevan hospital and that he 
indeed is her brother it follows from her words that aikaz turned 
to her on jan 6 with a request to take him to a good yerevan 
hospital tass said 
along the road to yerevan the legend of being saved after 35 
days was supposedly thought up tass said 
none of the other five people who allegedly were trapped in the 
basement of a ninestory apartment building with akopyan have been 
found 
officials gave up hope weeks ago of finding more survivors in the 
dec 7 quake which killed 25000 people they began bulldozing the 
ruins in leninakan and other cities to prevent decaying bodies from 
spreading disease 
tass said today that professor gurgen badanyan a leading soviet 
internal medicine specialist believed akopyan had been suffering 
from chronic lung and heart deficiencies for at least several years 
akopyan was initially reported to be suffering from pneumonia 
a psychiatric exam indicated that akopyan is not mentally ill 
but doctors observed that he mixed up some facts including the names 
of children and the number of people who were trapped with him 
doctors think this is possible as a result of strong 
psychological stress we decided to ask him a direct question is he 
really telling the truth akopyan said yes and in a rather 
mixedup way repeated his first version tass correspondents 
kirill dibrova and alexander shchglenko wrote 
they said doctors do not reject the theoretical possibility 
that akopyan had spent a month trapped in the basement 
it added that today akopyan told doctors that if journalists do 
not leave him in peace he will throw himself out the window it 
said doctors consider this threat fully possible

festival and washington is celebrating as usual as if fridays 
inauguration were for the first president and not the 41st 
well maybe not the first george washington after all took the 
oath in new york city and did so without pageantry the founding 
fathers wanted to avoid any semblance of european monarchy and kept 
the ceremony as spartan as bushs 200 years later will be 
elaborate 
even bush who intends to wear a regular business suit for his 
oathtaking on the capitols west portico on friday confessed he is

an army parachute demonstration music by the gatlin brothers and 
the beach boys and a fireworks finale also are on the program 
the opening spectacle is one of at least nine free events 
sponsored by the inaugural committee an unprecedented number even

the public pays a share congress appropriated 750000 to cover 
part of the cost of the friday ceremony on the capitol grounds and

million in tax money is earmarked for the armed forces inaugural 
committee which is organizing various military contributions 
including marching bands chauffeurs for dignitaries and security 
and traffic control about 8500 members of the armed forces will be 
involved 
given tolerable weather an estimated 150000 people are expected 
to flock to the capitol in winters chill for bushs oathtaking and 
inaugural address friday tickets dispensed free of charge by 
members of congress will be required for all but the mostdistant 
spots planners have their fingers crossed reagans second 
swearingin in 1985 had to be moved inside and his parade was 
canceled when temperatures plummeted below 10 degrees 
already with smaller events still being added on a daily basis 
bushs inauguration schedule is nearly as long as the list of 
arrivals at national airport more than 70 events ranging from 
state receptions to a prayer service at national cathedral on 
sunday have been coordinated with the inaugural committee and 
scores of other independent shindigs are planned including the 
usual array of counterinaugural parties for critics of the new

blue is back brown is down and the california 
look come jan 20 will be passe 
the inauguration of george bush brings much more than a change in 
government its the launch of a whole new look a look that is 
prompting sighs of relief among graying women larger than size 4 and 
mens clothing retailers who never met a brown suit they liked 
barbara bush is keeping her inaugural outfits a secret at least 
until the last minute 
but a few things are certain her favorite color is blue so 
farewell to scarlet the color so identified with nancy reagan that 
reporters wore it to press conferences in an effort to attract her 
husbands attention 
farewell too to designer adolfo another favorite of mrs 
reagan mrs bush an unabashed size 12 prefers bill blass and 
arnold scassi diane dickinson and adele simpson shes having 
several designers put together her inaugural wardrobe 
theres no doubt in my mind that shell look spectacular from 
head to toe but it will be a different style from nancy reagan 
said mrs bushs spokeswoman sondra haley shell have her own 
style 
when he takes his oath of office on the capitol steps 
presidentelect bush will be wearing a business suit possibly a 
dark oxford gray number he purchased within the last two weeks from 
arthur a adler a mens store a few blocks from the white house 
size 42 long alterations on the sleeves and cuffs 
vice presidentelect dan quayle also bought a couple of suits 
from adler last week one navy blue the other a navy stripe if 
i were to guess i would say the solid navy for the swearingin 
said store manager david sheftell 
no browns no tans these gentlemen know what colors do the 
most for them and thats why theyre sticking with the blues and 
grays sheftell added ronald reagans penchant for brown didnt 
do much for sheftell 
mr reagan never got away from the california look sheftell 
said gingerly bush is a traditional dresser which stems back 
from his time at yale we used to call it ivy league he smiled 
anticipating a resurgence in sales 
bush and reagan wore traditional tails to the swearingin in 
1981 but they shifted to business suits in 1985 bush is more 
comfortable in a business suit said spokeswoman alixe glen 
also all of the members of congress are going to be dressed in 
suits as well he didnt want to feel overdressed 
washingtons tony boutiques and department stores are in an 
inaugural merchandising frenzy their buntingdraped windows filled 
with crisp tuxedos bright fullskirted gowns and sparkling 
rhinestone evening bags 
people are buying long dresses very elaborate a lot of full 
skirts bright colors as well as black its been pretty hectic 
said renee rizik part owner of riziks a downtown specialty store 
in the heart of the power shopping district 
any changes from 1985 theres more of a range this time she 
said referring to purchase prices last time they were mainly very 
expensive 
gowns were on sale for halfprice at the elizabeth arden salon 
across the street from riziks black sequins emerald taffeta red 
velvet white satin full skirts tight bodices spaghetti straps 
no straps some of them 1500 after reduction 
the sales are in timing with the balls which makes it easier 
on everybody said saleswoman peggy oconnor theyre buying 
bright colors because its a happy time reds and blues 
for those who dont have 1500 to blow on a ball gown joanna 
doniger has opened a temporary branch of her new york establishment 
one night stand at a suburban holiday inn the room is lined with 
gowns she brought 250 to rent for one night only at prices ranging 
from 175 to 350 necklaces go for 20 earrings for 10 
people are dressing up much more than they were 10 years ago 
but who wants to go out and spend a couple of thousand dollars for a 
dress doniger asked airily between appointments we probably 
see about 20 people a day we can always fit people in as long as we 
know they are coming 
one night stand may be a godsend for society tyros but the more 
traditional couture customers are frequenting their usual haunts 
places like neimanmarcus a week before the balls the uptown 
branch of the fancy department store had sold 100 gowns and was 
anticipating an additional five or 10 sales to lastminute shoppers 
were selling a very full ball type of gown said public 
relations manager juana stockwell a lot of people thought it the 
bush inauguration would be more understated but we havent really 
seen a change 
neimanmarcus has developed a 1200 pair of shoes called the 
stars and stripes shoe a white satin silk pump covered with pave 
rhinestones in red white and blue configured in stars and stripes 
stockwell said only one pair had been sold by a branch in texas 
another inaugural special also going begging was a 47000 
eagle brooch encrusted with gems this would be perfect for 
barbara bush said stockwell it really would because of the 
eagle and although its all precious jewels its an understated 
piece she likes the understated type of jewelry and its really 
elegant 
are you listening mr presidentelect

university counsel cliff k travis says he will review the 
request when he gets copies of wills and documents that establish a 
line of succession for the scholarship 
raper a 1988 graduate of owen valley high school in spencer is 
majoring in business at indiana a state university that was founded 
in 1820 
his mother nancy raper said last week she has the documents 
travis says he needs and threatened to sue the university if the 
scholarship is not honored 
mrs raper said she has known about the scholarship since she was 
a little girl but considered the piece of paper as just a curiosity 
until a year ago previous generations of abels descendants either 
didnt go to school or included no sons the scholarship specifies 
male descendants because women were not admitted to the school back 
when it was created 
mrs raper said when her mother died a year ago and her son was 
making plans to attend indiana the significance of the scholarship 
hit her she consulted a lawyer and decided to follow up on it 
its something that my greatgreatgreat grandfather purchased 
in the belief that his heirs would be taken care of she said 
he was a supporter of the university and im sure 100 helped 
tremendously at that time 
if the validity of the scholarship has to be decided in court 
travis says it would be the first time 
he said similar requests have come up a few times over the 
decades but for at least 40 years they have been rejected for 
instate residents on the basis of a university ruling that 
technically nobody from indiana pays tuition only fees 
outofstate residents are eligible for partial scholarships the 
difference between instate fees and whatever the total charged 
to outofstate residents is the ruling stated 
whether that definition will be applied in rapers case in order 
to disqualify him is what university officials are trying to decide 
but mrs raper said her greatgreatgreat grandfather would not 
have purchased a perpetual scholarship if it were only intended to 
pay outofstate tuition 
i just cant understand why hed purchase something that would 
be no good to him she said

to pay sothebys auction house interest on nearly 1 million worth 
of jewelry for which he has not yet paid as well as attorneys fees

a man who tried to help an elderly couple 
jumpstart their car has been awarded 65 million in punitive 
damages for injuries he suffered when the battery exploded 
the jurys action friday against johnson controls inc the 
manufacturer of sears diehard batteries raised to 97 million the 
total damages awarded to gary jones 34 and his wife mona of 
redding

and the distributor sears roebuck amp co inc liable for 32 
million in general damages the general damages covered jones 
injuries medical costs and lost wages

jones a former banquet chef tried to help an elderly couple 
jumpstart their car in june 1986 across the street from the la 
jolla campus of the university of california at san diego 
jones testified during the sixweek trial that as soon as the 
engine turned over the sears diehard battery exploded 
i was blown from the car and i screamed for someone to call an 
ambulance said jones who lost an eye and suffers seizures 
an attorney for the couple harvey levine said he hoped johnson 
controls would recall the batteries or at least warn customers of 
the jumpstart danger 
the design of the battery was changed in 1985

thirtyfive years after a young martin 
luther king jr stepped up to the pulpit at dexter avenue baptist 
church aging members of his congregation carry on the activist 
spirit he fostered 
the redbrick building situated a block from the alabama capitol 
looks much as it did the day he arrived the worn dark pews are the 
same ones members sat in to hear kings sermons only cushions have 
been added 
the rev murray branch the current pastor said physical 
appearances are not the only things that remain unchanged at the 
church now known as the dexter avenue king memorial baptist church 
and recognized in 1974 as a national historic landmark 
king who would have turned 60 sunday came to dexter avenue in 
the fall of 1954 at age 25 on dec 2 1955 blacks went to his 
church to organize the montgomery bus boycott often regarded as a 
starting point for the civil rights movement 
branch said that kind of activist spirit which dates back to 
the churchs founding in 1877 still exists in the congregation 
the church is a meeting place for social activists and its work 
extends into africa where the congregation supports missionary work 
king would be pleased to some extent because we have increased 
substantially in our benevolent work branch said in an interview 
last week he said a constant stream of people comes to the 
church in need of help 
hardly a week passes that we do not get appeals and many are 
white said branch who taught at morehouse college in atlanta 
while king was a student 
but zelia evans who remembers kings first sermons said he 
would not be satisfied he would think we were not doing enough 
she said 
on monday the national holiday marking kings birthday a noon 
service featuring speakers and singing is expected to attract scores 
of visitors on sunday congregants will remember their former 
pastor with a quieter service 
branch said dexter avenue baptist had about 460 members in kings 
day but that number has dwindled to about 250 
robert nesbitt a member of the church committee looking for a 
new pastor had heard about king from a friend while in atlanta 
king had planned to go to chattanooga tenn to preach but nesbitt 
persuaded him to come to dexter avenue mrs evans said 
he was young and energetic in fact one of the members said 
why did mr nesbitt bring us that boy to preach here but we found 
out he was much more than a boy she said 
members knew they had a good preacher in king but we didnt 
know how special he was mrs evans said 
king remained at dexter avenue through 1960 when the demands of 
the civil rights movement required his full attention some of the 
programs king instituted at dexter avenue baptist still are in 
place such as his month clubs in which members sharing birthdates 
in the same month get together for service projects 
branch disagreed with assessments that king built dexter avenue 
baptist or vice versa kings personality dictated his destiny 
branch said adding he was headed this direction growing up at 
ebenezer baptist church in atlanta 
and branch said the church exhibited a keen social conscience 
long before king as early as the late 1800s when news accounts 
indicate it provided assistance for disaster victims in central 
america

the last president to hold an open house was william howard taft 
80 years ago but the most memorable occasion was in 1829 when 
thousands of tennessee frontiersmen and indian fighters in muddy 
boots followed one of their own andrew jackson right into the 
white house many stood on the pastel upholsteries of fine damask 
and satin just to get a better view others shattered china and 
glassware after too much refreshment 
most new presidents of course would prefer that their 
inaugurals be remembered not for the whirlwind of celebration but 
for their calls to the nations conscience those ringing words of 
wisdom to set america on an ever brighter course but there have 
been more thuds than rings especially in this century 
still the nation embraces with special fondness the words of 
franklin delano roosevelt to a depressionstricken country in 1933 
the only thing we have to fear is fear itself and then there 
were those of a democrat from massachusetts who unlike michael 
dukakis managed to defeat an incumbent vice president for the white 
house ask not said john kennedy 
bush probably will have his moments but first he may want 
simply to take in the view the departing tenant ronald reagan 
put it this way by way of defining the job bush has had the last 
eight years the vice presidency is described by an old rule 
of dogsledding only the lead dog gets a change of scenery

secretary of state george p shultz will embark 
on his last overseas trip sunday a visit to vienna to wind up a 
35nation human rights conference and set the stage for eastwest 
arms control talks 
while in the austrian capital shultz also will hold a 32nd and 
final meeting with soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
shultz plans to return to washington on tuesday after making a 
speech to the conference he will leave office three days later to 
be succeeded by james a baker iii assuming senate confirmation 
and fly home to palo alto calif 
the trip had been on hold until greece and turkey settled a 
dispute over how much turkish territory would be included in arms 
control negotiations between the north atlantic treaty organization 
and the warsaw pact 
in 6 years shultz 68 has flown more than 1 million miles on 
diplomatic missions on this one he will spend about 18 hours in the 
air and about 32 hours on the ground 
the vienna conference has run for 27 months its windup first was 
delayed until the reagan administration was satisfied with the 
reforms the soviet union had made in human rights the release of 
more than 600 political prisoners reunification of more than 100 
divided families and a nineyear high in jewish emigration met the 
us test 
as a result shultz recommended and president reagan approved the 
holding of another human rights review in moscow in 1991 and the 
closing down of the vienna conference 
shultz and shevardnadze both instrumental in the improvement in 
ussoviet relations will discuss preparations for the arms 
control talks and probably the scheduled feb 15 completion of a 
soviet troop withdrawal from afghanistan 
the united states was not directly involved in the dispute 
between greece and turkey but worked behind the scenes for a 
resolution yuri dubinin the soviet ambassador to washington 
called on shultz late thursday to discuss the situation

here is the text of president reagans radio 
address saturday 
my fellow americans over the years ive greatly enjoyed this 
opportunity to get together with you and report on the weeks events 
here in washington but next week after witnessing the inauguration 
of george bush as president nancy and i will head back to the 
ranch and we go with full hearts with best wishes for george and 
barbara and with gratitude to all of you its been a privilege to 
serve the people and the nation weve always loved and love so much 
today 
its difficult of course to put all of the events of eight busy 
tumultuous years in perspective in fact thats best left to the 
impartial judgment of history but as i look back over these 
saturday talks i cant help but think about how often at moments 
of accomplishment and triumph as well as crisis and heartbreak we 
came together in this way a president giving his accounting to 
those under our system of government to whom he is accountable we 
shared a great deal together for me its been a special 
relationship believe me saturdays will never seem the same ill 
miss you 
but you know somehow messages of farewell leavetaking and 
nostalgia dont quite capture my mood today dont get me wrong 
weve had great years and done much together the economy is 
booming longfestering social problems like drugs crime have 
declined and our educational standards are being dealt with and 
for the first time in the postwar era the soviet menace shows some 
signs of relenting this last development is of course so 
heartening to those of us whove lived through all the brooding 
terrors of the postwar era were prayerful and hopeful hopeful 
that the next generation of americans will not have to contend as 
we did with the nightmares of nuclear terror and totalitarian 
expansionism 
you know shortly after world war ii and the struggle against 
nazi germany winston churchill looked with grave concern and 
sadness at a world that evolved so quickly as he put it from 
triumph and tragedy but then as he began to detect the vigor and 
resolve of america against the soviet menace and for freedom in 
europe and everywhere in the world a vigor and resolve shared 
equally by an american president and an american congress of 
different political parties he grew hopeful and grateful for this 
unselfish bipartisan unity 
theres a story i want to tell you today about a meeting 
churchill had with a group of american journalists in 1952 at a 
time when all the troubles of the cold war including the hardship 
of morally and militarily rearming the west were keenly felt his 
friend and physician lord moran recorded churchills appraisal of 
american leadership 
what other nation in history churchill asked when it 
became supremely powerful has had no thought of territorial 
aggrandizement no ambition but to use its resources for the good of 
the world i marvel at americas altruism her sublime 
disinterestedness 
all at once i realized lord moran wrote winston was in 
tears his eyes were red his voice faltered he was deeply moved 
well generous words honest emotion from a great world leader 
and now more than a quarter century later as the decade of the 
80s comes to a close there is hope that the generosity and resolve 
that churchill saw in the american people is at last paying an 
historic dividend the possibility of a new time in human history 
when all the problems that so haunted the postwar world give way to 
peace and expansion and freedom 
so you can see why to me the story of these last eight years 
and this presidency goes far beyond any personal concerns it is a 
continuation really of a far larger story a story of a people and 
a cause a cause that from our earliest beginnings has defined us 
as a nation and given purpose to our national existence the hope of 
human freedom the quest for it the achievement of it is the 
american saga 
and ive often recalled one group of early settlers making a 
treacherous crossing of the atlantic on a small ship when their 
leader a minister noted that perhaps their venture would fail and 
they would become a byword a footnote to history but perhaps 
too with gods help they might also found a new world a city upon 
a hill a light unto the nations 
those words and that destiny beckon to us still whether we seek 
it or not whether we like it or not we americans are keepers of 
the miracle we are asked to be guardians of a place to come to a 
place to start again a place to live in the dignity god meant for 
his children may it ever be so 
thanks for listening and god bless you

here is the text of the democratic response to 
president reagans radio address saturday as given by sen joseph 
lieberman dconn 
good afternoon im sen joe lieberman of connecticut as a newly 
elected senator i am especially honored to be asked by sen george 
mitchell to follow this final weekly radio address of president 
ronald reagan 
over the last several years we democrats have used this time to 
provide constructive alternatives to the policies of the president 
and his party 
but today we join with all americans in honoring and 
appreciating his stewardship of the highest office in our land 
mr president we salute you your love of this country and your 
fervent devotion to freedom inspired us all you raised the spirit 
of america and upheld the values of faith flag and family that we 
hold so dear 
i believe that is why after eight years mr president you are 
even more popular with the american people than on the day you were 
sworn in some politicians might find that fact frustrating but we 
all should be grateful for it for without the respect of the 
people the president would be powerless and our country would be 
left at risk 
america is freedom president reagan said in his farewell 
address this week as a person whose grandparents came to this 
country to escape persecution abroad and just last week was sworn in 
as a united states senator i know how real the american promise of 
freedom and opportunity still is 
but i also know that along with opportunity comes challenge and 
that is what confronts us now at the end of the reagan era and the 
beginning of the bush administration the challenge and opportunity 
of our future 
we are challenged to protect our nations security while we 
pursue the opportunity for peace with the soviet union 
we are challenged to end the plague of drugs and crime while we 
endeavor to provide opportunity for our young people to become 
educated and trained to join our workforce 
we are challenged to reduce the federal deficit while opening 
opportunities for those afflicted with disease or burdened by 
poverty 
but perhaps our greatest new challenge in the years ahead will 
come from the natural environment that delimits our world and 
defines the quality of our lives 
when the pilgrim john winthrop envisioned the shining city upon 
the hill of which the president speaks so eloquently he looked out 
upon a continent untouched by smog hazardous waste and acid rain 
in the centuries since that pristine age we have conquered the 
continent but we have also made it dirty and unsafe 
the industrial revolution has swept the world but we havent 
swept up behind it now the decades of neglect have come back to 
haunt us and threaten to engulf our childrens future and endanger 
their health and safety 
if we do not meet this challenge we may face disaster holes in 
the ozone layer and acid in the rain will cause skin cancer and lung 
disease 
gases in the air will warm the planet and lead to drought in our 
heartland and flooding along our coast 
waste in our water will make our beaches forbidding places to 
visit on a summers day 
but there is hope and it lies as president reagan would say 
with we the people the protection of the environment will be 
high on the agenda of the new congress and the new president not 
because it makes political sense but because the people know it 
makes common sense 
people like rico and annette gattilia of north haven conn who 
built a grass roots environmental movement from the living room of 
their modest home a movement that does battle with the large 
chemical company that pollutes the air in their own backyard and 
dirties the river where once they would fish and swim 
government cant do everything it must have limits as president 
reagan has said but one of the things it can and must do is protect 
the health and safety of our people elimination of pollution in our 
water on our land and in the air is a responsibility we in 
government cannot shirk the people will not allow us to 
as president reagans time in washington comes to an end and my 
service in the senate here just begins i must say that i am 
encouraged and inspired by his sense of patriotism and hope it 
moves and binds us all across generations and ideologies because it 
is born of shared pride in country belief in god and a sense of 
duty to the people 
so let us now set out to work on the unfinished business of 
america with the spirit of purpose and confidence that is the legacy 
of the reagan years it is after all the same spirit that built 
this country and will if we protect it continue to make us a truly 
great nation

standing stoically in line for heating 
fuel sadrahmah bikhar mused on the pullout of soviet troops saying 
simply its good i dont like them 
its hard to find anyone who does on the streets of this bleak 
capital ringed by snowy hills 
in random interviews with the associated press most people were 
openly hostile toward the soviets but asked about the survival 
prospects of president najibs marxist government many glanced 
uneasily at the interpreter and bystanders and make noncommittal 
replies 
instead they expressed hope but little belief that the 
fighting will end when the soviets leave 
their reluctance to answer certain questions is understandable 
in this divided land official rhetoric remains upbeat although it 
contrasts sharply with reality 
on saturday antigovernment guerrillas known as mujahadeen 
attacked a 400vehicle government supply and ammunition convoy four 
miles from kabul 
western reporters saw afghan units dig in on both sides of the 
solang highway a key northern route and heard rocket fire before 
government troops opened fire into the hills and the convoy raced 
past 
the same day the staterun kabul times published new triumphant 
exhortations from the sovietbacked marxist administration in a 
report on celebrations for the ninth anniversary of the founding of 
the ministry of state security it said gen ghulam farouq yaqubi 
welcomed najib declaring we feel ourselves more powerful than 
ever against the thievish attacks of the intransigent extremists 
on the streets bikhars severalhour wait reflected the 
increasing harassment of the convoys running three times a week on 
the solang now the sole highway supplying the city 
as the soviets have moved out their forces to meet a un 
deadline for pulling out all their troops by feb 15 guerrillas 
have approached the capital and stepped up convoy attacks 
bikhar said all he knew was that things were getting worse asked 
what he thought would happen when all the soviets were gone he 
shrugged and said through an interpreter i dont know i hope the 
fighting will stop 
but there was no doubt in the mind of eshaqza anargul a mechanic 
with the stateowned afghan airline ariana 
there will be fighting for another 10 years maybe longer he 
said 
economically it will get worse too he added 
armed opposition to the government began soon after it invited 
the soviet troops in 1979 in the wake of a sovietbacked coup since 
then the war has killed an estimated 1 million people driven a 
third of the 15 million afghans to pakistan and iran and scarred 
millions more 
amputees are a common sight on the streets of kabul tales abound 
of family members troops guerrillas and civilians killed or 
missing 
abdul salom a turbaned 60yearold said he fled his village of 
saraikhoga 50 miles from kabul after it was damaged in bombing 
attacks against rebels he has squeezed into a mud house with 
relatives in the kharkhana district of kabul 
the area is a mixture of bleak concrete sixstory apartments 
and slums of mud houses without heat electricity or water salom 
squats under a blanket in a friends shop a cargo container turned 
into a makeshift store selling soap nails and other items 
he is one of about 1 million refugees who have doubled the prewar 
population of the capital 
we just want peace he said no russians no mujahadeen no 
government just peace

conventional weapons and troops across europe 
the agreement was the final element of an accord designed to 
enhance freedom in the soviet bloc and boost eastwest contacts it 
was initialed after a lastminute compromise solved a dispute 
between greece and turkey 
diplomats who have spent more than two years haggling over that 
accord informally accepted it minus the mandate for the new arms 
talks friday negotiators at the 35nation conference said they 
would formally adopt the final statement sunday 
the conference to review the 1975 helsinki accords on economic 
cooperation and human rights convened in november 1986 and involved 
the soviet union united states canada and all european nations 
except albania 
the us ambassador to the talks stephen j ledogar said the

cafe or talks on conventional armed forces in europe 
ledogar told reporters the mandate for the arms talks was signed 
by nato and warsaw pact negotiators after lastminute telephone 
calls between vienna and the turkish capital ankara resulted in a 
compromise on a greekturkish dispute that stymied diplomats for the 
past week 
greece had objected to the exclusion of a triangle of turkish 
territory close to the syrian border from the arms talks 
the territory includes the eastern mediterranean port of mersin 
which greece says is used to ship arms to northern cyprus 
controlled by turkey 
turkey had agreed with the soviet union to exclude the territory 
and feared that reopening the issue might prompt moscow to reiterate 
earlier demands to include the nearby us air base of incirlinck in 
the talks 
ledogar said the territory was not strategically important in 
eastwest terms 
the text of the new mandate left open whether the zone for the 
new talks would include or exclude mersin 
ledogar indicated this was deliberately left ambiguous but said 
the united states the soviet union and other unidentified states 
gave undisclosed bilateral assurances to turkey over the zone 
the new talks will aim to reduce troops tanks heavy artillery 
and other weapons across the continent from the atlantic to the 
ural mountains deep inside the soviet union 
negotiations on setting up the talks which do not include naval 
forces chemical or nuclear weapons started in february 1987 
both the north atlantic treaty organization and the sovietled 
warsaw pact have said they are eager to begin the negotiations 
which will replace the mutual and balanced force reduction talks 
going on in vienna since 1973 
those talks aimed only to reduce conventional troops and weapons 
in central europe 
negotiators from both blocs say they are hopeful the new talks 
will progress much faster although they are complicated by the 
difficulties of defining weaponry involved and by verification 
the mandate for the new talks now goes into the helsinki final 
document which contains the most detailed human rights agreements 
ever reached between east and west 
western diplomats hailed the accord but said the east bloc 
frequently violated commitments it made on human rights in the 1975 
helsinki final act 
the new accord foresees greater freedom for religious believers 
in the east bloc much more precise regulations on emigration and 
travel from the east an end to abuse of psychiatry and to the 
jamming of western radio stations and increased eastwest tourism 
and business deals 
it also for the first time creates a mechanism to raise human 
rights issues at any time on a bilateral level with any other 
helsinki signatory 
one of the most disputed issues at the helsinki conference was a 
1991 human rights conference in moscow the united states and 
britain announced last week they would go but only on condition 
that soviet reforms continue and are institutionalized by then 
canada held out on moscow until the last minute seeking exit 
visas for a jewish couple in leningrad refused emigration for 10 
years on grounds of national security 
canadian ambassador william bauer said saturday the soviets had 
promised to review the case 
delegates had said they would formally adopt the accord on 
saturday but on saturday that was pushed back to sunday 
a western diplomat said the delay was due to east german 
objections to a word in the german translation of a provision that 
minimum currency exchange requirements could be abolished in the 
future the objection was resolved he said speaking on condition 
of anonymity 
east germany earns millions of west german marks each year from 
visitors required to change certain amounts of hard currency and 
only last week agreed to consider abolishing them in future

people from the deck of a damaged cypriot freighter saturday during 
a dramatic and dangerous rescue in the stormy north atlantic 
the helicopters then flew the west german captain and his wife 
the west german engineer and the 29member filipino crew to ireland 
the west germanowned ship the 42000ton yarrowanga was bound 
from norway to the st lawrence seaway in canada to take on iron ore 
when it was caught in a gale friday that put two large gashes in the 
hull 
the ships boiler failed friday but the crew restarted it and 
the ship was moving under its own power toward ireland when the 
rescuers arrived 
the yarrowanga was listing in 30foot seas and 50mph winds when 
one of the helicopters first tried unsuccessfully to land on the 
deck rescue organizers said 
the longrange hh 53c helicopters based in woodbridgebentwaters 
in eastern england had flown to shannon international airport on 
friday night and took off early saturday for the flight of more than 
200 miles to the vessel 
they were refueled en route by two longrange hc130 hercules 
tanker aircraft and reached the yarrowanga in the early afternoon 
in little more than an hour the first helicopter lifted up 15 
people with a winch and the second aircraft hauled up 17 more 
the helicopters then headed back to shannon where the irish 
marine rescue coordinating center had been monitoring their progress 
this was a textbook rescue operation said maj ken stafford 
leader of the us rescue squad everything went according to 
plan all taken off the stricken ship are in good health and none

strict orders not to speak publicly until all reports are made said 
an airport official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
us air force capt david freeman said it is the most 
dangerous mission ive ever been on but everything went well 
royal air force nimrod reconnaissance planes designed for long 
searches at sea circled the ship friday night 
the coast guard rescue center at falmouth england said a dutch 
tug the typhoon was expected to reach the yarrowanga on sunday and 
attempt to salvage it 
its irish agent shipping broker john dundon said the ships 
owners had sent instructions through him that the crew should 
abandon ship even if salvage rights were to be claimed by another 
party

the sister of a man who claimed he and five 
companions survived 35 days in the rubble of the armenian earthquake 
says the story was made up so her brother could get into a good 
hospital soviet media reported saturday 
the tass news agency said reporters had tracked down aikaz 
akopyans sister julietta who akopyan said witnessed his rescue 
jan 11 from the ruins of his ninestory apartment building in the 
city of leninakan 
neither officials nor local journalists had been able to find his 
sister or the five other people reportedly rescued with akopyan 
they could find no witnesses to the reported rescue 
at first the sister denied her kinship with akopyan but later 
on acknowledged that it was she who had brought aikaz to the yerevan 
hospital and that he really was her brother tass said 
according to her words it appears that on jan 6 aikaz 
requested her to drive him to a good yerevan hospital and it was on 
the way to yerevan that a story of rescue after 35 days was 
ostensibly invented tass said 
the government newspaper izvestia said akopyans sister made up 
the rescue story because she wanted to put her brother in a good 
hospital it based its report on an interview with an unidentified 
leninakan resident who it said was present when tass spoke to the 
woman 
tass quoted lt col v kozlov of the armenian civil defense 
medical service as saying that according to data he had available 
akopyan was rescued five days after the dec 7 earthquake and that 
on jan 6 he had sought drugs from leninakan hospital for an 
allergy but he added that there are many people with the last name 
akopyan in leninakan 
however the news agency said akopyan now in a hospital in 
yerevan was sticking to his story and that doctors could not rule 
out the possibility it was true it said reporters still had been 
unable to clarify all details of the case and that akopyan had 
threatened to jump out of the window in his hospital room if 
reporters didnt leave him alone 
doctors regard the threat as quite realisitic tass said 
tass reported thursday the rescue from the ruins of the quake 
that killed about 25000 people that night the 50yearold 
electrician was shown in his hospital bed on soviet television 
but the news agency cast doubt on the story the following day 
saying that no witnesses had been found everyone wanted to 
believe in the leninakan miracle it said 
akopyan said he and the five others had gone to the basement of 
the apartment building to haul out two large kegs when the 
earthquake struck they were stuck unhurt in a food cellar and 
survived on canned vegetables smoked ham stewed fruit and pickles 
he said 
he said he sang songs and told stories to the other five to keep 
their spirits up 
akopyan was reported to be suffering from pneumonia as a result 
of the confinement when he was admitted to the hospital 
but tass said saturday that gurgen badanyan whom it identified 
as the leading soviet internal medicine specialist believed akopyan 
had been suffering chronic lung and heart deficiencies for least 
several years 
a psychiatric examination indicated akopyan is not mentally ill 
tass said doctors observed that he mixed up some facts including 
the names of children and the number of people who he said were 
trapped with him 
doctors think this is possible as a result of heavy 
psychological stress we decided to ask straight whether he was 
telling the truth akopyan said yes and in a rather confused way 
repeated his first version tass correspondents kirill dibrova and 
alexander shchglenko wrote 
medical specialists do not deny the theoretical possibility 
that aikaz akopyan did spend about a month in a basement under the 
rubble tass said

virginias joint celebration monday of the 
birthdays of two confederate generals and a black civil rights 
leader on leejacksonking day is the perfect combination of 
diversity says the man responsible for the merger 
lt gov l douglas wilder who as a state senator five years ago 
pushed through the bill making martin luther king jr day a virginia 
holiday says he doesnt find it ironic that king shares the holiday 
with virginia natives robert e lee and thomas stonewall jackson 
i find no irony in it at all wilder a grandson of slaves 
and the first black elected to statewide office in the south since 
reconstruction said friday it shows we are prepared to recognize 
good men men of principle have differed on principle and i think 
all three were men of principle 
james farmer a civil rights leader who worked with king said 
saturday that king deserves a day all his own because martin 
luther king stood alone as a giant 
but he said king would have been amused at being linked with 
heroes of the confederacy 
dr king was very tolerant of things like that farmer said 
if he is looking down from heaven now i can hear him laughing 
the bill passed the state legislature in 1984 after seven years 
of effort by wilder and often acrimonious debate in public hearings 
opponents objected to honoring a nonvirginian with a holiday 
when favorite sons such as thomas jefferson and patrick henry did 
not have their own days celebrating kings birthday on the third 
monday in january already designated as leejackson day also drew 
protest 
kings birthday is jan 15 1929 lee was born jan 19 1807 and 
jackson was born jan 21 1824 
the memory of lee and jackson is sacred to the hearts of all 
true virginians to replace our heroes with martin luther king or 
any other nonvirginian is to betray the greatness of our heritage 
as a commonwealth forest tucker a member of the sons of 
confederate veterans said in 1984 
but wilder persisted i have never taken to the floor of the 
senate to say one word against stonewall jackson he told his 
fellow legislators five years ago i have never failed to stand in 
honor of robert e lee but that cause which is sacred to many 
virginians is not sacred to all virginians 
wilder who is expected to announce his candidacy for governor 
this month now minimizes the controversy over the bill pointing 
instead to ceremonies around the state honoring king in richmond 
for example a week of activities is being devoted in memory of the 
slain civil rights leader including forums worship services and a 
touring stage show performing works by black writers 
martin luther king jr day is a state holiday in all states 
except arizona idaho montana new hampshire south dakota and 
wyoming mississippians honor both lees and kings birthdays on the 
same day 
charles sadler a spokesman for the martin luther king federal 
holiday commission in washington dc said his group doesnt mind 
how kings birthday is celebrated as long as it is a joint holiday 
is better than nothing he said

the motel where martin luther king jr was 
slain has been a focal point for past celebrations but will not be 
part of the citys major tributes to the civil rights leader monday 
the lorraine motel where king was killed by an assassins bullet 
in 1968 is to become the centerpiece of an 88 million civil 
rights museum the crumbling motel has been surrounded for most of 
the past year by a chainlink fence 
king was born jan 15 1929 and the national holiday honoring 
him is monday promoters of the lorraine museum had planned to stage 
a groundbreaking ceremony for the project on the holiday but it has 
been delayed until jan 27 
the state needed more time to line up the worker crews that are 
to begin work that day said darmy bailey president of a 
nonprofit foundation that took up donations to buy the lorraine at 
a foreclosure auction in 1982 
as the lorraine museum project prepares to go forward another 
king institution is undergoing a transition 
coretta scott king the civil rights leaders widow will step 
down as president of the king center on april 4 to be replaced by 
her son dexter scott king directors of the atlantabased memorial 
and policy center announced saturday 
mrs king will stay on as chief executive officer and 
spokesperson for the center which is devoted to spreading the 
activists nonviolent policies worldwide 
in memphis speeches and memorial services are planned at various 
locations including clayborn temple where king helped organize a 
sanitation workers strike 
he was killed while in town to help lead that protest in past 
years members of the american federation of state county and 
municipal employees have gathered at the lorraine to lay a wreath in 
kings honor 
theyve got so much stuff going on down here now i dont think 
we need to go down to the lorraine in fact we cant even get on 
the premises said the rev james smith president of the 
federations local 1733 
the museum project with funding from the city county and state 
should be finished in 1991 bailey said 
the lorraine civil rights museum foundation plans to turn over 
title to the motel to the state so it can maintain and run the 
museum however muhammad ziad leader of an organization called the 
poor peoples campaign filed a lawsuit last week to keep the state 
from taking over the building 
he said in the chancery court lawsuit that people who gave money 
to save the motel should be polled to see what they think about the 
project 
while the major king day events will be held elsewhere a memphis 
group called the commission on religion and racism has scheduled a 
march to the motel 
the march is dedicated to jacqueline smith who has camped out on 
a sidewalk beside the lorraine since being evicted from the motel in 
march to make way for the museum project 
miss smith a former lorraine employee contends the project is 
part of an effort to gentrify the neighborhood which is dominated 
by warehouses and rundown rental property she also has said the 
memorial would focus on the violence of kings death rather than the 
peacefulness of his message

police guarded wenceslas square on 
saturday to block a memorial service and activists threatened to 
copy the suicide of jan palach who burned himself to death in 1969 
to protest the sovietled invasion 
opposition groups vowed to go ahead with a memorial rally sunday 
marking the 20th anniversary of palachs suicide in the square 
despite a ban by communist party authorities 
at least three anonymous letters were received in prague during 
the past week from an unknown committee for collective suicide 
threatening to emulate palachs act 20 years ago 
in an extremely unusual move by authorities the party daily rude 
pravo published a frontpage letter from a professor who taught 
palach and later signed the charter 77 human rights document he 
warned against further selfimmolation attempts 
palach set himself alight in pragues wenceslas square on jan 
16 1969 to protest the presence of soviet troops in czechoslovakia 
after they invaded to crush the 1968 prague spring reforms 
milan machovec a philosophy professor who taught palach at 
pragues charles university appealed in his letter to anyone 
considering a repeat of palachs act 
i consider it my duty to reiterate that dying jan palach 
himself urged young people not to follow him the letter said 
it was unprecedented for the communist daily to print a letter 
from a charter 77 signatory machovec is also a member of the 
recently formed helsinki committee and of the masaryk society but 
his dissident affiliations were not mentioned in rude pravo 
machovec quoted tomas g masaryk founder of the czechoslovak 
state in 1918 as saying suicide and similar extreme acts are 
rather cheap and that real bravery is patient work and life 
zdenek dienstbier the head of an official human rights commitee 
founded last month also received one of the selfimmolation 
threats the commitee warned that a demonstrative suicide is a 
very inhuman and immoral act and called for dialogue with the 
unknown authors of the letter 
communist authorities in prague banned the rally last week the 
independent groups said they would hold the protest anyway 
police began guarding the square early saturday morning similar 
tight security was in force august and october when thousands of 
people took part in banned rallies later broken up by police 
a comment by the soviet news agency tass carried by several 
official newspapers saturday charged that palachs death was not his 
own choice 
the adventurers who have deceitfully made him commit suicide 
counted only on explosion of passions and emotions inside the 
country it said 
it seems that the present handful of organizers of 
antisocialist actions in czechoslovakia tries to reach similar 
objectives at any cost 
earlier this week police confiscated a death mask sculpted by 
olbram zoubek who made a tombstone for palachs grave 20 years ago 
activists in prague said 
activists have said sunday afternoons meeting was planned as a 
brief commemorative act with leading dissidents laying flowers and 
lighting candles at the king wenceslas statue where palach set 
himself on fire 
charter 77 one of five groups which called sundays rally also 
plans a vigil at palachs grave on jan 21 in the village of 
vsetaty about 18 miles north of prague 
his body was exhumed from the prague cemetery and reburied at 
vsetaty in 1973 his prague grave had often been heaped with flowers 
and burning candles until the body was removed

president carlos salinas de gortari has won 
his first battle in a war with the bosses of the oil workers union 
the most powerful but reportedly the most corrupt union in mexico 
in a bold move tuesday salinas had union leader joaquin 
hernandez galicia and 50 of his associates arrested on charges 
ranging from illegal possession of guns to tax evasion and homicide 
hernandez galicia faces a maximum sentence of 40 years 
more arrests are expected soon a source in the attorney 
generals office told the associated press he said salinas planned 
to clean up the situation 
we do not want to make it look like a witch hunt a 
government source said on condition of anonymity but this is not 
the end 
a likely additional charge is unexplained wealth the 
government has ordered banks to freeze accounts of the top leaders 
it was the new presidents first confrontation with the powerful 
mexican unions and he picked a foe past presidents fearful of his 
power had left alone 
critics in and outside the government claim union chiefs led by 
la quina the diminutive by which hernandez galicia is known 
amassed fortunes controlled lives and sold jobs in a paternalistic 
system that built loyalities and gave bosses political leverage in 
the governing revolutionary institutional party 
to appease the union the party gives it an unofficial power 
quota by nominating as legislators union members who then are almost 
assured of victory despite losses in july 6 elections the union 
has one senator and seven representatives hernandez galicia also 
had his men as chiefs of police judges and city councilors in oil 
regions 
officials say hernandez galicia is a volatile leader who 
blackmailed government administrations through his union power and 
control over the state oil monopoly pemex which at one time was 
forced to grant the union 40 percent of its contract work much of 
the work was done by companies set up by the union boss and his 
associates 
he frequently has been called repressive and authoritarian and is 
accused of fraud nepotism even murder unexplained deaths and 
beatings of those opposed to la quina publicly have been blamed on 
him and his men though none of them ever has been charged in the 
incidents 
hernandez galicia always dismisses such allegations as attempts 
by jealous foes trying to turn the president against him and the 
union 
two bodyguards arrested with him last week have signed statements 
saying they killed another labor leader on hernandez galicias 
orders according to the attorney generals office 
on jan 3 hernandez galicia threatened to call a general strike 
if the government yielded as much as one millimeter of the oil 
industry to private business 
the statement did not endear him to a president who has said the 
state will retain control of the oil industry but seek private 
domestic investment in related secondary industries 
hernandez galicia opposed the nomination of salinas the man 
responsible for eliminating many union privileges when he was budget 
and planning secretary 
the 66yearold union chief a welder who took over the union in 
1964 and saw his power expand as the oil industry became mexicos 
top source of foreign income was a revered figure who dispensed 
favors to the rank and file had children named after him and was 
generous to schools and churches 
but he also traveled with a personal escort of 35 armed men said 
a federal investigator 
he was ruthless said maximo hernandez leader of a small 
group in the union that opposes hernandez galicia he would crush 
opposition post armed men at union meetings and hold threeminute 
sessions to ram through what he wanted 
his arrest tuesday caused a oneday walkout by union members at 
most oil installations but soon other labor unions offered their 
support to salinas 
some leftist parties accused the government of repression and 
joined a few thousand oil workers in a march thursday press 
reaction favors the president as does private business 
we must remember the oil leaders arrogance how they have 
challenged presidents with insolence we must remember their 
excessive salaries their avarice how the union thought itself the 
owner of mexicos petroleum wrote columnist fernando benitez in 
la jornada a newspaper that often criticizes the government 
he was a monster created by the governmment and the government 
in the end cut off his head said hernandez but the body is 
still twitching

of a place to come to a place to start again a place to live in 
the dignity god meant for his children may it ever be so regan 
said 
the president began his script with the traditional greeting 
my fellow americans and ended it as he always has thanks for 
listening and god bless you 
reagans first job was as a sports broadcaster in davenport 
iowa and radio gave him the exposure that helped him launch a 
career in hollywood 
as an actorturnedpolitician reagan honed his radio style for 
use as a political tool during his days as the governor of 
california 
over the years it has been difficult to calculate how many 
people hear the presidents live noontime address since many of 
the radio networks that have carried it only feed it to their 
subscribers who either replay it at their leisure or do not air it 
at all 
the only time the president was assured his voice would be 
carried came during the 1984 campaign when his campaign purchased 
the air time 
the president personally chose themes for his addresses 
occasionally he dominated the news as on the saturday he used 
the folksystyle addresses to announce the reappointment of federal 
reserve chairman paul volcker or the time he announced suspension 
of a preferential trading status for poland in the wake of the 
communist governments suppression of the solidarity labor union 
reagans most infamous remarks came outside the formal radio 
address when he announced prior to one speech from his ranch in 
california that he had just signed legislation that will outlaw 
russia forever the bombing begins in five minutes 
the president has a habit of joking with his aides prior to the 
talk and the remarks were made during a voice check when the 
microphone was turned on but he was not yet on the air the remarks 
were heard by the radio pool that was transmitting it to the 
other networks

the us naval force in the persian gulf is 
being trimmed again leaving the fleet with six surface fighting 
ships the lowest number since the mid1987 buildup that began as 
the iraqiran war escalated 
as the missile cruiser uss josephus daniels and three missile 
frigates departed the gulf in recent days three newly arriving 
vessels entered the waterway to begin their threemonth duty tours 
the threeforfour swap effectively reduced the gulfbased fleet 
from 15 to 14 ships and pared the number of surface combatants 
cruisers destroyers and frigates from seven to six 
the total of 14 is the lowest number of american warships in the 
gulf since july 1987 it also includes six minesweepers an 
amphibious landing ship that serves as their mother ship and the 
uss la salle flagship of the joint task force middle east 
another ten ships a battle group built around the 
nuclearpowered aircraft carrier uss nimitz remains on station in 
the arabian sea it is to be replaced by another carrier group 
headed by the uss constellation at the end of the month 
the force inside the gulf is slowly being reduced in strength 
following the iraqiran ceasefire that went into effect last 
august but us military sources say a carrier group will be 
operating in the indian ocean and arabian sea for the foreseeable 
future 
the defense department said in a statement friday that the 
josephus daniels was being withdrawn because it was no longer 
required to meet the threat to our forces and shipping in the 
region 
in fact the departure of the daniels did not reflect a sudden 
decision to reduce the force the 8200ton cruiser based at 
norfolk va was scheduled to leave the gulf on jan 8 along with 
three other east coastbased ships the frigates aubrey fitch doyle 
and taylor 
as those four ships sailed out of the gulf in recent days their 
patrol responsibilities were taken over by the destroyer obannon 
and the frigates hawes and de wert all based at charleston sc 
the frigate klakring originally slated for deployment along with 
those three had its orders cancelled in december officials said at 
the time that the resulting force reduction of one ship was seen as 
a prudent move considering the situation since the 
ceasefire 
with the arrival of the newcomers the mix in the gulf includes 
the hawes the de wert and another missile frigate the reid as 
well as the obannon and another destroyer the harry w hill plus 
the missile cruiser england 
the united states earlier scaled back its operations in the gulf 
from direct escorting of usflagged tankers to a system of 
monitoring their movements from a distance 
it also has curtailed air patrols and according to the pentagon 
on friday recently withdrew one of the four awacs or airborne 
surveillance aircraft based in saudi arabia during the last year of 
the iraqiran war 
there have been no armed incidents in the gulf since the united 
nationsbrokered truce went into effect aug 20 and other foreign 
navies have been pulling out their forces 
britain disclosed earlier in the week that it planned to withdraw 
its last three minesweepers by march leaving it with a threeship 
patrol unit italy belgium and the netherlands are withdrawing 
entirely and the french have cut their regional force to reflect 
the reduced tensions in the waterway since the 8year war ended 
although the ceasefire has worked us defense secretary frank 
c carlucci said during a visit to the gulf on dec 5 that there was 
no plan for major changes in our force structure as long as 
baghdad and tehran failed to make any progress toward a negotiated 
peace 
us officials have made it clear that the united states would 
continue to maintain a permanent force in the gulf at least at the 
level of four to six warships that were assigned there before the 
1987 buildup 
the continued presence of a soviet fleet some seven to ten 
warships is seen as an important factor affecting the rate at which 
the united states will reduce its gulf force us military sources 
say 
in any case those sources say any cutbacks would not include 
the six minesweepers sent to the gulf in late 1987 to deal with a 
growing threat of mines planted by iran in shipping lanes 
us officials insist that a mine threat still exists mainly in 
the northern gulf and the navy is still debating what to do with 
the woodenhulled korean war vintage minesweepers

relatives of an air force pilot 
killed in the 1986 us raid on libya said saturday they dont trust 
moammar gadhafi and want an autopsy performed on the body to be 
certain it is the fliers 
the air force telephoned the ribas dominicci family in puerto 
rico on friday night to inform them the body released by libya had 
been identified in italy as that of fernando ribas dominicci the 
33yearold airman was killed during the april 15 1986 raids on 
libya 
after getting over this shock we have asked the pentagon for a 
complete autopsy to know the cause of his death said the slain 
pilots brother salvador 
he said he also wants a family doctor to certify whether it is 
ribas dominiccis body 
libyan authorities turned over the body friday to the papal 
representative in tripoli they said it belonged to capt paul 
lorence 31 of san francisco 
lorence and ribas dominicci a native of utuado puerto rico 
piloted the f111 bomber that was the only plane lost in the raids 
on libya the other body was never found the libyans said 
they were only four inches apart in the cabin said the 
brother a 38yearold attorney who spoke by telephone from the 
western city of mayaguez 80 miles west of san juan 
the pilot was the youngest of six brothers fernando ribas 
dominicci also left a wife blanca and a son also named fernando 
who is now 7 years old they live in austin texas 
the italian news agency ansa quoted an italian forensic expert 
among three italians and three americans who helped identify the 
body as saying the identification was made possible on the basis 
of the comparision of teeth with documents provided by us 
authorities ansa said the body was well preserved 
ribas dominicci said the family has doubts because of a libyan 
television report and pictures of the body when it was found three 
months after the raid the broadcast said the body had been washed 
ashore and identified it as lorences 
no body is in good condition after floating in the water for 
three months said ribas dominicci 
he said the family also is skeptical of gadhafis motives saying 
it could be a publicity stunt 
with ghadhafi i dont discard any possibility he said 
ribas dominicci said his 87yearold father had not been told of 
the development because he is ill 
this is like reliving a sad episode he said

as nancy reagan prepares to leave the pomp and 
pageantry of eight years in the white house she wants to be 
remembered for her work against drug abuse rather than her penchant 
for borrowing highpriced designer gowns 
im very happy that i was able to help the fashion industry 
but i hope thats not the thing im remembered for i hope im 
remembered for the drug program and the help to children the 
first lady said 
her voice reduced to a mere whisper by a severe bout of 
laryngitis mrs reagan reviewed the ups and downs of her years in 
washington in a 45minute farewell interview on thursday with the 
associated press 
sipping coffee from a delicate white and gold china cup in the 
yellow oval room of the mansions private quarters mrs reagan 
discussed the disclosure that she had ignored the pledge she made in 
1982 to abstain from borrowing highpriced designer clothes and 
gowns 
i was just trying to help an industry that i could help and i 
was in the position to help i didnt see anything wrong with 
that mrs reagan said 
mrs reagan noted that americas top designers have given her 
their lifetime achievement award for her contribution to the 
fashion industry 
whenever anybody talked about fashion they would think french 
dior whatever they never thought about american well now 
american designers are taken seriously abroad there is a 
competition that is just wonderful the first lady said 
attempting to counter critics who have said her actions amounted 
to free advertising for several of her favorite designers mrs 
reagan insisted i wasnt advertising for these people i was 
trying to promote and help one of the biggest industries in our 
country they are all very grateful and nobody saw anything 
wrong with it 
turning to the work she wants to be identified with mrs reagan 
said she has had some silent victories in her battle against drug 
abuse receiving a lot of letters from kids or parents that 
ive been able to help in instances that few people know about 
she said she regretted that theres always those kids that you 
havent been able to get to and you havent been able to reach 
she added that she intended to keep working through the antidrug 
abuse center named after her that is to be built near los angeles 
i dont believe in retirement she said 
mrs reagan said she was saddened to learn that jason brady a 
16yearold suffering from cancer who had visited her a week before 
christmas through the makeawish foundation had died 
he said he wanted to come here he said ive seen you on 
television and i want to tell you that i admire you and i know 
that youve been a great support to your husband she said her 
voice softening he died on christmas day 
queried about criticism from consumer advocate ralph nader that 
she and president reagan have not included warnings against tobacco 
in their lectures against drug abuse mrs reagan held up a finger 
for emphasis i agree with him she said its as addictive as 
any of the other drugs including alcohol 
the first lady went on to say she hoped one of her aides a 
smoker who was present in the room is listening mrs reagan 
has been known to rigorously keep after white house personnel who 
smoke insisting they get help to kick their habit 
looking back over her eight years in the white house mrs reagan 
said she had not anticipated that life in the executive mansion 
would be as confining as it turned out to be certainly after 
ronnies shooting in march 1981 everything tightened up she 
said 
it always bothered ronnie that he created such a todo when we 
went to a restaurant and this entourage of cars that always 
bothered him mrs reagan said of the 20plus vehicles that the 
secret service organizes for a presidential motorcade 
presidentelect bush and his wife barbara are expected to keep up 
their active social life and mrs reagan said she hoped theyll 
find their own way to get out and about despite security concerns 
mrs reagan said she and her husband are happy they will 
continue to receive secret service protection after they leave the 
white house 
one subject mrs reagan refused to discuss was former reagan 
chief of staff donald t regans revelation that she had used an 
astrologer to help formulate the presidents schedule read my 
book she quipped promising to deal with the subject in her 
memoirs which she said are due out in the fall 
of regan who blamed the first lady for organizing his ouster in 
the wake of allegations he had mismanaged the white house during the 
irancontra affair mrs reagan was curt 
asked if reagan was happy with his former aide mrs reagan said 
simply hes not asked if shed changed her mind about regan 
who was harshly critical of her involvement in white house affairs 
in his book for the record she whispered no 
of the kissandtell books that many reagan aides have 
written mrs reagan said she finds them to be reckless kinds of 
books 
i think theyre terrible theres an implied trust and 
when you leave and write these books youre breaking that trust 
she said 
the first lady said she has a formula for dealing with such 
books including any that come out in the future 
i wont read them she said with stern look i havent 
read any of the others 
the first lady said the barrage of criticism shed encountered 
upon entering the white house spurred by stories about her 
privatelyfunded purchases of 209000 of new china and a 730000 
redecoration of the white house had been a big surprise 
i had one disadvantage that ronnie didnt have i came in with 
terrible press she said i never had that before it made 
me pull back there was a hurdle on both sides you all 
getting to know me and my getting to be a little hesitant afraid 
even eight years later mrs reagan still appeared upset about 
reports that she wanted president carter and his wife rosalynn to 
move out of the white house prior to the reagan inauguration i 
never said that mrs reagan said again her finger pointing for 
emphasis 
as she rose to leave mrs reagan was eager to offer some word 
of wisdom for future first ladies as well as all married women 
do your own thing dont be afraid to give your opinion just 
because youre married doesnt mean youve given up your right to 
have an opinion

the kremlin took direct control of a region claimed 
by two rival republics the tass news agency said saturday in the 
governments most determined bid to calm its worst pocket of ethnic 
unrest 
the decree keeps the nagornokarabakh region within the southern 
republic of azerbaijan and rejects demands that it become part of 
the neighboring republic of armenia 
nagornokarabakh and armenia are mainly christian and azerbaijan 
is predominately moslem 
a commission led by arkady volsky the kremlins representative 
in azerbaijans troubled region of nagornokarabakh can suspend 
local governing councils administrative bodies and informal 
organizations and oversee the mass media publishing health and 
education tass said 
the declaration was adopted in connection with the persistent 
strain in interethnic relations in nagornokarabakh and around it 
with a view to preventing their further aggravation and to 
stabilizing the situation in the region the official news agency 
said 
the decision was made thursday by the presidium of the supreme 
soviet the countrys highest executive body but released only 
saturday by the tass news agency previous reports had said only 
that a special situation had been imposed on nagornokarabakh 
the decree was billed as a temporary measure but did not say how 
long it will last or when new elections will be held it did not say 
who besides volsky will serve on the committee 
more than 60 people have been killed and about 200000 have fled 
their homes as a result of the dispute that flared up in february 
1988 over control of nagornokarabakh azerbaijan and moscow have 
rejected annexation and the kremlin instead opted for a longterm 
economic and social development program 
but that has not stopped the unrest which last erupted into 
violence in midnovember military rule and a strict curfew was 
imposed on the armenian capital yerevan the azerbaijani capital 
baku and other cities 
top kremlin officials including president mikhail s gorbachev 
have reacted angrily to demands for annexation that have continued 
after the dec 7 earthquake that devastated northern armenia and 
killed about 25000 people 
armenian activists say several of their leaders have been 
arrested and held in administrative detention 
tass said that under the decree the powers of nagornokarabakhs 
legislature and executive bodies shall be suspended until the 
holding of elections of a new composition of the soviet 
the committee shall be entrusted with the task of being in 
charge of the local bodies of state power and administration of 
nagornokarabakh it said 
courts and prosecutors in the disputed territory will work under 
new regulations to be imposed by the procuratorgeneral ministry of 
justice and the supreme court tass said 
the committee shall have the right to suspend the activities of 
public organizations and independentlyacting associations if they 
run counter to the constitution and legislation of the ussr or 
if necessary to dissolve them tass said 
that provision apparently was aimed at the informal organizations 
formed by activists to push demands for annexation by armenia 
official azerbaijani newspapers have complained that officials in 
nagornokarabakh practically stopped obeying any orders from baku 
lengthy strikes have been reported in the areas largest city 
stepanakert the latest violence erupted after reports reached 
azerbaijan that armenia had sent settlers into nagornokarabakh to 
build a factory and boost the regions ethnic armenian majority

a court saturday convicted four leading members of a 
leftwing terrorist group of murdering french industrialist georges 
besse and sentenced them to life in prison 
nathalie menigon 31 and joelle aubron 28 were convicted of 
carrying out the shooting death of the renault chief on nov 17 
1986 menigons companion jeanmarc rouillan 33 and georges 
cipriani 38 were convicted of complicity 
seven judges concurring to demands of state prosecutor galiber 
dauque ruled the four must spend at least 18 years behind bars 
before they are eligible for parole 
the panel which sits only on terrorism cases deliberated for 75 
minutes after hearing five days of testimony 
the defendants had boycotted the court since the second day of 
the trial none was present when the verdict was read 
all four are top members of direct action which started as a 
french group that bombed french institutions usually during the 
night when buildings were empty and no one could be hurt 
but over the last few years a deadly european branch has evolved 
with links to west germanys red army faction and belgiums 
communist fighting cells 
the group was largely rendered ineffective when the four were 
arrested at a farm south of paris and all their documents were 
confiscated among them was the original draft of a statement 
claiming responsibility for besses assassination police also found 
weapons allegedly used in the killing and a piece of the black suit 
besse was wearing when he died 
the auto executive was killed near his home in southern paris as 
he returned from work 
direct action pamphlets were found in a nearby subway station 
but the group did not formally claim responsibility for the murder 
until feb 11 nearly three months later 
besses widow francoise and their five children attended the 
weeks hearings 
the most important thing for me is that this trial took place 
and with dignity she said refusing to comment on the verdicts

chinese militiamen who attacked a guest house on the outskirts of 
nanking most of the african students from nanking had been forced 
to the guest house on dec 26 by chinese police who refused to allow 
them to travel to beijing 
african students allege that during the arrests chinese 
paramilitary forces used electric truncheons to shock and beat the 
african students the chinese have denied the charge 
the xinhua report quoted liang ruiju president of hehai 
university as saying he believed the foreign students in our 
university are still kids 
i hope they will return to their normal school activities as 
soon as possible he said 
about 1500 africans receive chinese scholarships as part of 
beijings policy to emphasize its ties to the third world

from pork rinds to power boats from 715 am 
workday starts to spurofthemoment shopping jaunts george herbert 
walker bush already is setting a pace and a style far different from 
the man he will succeed 
the nations 41st president is a man of aristocratic breeding and 
downhome tastes he enjoys country music dropping by sears to buy 
power tools jogging a mile or two his drink of choice is a vodka 
martini his idea of competitive sports is a good game of 
horseshoes his suits are tailormade 
during his campaign bush often joked that one of his hardest 
tasks during eight years as ronald reagans vice president was 
keeping my charisma in check 
as bush nears his inauguration he has exhibited a salty 
easygoing confidence that if not everyones idea of charisma is at 
least sharply at odds with the onetime perception of him as awkward 
in public whiny of voice and wimpy in demeanor 
bush still speaks in bursts and with a syntax that is often 
haphazard he sprinkles his conversation with phrases such as 
going ballistic and im not going to get all tense and 
talks about the drug thing or the persian gulf thing 
but bush seems far more at ease with himself now and has 
exhibited a quickwittedness particularly in his dealings with 
reporters that seemed to be missing in the past 
after avoiding regular contact with reporters during his 
campaign bush now admits that he relishes the giveandtake of news 
conferences and has held a dozen or so of them since his election 
his humor is often selfdeprecating as when a reporter recently 
began a question mr vice president do you ever stop to think 
 
not often bush interrupted 
bush 64 said in a recent interview that he shared with wife 
barbara upon rising one morning a few days ago a sudden revelation 
i feel excited about this job 
bush has made it clear he intends to be up and about a prospect 
that must make the secret service nervous and which doesnt make 
reporters jobs any easier 
im not going to be isolated and cut off say i want to go buy 
a suit i want to eat peking duck and i dont want to have to spend 
a lot of time worrying about where people are i want to say im 
ready to go lets go he said 
bushs forays into town are becoming legendary remindful of the 
unannounced trips president lyndon johnson used to take 
he buys bagels at a local delicatessen makes frequent trips to a 
washington mens shop to be fitted for suits goes out himself to 
buy presents for his wife and often drops by the local safeway to 
pick up a few groceries 
bush enjoys playing tennis with his family and with tennis pros 
and as vice president and presidentelect often dropped in 
unannounced at the gymnasium in the house rayburn office building to 
work out with former colleagues 
he enjoys restaurants often lingering for hours over meals with 
friends and guests 
in his beloved vacation home of kennebunkport maine bush 
frequently takes unannounced walks through the village patronizes 
local shops takes his boat out for a spin goes fishing jogs 
through the neighborhood 
at his oceanside family compound he uses one cottage as an 
office where he does his own typing on an electric typerwriter set 
up at his desk 
on a recent visit he shushed reporters asking him questions 
while he was fishing in a local river telling them not to scare 
away the fish however he admitted he never caught fish at that 
particular spot anyway so why did he return there i like to 
cast he said 
he also enjoys throttling up his sleek 28foot cigarette boat 
fidelity crashing through atlantic ocean waves at speeds up to 
50 mph sometimes appearing to relish in leaving a coast guard 
chase boat in his spray 
although bush kept the boat in the chesapeake bay near 
washington one summer he says he has no plans to move it to the 
potomac river when he moves to the white house that wouldnt do 
justice to the oceangoing craft he says comparing it to a 
thoroughbred horse 
while bush seems certain to continue his visits to the family 
estate in kennebunkport during warm weather he has indicated he 
plans to spend a lot of time at camp david the presidential retreat 
in maryland and is reportedly eyeing the purchase of a condominium 
in the florida keys where he enjoys fishing 
the former oil industry executive while claiming texas as his 
adopted home does not back away from his new england roots or his 
good fortune at birth once joking that his forefathers had come on 
the mayflower you could tell them because they all were holding

israel created in 1985 it is patrolled by a small contingent of 
israeli forces and the allied south lebanon army militia 
palestine liberation organization groups have staged attacks on 
troops and militiamen patrolling the zone fired rockets at israels 
northern settlements or attempted to infiltrate israel on 
hostagetaking operations 
lubrani coordinator of israeli actions in lebanon said the 
hostilities have stopped since arafat last month renounced terrorism 
and recognized israels right to exist 
but lubrani said he could not yet assess the plo position 
i think it is too early to judge and time will say he said 
on israel radio at the moment they are leaning somehow toward a 
status quo no violent actions but how long this will last i cannot 
tell you this can last until tonight

east peace conference but drew criticism on saturday from israel 
william waldegrave britains deputy foreign affairs minister who 
met with arafat friday night also planned to meet monday with arab 
league secretary general chedli klibi the tunisbased organization 
said saturday 
waldegrave said his twohour meeting with arafat constitutes a 
major development in the policies of great britain 
the talks demonstrated that the world was changing and israel 
had to change as well or it would risk being left behind said 
waldegrave who is to visit israel in early march 
arafat characterized the talks held at the home of plo tunisia 
representative hakam balaoui as fruitful constructive and 
useful 
in london israeli ambassador yoav biran said saturday he 
regretted what he called the unwarranted rush of british 
politicians to meet arafat and the plo 
the road towards peace in the middle east does not lead through 
the plo he said behind the plos charm offensive directed at 
the west this organization adheres to its unchanged policies by 
words that are directed at arab audiences and by continued attempts 
at terrorism directed at israel 
israeli foreign ministry spokesman alon liel said on friday that 
the british were well aware of israels attitude toward the 
palestine liberation organization 
israel opposes an international peace conference on the middle 
east and refuses to negotiate with the plo which it maintains is a 
terrorist organization 
waldegrave and arafat who met with reporters after their talks 
agreed that any arabisraeli peace conference should be sponsored by 
the five permanent members of the un security council including 
the united states and the soviet union 
arafat said other participants should include all concerned 
parties the plo or our provisional government israel egypt 
syria lebanon and jordan 
it was the first time arafat mentioned the possibility of a 
provisional government sitting at a peace conference in the name of 
palestinians since the palestine national council a sort of 
parliamentinexile for the plo decided to establish one at a 
meeting in algiers nov 15 
asked how britain could help bring about an international 
conference waldegrave said he did not want to exaggerate his 
countrys role but he added that london has special contacts with 
the united states other european governments and a number of arab 
states 
british prime minister margaret thatcher gave the goahead for 
the meeting after the arafats public renunciation of terrorism and 
implicit recognition of israelis right to exist in december 
the intefadeh has had an extraordinary effect on international 
public opinion and on great britain in particular waldegrave 
added referring to more than a year of unrest by palestinians 
living under israeli occupation in the west bank and gaza strip at 
least 355 palestinians and 15 israelis have died in the violence

newly elected us sen connie mack mayor xavier suarez and us 
rep e clay shaw visited the bobby maduro miami stadium to examine 
the problems facing the growing number of nicaraguan arrivals a 
total of 263 nicaraguans are living at the stadium 
shaw a republican congressman from fort lauderdale pledged his 
efforts in washington so that miami wont have to take on alone 
the financial burden of these new refugee arrivals 
the reality is that those federal funds dont come easily 
to help find jobs and homes for immigrants streaming across the 
texas border from mexico and seeking political asylum said mack a 
republican from cape coral 
but it is important that we understand a lot must be done to 
find a solution to the problem mack said through suarez who

miami officials are worried that the latest wave of nicaraguans 
pouring into the city will overburden facilities like schools and 
hospitals 
the central americans began arriving from southern texas by the 
busload thursday and friday following a federal judges ruling that 
the government could not keep them there while their applications 
for political asylum were being processed 
the nicaraguans maintain that they are fleeing oppression by 
their countrys leftist sandinista government the immigration and 
naturalization service says the immigrants are not eligible for 
asylum if they actually are fleeing bad economic conditions in their 
homeland which has been hurt by a us trade embargo 
since the judges decision monday about 400 people have come 
here bringing the twomonth total to about 2000 most of them 
nicaraguans officials expect about 100000 more to make their way 
to this heavily hispanic city during the next 18 months 
a delegation of community leaders visited southern texas on 
friday to warn those awaiting transportation to miami 
they need to know that theyre going to have to fend for 
themselves tony ojeda and assistant county manager from dade

of managua with president daniel ortega 
hes ruining your country shaw said of the sandinista 
leader and i pledge full support for the contras 
his call was met by cheers in spanish to the effect of long 
live democracy and communism out 
mack told the refugees he plans to speak with presidentelect 
bush about the refugees he already had contacted attorney general 
richard thornburgh to help coordinate federal efforts he said 
huge piles of used clothing were gathered under a palm tree 
outside the stadium and a church group was distributing free orange 
drinks and chili dogs to those in the shelter as well as to dozens 
more camping outside the stadium who arrived after authorities 
declared the shelter full 
one refugee who arrived too late to get a cot under the bleachers 
was sergio lezama 54 of managua the lawyer said he has slept at a 
friends house since his arrival 
i dont have a family here in miami he said so im just 
waiting here hoping for some place to live and some work 
the refugees at the baseball stadium will be relocated to beckham 
hall a county facility before jan 25 when the baltimore orioles 
baseball team arrives for spring training officials said

she was a dedicated doctor who had gone to 
bellevue hospital on her day off to work on a pathology lecture he 
was a former bellevue mental patient who moved unchallenged through 
its halls in a lab coat and stethoscope 
she was bright bubbly and caring a 33yearold south carolina 
native who came north to pursue her medical career and was expecting 
her first child he was a 23yearold from brooklyn who once yearned 
for a career in baseball but had instead a history of petty crimes 
and psychiatric problems 
the paths of kathryn hinnant and steven smith crossed when he 
stopped by the tiny office where she was working during a violent 
struggle police say he beat strangled and raped her then stole 
her fur coat and credit cards 
in a city where there were more than 1840 homicides last year 
an average of more than five a day this one got attention and it 
raised questions both about security at the hospital and about the 
treatment of the mentally ill 
smith who has a history of psychiatric care since 1981 
sometimes stayed at a homeless shelter sometimes he slept on a cot 
hidden in a closet on the 22nd floor of the hospital a massive 
1200bed facility 
last summer he reportedly tried to have himself committed to 
bellevues emergency psychiatric ward but was referred to a clinic 
just last month smith was hospitalized for nine days after 
telling doctors there he had swallowed rat poison in a suicide 
attempt 
and on jan 1 six days before the slaying a security guard 
arrested smith at the hospital and accused him of stealing a clock 
and a hypodermic needle smith was charged with a misdemeanor 
allowing him to go free 
its a rotten system set up by our society dr john pearson 
director of pathology at bellevue and hinnants boss said after 
speaking at a memorial service for her 
the mentally ill homeless are not in and of themselves at 
fault he said its the system that is at fault they dont 
have to be out on the streets but we have a society that lets that 
happen and thats wrong 
hinnant was working on her own time saturday jan 7 in a 
fourthfloor office preparing a lecture for her younger colleagues 
on monday 
she was to meet her husband eric johnson a piano salesman that 
evening the couple had married in october she was five months 
pregnant 
but sometime saturday afternoon smith wearing physicians 
clothing and a stethoscope attacked her police said he has 
contended that a man he identified only as john also participated in 
the attack but police have found no evidence that john exists 
when hinnant failed to meet her husband a worried johnson called 
her office the police and two hospitals on sunday morning he went 
to bellevue where he and a hospital administrator found his wifes 
severely beaten body 
mayor edward i koch called it a brutal outrageous murder 
and police made the case their top priority a 30000 reward was 
posted police got a break when three homeless men went to police 
with some of the doctors belongings they said smith had given to 
them 
smith was arrested at a homeless shelter and charged with murder 
last year in new york 65000 people showed up at city hospitals 
asking for psychiatric help about 16000 were admitted for 
psychiatric care said luis marcos vice president for mental 
hygiene at the citys health and hospitals corp which oversees 
bellevue and other city hospitals 
marcos wouldnt discuss whether bellevue officials bungled 
smiths case but conceded that overcrowding can affect a physicians 
judgment 
im not necessarily saying crowdedness interferes with a 
diagnosis marcos said but if you are under pressure because 
you have many patients to be seen in a crowded situation obviously 
your ability to perform an evaluation is going to be affected by 
it 
we try to provide the best care we can with the resources we 
have marcos said 
robert hayes spokesman for the coalition for the homeless 
estimated that new york has 10000 homeless people who are also 
mentally ill 
the real story is that mentally ill people are routinely turned 
away from psychiatric hospitals for lack of beds hayes said 
that plays a big role in the horrors of street life in new york 
and these horrors are going to continue until there are more 
psychiatric beds 
pearson said he hopes something good comes of his colleagues 
death 
she was an incredibly bright happy person and im not just 
saying that anybody who knew her knows what im talking about he 
said maybe something will change because of her

a vietnamese official arrived unannounced in 
beijing on saturday for what is believed to be the first highlevel 
talks since 1979 between china and vietnam on the cambodian conflict 
both sides attempted to keep the visit secret and officials 
refused comment on the arrival 
china which arms guerrillas fighting vietnamese troops in 
cambodia previously said it would not begin talks unless vietnam 
moves to end its 10yearold occupation 
however foreign reporters peeking through a window at beijings 
old airport saw chinese and vietnamese officials greet a man 
resembling vice foreign minister dinh nho liem 
the man ducked into a chinese foreign ministry car which sped 
away the vietnamese ambassador to china nguyen minh phuong came 
out the front door of the airport and followed in another car 
liems name was also on the flight log of air china flight no 
974 which flew out of bangkok on saturday japanese journalists 
reported seeing liem at the bangkok airport 
the ministry of foreign affairs earlier reserved a vip room at 
the beijing international airport for a vietnamese guest but 
canceled it on short notice an airport employee said on condition 
of anonymity 
in a possible attempt to keep the visit secret chinese officials 
switched the welcoming venue to the old airport which shares 
runways with the newer one 
earlier this week a top cambodian resistance official said 
china at the request of the soviet union agreed to its first 
highlevel talks with vietnam since late 1979 
the deal also involved the soviet union opening direct talks with 
cambodian resistance leader prince norodom sihanouk said prince 
norodom ranariddh his son and representative in thailand he spoke 
over resistance radio and the text was obtained thursday 
thai officials also said they knew of the agreement but would 
give no details 
the vietnamese visit follows negotiations in august between china 
and the soviet union on the cambodian conflict a major stumbling 
block for improving longstrained ties between moscow and beijing 
relations between the two communist giants have been undergoing a 
thaw in recent months soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
will come to china next month to pave the way for the first 
chinesesoviet summit in 30 years 
ties between china and vietnam allies during the vietnam war 
deteriorated when vietnam toppled the prochinese khmer rouge in 
cambodia in 1978 china and vietnam fought a border war early the 
next year 
the khmer rouge ruled cambodia since 1975 in a reign of terror 
that left at least 1 million people dead the group is now one of 
three major groups fighting the vietnambacked government of 
cambodia 
china now arms the khmer rouge and other rebels there the united 
states backs the two noncommunist groups 
in recent weeks better chinesevietnam relations began to seem 
possible 
on jan 7 china said a vietnamese proposal to withdraw all its 
troops from cambodia by september was a step forward 
president heng samrin of cambodia says 50000 vietnamese troops 
are in cambodia but western intelligence officials and rebels put 
the number much higher 
vietnam still insists on measures to prevent the khmer rouge from 
returning to power however china has refused to exclude the khmer 
rouge from a future cambodian government

the government on saturday acknowledged 
that us documents link some west german companies to an alleged 
chemical warfare plant in libya but said there still was no proof 
west german laws were broken 
west german experts returned home from washington after examining 
us documents on the libyan plant last week 
government spokesman friedhelm ost said the us information 
indicates a number of german firms as well as companies from 
several nations made deliveries for the libyan chemical plant but 
officials found no evidence to warrant prosecution 
washington contends it has proof that the new libyan plant at 
rabta is a chemical weapons factory libyan leader moammar gadhafi 
maintains the plant manufactures pharmaceuticals 
a preliminary evaluation of the documents provided by the 
americans shows that the material is nothing beyond what we already 
know about so far and would not stand up in court ost said in a 
statement he did not identify the firms named in the documents 
government officials previously said even with indications of 
involvement in the libyan plant proof would still be needed that 
west german companies broke their countrys export laws 
west german authorities have launched investigations into two 
companies that allegedly were involved in the libyan project 
imhausenchemie of lahr and the nowdefunct ibi engineering of 
frankfurt 
ost said saturday that after examining confiscated ibi company 
documents authorities have not yet found hard evidence the company 
broke any laws 
west german officials at first cleared the two companies but 
later said they cannot exclude that german companies may have 
been involved in the libyan project 
alleged participation by german firms in the libyan plant has 
embarrassed the government and resulted in strained ties with the 
united states when the accusations first came to light through 
american newspapers german leaders complained about a us media 
campaign against their country 
the news magazine der spiegel on saturday reported that west 
german officials began receiving intelligence information about 
german complicity in the plant in 1986 and not last fall as 
government authorities have maintained 
the magazine said several times the west german federal 
intelligence service urgently and concretely pointed to 
participation by german firms 
the federal government did not take reports by the german and 
american secret services seriously said spiegel which did not 
identify its sources 
but ost said the government followed up on all information 
supplied to it by its intelligence forces without delay 
a leading federal lawmaker for the free democrats junior 
partners in chancellor helmut kohls coalition government on 
saturday called for a parliamentary investigation into the 
governments handling of the libyan chemical plant affair 
the scandal is growing every day and damages the image of 
the federal republic hildegart hammbruecher told saarlandischer 
rundfunk radio in an interview 
der spiegel also said the magazine has information that west 
german engineers are assisting libya in improving and rebuilding 
military aircraft 
the magazine said the engineers worked for cttl of liechtenstein 
a sister company of the bavarian firm intec

a major manufacturer of helicopters said 
it is looking into building a commuter helicopter that could carry 
up to 100 passengers 
officials at sikorsky aircraft based here said they have been 
actively studying the feasibility of such a helicopter which they 
call a vlct for very large civil transport for the past year 
such a jumbo helicopter could offer a solution to the problem of 
highway traffic jams and airport congestion sikorsky officials said 
the effort began in earnest last year as a continuation of 
research of the past 20 years said robert kelly director of 
commercial marketing in remarks prepared for release sunday at a 
helicopter trade show in new orleans 
we are producing military helicopters today that can easily 
transport 20000 pounds at good speeds over long stage lengths 
kelly said that could equate to 100 passengers and lots of 
reserves if that should turn out to be the optimum 
using existing technology such a helicopter could be introduced 
by the turn of the century kelly said sikorsky officials envision 
a helicopter that would carry 75 to 100 people on short to 
mediumrange trips at about 150 mph 
sikorsky said it is does not intend to introduce such a craft 
before the year 2000 to allow time for refinements of equipment and 
for cities and states to construct suitable heliports 
sikorsky noted that the federal aviation administration has 
estimated that airport congestion will become a critical problem 
nationwide by the year 2000 similar projections also have been made 
for europe and japan 
sikorsky primarily a defense contractor is a leading 
manufacturer of military helicopters including the black hawk and 
the seahawk which are produced for the us navy and the royal 
australian air force

george bush getting in a last round of 
fishing before becoming president regaled reporters saturday with 
his account of landing a 13pound fighting bonefish the day before 
he said he even got a photograph 
the fishing really is excellent just wonderful bush told 
reporters watching his party depart from a private dock before 8 am 
bush caught no bonefish saturday although he pulled in 25 smaller 
fish he came back after nearly 10 hours on the water saying windy 
conditions had hampered the fishing 
bush caught seven different types of fish ladyfish snapper 
jack perch trout catfish and a twofoot shark and all were 
thrown back 
perhaps the most interesting catch of the day was by bush buddy 
fred zeder the former ambassador to micronesia who snagged a 
seagull as he was trying to cast his line the gull bobbed around 
like a kite but soon was reeled in unsnagged and flew off 
the presidentelect said work including preparation of his 
speech for fridays inaugural could wait until he returned to 
washington sunday 
however bushs transition office in washington announced several 
appointments including david c mulford as under secretary of the 
treasury for international affairs and anna maria perez as barbara 
bushs press secretary 
when a tourist perched on an adjacent pier told bush she was from 
england he asked puckishly think prime minister margaret 
thatcher would like a little of this bonefishing action 
bush fishing off a 17foot skiff in shallow waters said he 
reeled in a 13pound bonefish friday after it stripped off 150 yards 
of line after weighing it bush said he threw the fish back in 
we got a picture word of honor said bush producing the 
roll of film and instructing an aide to release it if it looks 
good 
the vice president on his third fishing or hunting trip since 
his election said these are pound for pound id say as 
fighting a fish as there is in the world 
it really is amazing what they do continued bush then you 
take them in weigh them and hold them in the water and stroke them 
so that they can escape without some shark getting them it really 
is very wonderful 
senator simpson caught a goodsized redfish about 10 or 12 
or 13 pounds also said bush 
alan simpson the republican senator from wyoming added a few 
embellishments 
you cant keep up with him we had fish all over the place i 
caught a redfish he caught a bonefish my redfish was one of the 
largest ever caught in these particular waters said simpson 
bush rolled his eyes i didnt point out i have to put up with 
this all day long out there he said 
bush used an 8pound test line to reel in his catch friday which 
he called the sporting thing to do theres no machine reeling 
them in he said 
this is bushs fifth trip since 1980 to this resort halfway down 
the keys but he deflated local boosters hopes friday when he said 
he will not establish a winter white house here or anyplace else 
treasury secretary nicholas f brady was also fishing with bush 
but no work was on the agenda 
asked if he would steal some time to work on the inaugural 
speech bush said tomorrow night i start ive already started

workers at two textile factories in central 
poland threatened to go on strike monday if management fails to meet 
demands for higher pay a regional solidarity leader said saturday 
local solidarity committees support the wage demands but the 
strike call has upset the solidarity regional executive committee 
that backs union leader lech walesas position that it is now time 
to focus on reviving the banned union 
we are not happy with those strikes it looks like a 
provocation or perhaps a safety valve that releases some pressure 
from the boiling pot said ryszard kostrzewa of the executive 
committee for the lodz region where the factories are located 
the threat of further strikes comes on the eve of a communist 
party plenum scheduled to begin monday 
a government source insisting on anonymity has said communist 
leaders are prepared to offer to legalize solidarity if the union 
agrees to respect a law limiting wildcat strikes enter into talks 
and help the government draft political reforms 
walesa said saturday he could not confirm the report that 
communist leaders are preparing to offer to legalize solidarity but 
he called such recognition simply the obvious solution 
the needs of society are so obvious and there are so many 
important problems he said 
solidarity was outlawed in 1982 following imposition of martial 
law in poland and has been struggling for legalization ever since 
in recent months there have been clear signs of increasing 
tolerance of the union and walesa with the government hoping to win 
the help of the opposition as it attempts to revitalize the economy 
and reform the political system 
solidarity officials say workers at the emfor factory in lodz 
about 82 miles southwest of warsaw are demanding a pay raise of 32 
cents an hour 
in nearby pabianice workers at the technical fabrics factory 
want raises to compensate for losses of up to 10 a month workers 
say resulted from new wage regulations introduced in the factory 
four months ago the union said 
lodz the center of polands textile industry and one of the 
countrys most polluted cities was the scene of reported work 
stoppages wednesday and thursday when workers at morfeo factory 
outside the city demanded a pay raise of 50 percent 
management offered a pay increase of 20 percent friday but the 
strike did not continue kostrzewa said the workers also called on 
management to improve working conditions and legalize solidarity in 
their list of 11 demands 
in another development an opposition spokeswoman said police 
used batons and dogs friday to break up a demonstration of about 300 
people demanding the legalization of solidarity in the southwestern 
city walbrzych 
maria pinior a spokeswoman connected to both solidarity and the 
banned polish socialist party in nearby wroclaw said about 50 
people were arrested

two pilots of a salvadoran airliner were 
arrested saturday for allegedly trying to smuggle eight guns to el 
salvador in their luggage said a us customs official 
the guns were found in suitcases being taken out of a los angeles 
international airport terminal by two taca international airlines 
flight attendants during a 1230 am search of the flights 
luggage said ed adamson who heads the local customs office 
the bags held seven automatic handguns and a 12gauge 
semiautomatic shotgun nicknamed the streetsweeper adamson said 
the boeing 737 was detained but the passengers were able to leave 
aboard another flight said adamson 
the planes captain francisco jerez 30 and the copilot 
francisco panameno 29 both of el salvador were arrested for 
investigation of violating the neutrality act and scheduled for 
arraignment tuesday the act forbids the exportation of firearms 
without state department approval 
investigators had not determined for what purpose the guns were 
intended adamson said 
the airliner was held at the airport while us authorities 
considered whether to seize it but the airline was cooperating and 
did not appear to be connected to the alleged smuggling said 
adamson 
were not at liberty to make any comment about it said a man 
at tacas los angeles office who did not identify himself and 
referred calls to a regional manager in new orleans a reservations 
agent there said the regional office was closed until sunday morning 
the search for the guns was prompted by a tip received by agents 
on friday that the flight crew would attempt to smuggle firearms 
adamson said 
agents conducted an intense search of baggage and people but 
could not locate the pilots bags he said 
a short time later an agent spotted two taca flight attendants 
leaving the terminal with bags with the pilots names on them 
the flight attendants said they had been instructed by the pilot 
to take the suitcases to his hotel and agents believe they did not 
know what they held adamson said

dozens of midwestern skinheads converged here 
saturday for a weekend of meetings marches and partying all with 
the goal of fighting the racism and violence espoused by rival 
skinhead groups 
we want to unite all the antiracist skinheads said brandon 
sanford of the minneapolis baldies an intense 18yearold who has 
skinhead tattooed across the back of his shorn head 
were here to talk about what real skinheads are all about 
he said we dont want the racist people to use the skinhead image 
as a recruiting tool 
youths from chicago milwaukee kansas nebraska and ohio most 
in the skinhead uniform of shaved heads tattoos boots and flight 
jackets traveled to minneapolis over the weekend meeting on street 
corners and fast food restaurants in the citys uptown section 
the talk was of music old friendships and their fight against 
the racist skinheads in their areas 
were trying to organize so people know that being a skinhead 
is not about hating people said brian lauer a member of brew 
city skins a milwaukee group that formed to counter a group of 
racist skinheads in that city 
lauer was among some 100 skinheads attending a strategy session 
at a local library saturday there were plans for a sunday march 
with other groups and a concert featuring local skinhead bands 
sunday night 
at saturdays meeting skinheads from eight cities told of their 
crews or groups and their fight against white power skinheads 
in their area 
theres only one kind of skinhead and theres bald nazis 
said dave a skinhead from des moines iowa 
the group agreed to form a network to trade information and to 
offer assistance to individual groups in various locations who are 
fighting racist skinheads the ku klux klan and nazis 
we have to work together to make them the racist skinheads 
disappear said corky a black skinhead from chicago 
the past year has been filled with headlines of the violent 
racist and antisemitic actions of some skinhead groups around the 
country 
an ethiopian immigrant was killed in november by skinheads 
wielding baseball bats in portland ore synagogues have been 
desecrated in dallas chicago and san diego skinheads were involved 
in a televised melee with blacks on the geraldo rivera show 
these skinheads spout a philosophy of white separatism and 
fascism they talk of creating a white nation wear nazi swastikas 
and complain of a government controlled by zionists 
but in many cities they are opposed often in street brawls by 
other skinheads who say their racist activities are a perversion of 
the original philosophies of the skinhead movement started by 
english working class youth who listened to ska a racially mixed 
music and whose ranks included blacks 
being a skinhead means being hard working being for yourself 
having a pride in your country and pride in yourself it doesnt 
matter what your color is said eli simbura an 18yearold member 
of the baldies whose cramped apartment served as a rallying place 
for the skinheads attending the weekend activities 
the antidefamation league of bnai brith claims there may be as 
many as 2000 racist skinheads in 21 states and a check in several 
cities shows at least as many antiracist skinheads but an accurate 
estimate is difficult because skinheads often move from city to city 
skinheads pride themselves in being violent in support of their 
ideas and their friendships the baldies whose 40 to 50 members 
include blacks hispanics and orientals have warred with the white 
knights a smaller group of local racist skinheads 
we are violent simbura said proudly we believe in direct 
action

georgetown university basketball coach john 
thompson walked off the court at game time saturday night 
protesting a toughened ncaa rule on scholarships with the help of a 
standing ovation from fans 
thompsons dramatic gesture came just before the tipoff of 
saturday nights big east mens basketball game between his 
seventhranked hoyas and boston college 
as he headed for the dressing room thompson did not openly 
acknowledge the cheering crowd at capital centre he went to his car 
and drove away without speaking to reporters assistant coach mike 
riley took over and the game continued 
the move was to protest a new national collegiate athletic 
association rule that will impose harsher academic requirements for 
incoming freshmen to qualify for athletic scholarships after being 
defeated tuesday the proposal passed wednesday by a 163154 vote at 
the ncaa convention in san francisco 
without being specific thompson said friday that his boycott 
would continue until i am satisfied that something has been 
done he called the new rule a tremendous tragedy because of 
its potential effect on the ability of poor youths to get a college 
education 
proposal 42 which is to go into effect next year would prevent 
high school students who meet only part of the ncaas entrance 
standards from being eligible for an athletic scholarship their 
first year in college 
it applies to athletes who fail to get both a c average in 11 
key subjects in high school and a minimum score on one of two 
standardized college entrance tests either a 700 out of a possible 
1600 on the scholastic aptitude test or a 15 out of 36 on the 
american college test a previous rule allowed those who met either 
of the two standards to get a scholarship though they couldnt play 
on a team as freshmen 
figures released in 1987 put the nationwide average sat score at 
906 and the average act score at 187 critics have charged that the 
tests are biased abainst minorities who tend to score lower than 
whites 
thompson who is black purposely refused to label the proposal 
as racist but did call it discriminatory 
im beginning to feel that a kid with a low socioeconomic 
background has been invited to dinner had dessert and is now being 
asked to leave he said 
temple basketball coach john chaney one of many college coaches 
who expressed support for thompson said instead of considering 
some of these proposals they plan to punish the youngsters punish 
these kids who come from a poor background and have a poor 
educational opportunity 
but dave cawood ncaa assistant executive director said in a 
statement that those who voted for the rule considered it a means 
to strengthen the academic entrance requirements for freshmen not 
a racial issue 
thompson is one of the countrys top college basketball coaches 
he was coach of the 1988 us mens basketball team which won the 
bronze medal and in 1984 his georgetown team won the ncaa 
championship 
boston college coach jim obrien applauded thompsons action 
saying his lofty stature among coaches helps make it a very 
effective demonstration 
i dont think that just saying anything gets it done obrien 
said in his position by doing what hes doing he will draw more 
attention to it he feels something needs to be done right now

scarletrobed holy men arrived on 
magnificent chariots and plunged into the confluence of three rivers 
on saturday the beginning of a mystical celebration of a rare 
planetary alignment 
chanting hymns the first bathers on saturday offered milk and 
flowers as the sevenweek holy fair known as kumbh mela began 
millions are expected to take part 
it is something seen to be believed it is something nearly 
impossible for us to understand said wade dazey an american 
tourist who spent 1500 to come from california to this central 
indian city to see the fair 
you cant see anything similar to this anywhere in the world 
it is worth the money and time said dazey a lecturer of 
religious studies at the university of california 
an estimated 30 million to 40 million people are expected to 
bathe at the confluence of the ganga jamuna and mythical saraswati 
rivers during the fair which takes its name from a fight between 
gods and demons over a pot of nectar 
drops of nectar are believed to have fallen at the confluence 
and hindus believe a bath at the spot will give them salvation from 
what they consider a long cycle of birth and rebirth 
kumbh in hindi means pot and mela means fair 
the most auspicious time to seek salvation according to the 
hindu faith is when jupiter is in taurus and the sun and moon are 
in capricorn a configuration that occurs every 12 years 
the day did not begin on a auspicious note for a group of 50 
pilgrims who fell into the river ganga when the two boats they were 
in capsized there were no casualties an official said 
holy men dressed in saffron scarlet white and gold robes were 
given precedence at the bathing site 
they arrived on magnificent chariots pulled by followers and on 
elephants and camels adorned with feathers bells ornaments and 
marigold garlands brass bands playing popular music marched in 
front of the procession as the holy men blessed the throngs of 
people waiting to take a dip 
some of the holy men wore loincloths and others had only ash 
smeared over their bodies they bathed in temperatures as low as 43 
degrees with their hair either shorn off or tied in knots over 
their heads 
the nagas holy men who live as naked recluses were given even 
greater precedence and bathed at dawn 
the logistics of the holding the fair almost defy comprehension 
at least 11000 police officers are constantly on duty to monitor 
the 3000acre fair area according to jagannath dwivedi the chief 
administrator of the event 
the police regulate the movements of bathers and attempt to ease 
tensions between rival sects of holy men who have been known to use 
their spears and lances against each other 
there is always tension and you never know when a minor clash 
will snowball into a battle dwivedi said 
naval divers patrol the river front to prevent pilgrims from 
drowning 
special attempts are made to keep pilgrims moving steadily to 
avoid stampedes he said at least 800 pilgrims died at the fair 
held in 1954 and 50 were trampled to death in 1986 at a similar 
fair in the city of hardwar upstream on the ganges 
hardwar and the cities of ujjain and nasik are other places in 
india where hindus believe drops of heavenly nectar had fallen but 
the allahabad fair is considered the best 
arrangements to park 200000 vehicles and 5000 boats have been 
made and authorities have run 400 special trains to bring pilgrims 
to the city dwivedi said 
sprawling canvas tents have been erected to accommodate the 
millions of pilgrims who will participate in the fair 
about 13000 gallons of milk 10 tons of butter and 5 tons of 
cheese will be supplied to the pilgrims daily authorities have 
stocked 10000 tons of wheat 4000 tons of rice and 2000 tons of 
sugar for distribution dwivedi said 
consumption of meat and liquor is banned at pilgrimage centers 
during hindu festivals

people braved freezing rain in cincinnati to attend a rally that did 
not involve blocking clinics or being subject to arrest 
our conviction about human dignity tells us that there is 
somethng in every human person tht is sacred that is inviolable 
that is not ours to dispose of as we see fit roman catholic 
archbishop daniel e pilarczyk told the crowd saturday

center said sgt raymond odonnell a police spokesman about 225 
demonstrators were arrested 
they were lying down and praying in seated positions 
odonnell said most of the people had to be carried we would 
load some people onto the bus then other people would run out into 
the street and lie in front of the wheels of the bus 
about 20 to 30 prochoice activists demonstrated nearby without 
incident odonnell said 
later saturday evening about 100 prochoice activists 
demonstrated outside st patricks cathedral protesting what they 
called cardinal john oconnors support for operation rescue 
we understand that he is in political religious and 
philosophical agreement with the antichoice people said merle 
hoffman a founder of the new york prochoice coalition which 
organized the counterprotest and was one of the groups that sought 
the judges order 
but we question whether he approves of their terrorist 
tactics she said they are now blatantly defying a federal 
order 
the second biggest protest occurred at lincolns women services 
where police said 175 people were arrested most of them carried 
away on stretchers after they refused to walk 
seven people chained themselves together they used extrastrong 
steel locks but we have equipment that cuts through them like 
butter said police inspector richard mayronne

outside the sanger clinic police said 
us district judge robert ward issued a permanent injunction 
against the group on tuesday forbidding members to obstruct access 
to clinics that perform abortions in new york city

said the organization planned to seek a contempt charge against 
operation rescue

while waiting to be arrested for blocking the entrance of an 
abortion clinic 
we got here at 630 this morning we shut the place down no 
ladies have had abortions today look at the lives weve saved 
said anthony marquize director of united for life 
terri bartlett executive director of planned parenthood 
disagreed 
theyre not preventing abortions theyre just delaying them 
and hurting women who already have had to go through a great deal to 
make this decision she said

increases in labor productivity and a cut in the 
number of production workers boosted the soviet national income by 
44 percent in 1988 but the economy still fell short of its growth 
target tass said saturday 
in a separate report the official news agency said soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev called for major changes in the farm 
sector but defended the current system of giant collective and 
state farms 
in a report on a meeting saturday of the council of ministers or 
soviet cabinet tass said officials revealed some 1988 economic 
statistics 
the national income a measure of economic activity that differs 
from gross national product by excluding some indexes including the 
value of some services increased by 44 percent in 1988 and by 36 
percent for the period of 19861988 tass said 
the growth of national income was assured by an increase in 
labor productivity with a reduction in 19871988 of the number of 
people engaged in material production tass said 
however it said the national income still fell short of the plan 
for 1988 by 133 billion rubles or 21 billion it did not give the 
planned figure 
the ministers sharply criticized the countrys inability to 
supply the population with enough fruit vegetables and other 
foodstuffs 
no stability in the development of agricultural production and 
in the operation of processing branches had been achieved so far 
tass reported the populations requirements for many foodstuffs 
are not met big purchases of food abroad have to be made 
the cost of those purchases for the last three years was 48 
billion it said 
gorbachev said a longawaited plenary meeting of the communist 
party central committee on agriculture will take place in march 
the soviet president is pushing to increase farmers interest in 
their work by organizing them on the basis of smaller groups and 
giving them more responsibility and a chance to earn more money for 
harder work 
but in remarks friday to agricultural specialists gorbachev 
defended the giant collective and state farms that were organized 
during stalinist times the remarks were carried saturday by tass 
those who do not trust the collective and state farms have 
simply failed to think everything over to the end and failed to sort 
things out tass quoted gorbachev as saying 
it is precisely now that our big collective and state farms 
will be able to work in the right way and in the interests of rural 
workers and it means for the benefit of the country because we 
reveal their potential in boosting the output of products

the government on saturday offered one of 
its major hotels the baghdad sheraton for sale to the private 
sector 
staterun newspapers carried an advertisement offering the 
307room hotel to a private company with at least 150 million in 
capital the hotel is wholly owned by the government and run by the 
international sheraton chain 
the ruling revolutionary command council in september abolished 
the state tourism authority and decided to sell all of its assets 
including five major hotels in baghdad 
the move to sell tourist facilities is a part of president saddam 
husseins drive to develop the private sector in what has been a 
staunch socialist economy 
selling state assets is seen as a means of overcoming massive 
government debts and stimulating the economy battered by the 
8yearold war with iran that ended with a ceasefire in august 
the sheraton chain runs another hotel in iraqs southern port of 
basra that was badly damaged by iranian shelling 
sheraton officials said they have no idea whether it was also up 
for sale but they confirmed the government has announced it would 
be on the market soon

the soviet union plans to put a huge 
telescope in orbit and to set up a biotechnology laboratory with an 
american chemical company soviet scientists said saturday 
vadim t ivanov director of the shemiakin institute for 
bioorganic chemistry said he plans to sign an agreement with the 
monsanto co in st louis to establish a biotechnology laboratory 
in the soviet union 
ivanov is a member of a delegation of highranking soviet 
researchers attending the annual meeting of the american association 
for the advancement of science 
research at the biotechnology laboratory would focus on nervous 
system biology growth hormones to boost livestock production and 
help underdeveloped humans and genetic engineering to make crops 
resist pests salt and drought ivanov said 
soviet scientists also hope to place an optical telescope with a 
10meter mirror in orbit by about the year 2000 although the 
proposal doesnt yet have government approval said nikolay s 
kardashev deputy director of the soviet institute for space 
research 
the soviet telescope would be far larger than the 15 billion 
hubble space telescope which the united states plans to launch from 
a space shuttle in february 1990 it has a mirror diameter of 24 
meters or about 945 inches 
kardashev also said that despite some earlier problems his 
countrys phobos 2 space probe launched last year toward an 
encounter with the martian moon phobos seems to be working well as 
it heads toward the red planet 
we hope its ok no problems he said the soviets earlier 
lost all contact with a similar probe phobos 1 
this is the second year a soviet delegation has visited the 
annual meeting of the aaas which publishes the journal science and 
bills itself as the leading general scientific group in the united 
states some 10000 scientists are expected at the meeting which 
concludes thursday 
the soviet scientists cited numerous examples of ussoviet 
scientific cooperation in each of their fields and expressed hope 
for more 
its very good improving international cooperation kardashev 
said 
soviet scientists also want to boost cooperation with us 
earthquake experts especially in faultridden california following 
the devastating quake in armenia said konstantin frolov who headed 
the soviet delegation 
frolov vice president of the ussr academy of science also said 
it was unlikely the death toll from the earthquake exceeded 30000 
nobody knows now absolutely perfectly how many died in the 
dec 7 earthquake but 25000 or 30000 may be so frolov said 
for weeks after the 69magnitude quake in northwest armenia 
soviet officials estimated the death toll at 55000 late last month 
they downgraded it to about 25000 after nearly that many bodies 
were recovered from collapsed buildings 
however american engineers returning from an armenia visit said 
jan 4 said thousands of bodies never will be found and said they 
thought probably 60000 died during the quake 
sixtythousand this is too much frolov said 
frolov often speaking through an interpreter called the 
armenian quakes a very sad and difficult situation and said the 
soviets want to learn how to speed postdisaster rescue and relief 
efforts protect against earthquake damage better predict temblors 
and improve building methods 
ivanov citing the soviets interest in cooperative biotechnology 
research said the joint sovietmonsanto lab would be located at his 
institute and that monsanto would help equip it members of both 
organizations would be on a board overseeing the lab he added 
details havent been worked out about how profits would be shared 
from any products developed at the lab but patents should be 
joint patents he added

tass quoted official afghan news agency bakhtar as saying the 
helicopters were carrying leaders of extremist organizations 
foreign military advisers and highranking pakistani officers to the 
area when they landed at a farm in nangarhar province on monday 
soviet and afghan media often refer to the usbacked 
antigovernment guerrillas as extremists 
tass said the pakistani mechanized column reached the same area 
on the same day bringing armed people arms and ammunition the 
sovietbacked afghan military attacked damaging or destroying the 
two helicopters and some armored cars it said

casualty figures there was no immediate word from the pakistani 
government or afghan guerrillas based in pakistan 
the pakistani armed forces committed an unprecedented action of 
aggression against the republics of afghanistan tass quoted the 
afghan military command as saying 
islamabads actions not only flagrantly violate the letter and 
spirit of the geneva agreements but also enter into direct 
contradiction with the universally recognized norms of international 
relations it said afghanistan made a formal protest to pakistani 
diplomats in kabul 
antimarxist resistance fighters who oppose kabuls prosoviet 
government operate out of bases inside pakistan and near the border 
afghanistan and the soviet union repeatedly have accused the 
united states and pakistan of violating the april 14 geneva 
agreement by continuing to supply the resistance with weapons 
under the agreement the soviet union is to withdraw its 100000 
soldiers from afghanistan by feb 15 half of the soldiers were 
withdrawn between may 15 and aug 15 but soviet diplomats have said 
they might not meet the final deadline because of continued 
interference by pakistan and the united states 
in another development guerrilla leader sibghatullah mojaddidi 
said his alliance plans to announce a provisional government within 
a month the saudi arabian newspaper okaz reported saturday 
mojaddidi spokesman for a coalition of seven pakistanbased 
afghan guerrilla groups said in an interview with okaz that his 
group would not object to the return of afghanistans deposed king 
zahir shah 
the former monarch has lived in italy since his overthrow in 1973 
the guerrillas are demanding power be turned over to them 
exclusively after the soviet union withdraws its remaining troops 
but the soviet union which sent troops into afghanistan in 1979 
in support of a marxist regime insists president najibs government 
should stay on after the military withdrawal

the artistic and musical director of the new opera 
of the bastille has been fired in a dispute over duties and salary 
and a stage director said saturday he will refuse to direct the 
operas debut presentation 
daniel barenboim a conductor and concert pianist was ousted 
friday after contending an agreement he signed with the former 
conservative government of jacques chirac guaranteed his position 
and a salary of more than 1 million 
but pierre berge president of the association of theaters of the 
paris opera told a news conference friday the accord was signed 
in haste and was not valid 
the may 5 accord said barenboim should receive a salary of 
between 11 million and 12 million berge appointed in august 
offered barenboim a 570000 salary as musical director 
barenboim told europe 1 radio he considered the development a 
breach of contract and threatened to sue 
berge said allowing barenboim to be artistic and musical director 
was giving him too much power 
it is a little bizarre and that doesnt exist in practically 
any country of the world berge said 
several artistic personalities including stage director patrice 
chereau composer pierre boulez and singer jessy norman signed a 
message to president francois mitterrand and minister of culture 
jack lang saying they would not be involved in the programs 
barenboim planned unless his duties were restored 
barenboims firing may throw in to question the opening date of 
the bastille opera set for early next year 
on saturday chereau said on fr3 television that he will not 
direct the first show at the bastille opera because of barenboims 
firing

ceremonies for carlucci and taft will be small and lowkey

bernhard goetz who was sentenced to one year in 
jail for shooting four black men in a subway with an unlicensed gun 
says the violence resulted from the deterioration of society 
the 41yearold electronics engineer was also ordered friday to 
pay a 5000 fine by state judge stephen crane who said goetz had 
shown no remorse for his actions 
i do feel this case is really more about the deterioration of 
society than it is about me said goetz whose 1984 shootings of 
the men he said were trying to rob him prompted debates on racism 
selfdefense and vigilantism

rural interstate highway accidents killed 352 
more people than a year earlier in states where the speed limit was 
raised to 65 mph while death tolls on other roads decreased 
slightly according to a government report 
the 19 percent increase in deaths occurred over a period that 
varied for each state depending on when drivers were allowed to go 
faster said the report friday by the national highway traffic 
safety administration congress authorized the increased limit 
beginning april 2 1987 and 38 states have adopted it for their 
rural interstates 
highway deaths in those states on urban interstates and other 
roads where the 55 mph limit remained totaled 21366 for the same 
period in 1986 and 21231 in 1987 the report said fatalities in 
states that raised the speed limit increased by an average nearly 
three times as high as in 10 states that kept the limit at 55 on all 
roads the report showed

george washington trembled as he delivered his 
first inaugural address 
abraham lincoln was thrown off his stride by a spectator falling 
from a tree 
harry truman was 29 minutes late taking the oath of office 
now its george bushs turn 
from the 13star flags to the metal detectors everything is just 
about ready for fridays repetition of the ceremony franklin d 
roosevelt called a day of national consecration 
the inauguration of an american president has in its 200year 
history been marked by eloquent prose adorned by poetry buried 
under a blizzard pelted with rain and on two occasions visited by 
such harsh weather that participants had to move indoors 
it has seen reunions of theodore roosevelts rough riders of the 
battery that cpl truman led in world war i and of the pt boat crew 
that john f kennedy commanded in the pacific 
the metal detectors are a new touch in keeping with the 
terroristconscious washington of 1989 but security is nothing new 
to inaugurals 
when lincoln took the oath in 1861 two riflemen lurked at each 
window of the capitol wings flanking the inaugural stand watching 
for any interference wrote biographer carl sandburg 
when franklin d roosevelt assumed office in the depth of the 
depression in 1933 there were machine guns at the capitol 
both lincoln and roosevelt were in the stovepipe hat era of 
inaugural dress which prevailed until 1952 when dwight eisenhower 
opted for homburgs kennedy returned to the high silk hat tradition 
but more recent presidents have usually worn business suits 
president reagan wore morning clothes with striped pants and tails 
for his first inaugural in 1981 
the weather also has varied it rained on fdrs inaugurals in 
1933 and 1937 as well as on lincolns second one in 1865 
in 1909 washington was in the grip of a blizzard so william 
howard taft took the oath in the senate chamber instead of outside 
as usual 
in 1961 it was 28 degrees at noon but the ceremonies went on at 
the east front of the capitol as scheduled that was when poet 
robert frost blinded by the sunlight reflected from fallen snow 
was unable to read the especially written poem he had brought with 
him and summoned up from memory an old one the gift outright 
such as we were we gave ourselves outright to the land 
vaguely realizing westward 
in 1985 with the temperatures in the dangerously cold range 
reagan canceled all outdoor activities for his second inaugural 
the new york city commission on the bicentennial of the 
constitution which is also observing the bicentennial of 
washingtons first inauguration says the best account of it was 
given by an observer named willam maclay according to maclay the 
father of his country trembled and several times could scarce 
make out to read as he delivered his address to a joint session of 
congress at federal hall in new york 
by washingtons second inauguration after the capital had moved 
to philadelphia he was advised by his cabinet to hold a simple 
ceremony in the senate chamber and travel to it without form 
attended by such gentlemen as he choose he chose to ride alone 
in his carriage 
at lincolns inauguration in 1861 according to an observer 
quoted in sandburgs biography at one point in his speech mr 
lincoln was thrown completely off his balance for a moment by a 
crash not far in front of him followed by something which for an 
instant looked like a struggle a spectator falling out of a 
tree 
as for truman he wrote in his memoirs that the preinauguration 
gathering in the capitol rotunda took so long that the marine band 
didnt strike up hail to the chief until 1214 pm and it 
wasnt until 1229 that he actually took the oath 
it didnt matter he had been president since noon anyway the 
constitution provides that the old presidents term ends and the new 
presidents term begins then not with the speaking of the oath

the prosecutor quit for a possible mayoral bid 
his aides botched the first key case to reach trial and the biggest 
corporate target of their fraud probe offered a top job to a former 
government adversary 
no it wasnt the latest episode of la law but the twists 
in the wall street insider trading scandal this past week could well 
provide some reallife fodder for hollywood writers of the glitzy 
television series 
it began last tuesday when politically ambitious manhattan us 
attorney rudolph w giuliani architect of a massive 
securitiesfraud crackdown over the past few years announced he was 
resigning at the end of the month 
although giulianis departure was expected because of numerous 
dropped hints he might run for new york mayor it came at a 
particularly crucial time in the wall street investigation for which 
he is largely responsible 
giuliani will be leaving more than a halfdozen important cases 
unresolved along with increasing acrimony over what defense lawyers 
call his brutal and sometimes careless tactics 
coincidentally those tactics backfired on his assistants just as 
giuliani was calling the press together at his downtown manhattan 
office to say farewell 
next door in federal court a judge decreed a mistrial in the 
stockmanipulation case against gaf corp and a senior company 
official the first key prosecution to reach the trial phase in the 
scandal 
us district judge mary johnson lowe said prosecutors broke the 
rules by failing to inform the defense that a key piece of evidence 
they introduced may have been altered 
a federal appeals court sided with her in ordering a new trial 
but warned the giuliani aide handling the case dont withhold any 
more evidence 
the departure of giuliani also signaled his evident failure to 
extract a plea bargain agreement from drexel burnham lambert incs 
highyield bond financier michael milken who has continued to 
assert his innocence although his employer capitulated last month 
drexel the biggest corporate target of giulianis crusade 
agreed dec 21 to plead guilty to six unspecified felonies pay a 
record 650 million in fines and restitution settle related 
litigation with the securities and exchange commission and cooperate 
in the governments expanding fraud probes 
as part of a move to cleanse its sullied image the firm 
announced last thursday it had offered the chairmans job to john 
shad the former sec chief who authorized the investigation that 
ensnared drexel in the first place 
it wasnt clear by the end of the week whether the offer would be 
accepted by shad who is now us ambassador to the netherlands but 
he was quoted in the wall street journal as saying any decision was 
subject to favorable resolution of drexels legal problems 
in other business and economic news this past week 
government statistics suggested sharp rises in consumer 
spending debt and inflation the federal reserve said consumer 
borrowing swelled at an 82 percent annual rate in november driven 
by creditcard purchases the commerce department said retail 
spending shot up 67 percent last year the fastest growth in four 
years and the labor department said wholesale prices rose 4 percent 
last year the highest rate since the early 1980s 
although the stock market appeared to be holding its own the 
postcrash uncertainty of the securities world was dramatically 
demonstrated by sharply different earnings situations at two of wall 
streets biggest firms bear stearns cos reported the highest 
quarterly profits in history while shearson lehman hutton inc said 
it would suffer a quarterly loss partly because of the tumbling 
value of its holdings in a troubled texas bank mcorp 
presidentelect bush suggested he might propose tax changes that 
would make debtfinanced takeovers less attractive but there was no 
evident slowdown in the merger news that colored 1988 cooke 
cablevision inc and the new york times co agreed to sell their 
cable tv operations in transactions totaling almost 2 billion and 
west pointpepperell inc reported sharply lower profits partly 
because of efforts to fight a 14 billion hostile takeover bid 
meanwhile on the cooked and and raw poultry fronts a judge 
ruled popeyes famous fried chicken may resume a 290 million 
takeover attempt of rival churchs fried chicken and holly farms 
corp set wednesday as the deadline for suitors tyson foods inc and 
conagra inc to submit new offers in a 1 billion bidding struggle

throughout the country aging bridges crack or 
sway as traffic clogs potholeridden roads and highways public 
dams and sewers cry out for more than a good plumbing job 
then theres the problem of trashing our trash 
as the nations infrastructure and public works systems show 
increasing signs of deterioration many public officials are 
expected to turn more and more to bonds at least thats what 
experts predicted this past week at a forum by municipal bond 
investors assurance corp a leading insurer of municipal bonds 
theres no way of escaping those needs youve got to get to 
work said forum participant austin v koenen managing director 
for shearson lehman hutton inc im very bullish on volume 
an mbia survey of municipal bond professionals predicted that 
volume of taxexempt municipal bonds most often used to finance 
infrastructure and other public projects will rise 7 percent in 
1989 to a record level 120 billion 
volume for the taxable municipal market should reach 28 billion 
this year compared with an estimated 22 billion in 1988 it said 
the survey suggested the biggest increase would come in bond 
issues for transportation estimating a 61 percent rise in volume 
over last year to 1408 billion however the biggest chunk of 
newly issued bonds an estimated 3004 billion this year vs 2838 
billion in 1988 will be used to refund old debt the survey said 
it predicted a 58 percent rise for gas and electric to 1214 
billion a 48 percent rise for water and sewer projects to 1267 
billion a 35 percent rise for hospitals to 1494 billion a 26 
percent rise for education to 2031 billion and just a fractional 
rise in housing to 1396 billion 
in last years general election alone voters nationwide approved 
a record 138 billion in state and local bond issues to finance 
projects ranging from road and bridge repairs to new prison 
facilities 
experts say the anticipated increase in bond volume is largely 
due to a steady reduction of federal assistance and the historical 
neglect of public works projects by some local and state governments 
until very recently the need to replenish and expand public 
works has been largely ignored john e petersen senior director 
of the government finance research center noted in a separate 
report on infrastructure needs and financing released at the forum 
by the early 1980s the infrastructure was wearing out faster 
than it was being replaced he said 
last year one of the nations busiest bridges the 
williamsburg which links manhattan and brooklyn was shut down for 
more than three months after inspectors discovered extensive 
corrosion the bridge was built in 1903 for bicycles and horsedrawn 
buggies when closed it was carrying more than 100000 vehicles and 
420 trains daily 
koenen noted that just a few weeks ago the 122yearold roebling 
suspension bridge which spans the ohio river in cincinnati was 
closed briefly after it began swaying under heavy pedestrian traffic 
following the bengalsseahawks football game but officials later 
declared the bridge safe 
supporting the mbia survey on projected volume petersens study 
found that capital investment needs are by far the greatest in the 
areas of highways streets and bridges next to that comes public 
transit water supply and distribution waste water treatment solid 
waste disposal and airports 
petersen also noted that changing population patterns will affect 
municipal bond issuance 
if the population trend continues 62 percent of the population 
will live in the south and west by 2010 compared with 48 percent in 
the 1970s he said thats going to stimulate spending needs 
another factor that could effect future municipal spending is the 
socalled greenhouse effect or the pollutioncaused warming of 
the atmosphere petersen said 
recent studies indicate that global warming with the resulting 
rise in water levels due to polar melting will affect economic 
activity and infrastructure spending in coastal areas

trading volume on the nations futures exchanges rose by a modest 
73 percent last year as a droughtdriven surge in agricultural 
hedging and speculation helped offset a slump in the stockindex 
futures markets 
volume on the 11 us futures exchanges totaled a record 295 
million contracts compared with 275 million contracts traded in 
1987 according to figures compiled by the futures industry 
association a trade group 
the increase compares with volume expansion of nearly 25 percent 
in 1987 and continues a growth pattern of more than two decades 
on futures exchanges people trade contracts for future 
deliveries of commodities such as grain cattle gold and crude 
oil and financial instruments including government securities 
stocks and foreign currencies 
commercial players those directly involved in producing buying 
or selling a particular commodity or financial instrument use 
futures to hedge against losses in their business dealings or 
financial investments speculators are investors who seek to profit 
from the fluctuating prices of the contracts 
agricultural futures trading in the united states dates back more 
than 120 years but financial futures introduced in the early 1970s 
now account for most trades 
last year financial futures trading accounted for 1391 million 
or nearly 57 percent of the total futures volume fia figures show 
more than half of those trades involved the chicago board of 
trades us treasury bond contract with a volume of 703 million 
a 52 percent increase over the previous year 
the chicago board of trade the oldest and largest us futures 
exchange also reported a dramatic resurgence in grain and soybean 
futures trading wheat volume soared by 75 percent soybean trading 
jumped 69 percent and corn volume surged 53 percent as the worst 
drought in 50 years withered crops and sent prices skyrocketing 
the drought of 1988 added significant increases to volume in 
agricultural trading said karsten mahlmann the exchanges 
chairman he said the exchanges more lightly traded agricultural 
options hedging instruments that are similar to futures also 
worked extremely well to manage risk in the agricultural markets 
overall volume at the chicago board of trade grew by 125 percent 
in 1988 the 20th consecutive year of record volume for the 
exchange with a total of 1431 million futures and options 
contracts traded the chicago board of trades share of the industry 
was 485 percent 
the nations secondlargest futures exchange the chicago 
mercantile exchange did not fare as well officials reported a 75 
percent decrease in volume mainly due to a 40 percent drop in 
stockindex futures trading at the exchange 
the chicago mercantile exchange trades the standard amp poors 500 
stockindex futures contract by far the industrys leading contract 
of its type despite the drop in volume officials blamed the decline 
on slack interest in stock market investing following the crash of 
october 1987 
but the chicago mercantile exchange also reported a 66 percent 
increase in foreign currency futures trading including a 63 
percent gain in its eurodollar futures contract the exchanges 
volume leader and a 20 percent leap in yen futures 
overall volume at the chicago mercantile exchange last year 
totaled 78 million contracts giving the exchange a 264 percent 
share of the industry 
the new york mercantile exchange home of crudeoil and platinum 
futures scored a 335 percent volume increase with 343 million 
contracts traded the volume placed the exchange third in the 
industry with an 116 percent share 
new yorks commodity exchange which specializes in gold silver 
and copper saw its volume shrink by 10 percent to 192 million for 
a 65 percent share of the industry 
new yorks coffee sugar amp cocoa exchange traded a record 10 
million contracts up from 63 million in 1988 for a 34 percent 
share 
trading volume at chicagos midamerica commodity exchange reached 
a record 34 million contracts a 44 gain over 1987 giving the 
exchange a 12 percent share of the industry 
the new york cotton exchange reported a record turnover of 31 
million cotton orangejuice and financial futures contracts a 19 
percent gain for a 1 percent share of the industry 
the remaining 14 percent of the industry volume was divided 
among the new york futures exchange the kansas city board of trade 
the minneapolis grain exchange and the chicago rice amp cotton 
exchange 
these figures do not include statistics from the chicago board 
options exchange which trades only financial options

these are uneasy times for stock market investors 
who key their strategies to the ups and downs of interest rates 
for the past several weeks interest rates have been rising 
especially in the shortterm money markets 
thats supposed to spell trouble for stocks by acting as a drag 
on the economy and by luring investors money away from the stock 
market and into interestbearing securities such as treasury bills 
but things havent worked out that way of late the stock market 
has rallied since midnovember recently reaching a series of new 
highs since the october 1987 crash 
a lot of money managers at investing institutions who have been 
shying away from stocks are now faced with the possibility that a 
train might be leaving the station without them 
a substantial corps of skeptics on wall street remains 
unimpressed by the markets recent strength 
some of these observers say it is merely a temporary 
manifestation of the january effect a muchdocumented tendency 
of stock prices to rise in the early stages of a new year 
in simplest terms the january effect is believed to arise from 
several seasonal factors including the cessation of yearend 
selling for tax purposes and infusions of new money into pension 
plans 
if this is the only driving force for the markets advance the 
rally is presumably in for a limited run 
a good many analysts however contend that the rise in stock 
prices is also the product of an abundance of fear and pessimism 
that still persists 
market rallies typically begin in periods of gloom and end when 
all the doubters have been converted to optimistic views and 
expended all their reserve buying power 
conservative attitudes of individuals 10 percent cash reserves 
in mutual funds and similar high cash positions of pension accounts 
are the best sources of support for the stock market said rao 
chalasani at prescott ball amp turben inc 
the us continues to be a place of value for foreign 
investors those dynamics will support the stock market as long as 
earnings hold up 
in the past week the dow jones average of 30 industrials rose 
3178 to 222607 
the new york stock exchange composite index gained 162 to 
15958 the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market 
climbed 235 to 38709 and the american stock exchange market value 
index was up 453 at 31593 
volume on the big board averaged 15357 million shares a day 
against 15339 million in the first week of 1989 
analysts who take a bullish view say there is another possible 
explanation for the recent gains in stock prices 
it could be they suggest that interest rates will soon stop 
rising and turn downward 
the socalled upward pressure on interest rates may prove to be 
illusory said william lefevre at advest inc 
utility stocks highly sensitive to changes in interestrate 
expectations have lately traded well above their low points of last 
year he points out 
the behavior of the dow jones utility average says interest 
rates are headed lower not higher in the intermediate to 
longterm future lefevre maintains 
talk has even begun to stir on the street of an increasingly 
powerful rise in stock and bond prices should the economy slow and 
the federal reserve relax its recent credittightening 
when that occurs all will know that short rates are due to 
peak and the proper place for assets is in long bonds and stocks 
said john connolly at dean witter reynolds inc we could see a 
scramble develop sometime soon

indications that world oil production is 
declining helped strengthen some crude oil prices this week 
opec secretary general subroto said friday the cartels output 
for january could fall below the 185 million barreladay target 
in addition ongoing problems in the north sea have reduced oil 
production by about 500000 barrels a day 
on the new york mercantile exchange the february contract for 
west texas intermediate the benchmark grade of us crude rose 31 
cents to close at 1848 a barrel friday after advancing 3 cents on 
thursday the contract traded as high as 1864 but retreated on 
profittaking analysts said other contract months were mixed 
however traders noted that prices of crude contracts between 
june and november fell opecs accord took effect jan 1 and extends 
for six months many economists speculate that opec will raise its 
volume in the second half of the year 
wti was trading in the 15 range when members of the organization 
of petroleum exporting countries agreed in november to cut back 
production to 185 million barrels traders say prices have risen 
amid signs opec is abiding by the agreement and new speculation on 
friday encouraged further buying 
a statement from subroto that january production would be below 
the quota was probably the main factor moving the market william 
byers an analyst with bear stearns amp co said friday 
among refined products traded on the exchange unleaded gasoline 
futures rose the february contract for gasoline closed 070 cent 
higher at 4997 cents a gallon 
heating oil futures ended the day mixed with the february 
contract up 011 cent at 5295 cents a gallon the march contract 
also rose but subsequent months declined 
heating oil prices have not firmed along with other energy prices 
recently as demand has fallen off due to seasonal factors traders 
said
