whats a hot tub doing at the farm science 
review 
the farmer likes hot tubs just as much as anyone does we have 
a tendency to think the farmer is not a normal person but of course 
he is said craig fendrick manager of the farm equipment 
exposition at the molly caren agricultural center 20 miles west of 
columbus 
organizers of the threeday event say the 600plus demonstrations 
and displays have changed over the years 
we sat back and thought how come we can attract the farmer 
but not his wife his family his neighbors fendrick said 
wednesday 
so along with tractor demonstrations and free samples of 
pesticide the review offered tips on how to remove chocolate stains 
from linen manage personal finances update a wardrobe with 
inexpensive accessories and eat at pizza hut without gaining much 
weight 
information also was available on owning a bedandbreakfast inn 
and breeding a pet llama 
ten or 15 years ago the typical visitor at the review was white 
male between 50 and 60 years old wore overalls and attended the 
event by himself 
today hes wearing designer jeans his wife is with him and 
shes usually pushing the stroller fendrick said a lot of them 
out there are in their 30s

it took two days of research to find an answer 60 centimeters 
we werent quite sure what that meant curran said adding 
that officials think it corresponds to a size 7

michigan house members returned from summer 
break to temporary quarters in a former print shop and went to work 
on folding chairs and cafeteriastyle tables instead of their usual 
stately chairs and desks 
the house is being housed in an office building so its capitol 
chamber can be restored during the next few months 
low ceilings made the noise level louder than usual wednesday 
and legislators practically had to step over each other in crowded 
aisles one lawmaker said he couldnt find a bathroom 
this wouldnt pass the inspection for a dairy barn rep carl 
gnodtke said but i guess its good enough for legislators 
despite the tight space and the noise most lawmakers gave good 
reviews to their temporary chamber 
i was all set to come here and gripe but i want to make sure 
the right people get complimented said rep michael griffin 
house speaker lewis dodak said he hoped members would start using 
their phones to call each other on the floor to cut down on traffic 
and noise

at 6 am one recent thursday soun 
sundary gentle and serene at 21 gave birth to her first child and 
held her up to a cambodia that has known only war for two decades 
i dont know about the future whether there will be peace or 
not she said as the sun shone into her hospital room after days 
of monsoon rains 
she and her husband soun rithy 25 have spent most of their 
lives with their tragic nation in turmoil and mass deaths the 
civil war of 197075 the fanatical communist khmer rouge rule of 
197578 and the fighting since vietnam invaded in late 1978 
seven members of their two families died in the murderous scourge 
of the khmer rouge who defeated a prowest government in 1975 
the couple and their daughter are likely to see more killing in 
the years ahead even though the vietnamese are pulling out 
rithy had come to phnom penh for the birth of his child but is 
returning to southern koh kong province where he has fought as a 
government soldier for seven years against the khmer rouge and other 
guerrillas 
peace talks in paris have collapsed vietnams pullout due to be 
completed sept 26 will leave the vietnameseinstalled communist 
government in phnom penh facing the guerrillas alone in what could 
be the wars most chaotic and violent phase 
we would like to have peace really vice premier kong samol 
said in n interview for almost 20 years our people have known 
more about killing and war than peace 
most feared is the possibility that vietnams pullout will allow 
the return of the khmer rouge the black pajamaclad fighters who 
killed hundreds of thousands of people in torture chambers and slave 
labor camps after they took over in 1975 
the government claims the army will have no problems handling the 
guerrillas 
many others do not feel as confident 
some phnom penh residents have been stocking rice in case 
supplies are cut off by escalating fighting said khieu kanharith 
editor of the governmentsponsored weekly kampuchea 
some senior government officials have told western aid workers 
they are saving money in case they have to flee 
they dont know what is going to happen after september if 
there are problems with the khmer rouge one aid worker said 
they believe if there are problems the first problems would be 
for them 
at kompong chhnang just north of phnom penh maj chhour 
chandoeun the provincial military commander said his nine 
battalions are hard pressed in their fight against the 300 khmer 
rouge guerrillas in the area 
they dont stay in one place and we dont know all their hiding 
places he said 
an aid official said the governments military draft appears to 
be widening a few months ago some parents forbade their sons to 
leave the house as overzealous recruiters yanked men off the 
streets some youths flee to the border with thailand only to be 
rounded up by the guerrillas for service 
a 10 pm5 am curfew was lifted in april but the climate of 
war still pervades this riverside capital 
in july authorities closed dance halls that had been packed 
nightly since they were permitted to open last year mayor thong 
khong blamed drunken quarrels and said only the rich could visit 
them anyway 
at that time there was increased fighting at the border and it 
was difficult to justify the sacrifice at the border and the good 
life in phnom penh one foreignaid official said 
for many years popular support for the vietnamesebacked 
government had stemmed mostly from its being the only alternative to 
the khmer rouge with vietnams pullout phnom penh extended 
economic reforms to include a freeing up of private trade in an 
effort to raise primitive living conditions 
ironically it created a new security problem by worsening 
corruption among officials and corruption was a factor that helped 
the khmer rouge topple lon nols prowest government in 1975 
the reforms reduced somewhat the gulf between the people and 
their leaders but in addition to the fear of more war remains the 
widespread fear of the authorities and the police who are 
thought to be everywhere

as though the constant shelling isnt enough 
residents of beirut now face marauding bands of gunmen who loot 
abandoned apartments or rob those huddling in bomb shelters here is 
another in a series of periodic reports on life in beirut 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
longsuffering residents of this 
beleaguered capital have braved six months of shelling and shortages 
only to face a new terror bunker bandits 
bands of gunmen prowl the streets of moslem west beirut at night 
cleaning out apartments hit in the artillery battles between the 
syrians and christian forces 
they grab anything salvageable persian carpets television sets 
video recorders silverware 
its not unusual to hear the crackle of automatic weaponsfire at 
night as the marauders fire in the air to keep people away from the 
scenes of their depredations 
they also prey on civilians huddling in basement shelters during 
the shelling because many people take their savings and jewelry with 
them when they go underground 
one gang of masked gunmen robbed six families in a bunker beneath 
their apartment block in west beiruts aishe bakkar neighborhood 
i dont know how they managed to get in during the shelling 
said one of the victims mohammed abusamir a middleaged sunni 
moslem taxi driver 
they just ordered us to hand over our jewelry money and 
watches and we had to do as they said he said i dont know 
which is the worst getting robbed in our own shelter or the 
shelling 
the number of reported robberies has gone down in recent weeks 
because about 13 million of beiruts 15 million people have fled 
to safer areas to escape the nightly barrages that have killed more 
than 900 people and wounded nearly 2800 since march 8 
but the thousands of abandoned apartments make easy pickings 
some residents now take pistols to their shelters to protect 
themselves against the looters 
other indirect victims of the violence are hundreds of sri lankan 
maids stranded in beirut by fleeing employers who order them to 
guard apartments and houses 
i risk my life here during the shelling looking after their 
carpets and silverware while theyre safe somewhere and having fun 
in south lebanon said a bitter kumari hami left to fend for 
herself in an eighth floor apartment in moslem west beirut 
id rather starve in my own country than be here she said 
her countrywomen along with filipinas and women from other poor 
asian countries came to beirut hoping to make a decent living most 
are paid 50 a month 
she said most employers make sure the maids do not flee by taking 
their passports unable to leave lebanon theyre left alone and 
frightened amid the daily artillery battles 
some are among the casualties but police said they have no 
specific figures 
fadi sinno who runs an office that hires sri lankans to work in 
lebanon said about 2000 women share kumaris plight 
their employers leave them in beirut because thieves usually 
rob empty apartments he said the maids come to me crying but 
theres nothing we can do about it because theyre bound by their 
contracts 
the philippines government has evacuated more than 200 filipinas 
who were stranded in beirut some complaining they had been forced 
into prostitution 
many have been made destitute by the 14yearold civil war that 
has destroyed lebanons economy but the latest round of fighting 
has brought a boom for scrap metal merchants 
in the chatilla district of west beirut junkyard owners like 
mohammed wehbi are out in the rubblestrewn streets every day in 
their trucks as soon as theres a lull in the shelling 
they scavenge among wrecked cars shrapnel and bombedout 
apartments for battered metal household items 
we only care about copper pieces of shrapnel wehbi said 
during a recent sweep through west beirut iron ones arent worth 
the trouble of collecting because they dont bring in much money 
he said when he sees a smoldering car he usually looks for the 
owner to buy it 
the most ill pay for such a car is 15000 lebanese pounds 
30 he said 
but people in some neighborhoods said dealers usually just tow 
the blackened shrapnelholed hulks away without bothering to ask 
about ownership 
wehbi said that after the metal is compressed it is shipped to 
europe and some arab countries through the southern ports of sidon 
and tyre to be melted down and used to make household appliances and 
ammunition 
iran takes copper for ammunition italy west germany and 
britain take brass for electrical appliances he said 
pointing to a large shipping container wehbi said thats more 
than half full of empty beer cans people are drinking more because 
theyre nervous and because theres no water its all good for 
business

facing police officers when he read a magazine article describing 
how a bulletproof vest saved an officers life

sothebys was surprised when a wellpreserved 
67yearold teddy bear sold for a record 86000 
so was the buyer 
his first words were youre kidding jack wilson who was 
an intermediary in the deal said wednesday 
however wilson said his american friend was prepared to pay 
even more and was delighted to bag the bear as a 42nd anniversary 
present for his wife 
wilson refused to identify the buyer 
the actual bidding was done by stockbroker james fox 26 of 
bristol who was given a blank check and sent to sothebys in london 
on tuesday 
i could tell from his voice he was ashen wilson said and 
he said the auctions just over and ive got the bear 
and i said well done james and then he said youd better 
sit down because i paid 50000 pounds 
and i said youve done what 
wilson said he waited a few hours before phoning his american 
friend 
i guess he might have figured on a third of that record 
price said wilson who is chairman of the house of nisbet teddy 
bear manufacturers in westonsupermare in southwest england 
hes is very pleased he was determined to have it 
the buyer and his wife are avid teddybear collectors wilson 
said and both happen to be as old as the recordbreaking bear 
the price is nearly five times the previous highest price for a 
teddy bear and 61 times its catalogue estimate said bunny campione 
a valuer for sothebys 
wilson said his firm would like to do a replica of the bear 
its up to my friend although it seems like we have the inside 
track he said 
the previous highest auction price for a teddy bear was 19000 
paid at a christies auction in london on may 18 for a steiff bear 
made between 1906 and 1909 for princess xenia a cousin of czar 
nicholas ii 
several bidders stayed in the race until the price reached 
38000 wilson said 
the other bidder after 24000 pounds 38000 was a telephone 
bidder and the general impression was that the caller was from 
tokyo wilson said 
bears are an art form like paintings wilson said people 
are used to hearing about crazy figures like 400 million for 
paintings and this is the same kind of price inflation it is a very 
rare bear 
the germanmade teddy edward t is thought to date from 1927 
the bear is 24 inches long has dualplush fur in blond and brown 
amber and black glass eyes measuring about 1 inch in diameter 
swivel joints a humped back and widely spaced pricked ears 
it is believed that it was part of a batch of a few thousand but 
mrs campione said the bear was in unusually good condition 
before going to america the bear will on display at the national 
teddy bear museum in stratforduponavon this weekend

the new show miss saigon received a rapturous 
ovation at the theater royal drury lane followed by decidedly 
mixed early reviews for the first major musical set mostly in 
vietnam 
for all its frenzied breastbeating this is a show with about 
as much heart as the tin man in the wizard of oz charles 
osborne in the daily telegraph wrote of the musical which updates 
the tragic tale of puccinis madame butterfly opera to the 
vietnam war 
lea salonga an 18yearold filipino making her acting debut in 
the west and welsh actor jonathan pryce star as a young vietnamese 
girl kim and her cynical pimp the engineer 
both yearn for the united states she to escape her wartorn 
country he to exploit what he refers to sardonically in a 
secondact showstopper as the american dream 
simon bowman plays the american gi who weds kim in 1975 prior to 
the fall of saigon only to leave her for a new life and a new 
american bride the story reaches its fatal climax in bangkok in 
1978 with the implication that innocence as embodied by kim 
cannot be reclaimed 
salonga and pryce both received cheers from the blacktie 
audience wednesday night that gave miss saigon an eightminute 
standing ovation 
but alongside the applause came concerns about the hype with 
some wondering whether this wasnt another in a series of 
effectsheavy overhyped british productions that substitute 
impressive mechanics for meaningful emotion 
said the daily telegraphs osborne it gives the impression of 
having been cynically concocted with lavish hightech decor as the 
most important ingredient merely to fill theater seats 
lester middlehurst in today newspaper wrote theres more to a 
musical than the money it cost cameron mackintosh to create such 
stunts as landing helicopters on stage and building giant statues of 
ho chi minh 
both these staging coups received extensive advance publicity in 
the british press and elicited more applause than most of the 
musical numbers 
problems installing the 22foot statue of ho chi minh reported 
to weigh almost two tons had led to the cancellation of the first 
two previews sept 4 and 5 but the opening night proceeded without 
technical difficulty 
budgeted at 465 million miss saigon will most likely 
withstand any critical slights its advance sale to date is almost 
8 million and a broadway opening is tentatively scheduled for late 
autumn 1990 with director nicholas hytner repeating his london 
assignment 
miss saigon marks another commercial hit for millionaire 
producer mackintosh whose shows besides les miserables 
include cats and the phantom of the opera two 
internationally successful andrew lloyd webber musicals 
but the producer said in a preopening interview that he is 
forsaking megamusicals for a while to turn his attention to alan 
parkers upcoming film version of les miserables

it was billed as a gathering of worldrenowned 
intellectuals tackling the loftiest of subjects and perhaps coming 
up with a metaphor for our times 
but while participants in the modestly named conversazioni on 
culture and society considered changes in the soviet bloc the 
influence of religion in world events and cultural illiteracy the 
larger assignment proved elusive 
everybody was satisfied but no final metaphor alas emerged 
said bernard levin chief columnist for the times of london 
in an introduction to the conference claudio veliz a conference 
host noted such past eloquent and economical tags as roaring 
20s neogothic and even cold war but lamented that 
today we are encumbered with postindustrial and postmodern 
usages as illuminating as postlife is for death or postoats 
for porridge 
levin one of many academics historians and others who joined a 
debate of world issues did not seem defeated by the groups failure 
to write a tag line for the closing years of the 20th century 
the whole idea is that we thrash out these things he said 
the third annual conference held this year at boston university 
brought together such thinkers as former presidential advisor arthur 
schlesinger jr cambridge university professor ernest gellner and 
noted french historian emmanuel le roy ladurie to work on a 
metaphor for our times 
the conference invited about 60 top thinkers 
several papers were presented sunday and positions taken on the 
best name for the present era during dinner discussion groups and 
public presentations the participants defended and attacked each 
others reasoning the papers were revised and a final session was 
held tuesday night 
i dont think the idea of the metaphor was built into the 
idea it was just a way of saying what do we think of our 
condition levin said 
levin pointed in his presentation to the drug epidemic the 
collapse of form in the arts and the old certainties vanishing and 
nothing being put in their place to coin the age of disorder 
the points he raised provoked considerable discussion and he 
said a degree of accord particularly his position that cultural 
literacy would someday return 
i had said that our time is the only one that would in fact try 
to define itself he added obviously any era the dark ages 
the age of enlightenment is not called that when it happens 
were the first age to try and define itself right now rather than 
waiting for history 
american economist walt rostow talked of the european communitys 
plans for dropping border restrictions in 1992 and offered the age 
of regionalism 
schlesinger gave an overview of how the world became what it is 
while laduries presentation was nonpolitical and more abstract 
dealing with the nature of the world levin said 
veliz a professor at la trobe university in melbourne 
australia focused on the domination of the english language and 
english culture throughout the wolrd he noted how soccer or 
english football is played throughout the world 
he also displayed a group photograph in which irans late leader 
ayatollah khomeni and his fellow ayotollahs wore jogging shoes 
keith botsford american correspondent for the independent in 
london said one series of discussions focused on the fact that 15 
years ago no one would have predicted that religion would affect 
politics in poland or that islam and fundamentalism would dominate 
headlines 
religion came in a startling second to the soviet union and 
really was talked about a great deal he said

a very upset auto industry predicts many 
more recalls will result from the swift collapse of a bush 
administration plan to let carmakers meet pollution targets by 
averaging vehicle emissions 
a house subcommittee removed the averaging plan from the 
presidents clean air bill wednesday in a unanimous voice vote that 
shocked a standingroom crowd that expected a closely divided tally 
the vote means the bush bill would require each car sold in this 
country to pass antipollution requirements for hydrocarbons carbon 
monoxide and nitrogen oxide current law has the carbycar 
requirement but the bush plan would make the standards tougher to 
meet 
tim maccarthy of the auto industrys motor vehicle manufacturers 
association said the new standards would be too tough for each car 
to meet after theyre driven for several years 
the industry and bush wanted to allow some engine classes to 
flunk the requirements while other classes would meet them with 
room to spare resulting in an overall pollution reduction after the 
emissions were averaged 
maccarthy predicted that once an engine class began regularly 
failing emissions tests the environmental protection agency would 
order massive recalls for repairs 
subcommittee chairman henry a waxman dcalif the chief 
proponent of eliminating averaging said the concept would simply 
allow more dirty cars on the road averaging provisions would 
cause more pollution he said because emissions from cars failing 
to meet the standards would not offset the gains from autos 
bettering the requirements 
the subcommittee vote had a bizarre quality because the two 
chief sponsors of the bush measure rep john d dingell dmich 
and norman f lent rny vigorously defended averaging at the 
outset of debate 
but as one subcommittee member after another argued averaging was 
a bad idea misunderstood by the public the defense stopped 
the voice vote was taken with only ayes heard and nobody 
sought a roll call to record individual members 
rep terry bruce dill sponsor of the antiaveraging 
amendment said it may be possible to work out a modified averaging 
proposal later but maccarthy said the averaging idea suffered a 
mortal wound 
we are very upset by the removal of the averaging provision 
maccarthy said it takes away our flexibility to deal with some 
very severe requirements in the bill 
after the vote dingell the powerful chairman of the full energy 
and commerce committee who moments earlier defended averaging told 
reporters that it appears existing law is working satisfactorily 
without averaging and that if the administration wanted the concept 
it could impose it without legislation 
asked why averaging was needed he said i did not advocate 
that particular point of view 
william rosenberg epas assistant administrator for air 
programs said the averaging idea was devised in the white house and 
not by dingell but rosenberg said he had no indication that dingell 
had any reservations 
we didnt give any signals that the administration was 
willing to drop averaging he added i was surprised i did not 
expect this would happen 
current law requires auto and light truck exhausts to meet a 
standard of 041 gram per mile for hydrocarbons such as unburned 
fuel 1 gram per mile for nitrogen oxides and 34 grams for carbon 
monoxide cars sold in california must meet even tougher standards 
the bush legislation would make the 49state standards 025 gram 
per mile for hydrocarbons 07 gram for nitrogen oxides and leave 
carbon monoxide unchanged at 34 grams 
todays exhaust limits represent reductions of 96 percent in 
hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide and 75 percent in nitrogen oxides 
from the uncontrolled cars of the 1960s and earlier but 
environmentalists note that cars are still the main contributor to 
urban smog and argue that they account for 50 percent of cancer 
deaths due to toxic emissions

rep barney frank says it would be a great 
mistake and cowardly to resign in the midst of a scandal over 
his involvement with a male prostitute 
the massachusetts democrat broke two days of public silence on 
his case wednesday to declare his resolve to ride out the scandal 
at least until the house ethics committee completes its inquiry into 
the case 
he disputed reports that democratic party and congressional 
leaders were urging him to step aside in order to save them further 
embarrassment and risk partisan damage 
i havent been asked by anybody to resign frank said no 
one has been urging me to resign 
a leading ally of frank meanwhile backed off plans to draft and 
circulate for the signature of democratic colleagues a statement 
supporting franks desire to stay in office through the ethics probe 
rep joe moakley dmass dean of franks homestate house 
delegation had planned such a statement but his press secretary 
jim mcgovern said moakley decided press attention has been so 
negative for frank that it was better to do nothing 
hes not running away from barney mcgovern said 
frank a fiveterm house member and leading liberal in congress 
is an acknowledged homosexual who has come under scrutiny since 
admitting last month that he had an 18month relationship with male 
prostitute stephen l gobie 
frank admitted paying gobie for sex then hiring him as a driver 
and personal assistant 
gobie who went public with his allegations last month contended 
that he operated a prostitution ring out of franks capitol hill 
apartment with franks knowledge frank denied knowing of such 
activity and said he threw gobie out when he learned of it 
frank asked for the ethics committee review heading off a 
certain request by opponents 
i think that resignation would be a great mistake frank 
said it would cut off the ethics committee process and i think 
that would be a cowardly and inappropriate way to proceed 
there are things that i did that i should not have done that 
ive apologized for and i will submit to the judgment of the ethics 
committee he said there are other things that ive been 
accused of that i havent done that i want to be able to rebut and 
the ethics committee is the place to do that 
frank also responded to a partisan attack leveled by house 
republican leader rep robert michel of illinois who suggested that 
frank was benefiting from a double standard that judged him less 
harshly either because he was a liberal or because the allegations 
involved activity with another man rather than a woman 
i dont think its fair to suggest the ethics committee of the 
house would be imposing a double standard theyve been very tough 
in the past so i think thats just an inaccurate accusation 
frank said 
over the weekend the boston globe long an editorial supporter of 
frank called on him to resign democratic national chairman ronald 
brown on tuesday acknowledged that pressure is building for 
franks resignation but said the ethics investigation should go 
forward 
asked if he was hurting the party frank responded at this 
point i think its important to have the ethics process go forward 
then people can make judgments after that

with a commander waving flowers in the 
lead vietnam on thursday began a pledged final withdrawal from an 
11year war against guerrillas it couldnt eradicate despite 
superior firepower 
vehicles carrying thousands of soldiers bearing rifles rumbled 
out of this northwestern province after a band played pop music and 
thousands of cambodians threw the troops flowers and flags in a 
governmentorganized ceremony 
vietnam says it is conducting a sixday withdrawal of its last 
26000 troops from siem reap and several otehr areas of the country 
but guerrillas charged that vietnam was faking the troop movement 
and actually hiding and disguising its troops 
vietnam invaded cambodia on christmas day 1978 and within two 
weeks toppled the fanatical khmer rouge regime a former communist 
comrade that had launched bloody attacks on the vietnamese border 
during its fouryear rule the pol potled khmer rouge killed 
hundreds of thousands of cambodians as it tried to turn cambodia 
into an agrarian commune 
at the height of its conflict with cambodian guerrillas vietnam 
had 200000 men in the country according to vietnamese officers 
they say it began annual partial pullouts in 1982 and that 55300 
vietnamese died fighting the cambodians including 25000 in 197778 
the invasion also brought economic blockades by noncommunist 
countries that kept vietnam one of the worlds poorest counties 
with the collapse of peace talks in paris last month the pullout 
would leave the vietnameseinstalled phnom penh government fighting 
three guerrilla groups backed by china thailand and other countries 
maj gen huol savorn commander of cambodias 4th army region 
said he expected a major guerrilla offensive after the pullout of 
the some 10000 soldiers of front 479 from siem reap battambang 
and oddar meanchey provinces these are among thai border provinces 
the guerrillas have been strongly contesting for years 
they are going to fight a lot to try to occupy border areas 
before striking inland he told reporters 
but they will not be able to achieve this he said with the 
equipment that they have they can only carry out hitandrun 
attacks 
the paris talks failed to agree on international monitoring of 
the troop movement and the only official foreign observers seen in 
siem reap were from vietnam and its close allies laos cuba and the 
soviet union the main source of arms for the war 
of the absence of western observers soviet delegate and foreign 
ministry official genrich kinreed said it was astonishing why they 
insisted on international monitoring but didnt come his 
fourmember team was led by suleimenov oljas member of the supreme 
soviet or parliament 
about 50 journalists from noncommunist countries watched the 
troop movement 
the cambodians bade the soldiers farewell in a twohour ceremony 
on the rainsoaked gravel road outside a kindergarten built by 
vietnamese soldiers 
banners expressing sadness at the troops departure and hopes for 
continued vietnamesecambodian solidarity were raised by groups 
of students soldiers and schoolchildren wearing red kerchiefs 
the young pioneers of the ruling cambodian communist party they 
sweated under a hot sun that charged in just after a morning mist 
lifted 
on a wooden stage with the military officers four buddhist monks 
in flowing saffron robes chanted prayers for peace 
cambodian and vietnamese officials took turns with speeches that 
denounced the pol pot genocide and defiantly claimed the 
guerrillas cannot take any territory 
maj gen khieu anh lon commander of front 479 hugged a 
cambodian commander in front of a blue banner displaying the 
national emblems of vietnams yellow star and cambodias angkor wat 
temple 
a young pioneer gave him her kerchief while three women in 
traditional costumes presented a bouquet of flowers 
the general walked down the muddied road picked up a young boy 
and climbed into his weatherbeaten usmade jeep to begin the 
withdrawal 
the vietnamese troops whose intervention triggered fighting that 
killed tens of thousands of people and split almost all asia into 
two hostile camps waved yellow and purple flowers as they 
disappeared down the road

a protein found in the brain of alzheimers 
patients has been located elsewhere in their bodies and that may 
lead to better diagnosis and treatment of the disease that afflicts 
2 million americans 
the protein deposits appear in several tissues including the 
skin and intestines indicating they may come from an unknown 
substance that circulates in the blood said dennis selkoe 
codirector of the center for neurologic diseases at brigham and 
womens hospital in boston 
if so finding ways to block delivery to the brain may help in 
fighting alzheimers disease he reported today 
but he said it is too early to know if such an approach would be 
useful and another scientist said the research provides only 
suggestive evidence for the idea that the protein deposits come from 
a bloodborne source 
david drachman chairman of the medical and scientific advisory 
board of the alzheimers association also said it is unproven that 
the proteins appearance in the brain plays any role in causing 
alzheimers 
nonetheless he called the study a very important advance in 
knowledge about the protein which is called amyloid 
selkoe who is also associate professor of neurology at harvard 
medical school reported the findings in the british journal nature 
with colleagues catharine joachim and hiroshi mori 
even if no circulating substance is involved in the protein 
deposits the work suggests that doctors may one day be able to 
confirm an alzheimers disease diagnosis by taking skin samples 
selkoe said in an interview 
drachman said data from the study suggest such a test would be 
unreliable but that perhaps the accuracy can be improved 
alzheimers disease attacks the brain and produces progressive 
impairment in memory thinking and behavior it kills more than 
100000 americans a year no cause or cure is known 
doctors now have no standard biological test to confirm the 
diagnosis in a living patient they can only rule out other possible 
causes including treatable ones for suggestive symptoms 
a standard feature in the brain of alzheimers victims is a large 
number of spherical neuritic plaques composed partly of the amyloid 
protein 
scientists do not know whether the plaques cause the disease or 
simply result from it 
brains of alzheimer patients also contain deposits of amyloid 
alone which is what the new study found in other tissues selkoe 
said 
eight of 11 alzheimer patients showed patchy amyloid deposits in 
the skin subcutaneous tissue or intestines with suggestive 
evidence of such deposits in two others 
three of 26 people without alzheimers showed the deposits with 
two showing equivocal evidence 
the three with deposits were at least 77 years old selkoe noted 
that elderly people without alzheimers also can have plaques in the 
brain although they have fewer plaques than alzheimer patients 
the findings imply that the amyloid deposits either are created 
independently at multiple sites in the body or derived from some 
substance that circulates in the blood he said 
selkoe said he favors the latter idea other kinds of amyloid 
come from such a circulating precursor and some newly found 
deposits were in or near blood vessel walls much as they can appear 
in the brain he said 
nobody has yet identified a circulating substance that can be 
demonstrated to give rise to the form of amyloid linked to 
alzheimers selkoe said 
he also said further study is planned to see if skin sampling 
might be useful to confirm a diagnosis of the disease

the bush administration is supporting efforts 
to retain catastrophic medical insurance for retirees amid growing 
indications that congress may bow to pressure to repeal the program 
catastrophic meets a very real need in protecting senior 
citizens against financial ruin as a result of an illness 
secretary of health and human services louis sullivan told the 
senate finance committee although some adjustments may be needed 
he added repeal would be a big mistake 
but leaders of the house and senate acknowledged wednesday the 
number of lawmakers who will vote to repeal the program outright is 
growing sen lloyd bentsen dtexas an author of the program and 
chairman of the finance committee said the house probably will vote 
for repeal 
democratic leaders of the house agreed to allow a repeal vote 
next week when the house considers a ways and means committee plan 
for keeping catastrophic care but scaling the program back 
the program the largest expansion ever of medicare is under 
attack from two groups of retirees those who already are covered by 
a catastrophic plan including federal retirees and higherincome 
older americans who object to paying for coverage for those at the 
bottom of the economic ladder 
sullivan said that although the administration prefers no changes 
in the program it would support a modification backed by senate 
leaders of both parties 
that proposal would eliminate coverage for most prescription 
drugs scale back coverage of physicians fees and reduce the 
surtax on higherincome retirees that pays for most of the program 
we want to do everything we can to preserve the core benefits 
in the program sullivan told the committee 
sen john c danforth rmo said congress should repeal the 
program and consider a replacement as part of an overall national 
health strategy 
sen bill bradley dnj said any discussion of repeal should 
include recognition that peoples lives are at stake repeal he 
said would amount to denying somebody the right to get an 
operation in a hospital and allow them to live without going 
bankrupt

transportation officials believe new security 
rules brought on by the explosion that destroyed a pan american 
airliner over lockerbie scotland make flying us carriers in 
europe and the middle east as safe as possible 
nothing is 100 percent but we try said fred farrar a 
spokesman for the federal aviation administration which ordered 
security procedures tightened after the dec 21 1988 bomb blast 
that killed 270 
the airlines are doing a lot said tim neale a spokesman for 
the air transport association an industry group we spend a half 
billion dollars a year on security 
the new rules imposed by the faa since the pan am 103 explosion 
include a requirement that us airlines operating in europe and the 
middle east xray or physically search all checked luggage a 
certain percentage of the luggage is searched by hand 
the new faa regulations apply only to us carriers 
air carriers operating in and out of 40 highrisk airports are 
required to make a positive passengerbaggage match designed to 
ensure that no piece of luggage gets on an airplane unless the 
passenger who checked it is also aboard 
and the installation of automatic devices for detecting 
explosives in checked luggage has begun with the first installed at 
new york citys john f kennedy international airport the thermal 
neutron analysis machine costs 750000 to 1 million 
we have issued a rule requiring airlines to provide devices 
like this and have them installed in 40 airports here and abroad 
within 1 years farrar said 
asked whether the explosivesniffer could have detected the bomb 
hidden in a radiocassette player which blew the boeing 747 airliner 
apart farrar said we are confident it could have caught it 
atas neale was not so sure 
its hard to say he said we still dont know for sure 
exactly what happened there its like a moving target you are 
constantly readjusting 
airline security originally was designed to counter hijackings of 
planes mainly to cuba 
now its an entirely different threat its more sabotage than 
hijacking said neale defenses have to be changed and the new 
requirements are intended to do that 
there is no single answer to terrorism he said the idea is to 
set up a new series of roadblocks 
us airlines are frustrated he said because there is a 
perception among the traveling public that flying a foreign carrier 
is safer 
but he said the us carriers are the only ones physically 
inspecting and xraying all checked luggage now overseas 
airlines he said use the profile system in which added 
attention is paid to a passenger who has behavior patterns or 
matches statistical data characteristic of hijackers

richard ramirez cooly flashed a sign of the 
devil and muttered the word evil after jurors convicted him of 
all 13 murders and 30 other felonies in the 1985 satanismtinged 
night stalker rampage 
the glum shaggyhaired drifter refused to stay in the courtroom 
when jurors returned their verdicts wednesday after 22 days of 
deliberations 
the jury found that ramirez was the devilworshiping night 
stalker who left satanic symbols at some murder scenes and forced 
terrified victims to swear to satan as they suffered unspeakable 
assaults 
husbands were murdered in their beds and wives were raped beside 
the dead bodies one victims eyes were gouged out 
the verdicts came four years after the killings terrified many 
californians and more than a year after the trial began when 
ramirez was caught it was by angry residents who ran him down and 
beat him 
ramirez of el paso texas listened to the verdicts on a speaker 
in a nearby cell 
as he was taken from the courthouse while wearing sunglasses 
ramirez flashed photographers a devil sign extending his index 
and little finger 
asked what he thought about the verdicts the 29yearold ramirez 
said only 
evil 
the trials finale came despite a jurors slaying which had 
threatened to halt the case during deliberations 
in a silent courtroom superior court judge michael tynan and 
clerk josephine williams spent more than a half hour reading the 
jurys thick book of verdicts the word guilty echoed again and 
again 
ramirez was convicted of all charges including rape sodomy 
oral copulation burglary and attempted murder in addition the 
jurors found 18 special circumstances existed making it possible to 
impose the death penalty 
in one of the murders the panel reduced a charge of firstdegree 
murder to second degree a decision the prosecutor praised as 
sophisticated the victim in that murder tsailian yu was 
dragged from her car on a street and shot to death indicating a 
lack of premeditation 
ramirez still faces an attempted murder charge in orange county 
and a murder charge in san francisco his status in those cases will 
be decided after sentencing in the los angeles case 
tynan scheduled the penalty phase of the trial to begin sept 27 
the same jury will decide the sentence the judge forbade the jurors 
from talking about the case 
were going to try to save his life defense attorney ray 
clark said of the penalty proceeding we will try to convince the 
jury that he should not be executed 
the defense had argued ramirez was a victim of mistaken identity 
that the victims were too traumatized to remember their assailants 
face 
clark characterized ramirez reaction to the verdicts as kind 
of stoic 
clark said he would appeal citing the jurors slaying as one 
reason for overturning the conviction 
on aug 14 juror phyllis singletary was found beaten and shot to 
death her livein boyfriend confessed to the killing in a note 
written before he committed suicide 
the slaying was not related to the case but defense lawyers 
unsuccessfully asked for a mistrial arguing that the killing had 
made the other jurors prejudiced against ramirez 
relatives of three night stalker victims were in the packed 
courtroom and listened somberly to the verdicts 
outside court deputy district attorney p philip halpin said 
im satisfied that certainly the jury considered the evidence very 
carefully and rendered appropriate verdicts 
but he added im not going to be relieved until its over and 
its not over yet 
he said he would urge jurors to impose the death penalty 
clark conceded that the most powerful evidence against ramirez 
came from attack survivors who wept and sometimes shouted at the 
defendant as they recalled their ghastly ordeals from the witness 
stand 
you son of a bitch why did you kill him cried one woman who 
witnessed her husbands slaughter i gave you everything you 
wanted whats wrong with you he was such a nice man 
through it all ramirez sat slumped in a chair occasionally 
smirking and once laughing as a foreignborn witness struggled to 
describe her rape

the federal crop insurance program needs 
improvements but it is a better way to provide disaster aid to 
farmers than emergency loans and direct payments a congressional 
report says 
and a government commission says some changes could be made 
immediately in the crop insurance program to boost farmer 
participation beyond the current 25 percent 
the program needs to be simplified and made more responsive and 
the administration could be improved ray davis and bill classen 
cochairmen of the commission for the improvement of the federal 
crop insurance program told a house subcommittee on wednesday 
a general accounting office report said the federal government 
spent 176 billion between 1980 and 1988 assisting farmers who lost 
crops because of drought or other natural causes 
about 69 billion of that was direct assistance 64 billion 
came through emergency loan programs and 43 billion was spent to 
subsidize crop insurance 
however the gao said the crop insurance program is a more 
equitable and efficient way to provide aid to farmers 
the gao said its investigation showed that most farmers dont buy 
crop insurance because they are used to having congress come to the 
rescue with special assistance whenever there is a major crisis 
for example 4 billion in direct payments were made in 1988 by 
emergency act of congress because of the severe drought said the 
gao 
rep glenn english dokla who chairs the subcommittee on 
conservation credit and rural development said 65 percent to 70 
percent participation in the crop insurance program is needed to 
make it work 
we cannot continue to do this english said referring to 
congress ad hoc approach to agricultural disasters the costs are 
too high 
john harman of the gao said that in examining disaster 
assistance programs his agency found that direct payments or 
emergency loans can result in different treatment for similarly 
affected disaster victims 
in contrast the terms of compensation under crop insurance are 
determined before a disaster occurs and therefore crop insurance 
provides farmers equitable assistance more consistently he said 
the gao also found that crop insurance because it is 
consistently available allows farmers more flexibility in 
longrange planning 
we recognize that the crop insurance program has had a history 
of management problems that in the short term makes it difficult 
to justify the current crop insurance program as the sole source of 
disaster assistance to farmers said harman 
he said congress should provide a transition period if it decides 
to rely exclusively on crop insurance for disaster assistance 
davis and classen testified before the house agriculture 
subcommittee on conservation credit and rural development 
the commission believes that many changes to effect immediate 
administrative improvements in the program can be made under 
existing law by the secretary of agriculture and the federal crop 
insurance corp said davis and classen these changes would 
foster increased participation by farmers

american ethnic groups view the ussoviet 
meeting that starts today as a means of seizing on kremlin reforms 
to lobby for such causes as baltic independence jewish emigration 
easy travel for eskimos and armenian rights 
secretary of state james a baker iii and soviet foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze are to sign an agreement saturday to shatter 
the socalled ice curtain that has divided the yupik and inupiat 
eskimos of siberia and alaska since the kremlin forbade travel 
across the bering strait in 1948 administration and congressional 
sources said 
the arctic winds that pass through are becoming warmer 
beckoning others to join in chipping away at the ice curtain said 
sen frank murkowski ralaska hailing the promised agreement 
the wellbeing of other ethnic groups in the soviet union is far 
less certain jewish armenian and baltic organizations were 
pressuring the bush administration to use the bakershevardnadze 
session to discuss many of the same issues dealt with at a stormy 
communist party meeting that ended wednesday in moscow 
the communist party passed a resolution urging soviet 
nationalities including the lithuanians estonians and latvians of 
the baltic republics and the armenian majority of the troubled 
nagornokarabakh enclave to curb their demands for political 
independence in return for greater economic autonomy 
six senators led by sen claiborne pell dri chairman of the 
foreign relations committee have introduced a measure urging moscow 
to transfer authority over nagornokarabakh to armenia from which 
it is separated by a narrow band of azerbaijan 
armenianamerican groups took out newspaper advertisements this 
week urging baker to raise the issue with shevardnadze when they 
meet in jackson hole wyo this friday through sunday 
balticamerican groups were planning similar steps the united 
states never has recognized the soviet annexation of the baltic 
republics at the close of world war ii and on tuesday baker 
advanced that policy a step further by urging independence for those 
people 
its been the position of the united states for some time that 
we do not recognize the incorporation of the baltic states into the 
soviet union baker said we do not seek to foster nor would we 
profit from instability in the soviet union so wed like to see a 
peaceful move toward independence for the baltic states 
vice president dan quayle signaled a more outspoken white house 
stance on the baltic in a cable news network interview on sept 9 
clearly every event triggers a response and if theres a 
negative event toward the baltic states i would imagine there would 
be a negative response quayle said neither he nor other 
administration officials have specified what steps they would take 
if the kremlin cracks down 
viktor nakas a spokesman for the lithuanian information center 
a washingtonbased emigre group said i see this as a step i 
think that circumstances have forced the bush administration to take 
a stand 
a bipartisan group of 24 senators headed by sens robert c 
byrd dwva and don w riegle dmich sent a public letter to 
baker on wednesday saying that the vice presidents recent 
statements to the press in support of the baltic peoples struggle 
for independence must be reemphasized in facetoface meetings with 
soviet officials including shevardnadze 
the administration also came under some pressure and some 
applause this week from the national conference on soviet jewry 
which pointedly met in washington on tuesday two days before 
shevardnadzes arrival 
it looks as if most jews who want to leave the soviet union may 
now leave deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger told the 
conference 
that does not mean we are dropping the refusenik cases that are 
still unresolved we will continue to work on them until every 
single case in which an emigrant permit is unjustly denied has been 
satisfactorily resolved he said stressing that the issue would 
be raised at the meeting this week 
the jewish group in response endorsed a bush administration 
plan to shift to the us consulate in moscow the job of screening 
of soviets seeking to emigrate to the united states the change is 
needed to cope with the rapid rise in emigration which promises to 
top the record level set in 1979

legislation advancing in the house would give 
more veterans the opportunity to choose arlington national cemetery 
as their final resting place 
the national military cemetery on a hillside directly across the 
potomac river from washington dc is expected to run out of 
casket space in 2020 the columbarium where urns are stored is 
expected to be full in 2029 
but a bill approved by the house veterans affairs committee 
wednesday would allow veterans who qualify for burial at arlington 
to choose an unmarked burial for their ashes although the 
legislation doesnt specify the site one proposal would have ashes 
buried in one area with the names of all the deceased carved on a 
large memorial stone 
the problem of dwindling space at arlington has been growing as 
the average age of the veterans population has grown older the 
number of veterans over 65 years old total nearly 6 million now and 
should be nearly 9 million by the turn of the century 
until restrictions were enacted in 1967 any honorably discharged 
veteran could be buried at arlington roughly 190000 people are 
buried in the 612acre cemetery 
the disposal of ashes in a common area would be strictly optional 
and would not use any space that could be used for caskets the bill 
says 
the ashes which would not be placed in urns would be buried 
under sod or in small hole an aide to rep charles e bennett 
dfla the bills chief sponsor said the army would insist on a 
fitting ceremony and interment to address concerns that it may 
seem like a mass grave 
in another action the committee approved legislation to create a 
world war ii memorial in or near the district of columbia paid for 
by donations and taxes 
no decisions have been made on size location and design of the 
memorial

cuts congress is considering in the fiscal 1990 
budget for various weapons programs could derail a ussoviet 
agreement on reducing strategic arms says president bushs nominee 
to be chairman of the joint chiefs of staff 
gen colin l powell whose career has spanned two combat tours 
in vietnam to a stint as former president reagans national security 
adviser won unanimous approval wednesday from the senate armed 
services committee to be the nations top military commander 
if confirmed by the full senate powell would succeed adm 
william j crowe jr who is retiring sept 30 
during the nearly threehour confirmation hearing earlier 
wednesday powell told members of the committee that political 
changes in the soviet union should not lead to wholesale cuts in the 
star wars program landbased nuclear missiles or the b2 stealth 
bomber 
house legislation would cut 502 million from the 11 billion 
request for the multiplewarhead railbased mx missile and 
eliminate all 100 million earmarked for the singlewarhead 
truckmobile midgetman 
powell said the house plan would completely unhinge our start 
strategic arms reduction treaty negotiating position 
house and senate conferees met behind closed doors wednesday to 
craft a final version of the defense bill according to 
congressional sources who requested anonymity senators rejected a 
revised house proposal calling for full funding of the mx missile 
and elimination of the midgetman 
powells remarks came one day after secretary of state james a 
baker iii announced the administration will no longer insist on 
elimination of landbased mobile missiles conceding the issue had 
complicated negotiations the soviets have two mobile missiles while 
the administration is asking congress to fund the mx and midgetman 
powell also told senators that scaling back the program to build 
130 of the batwinged b2 bombers considered the most expensive 
plane in history at 530 million a copy would force the united 
states to change its stance in arms talks with the soviets 
without the b2 we no longer have the same start position that 
we did for the last several years and i believe it most unlikely 
that there will be a treaty up here to ratify he said 
we would have to go back quite a ways and renegotiate a 
different type of treaty he said 
on other issues powell said 
he supported using the armed forces in the war on drugs and in 
response to terrorist attacks 
the us should not unilaterally cut troops in south korea 
europe and other overseas posts to convince allies to share more of 
the defense burden powell said he was very hesitant to do it to 
satisfy current budget demands 
powell is commander of the army forces command in fort 
macpherson ga he was hailed by democrat albert gore jr of 
tennessee and republican pete wilson of california as likely the 
best appointment bush has made

mikhail s gorbachevs swift elimination of a 
quarter of the ruling politburo including two leading 
conservatives demonstrates his political strength just as doubts 
about his staying power were gaining currency in washington 
the dramatic power play executed on the eve of foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadzes meeting with president bush at the white 
house served to counter suggestions that the soviet president had 
been weakened by increasing public frustration with worsening 
economic conditions and heightened ethnic tensions 
the shakeup could be seen as strengthening shevardnadzes hand 
as he seeks to revitalize the arms control process during talks with 
bush and secretary of state james a baker iii in washington and 
wyoming 
with successive moves during the last year to consolidate his 
power gorbachev may now have broken highlevel resistance and 
opened the way for sweeping changes that reformers say are needed if 
gorbachevs program of economic restructuring is to shake the 
country out of the doldrums 
the partys central committee meeting that shuffled the makeup of 
the partys politburo also handed gorbachev an early opportunity 
next year to use a party congress to reach further down into the 
party apparatus to shake out bureaucrats blamed for smothering 
reform 
the president and communist party chief successfully instituted 
glasnost which has brought more open criticism and debate 
he overhauled the political system to encourage competitive 
elections and representative oversight of government operations 
and his new thinking in foreign policy has done much to 
dispel what he called his countrys enemy image abroad 
but gorbachevs reforms so far have failed to relieve the 
grinding economic hardship that has left consumers frustrated by 
barren cupboards and empty store shelves at a time when their own 
media show them the practical pleasures of living in the 
comparatively wealthy west 
outspoken reformists in and out of the recently elected congress 
of peoples deputies have said the transition from the old system of 
central planning and control to a new market economy requires 
radical stripping away of bureaucratic control over supplies and 
prices but gorbachev so far has talked about such steps without 
actually taking them 
with the retirement of veteran ukrainian party boss vladimir v 
shcherbitsky 71 the 58yearold gorbachev is now the only member 
of the politburo elevated to the ruling body during the regime of 
the late leonid i brezhnev 
shcherbitsky has long been regarded as one of the most 
conservative forces in the leadership but too entrenched in his home 
republic for gorbachev to unseat him 
former kgb chief viktor m chebrikov 66 another of those 
retired wednesday also was regarded as a conservative anchor who 
opposed many gorbachev reforms 
the departures left one prominent conservative yegor k 
ligachev in place but both gorbachev and ligachev have taken pains 
to express their support for each other while often disagreeing on 
policy 
gorbachev installed two of his own men gen vladimir a 
kryuchkov the new kgb chief and yuri d maslyukov who heads 
economic planning as full members of the politburo which now 
numbers 11 men 
the retirements also included nonvoting member yuri solovyev 
who thus became the first member of the partys top leadership to 
fall after being defeated at the polls 
solovyev who was rejected by the voters of leningrad when he ran 
unopposed for a seat in the congress already had been removed as 
leningrad party chief 
gorbachev opened the way for graceful retirement from the top 
echelons of soviet power when he paid public tribute to andrei a 
gromyko as he relieved him of the presidency a year ago 
he continued that practice wednesday 
when it was announced that shcherbitsky chebrikov and viktor p 
nikonov were going out on pension tass said gorbachev thanked the 
three politburo members warmly for their many years of fruitful 
activity in the party 
departures from the party leadership were once accomplished only 
by death or abrupt ouster into instant obscurity or public disgrace

jessye norman who has probably the most lustrous 
female voice in opera today was the guest artist at the opening of 
the new york philharmonics season in avery fisher hall 
she sang gloriously both before and after intermission at the 
concert wednesday night televised by pbs as live from lincoln 
center 
the evening began with music director zubin mehtas remarkable 
conducting of wagners overture to tannhauser it had the pure 
sweet religious faith which is one of the major themes of the opera 
a feeling of cleansing its listeners finally the music swelled 
into an electrifying ending 
mehta certainly has a feel for opera the new york philharmonic 
sounded like one of the great orchestras 
miss norman followed singing mahlers five late songs to poems 
by friedrich ruckert she shaped each of those familiar songs 
differently but with no sense of stretching to be different the 
first was poignant the third sometimes mysterious the third tender 
then swelling to become tones a listener could enter in the final 
song i have withdrawn from the world miss norman used a dark 
lush tone to convey something stark then shaded it into calm 
after intermission she sang the liebestod from wagners 
tristan und isolde even in that outpouring from a woman in a 
trance of love miss norman had nuances she started softly then 
rose to the power of isoldes largerthenlife vision though her 
vocal strength with a largerthanusual orchestra on stage was 
remarkable she lost no tonal beauty 
the orchestra played the prelude to tristan leading up to 
the liebestod 
the other piece on the program was mozarts 40th symphony 
mehta may have been slightly less inspired by that than by the 
operatic pieces balances in the second movement didnt sound just 
right but it is a rather hyper symphony and mehta and the 
philharmonic did capture that 
it was suggested ahead of time to audience members that womens 
gowns be white black or a combination of white and black and most 
women complied miss normans gown in contrast was bright patterns 
which looked inspired by africa or japan a covered walkway and tent 
for a late dinner kept the heavy rain off concertgoers bouquets in 
tall slender silver vases on each table were of white flowers

with president bush guaranteed a prominent role 
in next weeks education summit democrats and republicans and to 
a lesser extent educators already are jockeying for a piece of the 
action 
however money is one key subject absent from most of the lofty 
proposals and the flurry of activities before the twoday meeting 
with the nations governors 
democratic leaders of congress stole the scene wednesday by 
announcing six national performance goals to upgrade american 
education including lower dropout rates higher collegegoing rates 
and early childhood education for all poor 4yearolds by 1995 or 
earlier 
the democrats joined by maryland state and local politicians 
assembled at a showcase school in a washington suburb about 2 
hours before bush attended a private seminar with some of the 
nations bestknown educators who offered advice for the summit in 
charlottesville va 
thirty minutes before bushs seminar the national education 
association the nations largest teachers union released its own 
classroom agenda for the education summit 
nea president keith geiger broached the politically volatile 
issue of money and noted that for every 3 state and local 
governments added to education in the 1980s the federal government 
took 1 away he said the federal share of the school dollar for 
elementary and secondary schools declined from 92 percent in 1981 
to 63 percent in 1989 
geiger said money should be a key focus of the summit and added 
the federal government must become a more active partner in 
promoting progress 
arkansas gov bill clinton on hand to congratulate the democrats 
for their proposals conceded there will be a lot of discussions 
about federal funding at the summit 
but i think the important thing is to note that the governors 
at the white house committed to this process of goalsetting 
because we know first of all theres a big deficit secondly the 
president made a commitment not to raise any money thirdly most of 
the money being raised now is at the state and local level 
clinton said 
i think the most important thing is to decide where the country 
needs to go in education and then once you do that you can develop a 
strategy to achieve those goals that assesses responsibility 
clinton said who is coleading summit preparations for the national 
governors association 
the democrats also seek to raise students basic skills 
achievement levels boost their performance in math science and 
foreign languages and expand the pool of qualified teachers 
senate majority leader george mitchell of maine called the list 
democratic education goals for the nation and said his party 
has long championed educational opportunity for all americans the 
major federal education programs were democratic initiatives 
while the democrats gathered at eleanor roosevelt high school in 
greenbelt md bush sat down for private talks at the white house 
with a dozen education leaders assuring them that the deck was not 
stacked for the summit and that he was eager to hear their ideas 
dr james p comer a yale university child psychiatrist and 
expert on educating poor children said afterward that he entered 
the white house skeptical but emerged relieved and impressed that 
bush does understand the complexity of the problems facing the 
schools 
comer cautioned against putting more pressures on educators 
without creating the circumstances that can support them and 
make it possible for people to reach those goals 
but university of tennessee president lamar alexander the former 
republican governor of tennessee said we need clear goals and 
brandnew school systems 
while the democrats put no price tag on how much it would cost to 
meet their education goals the list clearly would entail major 
increases in the 22 billion education department budget 
their policy statement promised that the democrats will 
continue to seek adequate funding for the major federal education 
initiatives especially efforts to improve opportunities for the 
poor and handicapped and aid for schools and college students

a proposal to expand the rights of the disabled 
could put such a financial strain on city transit services that it 
ends up harming the general public and the handicapped alike 
congressional critics of the legislation say 
republicans on a house transportation subcommittee questioned 
wednesday whether wheelchair lifts should be required on all public 
transit buses pointing to one major city where existing lifts are 
used only every other day on average 
a bush administration official told the surface transportation 
subcommittee the provision is a key part of the americans with 
disabilities act which has come to be known as civil rights 
legislation for the handicapped 
the universal use of the lifts and a requirement for 
doortodoor bus service for those who cant make it to a bus stop 
would help get the nations 43 million disabled people into the 
mainstream of daily american life said roland j mross deputy 
administrator of the urban mass transportation administration 
republicans on the panel however are questioning the blanket 
nature of the requirements 
im also concerned that if we increase costs to the point that 
we bring a reduction of service then we are not serving the disabled 
and were not serving the general public either said rep bud 
shuster rpa 
each lift adds about 10000 to 15000 to the 155000 cost of a 
bus and adds 2000 to the annual maintenance cost mross told the 
panel he estimated the annual cost just of buying lifts at 30 
million umta would probably pay 24 million of that he said 
although there are already regulations governing access by the 
elderly and handicapped to mass transit receiving federal funds the 
new act would be far stricter 
at issue in wednesdays hearing was a requirement in the bill 
already passed by the senate and endorsed by the bush 
administration that all public transit buses be equipped with 
wheelchair lifts 
shuster said transportation department figures show that in 
seattle which has liftequipped buses each lift is used every 
other day 
spokesman for the seattle and the cambria county pa systems 
which are considered leaders in serving the handicapped told the 
panel the bill would cause hardships 
but ellen daly legislative analyst at the presidents committee 
on employment of people with disabilities said the existing service 
keeps the handicapped virtually confined to their homes 
she said many systems that have doortodoor service for the 
disabled require long advance notice 16 or 17 hours on the average 
and require a large amount of red tape to qualify for the service 
you cant decide on a moments notice that you want to go 
shopping or stay at the office late she said 
the senate passed a version of the bill with the transit 
requirements on sept 7

a survey of 6911 white middleclass college 
students found that they knew how to protect themselves against aids 
and other sexually transmitted diseases but werent doing it 
about 75 percent of the canadian students reported that they were 
sexually active but only 19 percent said they used condoms 
regularly twentysix percent said they never used condoms 
yet 80 percent answered correctly when asked questions about 
preventing sexually transmitted diseases 
the survey suggests most education and media campaigns to 
increase condom use are dismal failures said dr noni macdonald 
of the university of ottawa she presented her findings wednesday at 
a meeting of the american society for microbiology 
macdonald a member of a canadian health ministry task force on 
sexually transmitted diseases said her findings probably would 
apply to white middleclass us college students 
if weve got it in middleamerica canada you must have it in 
middle america she said 
the study found that 30 percent of 14yearolds already had had 
intercourse so had 77 percent of college men and 73 percent of 
college women 
one in four men and one in eight women reported having had at 
least 10 sexual partners 
these findings held true right across the country 
coasttocoast little town big town said macdonald 
a recent study of condom use by adolescent males in the united 
states found that 57 percent reported use of a condom the last time 
they had intercourse but that only 30 percent said they had always 
used a condom 
the author of the american study freya sonenstein of the urban 
institute in washington dc said condom use has increased but 
that condom use is lowest in the adolescents who are most at risk 
either because they have multiple partners or have sex with 
prostitutes for example 
condoms have been widely promoted as a way to cut the risk of 
getting infected with the human immunodeficiency virus or hiv that 
causes aids but they also can protect against other sexually 
transmitted diseases such as chlamydia a common infection that can 
leave women infertile sometimes without causing any symptoms at the 
time of infection 
eight percent of the canadian college students have had at least 
one sexually transmitted disease macdonald said 
sonenstein found that reports of condom use among american 
adolescent males doubled during the past 10 years or so 
dr john moran of the federal centers for disease control said 
condom sales jumped by 20 percent shortly after the us surgeon 
general released his report on aids in 1986 even so syphilis is on 
the rise in inner cities 
it appears obvious to me that there are a lot of people not 
using condoms that should he said in a telephone interview 
clearly there is a large group of people putting themselves at 
risk for hiv by not using condoms 
aids is uncommon among canadian college students now but with 
the rapidity with which theyre having sexual intercourse it would 
not take long to spread macdonald said 
she said that students must be taught not only the facts about 
aids and sexually transmitted diseases but also how to handle 
awkward social and sexual situations so that condom use becomes 
easier 
when you teach someone how to drive a car you dont tell them 
about the engine you teach them how to do it she said

foreign minister eduard shevardnadzes journey to 
the united states for superpower negotiations comes at a time the 
soviets are dealing with complex internal difficulties and talking 
as if the thrill is gone from relations with the united states 
that the bush administration is not consumed by the 
enthusiastic wish to reach agreements with the soviet union is 
recognized even here as an indisputable fact pravda wrote from 
washington dc as shevardnadze flew to the united states 
shevardnadze and baker last met in paris in july and for the 
soviets arms control remains the acid test of their relationship 
with the united states 
successful development of ussoviet relations can hardly be 
imagined without progress in the area of arms limitation and 
reduction the tass news agency recently informed readers 
shevardnadze and baker will meet over the weekend in jackson 
hole wyo 
the kremlins outward mood has shifted from elation to dismay as 
president bush has presided over a slowdown in the pace of arms 
control talks an area which gave mikhail s gorbachev his first 
tangible policy achievement with the signing of a treaty with former 
president reagan to eliminate medium and shorterrange nuclear 
missiles 
for soviets whose dreary shortageplagued lot has failed to 
improve and in many cases worsened under gorbachevs economic 
reforms the 1987 treaty and reagans visit to moscow seemed to 
presage a new and safer world with a good share of credit going to 
their own leader 
but with president bush the soviets are dealing with a president 
who said this week hes in no hurry for a summit meeting with 
gorbachev 
this time the soviets have dropped heavy hints that shevardnadze 
will unveil a new offer in washington where he pays a call on bush 
today or later in wyoming 
exactly what shevardnadze is carrying remains under wraps but 
tass quoted him upon departure from moscow as saying he has a 
personal message from gorbachev to bush on disarmament 
its a deep and constructive document designed to spur the 
talks in the united states shevardnadze said without giving details 
superpower negotiations aside shevardnadzes activities before 
he boarded a special washingtonbound jetliner give a glimpse of how 
daunting the problems facing his country are 
according to gennady gerasimov his spokesman the snowyhaired 
member of the ruling politburo attended a kremlin meeting charged 
with finding a way out of the spasms of violence between soviet 
ethnic groups in which 200 people have died in the last 19 months 
in addition entrenched portions of the soviet bureaucracy 
fearful of losing position and privilege have resisted movement 
toward a more marketoriented economy with its attendant risks 
official press accounts assert the superpowers are within reach 
of an accord to boost a worldwide ban on chemical weapons and 
gerasimov on wednesday welcomed bakers statement that the americans 
may withdraw their proposal for a ban on mobile icbms one sticking 
point in the geneva talks on longrange weapons 
yet the soviets have expressed dissatisfaction with the pace of 
arms control talks under the bush administration 
usually smiling and debonair shevardnadze earlier this month 
denounced the constraint and timidity of the officials in charge 
of washingtons new arms reduction policy it was another signal of 
the kremlins frustration at the latest turn taken by ussoviet 
relations 
putting superpower talks for a 50 percent reduction of strategic 
weapons on a faster track is a major concern of the soviets and 
theyve all but openly accused bush and baker of neglecting the 
parleys 
the geneva negotiations and the american delegations stance 
there call for a powerful political impetus tass said only the 
us president and the secretary of state are able to provide it 
when creating the atmosphere around the forthcoming political 
contacts the soviet side would like to concentrate primarily on 
recent positive statements by president george bush and secretary of 
state james baker tass said among those statements is bushs 
professed support for gorbachevs domestic reform agenda tass said 
whatever the course of the talks shevardnadze should feel right 
at home in the mountain air of jackson hole his native georgia in 
the soviet south lies in the caucasus range and its tallest peak 
mount elbrus tops grand teton by almost a mile

mikhail s gorbachev has strengthened his hold on 
the ruling communist party at a time when economic failures and 
ethnic violence have prompted some to worry openly about the 
possibility of a coup or civil war 
the soviet leader on wednesday retired a quarter of the partys 
top elite three full politburo members departed including the last 
brezhnev appointee other than gorbachev conservative ukrainian 
party chief vladimir v shcherbitsky 
replacing the three are men who hold critical positions for 
revolutionizing the old soviet ways of controlling citizens making 
law and running the economy 
the new kgb chief professional intelligence officer vladimir 
kryuchkov replaced viktor chebrikov an executive of the secretive 
agency through two decades of harsh repression of dissent 
economic planning chief yuri d maslyukov was promoted to full 
membership on the politburo and a leader in the new legislature 
yevgeny m primakov became a nonvoting member 
the shakeup came at a meeting of the communist party central 
committee that centered on solving ethnic strife that has killed 
more than 200 people in the multinational soviet union in the past 
19 months 
it followed committee approval of a program advocating for more 
selfrule in restive soviet republics but demanding that calls for 
secession from the union be stifled 
the removal of shcherbitsky and chebrikov two men with 
histories of cracking down on dissent was likely to mitigate the 
sting of gorbachevs harsh criticism of secessionists for 
independence activists in some republics 
the shakeup gives gorbachev a stronger hand in moscow as the 
party leadership writes a new program for the 1990s 
the central committee on tuesday moved up the date for the 
partys next congress to october 1990 handing gorbachev an early 
opportunity to bring new blood into the partys top echelon 
only a party congress can add reformers to the 251member central 
committee the last one was held in 1986 just a year after 
gorbachev came to power 
shcherbitsky was the last politburo member other than gorbachev 
still serving from the time of president leonid i brezhnev his 
retirement makes vitaly i vorotnikov of the russian republic the 
only pregorbachev appointee remaining on the politburo 
shcherbitsky presumably will remain party chief in the ukraine 
until a replacement can be named 
chebrikov had moved from head of the kgb a year ago to a new 
party position overseeing legal affairs he is said to be one of 
those responsible for gorbachevs selection as party chief in 1985 
but some western analysts regarded him as a gorbachev rival 
his departure was likely to please activists in some soviet 
republics especially in georgia where he was suspected of having 
prior knowledge of a military assault that killed a score of 
nationalist demonstrators in april 
viktor p nikonov an agricultural bureaucrat also retired from 
full membership he had described himself earlier this year as a 
deputy to yegor k ligachev on party agricultural policy his role 
on the politburo was never clear however and his views on major 
policy questions were not well known 
the new full members of the politburo kryuchkov and maslyukov 
are no strangers to the soviets 
kgb chief kryuchkov has promoted his agency as a friend rather 
than foe of the people he has undergone an unprecedented 
legislative confirmation hearing granted interviews to the press 
and offered to cooperate with the west to combat terrorism and drug 
trafficking 
maslyukov head of the state planning committee faces the task 
of reducing decades of central planning and sorting out economic 
relations with the republics 
two nonvoting members of the politburo yuri solovyev and 
nikolai talyzin also were forced out their places were taken by 
legislative leader primakov and boris pugo head of the party 
commission overseeing discipline 
solovyev the former party chief of leningrad was humiliated in 
march when he was rejected in an election for the new congress of 
peoples deputies even though he ran unopposed he subsequently was 
removed as party chief 
talyzin was maslyukovs predecessor as planning chief but was 
demoted twice before being dropped from the politburo 
gorbachev told the central committee in his closing speech 
wednesday it was time to strike a determined blow at those who 
offer us adventurist platforms instead of politics and serious 
affairs 
speaking extemporaneously and jabbing his finger in the air for 
emphasis he said the country could not afford to be dragged into 
any reshaping of borders changing shapes of national 
formations 
the communist partys program declared that republics have the 
right to own and manage their land and natural resources free from 
central planners in moscow and should enjoy broad opportunities 
to invigorate their economy and culture while relying on the 
overall strength of the national economy

retreat was followed by a swarm of gunwielding looters prompting 
president bush to dispatch military police and arrange for 
evacuations 
we just got lucky said bob mcmanus of west point conn 
about being among 145 passengers on a special pan am evacuation 
flight arranged by us marshals wednesday night he said the sight 
of the plane at the st croix airport touched off a stampede of 
those trying to flee 
the looters were everywhere there said mcmanus still 
gripping the 4iron golf club he used for protection 
they said were in charge now at one grocery store they 
just rolled up trucks and loaded them up 
us district judge stanley brotman of camden nj who was on 
temporary assignment in st croix said he first had to protect 
himself from the storm then the looters 
it was the most devastating experience of my life brotman 
said we had three originally in our condomimium and after the 
storm there were 18 in one room with mattresses up against every 
wall and rope to hold the shutters closed 
nadine gregg owner of an art gallery in st croix said she fled 
to protect her 5monthold son from violence several evacuees said 
was tinged with racism 
white people are scared its totally a racial thing she 
said they need martial law down there 
the younger blacks are going crazy mcmanus said theyre 
shouting racial slurs at the whites 
pan am planned four more evacuation flights today and the us 
coast guard dispatched cutters to aid those requesting evacuation

many residents of st simons island never 
lived through a major hurricane but theyre not ignoring the furor 
of hurricane hugo as it headed toward the east coast 
i think anybody is going to be worried its a major 
catastrophic happening said billy cullens a director of the st 
simons chamber of commerce 
at an island grocery store shoppers packed carts with bottled 
water canned goods and other supplies 
compared to past storms theyre taking it more seriously 
supermarket manager richard thomas said a lot more people seem to 
be talking about leaving 
attracted by its beaches golf courses warm climate and southern 
charm about 5000 people have moved to the island 65 miles south of 
savannah since the last hurricane came ashore in georgia in 1979 
st simons is about 10 miles long and is connected to the 
mainland city of brunswick by a sevenmile causeway parts of the 
island remain undeveloped but elsewhere beachfront condos and 
subdivisions have sprouted up amid palms pines and mossdraped oaks 
disaster officials called for the voluntary evacuation of the 
islands 14000 residents late wednesday they were ready to order 
the evacuation of 30000 residents from st simons and lowlying 
areas of brunswick and surrounding glynn county 
we would have to assess the situation look at the tides the 
storm surge and the advice of the national weather service said 
ed stelle the countys community development director 
the weather service issued a hurricane watch wednesday evening 
and said there was an 11 percent chance hugo could come within 65 
miles of savannah between 8 pm today and 8 am friday 
when hurricane david came ashore near savannah on sept 4 1979 
the storm knocked down trees power lines and flooded streets before 
moving into south carolina david left 1200 people dead 19 in the 
united states 
hugo has claimed 25 lives on caribbean islands 
since its last hurricane st simons population jumped from 
9000 
the major problem is the education of people said vernon d 
martin executive director of the coastal georgia regional 
development center in brunswick 
weve got a lot of new people who probably arent familiar with 
coastal problems associated with a hurricane theyre now aware of 
the warnings and what the warnings mean 
the problem is common in georgias eight coastal counties the 
area is the states fastest growing region with the population 
surging from 350000 in 1980 to an estimated 400000 in 1988 growth 
has been spurred by a new submarine base in camden county an army 
division at hinesville an 800millionayear tourist industry and 
an influx of industries 
but cullens said the growth has left the island better equipped 
to withstand hurricanes 
we have a better causeway and a better road system he said 
since hurricane david a twolane causeway with lift bridges has 
been replaced by a fourlane causeway with high bridges the island 
also has strengthened building codes he said 
ann rogers who runs a mailorder business on st simons said 
hugo would be her first hurricane 
i think im more concerned about our business than our house on 
the beach she said wed take our dogs and cats and wed be 
gone 
at the heritage retirement community the staff has met often 
with the elderly residents to prepare them for a possible evacuation 
many of our residents have pets and valuables general 
manager freddie stroud said its hard to explain to them that 
this is a temporary evacuation

cape hatteras nc urging coastal residents to begin taking 
precautions hugo picked up speed over open water and could come 
ashore late thursday or early friday

city spokesman pat dowling said in myrtle beach sc as radio and 
tv advisories warned remember the people of puerto rico 
since sunday hugo has killed at least 25 people left thousands 
homeless and caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage as it

a reporter for the san juan daily el nuevo dia 
the us coast guard had six ships in the area and sent armed 
crewmen from the cutter bear ashore to help restore order

a complete breakdown of authority theres a very high indication 
that innocent people are going to get hurt in an act of violence 
there lt jeff karonis said in miami 
the crew was evacuating all people from the island who fear for 
their safety the coast guard said in a statement a cargo plane 
was ready to supplement the evacuation if needed

southeast of savannah ga at 282 degrees north latitude and 752 
degrees west longitude and was moving northwest at 17 mph up from 
12 mph earlier in the day 
hugos wind speed also rose from 105 to 110 mph wednesday but 
forecasters said little further strengthening was likely 
forecasters said hugos path made residents from savannah ga 
to charleston sc most likely to be in harms way but they were 
delaying issuing hurricane warnings until they could make better 
projections 
bob sheets director of the national hurricane center said 
officials didnt want to spur a crywolf syndrome by triggering 
premature evacuation of the resort and retiree communities but 
forecasters said they hoped us residents learned from hugos 
caribbean rampage 
when those islands got pounded like they did thats 
remarkable forecaster martin nelson said of the relatively low 
death toll we gave them a lot of warning and they apparently 
took the warnings 
us coastal residents have enough time to prepare he said 
lets hope they are nelson said if later on they say 
boy you sure got that wrong thats ok wed rather that happen 
than have people wake up at 2 am and find a hurricane coming 
south carolina gov carroll campell put state law enforcement 
agencies on alert all we can do is to watch now and to wait he 
said 
in charleston the historic city hall was boarded up and school

propane fuel oil and lamps said tim brindley merchandise 
manager of k mart in mount pleasant sc

little impact 
its a great sigh of relief for all of us in the bahamas 
said meteorologist michael stubbs in nassau most people want to 
be able to enjoy the sea and sunshine here and now they can 
meanwhile forecasters said tropical storm iris was being 
weakened because of its proximity to hugo but could cause more 
problems for the hugohit islands

the environmental protection agencys massive 
annual guide to automobile gas mileage is supposed to tell motorists 
at a glance what cars are the stingiest and the worst guzzlers of 
fuel 
but not always it turns out 
dozens of cars each year are missing from the annual list and 
this year the absent included the entire line of luxury cars from 
mercedesbenz including 11 whose mileage is so poor the cars are 
subject to the special guzzler excise tax 
three of the mercedes cars likely would have made the ten 
worst list had they been included in the epa survey of 981 cars 
that was released earlier this week and widely distributed by the 
news media 
don larson branch manager at the epas auto testing laboratory 
in ann arbor mich said every year perhaps 80 or 90 cars do not 
make the list because manufacturers do not provide the testing data 
to the epa when the mileage guide goes to the printer 
aside from mercedes the epa could not say what specific cars 
were missing a spokesman for general motors corp said gm still 
must submit test data for three cars and industry sources said they 
would not be surprised if a dozen or more other manufacturers had 
yet to submit test information on a few cars each 
there are always a few stragglers said epa spokeswoman 
martha casey 
federal law requires automakers to submit the mileage test data 
and have it certified by the epa before a car is placed on the 
market but they are not required to submit the information by a 
specific date or meet the deadline for the initial industrywide 
mileage guide 
government and industry sources speaking anonymously 
acknowledged the mileage guide can both help and hinder automakers 
manufacturers often test their high mileage cars early to meet the 
deadline for the publication and move more slowly on their 
highmileage models said one official 
the submission of the test data is at the manufacturers 
control i dont know what was in the minds of mercedes in making 
their decision not to submit test results earlier but they do 
have relatively fuel inefficient vehicles said the epas larson 
the deadline for test data this year was aug 30 at the request 
of one automaker it was postponed until sept 5 mercedesbenz 
submitted its first 1990 model test data covering a dozen cars on 
sept 9 said eldert bontekoe of the epas certification office in 
ann arbor 
ab shuman manager of public relations at mercedesbenz of 
north america in montvale nj said in a telephone interview the 
mileage performance of the cars was absolutely not a factor in 
the data being submitted late 
it was just getting it all done said shuman who said the 
company had been unable to complete all the testing in time 
shuman also noted mercedes does not put its 1990 models on the 
market until nov 1 and so has more time to submit the test data 
than many other automakers whose 1990 models hit the showroom in 
september and october 
nevertheless 11 of the mercedes cars showed overall mileage of 
18 miles per gallon or less and are subject to a gas guzzler 
excise tax according to figures provided by the epa 
at least three of the 1990 mercedes models had mileage so low 
they likely would have been among the worst ten in mileage for 
1990 had they been included in the epa survey list 
the mileage data for the mercedes cars along with figures for 
any other cars submitted late will be included in an updated 
mileage list in february 
but ms casey the epa spokeswoman acknowledged the revised list 
usually gets little public attention

the food and drug administration is looking 
into a relatively high number of reports about unwanted side 
effects from the drug halcion the worlds most widely prescribed 
sleep medication 
an fda advisory committee is expected to review the reports at a 
meeting friday to determine why more adverse reactions have been 
reported for halcion than for other drugs in its class of hypnotics 
halcion has been on the market since the beginning of 1983 and is 
the upjohn cos secondlargest sales item 
spokeswomen for the company and the fda said they did not know 
the nature of the reports about adverse reactions or the number of 
reports received 
however the fda said that at the time the drug was approved the 
agency was aware of a variety of adverse effects reported in 
association with use of halcion including confusion agitation 
hallucinations amnesia and bizarre behavior all except bizarre 
behavior were included in label warnings the fda said 
upjohn spokeswoman florence steinberg said the company will 
review epidemiological data at the meeting that indicate that side 
effects with halcion are not different in number or kind when 
compared with other medications in its class 
she said the higher number of reports of problems associated with 
the drug stem in part from sensational allegations in the media 
about halcion including a case in which a utah woman who was 
using the drug was accused of killing her mother murder charges 
against the woman were dismissed 
steinberg said it was never established that halcion caused the 
woman to act as she did and contends the woman was taking a number 
of medications at the time 
the fda in seeking the advice of its psychopharmacologic drugs 
advisory committee did not say how many reports of adverse effects 
have been received for halcion but said the number is higher than 
for other hypnotic drug products the agency asked the panel to 
determine the meaning of this relatively high reporting rate and 
how this finding might be meaningfully communicated to the medical 
and lay public 
analysts quoted in wednesday editions of the wall street journal 
said halcion sales have been declining apparently because of reports 
of adverse reactions to the drug the newspaper quoted analysts as 
estimating that upjohns worldwide sales of halcion were expected to 
fall from about 260 million in 1988 to about 235 million this year

partisan warfare over cutting the capital gains 
tax is part of a budget quagmire that has congress so steeped in 
dispute that the government is threatened with automatic spending 
cuts next month 
republicans are taking pains in advance to set up the majority 
democrats for the blame 
at the heart of the political battle is the annual budget bill 
designed to reduce the deficit to within the parameters of the 
grammrudman budget law 
unless the bill is enacted the estimated fiscal 1990 deficit 
will exceed the 110 billion maximum in grammrudmans guidelines 
triggering cuts of nearly 17 billion will be ordered on oct 15 
half the cuts would come from the pentagon and half from civilian 
programs 
but the budget bill is threatened with defeat in the house next 
week because most democrats oppose its cut in the capital gains tax 
rate which they call a giveaway to the rich 
republicans who expect to win on the capital gains issue may 
not vote for the bill either because they want the bill stripped of 
other provisions including child care legislation and a revised 
catastrophic insurance plan for the elderly 
house budget committee chairman leon panetta dcalif predicted 
flatly that the automatic cuts will go into effect 
the question is how long will they stay in effect before the 
house senate and white house can agree he said 
house minority whip newt gingrich rga agreed and said popular 
items such as farm subsidies and the space program would be slashed 
because democrats were unable to manage the congress agenda 
gingrich said democrats were killing the legislation because they 
loaded child care medicaid improvements the fairness doctrine for 
broadcasters and a host of other issues on the mustpass legislation 
the more they load this up the more likely it will carry 
us into the automatic cuts he said 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater told reporters 
prospects for averting the cuts were somewhat bleak and it was 
up to the democraticcontrolled congress to overcome the problems 
with debate less than a week away house democratic leaders 
decided wednesday it would fight bushs capital gains cut with a tax 
alternative of their own raising rates for societys wealthiest in 
order to give new tax breaks for individual retirement accounts 
the plan is similar to one offered earlier this month by senate 
finance committee chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas including a 
provision which would allow ira savings to be used without penalty 
for education or firsttime home purchases 
most house democrats adamantly oppose the amendment approved in 
the house ways and means committee which would cut the maximum 
capital gains tax rate from 33 percent to 196 percent 
much of their anger is directed at bush who democrats believe 
has pushed his taxcut campaign promise ahead of his commitment to 
work together to reduce the deficit 
this dispute on capital gains is undercutting the kind of 
cooperation needed to tackle the deficit said panetta 
the capital gains dispute was also exposing rifts within 
democratic ranks not only were some conservatives siding with the 
gop on capital gains but liberals were pushing house speaker thomas 
s foley for an allout brawl instead of a compromise 
the troops that want to get on their horses and charge are 
growing impatient said rep david nagle diowa 
this capital gains issue will test the legendary tom foley 
thoughtfulness said rep pat williams dmont and a lot of 
people are watching to see if hell pass the test 
aside from the deficitreduction legislation the house passed 
all 13 of its annual appropriations bills before the august recess 
but only one has been forwarded to the presidents desk because 
action in the senate has been stalled over the drug controversy 
acknowledging the mess the house appropriations committee has 
tentatively scheduled a meeting next tuesday to approve a 31day 
interim spending bill which would prevent the government from 
shutting down oct 1

presidential assailant john hinckley is still 
collecting material on actress jodie foster and thinks mass murderer 
charles manson is a cool dude according to the government 
government lawyers opposing hinckleys request to talk with the 
news media on wednesday produced letters he wrote last year 
thanking a man for sending him a seminude caricature of miss foster 
that hinckley had requested 
the letters were read into the court record after hinckley who 
wants to meet with reporters to prove he is sane testified he 
hadnt been obsessed fixated or preoccupied with miss foster 
for five or six years 
hinckley has consistently told us he had no thoughts about 
jodie foster testified psychiatrist dr raymond patterson these 
writings tell us that is not true 
hinckley said after his arrest in the march 1981 assassination 
attempt on president reagan that his action was an effort to attract 
miss foster 
psychiatrists treating hinckley were unaware of the recent 
letters until they were turned over by the us attorneys office 
patterson said the secret service obtained the letters after 
hinckley sent them 
us district court judge june green is considering hinckleys 
request to conduct up to two interviews a month with the news media 
the hearing resumes monday 
mr hinckleys concern is on abc tvs prime time not on 
his mental health testified patterson who said hinckley suffers 
from a narcissistic personality disorder characterized as a severe 
mental illness 
patterson said a symptom of hinckleys illness is an inability to 
draw distinctions between the famous and infamous 
in his letter read in court by patterson hinckley thanked the 
man for the caricature then referred to manson 
i am not a follower but he is one cool dude hinckley said 
of manson leader of a cult whose members killed actress sharon tate 
and six others in 1969 miss tate was eight months pregnant when she 
was murdered 
patterson testified that hinckley made references to adolf hitler 
as recently as yesterday the psychiatrist did not elaborate 
at the hearing janet maher a lawyer for the mental hospital 
where hinckley is staying asked hinckley whether he told 
psychiatrists that he considered himself hitlers successor 
hinckley replied he had not informed the psychiatrists maher did 
not pursue that line of questioning further 
hinckley was acquitted by reason of insanity in the shooting of 
president reagan white house press secretary james brady a 
washington police officer and a secret service agent the shooting 
left brady partially paralyzed 
st elizabeths hospital where hinckley is a patient bars 
maximumsecurity patients from conducting interviews with the media 
it does permit such patients to correspond with reporters by mail

the senate is ready to dispatch beefedup us 
economic aid to polands first noncommunist government in four 
decades 
in addition the democrats who control both the senate and house 
are signaling their willingness to fight for an aid package far more 
potent than anything president bush has so far proposed or than the 
45 million initiative in the pending aid bill 
the senate readied the 144 billion appropriations measure for 
certain passage in a series of votes on amendments wednesday final 
action was postponed pending agreement on an unrelated antidrug 
package 
the senate appropriations committee included the bolstered aid 
for poland in the bill after contending that 10 million in economic 
aid initially proposed by bush was totally inadequate to 
demonstrate us support for polands surging economic and political 
reform movement 
democrats on the senate foreign relations committee raised the 
hackles of gop members wednesday as they contended the bush aid 
proposal is pathetically timid 
with all but one republican member boycotting and ignoring 
arguments that the money is not available the committee voted 10 to 
1 to authorize spending nearly 12 billion over three years in 
economic assistance for both poland and hungary 
the keystone of the democratic initiative is the creation of 
economic development funds for both countries the polish fund would 
be authorized at 300 million for each of the three years the fund 
for hungary at 75 million a year 
house democrats also indicated their willingness on wednesday to 
substantially increase aid to poland 
i believe we should give the administration everything it has 
asked for and then do more rep john dingell dmich told the 
house foreign affairs committee if we do not come to polands 
aid how can we expect others to make the sacrifices necessary to 
obtain freedom and democracy 
rep richard gephardt dmo the house majority leader said 
congress must find ways to rise above the nations budget crunch and 
provide assistance to poland and hungary equal to the historic 
nature of their apparent transformation from communist rule 
now is not the time for the niceties of bookkeeping now is the 
time for imagination and innovation gephardt said visionaries 
do not wear green eyeshades 
acting on amendments to the overall foreign aid bill the senate 
voted wednesday to boost aid to el salvador to 90 million after 
appeals to give the countrys new president a chance to succeed 
voting 6733 the legislators removed from the bill a provision 
that would have cut the aid into three installments to be made 
available at fourmonth intervals with congress given virtual veto 
power over the last installment 
the senate then voted to peg us military aid to el salvador at 
90 million a 5 million boost 
opponents of the restrictions contended that they represented an 
unwarranted slap at the government of salvadoran president alfredo 
cristiani at a time when there is a chance to end a tenyear civil 
war 
cristiani was sworn in june 1 as the victorious candidate of the 
rightist arena party 
it will be a blow to him politically at the very moment the 
very hour when we ought to be encouraging him to go forward 
said sen christopher dodd dconn who joined a rare 
liberalconservative alliance to oppose the restrictions 
sen patrick leahy dvt and other senators contended that the 
arena party has been linked to deathsquad activity in the past and 
has failed to totally stamp out human rights abuses 
the annual foreign aid spending bill pays for programs to bolster 
the military forces of friendly nations and to support economic 
development in poor countries

<TEXT>
q can you tell us what youre bringing 
shevardnadze well i am bringing a lot of paper but they are 
interesting papers 
q are they surprises 
shevardnadze i would not call them surprises but we have 
serious proposals ive brought a letter from mikhail gorbachev to 
president bush and i would like to say that we have come to 
washington at a very important stage in the development of 
sovietus relations also at a time when major very important 
fundamental changes are taking place in the soviet society and when 
many things are changing in the eastwest relationship 
and we have to state that to a large extent those changes in the 
eastwest relationship result from the changes from the positive 
developments in sovietus relations but we believe that we should 
not stand still we should not mark time we should move forward 
the experience that we have gained thus far permits us to hope that 
there will be further movement 
president bush has mentioned the possibility of a new closeness 
between the soviet union and the us and i would add that we have 
to move from a level of mutual understanding to a level of working 
together to a level of partnership wherever this is possible so 
this is what we are bringing with us to washington my meeting with 
the president is tomorrow we shall begin discussions with the 
secretary of state 
mikhail gorbachevs letter contains some very important 
proposals specifically mostly on arms control and on reducing the 
military standoff between our two countries and those proposals i 
have no doubt serve to remove most of the obstacles holding up 
progress and an agreement in geneva in vienna at conventional arms 
discussions also at the negotiations on a convention banning 
chemical weapons and nuclear testing talks and so on and of course 
we will be reporting to you more specifically during the talks and 
after them 
q mr shevardnadze are you going to tell the president that you 
wish the pace the progress of ussoviet relations would quicken

quicken that would serve the interest of our two countries the 
soviet union and the us and the interests of the world thank you

people who sleep wearing contact lenses face 1015 
times the usual risk of potentially blinding eye ulcers researchers 
warned today 
but many eye doctors already discourage patients from routinely 
wearing their lenses to bed 
you significantly increase the risk of complications when you 
wear any contact lens overnight and the more nights you wear it in 
a row the greater the risk said dr ronald e smith of the 
university of southern california 
socalled extendedwear lenses are designed to be kept in the eye 
for several days at a time when approved in 1980 they were 
recommended for use up to one month but because of concern about 
complications the us food and drug administration reduced the 
limit last may to one week 
by then however many eye doctors already had grown suspicious 
of the safety of wearing lenses to bed in part because they began 
seeing the usually rare eye ulcers in patients fitted with 
extendedwear lenses 
my recommendation to patients is that if it is not terribly 
inconvenient for you and you dont mind doing it i would prefer 
you to remove your lenses at night said dr lee rigel of east 
lansing mich chairman of contact lens section of the american 
optometric association 
i encourage my patients to try to wear them on a dailywear 
basis and avoid wearing their lenses overnight said dr scott m 
macrae of the oregon health sciences university its easy to 
start wearing a lens for one night and having it turn into 10 
nights 
the latest research estimates that about 12000 contactlens 
users in the united states suffer corneal ulcers each year largely 
because they wear their lenses to bed 
the studies also showed however that even ordinary daytime use 
of contacts while far safer than overnight wear seems to 
slightly raise the odds of these ulcers 
the research found that people who use extendedwear lenses day 
and night were 10 to 15 times more likely than strictly daytime 
users to have eye ulcers sleeping with ordinary soft lenses just 
twice a month resulted in nine times the usual risk of the disease 
our paper shows that overnight wear is the major risk factor 
said dr oliver d schein it begins with even the first night of 
overnight wear to some extent there is a risk with any kind of 
contact lens wear whether they are hard or soft worn daily or 
extended 
the study also found that the level of lens care among users was 
alarmingly low while it suggested that proper cleaning helped 
reduce the hazards of extendedwear contacts it did not eliminate 
the risk 
spokesman richard kase of bausch and lomb a contact lens 
manufacturer said his company believes extendedwear contacts are 
safe but the research will reinforce the importance of 
remembering that these are medical devices they need to be taken 
care of 
the research was conducted by schein an ophthalmologists at 
massachusetts eye and ear infirmary in boston and eugene c poggio 
a biostatistician at abt associates in cambridge it was financed by 
contact lens manufacturers and published in the new england journal 
of medicine 
an estimated 18 million americans wear contact lenses of these 
9 million wear ordinary soft contacts 4 million use extendedwear 
soft lenses and the rest wear hard or rigid gaspermeable lenses 
the researchers looked for links between contact lenses and 
ulcerative keratitis or ulcers of the cornea the transparent 
tissue that covers the eyeball these ulcers may puncture the 
cornea causing permanent blindness or leave scars that partially 
block or blur sight 
they estimate that 22 to 32 cases of these ulcers occur annually 
for each 10000 people who use extendedwear lenses overnight and 2 
to 3 cases occur per 10000 dailywear users 
schein said the ulcers are almost unheard of unless people wear 
contacts or have some other clear risk factor such as an eye injury 
the researchers estimated that each year in the united states 
there are 8000 cases of corneal ulcers among users of extended wear 
contacts and 4000 among those who use dailywear lenses 
although contact lenses are safe for the majority of users and 
offer certain visual and cosmetic advantages over eyeglasses they 
wrote both professionals and the public should know that contact 
lenses are not innocuous and that their use can lead to permanent 
adverse effects

world affairs outside his nations allies the united states has 
opposed membership for moscow

the twin organizations

barber conable announced wednesday that he intends to resume new 
loans to china in the near future but refused to name a date 
china the banks largest borrower after india has been getting

an attorney for samuel r pierce jr says the 
former hud secretary is deciding whether he will testify as demanded 
by a subpoena from a congressional panel 
we are forced to review each and every option including 
whether to the refuse to answer questions by invoking his fifth 
amendment right against selfincrimination said attorney paul l 
perito 
a house government operations subcommittee voted unanimously 
wednesday to subpoena pierce to testify about alleged 
influencepeddling and mismanagement at the housing and urban 
development department he once headed 
pierce was ordered to appear on three separate occasions the 
first before the employment and housing subcommittee he faces 
contempt of congress proceedings if he does not appear 
pierce provoked anger among the panel members when he demanded a 
third delay on the eve of his scheduled voluntary testimony last 
friday 
i think the subcommittee had no option said subcommittee 
chairman tom lantos dcalif the subcommittee had an agreement 
with mr pierce that agreement was broken unilaterally by mr 
pierce 
perito said pierce who appeared voluntarily before the panel 
in may was willing to testify but needed another two weeks time 
for preparation 
in a letter to the panel received before the vote he said we 
believe the subcommittees vindictive and punitive actions in 
denying mr pierce adequate time to obtain and review pertinent 
documents and in insisting on use of subpoenas are taken in 
retaliation against mr pierces exercise of his constitutional 
right 
republicans and democrats alike rejected that claim saying 
pierce had months of time for preparation even though pierce said 
he only hired a lawyer this month 
rather than coming forth and clearing the record he is 
toying with the subcommittee in order to evade or avoid his 
responsibility said rep ted weiss dny 
congressional staff attorneys said refusal by a former cabinet 
official to testify could appear to invite efforts to appoint a 
special prosecutor under the law providing for a courtappointed 
independent counsel to handle investigations of current or former 
top executive branch officials 
already some house members are calling for a special prosecutor 
or suggested one would be needed if the justice department does not 
clarify whether it is investigating possible criminal violations by 
former hud officials who are principals in the subcommittees 
investigation 
the subpoenas call for pierce to appear next tuesday followed by 
other appearances on oct 27 and nov 3 lantos said the dates could 
be changed at his discretion and he raised the possibility that 
further testimony by pierce could be required 
lantos said because of pierces actions he no longer felt bound 
by their previous agreement to limit the scope of the subcommittees 
questioning to three matters pierces previous voluntary testimony 
of may 25 his actions involving a durham nc housing project 
and the case involving drg corp which conducted mortgage 
coinsurance business with hud and left the government with huge 
defaults 
since pierce appeared before the panel in may subcommittee 
members say inconsistencies and contradictions in his testimony have 
emerged

thousands of cambodians threw 
vietnamese troops flowers today as hanoi began a pledged final 
withdrawal from an 11year war against resistance forces its 
superior firepower could not suppress 
in the governmentorganized ceremony vehicles carrying thousands 
of soldiers bearing rifles rumbled out of this northwestern province 
after a band played pop music a commander waved flowers in the lead 
vietnam says it is conducting a sixday withdrawal of its last 
26000 troops from siem reap and several other areas of the country 
but opposing guerrilla forces charge that vietnam is faking the 
troop movement and actually hiding and disguising its troops 
vietnam invaded cambodia on christmas day 1978 and within two 
weeks toppled the fanatical communist khmer rouge regime installing 
a prohanoi government in the capital of phnom penh 
during its fouryear rule the khmer rouge killed hundreds of 
thousands of cambodians as it tried at the point of a gun to turn 
the country into an agrarian commune it also launched bloody 
attacks on the vietnamese border 
at the height of its conflict with cambodian guerrillas vietnam 
had 200000 men in the country according to vietnamese officers 
they say hanoi began annual partial pullouts in 1982 and that 
55300 vietnamese died fighting the cambodians 25000 of them in 
1977 and 1978 
the invasion also brought economic blockades by noncommunist 
countries that kept vietnam one of the worlds poorest counties 
with the collapse of peace talks in paris last month the pullout 
would leave the phnom penh government fighting a coalition of up to 
50000 guerrillas backed by china thailand and other countries 
each side claims the other has received increased shipments of 
arms in recent months 
phnom penhs prime minister hun sen returned home today after 
talks in thailand on arranging a ceasefire and said it was now up 
to the guerrillas to agree to halt fighting 
maj gen huol savorn commander of cambodias 4th army region 
said he expected a major guerrilla offensive after the pullout of 
the some 10000 soldiers of front 479 from siem reap battambang 
and oddar meanchey provinces these malarial jungled thai border 
provinces are among those most strongly contested by the guerrillas 
they are going to fight a lot to try to occupy border areas 
before striking inland he told reporters 
but they will not be able to achieve this he said with 
the equipment that they have they can only carry out hitandrun 
attacks the main thing is they dont have enough food and 
equipment 
he said the guerrillas were outnumbered three to one and they 
had different aims and refused to cooperate with each other 
the paris talks failed to agree on international monitoring of 
the troop movement and the only official foreign observers seen in 
siem reap were from vietnam and its close allies laos cuba and the 
soviet union 
of the absence of western observers soviet delegate and foreign 
ministry official genrich kinreed said it was astonishing why they 
insisted on international monitoring but didnt come his 
fourmember team was led by suleimenov oljas member of the supreme 
soviet or parliament 
a fourmember team soviet was led by suleimenov oljas member of 
the supreme soviet or the parliament 
about 50 journalists from noncommunist countries watched the 
troop movement 
the cambodians bade the soldiers farewell in a twohour ceremony 
on the rainsoaked gravel road outside a kindergarten built by 
vietnamese soldiers 
banners expressing sadness at the troops departure and hopes for 
continued vietnamesecambodian solidarity were raised by groups 
of students soldiers and schoolchildren wearing red kerchiefs 
the young pioneers of the ruling cambodian communist party they 
sweated under a hot sun 
on a wooden stage with the military officers four buddhist monks 
in flowing saffron robes chanted prayers for peace 
cambodian and vietnamese officials took turns with speeches that 
denounced khmer rouge genocide and claimed the guerrillas cannot 
take any territory 
maj gen khieu anh lon commander of front 479 hugged a 
cambodian commander in front of a blue banner displaying the 
national emblems of vietnams yellow star and cambodias angkor wat 
temple 
a young pioneer gave him her kerchief while three women in 
traditional costumes presented a bouquet of flowers 
the general walked down the muddied road where the army vehicles 
were waiting picked up a young boy and climbed into his 
weatherbeaten usmade jeep to begin the withdrawal 
the troops carried back bamboo mats water jugs guitars even 
yawning dogs and a monkey on their trucks buses and armored 
personnel carriers 
we are very happy to be leaving said maj duong chu viet 
whose chest pocket was crowded with medals we feel cambodians can 
defend their own country 
the soldiers whose intervention sparked fighting that killed 
tens of thousands of people and split almost all asia into two 
hostile camps smiled and waved yellow and purple flowers as they 
disappeared down the road 
at a press conference wednesday in ho chi minh city vietnam the 
defense ministrys chief spokesman refused to rule out fighting 
another war in cambodia 
if the khmer rouge threatened the phnom penh governments rule 
and asked vietnam for assistance the vietnamese army would then 
announce its decision said maj gen nguyen van thai

test equipment the air force uses to determine 
the effectiveness of radarwarning receivers and other electronics 
on tactical fighters has been faulty and unreliable a new report 
says 
the general accounting office an investigative arm of congress 
said wednesday that the problems with the test equipment undermine 
the combat readiness of the aircraft and the ability of the planes 
to fly combat missions 
the aircraft are equipped with electronic warfare systems 
consisting of a radarwarning receiver that alerts the pilot when 
his airplane is being tracked by enemy radar and a jammer that 
transmits signals to deceive enemy radar 
the gao study found that at five tactical units in the united 
states europe and asia almost half of about 455 jammers the air 
force deemed ready for combat had undetected defects 
the cost for this kind of carelessness can be staggering 
said rep john conyers jr dmich the chairman of the house 
government operations subcommittee on legislation and national 
security which had requested the gao report and the risk it 
poses to our national security and to the lives of our pilots is 
simply unacceptable 
the study attributed the problems to the air forces acquisition 
process in one instance the air force purchased 72 test sets at a 
cost of 272 million before testing them

field testing of genetically modified plants 
and microorganisms will not pose any hazard to the environment 
if done carefully under existing laws says a national academy of 
sciences panel 
genetically engineered plants and microbes are not 
intrinsically dangerous the panel concluded in a study released 
wednesday but the experts said field tests should be allowed only 
after evaluating the effect on the environment if the modified 
organism were to escape from the test area 
we feel fairly confident that if this thing is done right it 
will not pose any hazard said robert h burris an emeritus 
professor of biochemistry from the university of wisconsin we 
hope that this will be reassuring to the public 
jeremy rifkin of the foundation on economic trends a longtime 
opponent of field testing of geneticallyaltered organisms called 
the report irresponsible public policy he said science has no 
way to evaluate the risks of releasing such organisms into the 
environment 
burris who was chairman of the academys committee on evaluation 
of introduction of genemodified microorganisms and plants that 
some 80 modified plants and microbes have been tested in the 
environment and we havent had any accidents as yet

killed in a motorcycle crash four months after a tv movie depicted 
his sevenyear ordeal 
his abduction by a convicted child molester left stayner scarred 
family and friends said at wednesdays service

lives just as though he had never gone he brought our 
brokenhearted family together stayners sister jody told 
mourners who filled a small mormon church and adjoining gymnasium

more than onequarter of male prostitutes studied 
in atlanta were infected with the aids virus and the virus was 
especially common among those also exposed to syphilis and 
hepatitis according to a report today 
until now most studies of aids among prostitutes have focused on 
females 
in the latest work researchers took blood samples from 152 male 
prostitues overall 27 percent were infected with hiv the aids 
virus as were 55 percent who also had syphilis and 37 percent who 
had been exposed to hepatitis b 
fortysix percent of the prostitutes described themselves as 
being heterosexual the rest said they were bisexual or homosexual 
the survey was conducted by dr kirk w elifson and colleagues 
from georgia state university it was published as a letter in the 
new england journal of medicine 
the rate of hiv1 infection in our sample suggests the need for 
continued educational drugtreatment and outreach efforts for male 
prostitutes and their sexual partners they wrote

the need to keep their offspring cool prompts 
asian bees to produce yellow rain excrement the us government 
once believed was a soviet biological weapon researchers reported 
today 
the phenomenon has never been adequately explained were 
providing an explanation said peter g kevan a biologist at the 
university of guelph in canada and coauthor of the study published 
in nature a british science journal 
during the mass defecation flights thousands of asian giant 
honeybees fly in swarms and relieve themselves of hot feces equal to 
20 percent of their weight allowing them to cool their nests more 
efficiently to help their offspring grow the study concluded 
it can be explained by the need to prevent the temperature of 
bees nests becoming so hot as to endanger the larvae wrote kevan 
and makhdzir mardan a biologist at the agricultural university of 
malaysia 
in a 1981 speech and 1982 report thensecretary of state 
alexander haig asserted that yellow rain was a soviet weapon 
derived from fungal toxins and used to kill thousands of people in 
cambodia laos and afghanistan during the 1970s 
that claim was quickly attacked by matthew meselson a harvard 
university biologist who argued the yellow spots left on plants was 
bee excrement 
in 1987 meselson and others published an article in foreign 
policy magazine that demolishes definitively haigs claim the 
magazines editor charles william maynes said at the time 
that article based on declassified documents revealed that 
state department and pentagon investigators who visited asia during 
19831985 concluded haigs theory was wrong nevertheless state 
department officials and white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
replied they had no reason to question haigs assertions 
the us government made a mistake kevan said by phone from 
guelph about 50 miles west of toronto its an embarrassing 
mistake to say the least one can understand why they dont back 
down 
he and mardan took 306 bees from six nests in asian tropical 
forests before and after the insects made mass flights they killed 
the bees weighed their gut contents and measured the amount of heat 
in the bee droppings 
the study determined that the asian giant honeybees excrete large 
amounts of hot waste during the mass flights its like somebody 
weighing 200 pounds suddenly losing 40 pounds kevan said adding 
that a colony of 40000 bees eliminates 1850 calories of heat 
during a single flight 
this behavior doesnt directly cool the bees but lets them cool 
their nests 35 percent more efficiently through a process known as 
gobbetting which also is used by european honeybees kevan said 
during gobbetting a bee regurgitates some nectar so some of the 
liquid in it evaporates on its tongue then the bee swallows the 
cooled nectar 
its like drinking cold water on a hot day kevan said 
the mass defecation flights mean the bees have less body weight 
to cool by gobbetting allowing them to cool themselves and thus 
their nests more easily 
at temperatures much higher or lower than 92 degrees fahrenheit 
bee larvae growth slows and malformed bees are more likely kevan 
said 
mardan and kevan found 80 percent of the mass flights happened 
when the bee colonies were under the greatest heat stress during 
mornings when temperatures rose most rapidly and during windless 
late afternoons

striking miners ended a fourday occupation of 
a coal processing plant hours after a courtimposed deadline but 
the union said it would use the tactic again to increase pressure on 
pittston coal group inc 
were going to hurt this company economically cecil roberts 
vice president of the united mine workers said after leading the 
occupying strikers to a rally outside the plant gates wednesday 
night 
were going to cut off their production until they wake up and 
were going to do it peacefully he said adding that the union 
could attempt to occupy another pittston plant as early as next week 
ninetyfive of pittstons striking miners along with three union 
officials and a religious leader voluntarily ended their occupation 
of the sevenstory building after ignoring a federal judges 
deadline for a little more than two hours 
we got a lot of miles per gallon out of this effort and weve 
got a lot more gas in the tank said eddie burke the unions 
southeast regional coordinator and one of those who occupied the 
plant 
a human barricade of 3000 supporters outside the plant protected 
the occupying team the supporters joined miners and other union 
members from throughout appalachia and the midwest at a rally in 
front of the plant as darkness fell 
some state troopers drove off at dusk and law enforcement 
authorities let the deadline pass without trying to get inside the 
plant 
the troopers withdrew a short distance down the road to let 
them have the rally without any interference said sgt mike 
frank a state police spokesman he said no specific time had been 
set for removing the occupiers 
roberts said the union proved its strength without forcing a 
confrontation 
we stood the state on its head he said we shocked 
pittston and totally cut off their production at their most 
productive processing plant for four days and we did that 
nonviolently everybody stood in the road and locked arms in 
solidarity and nobody could do anything with that power 
earlier us district judge glen williams said the miners would 
face no penalties if they left the plant before the deadline 
otherwise he said they would lose their 200 a week in umw strike 
benefits and face contempt charges while the union would be fined 
600000 for each day of the occupation 
it wasnt clear if they would face penalties for not leaving by 
the deadline 
the unarmed demonstrators stormed the plant sunday when only a 
dozen security officers were on the grounds 
they barricaded themselves inside the control room and shut down 
production at the plant where coal is cleaned sorted and shipped 
replacement workers had been operating the plant since the strike 
began in april although production has been about half of normal 
union leaders said they wanted to make a dramatic public 
statement about what they consider unfair treatment by the company 
which they contend is trying to break the union 
massive fines have taken away all other avenues of peaceful 
protest such as sitdown demonstrations and mass picketing they 
said 
pittston coal president michael odom called the demonstrators 
terrorists and said wednesday we will seek full prosecution under 
the law 
pittstons 1695 umw employees from virginia west virginia and 
kentucky have been on strike over wages and working conditions 
union members at other coal companies staged wildcat strikes in june 
and july 
although williams offered the demonstrators and the union 
amnesty umw attorney mike passino said they still could face state 
penalties 
a state judge already has fined the union nearly 17 million 
based on charges of illegal strike activities brought by the company 
meanwhile sen edward m kennedy dmass said his senate labor 
committee was launching an investigation of the labor dispute he 
did not give a timetable

a jury found a former nursing home 
aide guilty of killing five incapacitated patients in a pact with a 
lesbian lover and families of the victims celebrated the verdict 
outside the court 
my mother can finally rest in peace said jan hunderman 
daughter of victim marguarite chambers the scars will always be 
there but it helps knowing the truth 
a jury deliberated about five hours wednesday before finding 
gwendolyn graham guilty on five counts of firstdegree murder and 
one count of conspiracy to commit firstdegree murder in the deaths 
at alpine manor nursing home in walker 
graham 26 looked down and showed no emotion as the verdicts 
were read 
she faces a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment without 
parole no sentencing date was set 
linda engman daughter of victim mae mason said she was thrilled 
with the verdict i didnt have any doubts at all she said i 
wish we had the death penalty 
with a lack of hard evidence the case rested largely on the 
testimony of catherine wood grahams accomplice and former lover 
wood who already has pleaded guilty to seconddegree murder 
testified that graham smothered patients with washcloths because it 
relieved tension 
wood also a nurses aide at alpine manor said the two had 
formed a love pact each agreeing to kill patients so they would be 
bound to one another for life 
the victims were chambers 60 mason 79 belle burkhard 74 
edith cook 97 and myrtle luce 95 the women all severely 
incapacitated and many suffering from alzheimers disease were 
killed between january and april 1987 
defense attorney james piazza said he planned to ask the judge to 
set aside the verdict 
im surprised and disappointed piazza said there was no 
physical evidence whatsoever 
graham testifying tuesday denied that any murders had occurred 
at the home and said the murder plot was nothing more than a joke 
made up by wood that had gotten out of hand 
graham said a jealous wood went to police with the story after 
graham left her for another lover and moved to her hometown of 
tyler texas 
her denials contradicted testimony of several former coworkers 
and friends who said she admitted suffocating patients at alpine 
manor 
grahams former lover heather baragar testified that graham 
often confessed to her and would joke around about it 
another woman testified graham and wood had shown her 
souvenirs such as an anklet and a balloon they said they had 
taken from their victims 
wood testified that she stood watch while graham suffocated one 
patient but lacked the nerve to kill any of the patients herself 
the deaths had been ruled natural and no autopsies were 
performed police began investigating last october after woods 
exhusband told them she had confessed her part in the murder plot 
autopsies were performed on the only two bodies that were not 
cremated but no definitive evidence of suffocation was found 
even though we still find it difficult to believe that any of 
this actually happened we will continue to place our trust in 
our system of justice said a statement from the nursing home 
in his closing arguments assistant kent county prosecutor david 
schieber speculated that graham herself may not know why she killed 
the women 
it was murder for its own pleasure he said

joseph a fernandez who grew up in a harlem 
housing project and dropped out of a new york high school never 
dreamed he would lead the nations largest public school system 
fernandez currently the miami school superintendent said the 
new york city job was the farthest thing from his mind when he was 
growing up in rough areas on manhattans west side 
i didnt think id leave new york alive much less come back to 
lead the school system he said at a news conference in miami 
on wednesday the new york board of education voted unanimously 
to approve fernandez as the next chancellor of the new york city 
public schools 
he will stand as a splendid role model board president 
robert wagner jr said of 53yearold fernandez 
wagner praised fernandez for lowering the dropout rate in 
miamidade county schools while increasing parent and student 
involvement in individual schools 
fernandez will face a daunting list of problems in new york 
including overcrowded schools a high dropout rate and a 
decentralized system which has been stung by patronage and 
corruption scandals 
i like a challenge said fernandez if you put

prophet school superintendent of portland ore withdrew from 
consideration 
in 1987 during the search that was to lead to greens

fernandez said the timing was wrong because he had just been named 
to head the miami system the nations fourth biggest

the number one system in the country maybe we can turn some of 
the larger school systems in the country around by replicating what

many american professors are including 
the recent democracy protests in china and subsequent army crackdown 
in their courses and theyre finding that the beijing massacre has 
boosted student interest in those courses sharply 
some professors already have begun to teach the lessons of 
tiananmen square this fall while others plan to wait until spring to 
review the already rich literature spawned by the protests 
five or six years after our students graduate many of them are 
in positions to make a difference said andrew walder a professor 
of sociology at harvard university walder usually teaches a 
graduate seminar focusing on post1949 events in china but plans 
this year to examine the years just since 1979 
gordon bennett a professor of government at the university of 
texas austin said the demonstrations for democracy that occupied 
beijings tiananmen square until the army crackdown in early june 
will form the centerpiece of a survey of chinese politics he 
plans to teach next spring 
it relates to every thesis of political change in china 
bennett said that is whether chinese authoritarianism was 
capable of significant economic reform while suppressing political 
change or alternatively whether the decade of economic reform in 
china was forced 
roderick macfarquhar professor of government at harvard plans 
to teach a seminar in chinese politics to juniors this semester and 
said that the june protests will take up at least one week of the 
course 
macfarquhar said he heard from colleagues at beijing university 
when he taught a course on the cultural revolution several years ago 
that chinese officials wondered why someone at harvard was giving 
a course on it and they werent it caused a lively debate 
as a result macfarquhar said the current regime may well be 
apprised of professors at american universities teaching about 
tiananmen square but since they are antagonistic the reaction at 
the official level will be negative 
thomas gold associate professor of sociology and vicechairman 
of the center for chinese studies at the university of california 
berkeley said the number of students enrolled in his undergraduate 
course on contemporary chinese society has doubled to more than 120 
students since he last offered it two years ago 
but while gold expects that the student protests will dominate 
the course he said recent events in beijing reflected a pattern in 
chinese government and society that has existed for centuries 
its part of a dichotomy between a tightening up and a 
loosening that goes back thousands of years gold said 
but tiananmen square meant a temporary victory for those people 
who want to clamp down what happened in tiananmen square has 
happened many times part of the tragedy is how little is new he 
said 
gold said the events in beijing caught the imagination of 
american students 
it brought out our respect for human rights and democracy that 
most people dont think of very often he said when they saw 
this in china it was sort of an ennobling experience people are 
trying to understand what happened and once they do it will have a 
larger impact

the communist party newspaper pravda made a rare 
public apology today for printing an article that accused political 
maverick boris n yeltsin of indulging in a boozing and buying spree 
during his us tour 
it said the reporter who wrote the story hadnt seen the 
purported binge himself but relied instead on a us newspaper 
report and hearsay 
on monday pravda reprinted an article published by the italian 
newspaper la repubblica that said yeltsin had departed the united 
states leaving a wake of catastrophic prophecies insane expenses 
interviews and above all the perfume of jack daniels black label 
whiskey 
a flushed and angry yeltsin called the charges garbage within 
minutes of returning to moscow monday night the soviet legislator 
accused pravda of seeking revenge for the fact americans received 
us with admiration 
the communist party daily said today that it had instructed its 
washington correspondent v linnik to contact the la repubblica 
reporter who wrote the original article vittorio zucconi and check 
its accuracy 
asked whether he stood by the authenticity of everything he 
wrote about bn yeltsin in his article zucconi replied he had 
based it on secondary sources on a story that appeared in the 
washington post on sept 13 headlined with drunken embraces towards 
the capitalists and the testimony of soviet emigres who heard talk 
of yeltsins conduct in baltimore pravda said 
the pravda editorial board then offered its apologies to yeltsin 
but seemed to do it grudgingly the reprint of la repubblica story 
was promoted on the front page with excerpts saying yeltsin found 
the united states a holiday a stage a bar 5000 kilometers 
long 
but pravdas apology came on the bottom of page 7 
pravdas reprint of zucconis article without comment prompted 
the weekly moscow news to publish an editorial sharply criticizing 
the official organ of the communist party whose name means the 
truth 
noting that the soviet press practically never tells readers 
which of their leaders drink or about their shopping habits abroad 
the moscow news editorial said sarcastically about yeltsin we 
now know pity that such a leap forward in the sphere of glasnost 
was made by the soviet press not on its own but with the help of an 
italian newspaper 
during his ninecity tour that ended sunday yeltsin warned 
americans that president mikhail s gorbachev could face a 
revolution if he fails to improve living conditions soon 
yeltsin the former communist party chief of moscow was stripped 
of the post almost two years ago by gorbachev who criticized him as 
politically immature and overly ambitious 
but in a remarkable political comeback in march yeltsin won 89 
percent of the vote when he ran against an establishment candidate 
to represent moscow in the new congress of peoples deputies 
a month and a half ago he was elected along with nobel peace 
prize laureate andrei d sakharov and a handful of other reformers 
to the steering committee of the first organized opposition in the 
soviet parliament in almost 70 years

the military head of the pacific edition of stars 
and stripes today rejected allegations of censorship and personnel 
abuse under his editorship of the newspaper for us armed forces in 
the far east 
the paper is not censored said air force col edwin 
montgomery ive never had anyone no flag officer or bureaucrat 
tell me what stories to write or how they are to run 
ive been here three years and no one has told me anything like 
that 
but a civilian journalist at the newspaper dewey brackett said 
he was preparing a list of serious problems to be given to the 
papers management and to ombusdman philip m foisie who is to 
arrive sunday 
the pentagon appointed foisie ombudsman in june for the european 
and far east editions of stars and stripes with authority to 
monitor their performance and argue with military brass over 
decisions about news coverage 
he is a former editor with the washington post and a former 
executive editor of the parisbased international herald tribune 
the issue is not simply censorship it is also abuse of 
personnel and editorial mismanagement brackett said in a 
telephone interview 
brackett who testified before congress last winter about 
conditions at the newspaper declined to give details before the 
list is submitted 
montgomery who also testified before congress on the dispute 
said in a telephone interview that he felt foisie also will 
represent him 
mr foisie will have the opportunity to speak with whomever he 
wishes and im confident he will come to the conclusion were not 
censoring the paper he said 
the editorial staff consists of 17 us civilians and 21 military 
people montgomery said 
montgomery disputed bracketts claim that brackett had been 
disciplined for testifying to congress 
brackett has been only temporarily relieved as pacific editor and 
assigned to be a supervising editor montgomery said while we can 
analyze the latest series of allegations 
he said it was normal for civilian employees of the government to 
be relieved of normal duties during an investigation 
brackett said however i feel my relief is harassment and 
definitely retribution for having testified to congress 
brackett 49 said he was a retired us air force officer with 
about 20 years experience in journalism and in the far east 
there have been a series of disputes involving stars and stripes 
in recent years and they predate the arrival of montgomery who 
previously was a staff officer in washington 
reporters who have worked for star and stripes say their 
reporting of the news sometimes suffers because military commanders 
worry about the sensitivities of host countries 
the two editions of the paper published in japan and west 
germany are edited separately and are supposed to be hometown 
newspapers for us service personnel 
the pentagon describes them as authorized but unofficial 
publications and their charter says they are to provide a free 
flow of news and information without censorship or news 
management 
but last year an investigation by the general accounting office 
an arm of the us congress found evidence of censorship and 
improper managament the society of professional journalists sigma 
delta chi assisted in that investigation 
democratic reps barbara boxer of california and earl hutto of 
florida have written to adm huntington hardisty commander of us 
forces in the pacific asking him to look into continued allegations 
what we have here is harassment of whistleblowers and 
censorship ms boxer said in an interview in washington its 
bad enough to censor the news our men and women in uniform deserve 
the news as all of us get it as harsh as it is

sixteen kuwaiti shiite moslems were 
executed today for planting bombs that exploded in mecca at the 
height of the moslem pilgrimage this year the interior ministry 
announced 
the statement read over the staterun riyadh radio said that 
another four kuwaitis received prison terms of 15 and 20 years and 
1000 to 1500 lashes of the whip it said another nine kuwaitis 
were acquitted 
it was the first public word from saudi arabia that anyone had 
even been arrested in connection with the july 10 explosions which 
killed one pakistani pilgrim and injured 16 pilgrims of various 
nationalities 
the bombs went off as roughly 2 million moslems were preparing to 
head to mount arafat for the culmination of the pilgrimage rites 
saudi arabia is home of islams holiest shrines at mecca and medina 
saudi arabians including the ruling family are members of the 
majority sunni moslem sect the sunnis and the minority shiite sect 
which prevails in iran are traditional rivals for the alliegance of 
the worlds nearly 1 billon moslems the antagonism dates back to a 
split that occurred in the 7th century 
todays announcement said without elaborating that the executions 
were carried out in mecca and in accordance with islamic law 
condemned inmates in saudi arabia are usually beheaded by sword 
often in public squares after moslem prayers 
the defendants who came to the kingdom in july as pilgrims 
belonged to the moslem shiite sect and were of iranian kuwaiti 
saudi and qatari origin according to the statement they were all 
kuwaiti nationals 
the announcement said the defendants who had been tried before 
an islamic court gave full confessions it said the confession 
would be broadcast on television 
the announcement said the defendents were tried for an evil 
crime an aggression on the sanctity of the holy sites and on the 
pilgrims of the entire moslem nation 
the visit of senior kuwaiti officials in recent weeks had 
prompted reports that the saudis were holding and interrogating 
several kuwaiti pilgrims 
the latest was a whirlwind visit tuesday by the kuwaiti minister 
of state for foreign affairs saud alossaimi to relay a message 
from the kuwaiti leadership 
the interior ministry statement said the defendants brought the 
explosives with them from kuwait where they also trained on using 
them 
it said they held meetings in kuwait medina and mecca to plan 
their aggression with the confessed aim of spreading terror 
and fear in the hearts of the pilgrims and show that the saudi 
arabia was unable to protect the house of god 
it referred to their carrying out their crime at the 
instructions of the unjust ones who are enemies of this nation and 
for all pilgrims of gods house and cooperating with those unjust 
ones on such debauchery and terrorism in the most sacred spot in the 
world 
the allusion was an apparent reference to iran which has been 
urging moslems pouring into saudi arabia for the annual hajj to 
seize mecca and medina from the ruling al saud family 
the saudi ruling dynasty is the custodian of the holy shrines 
which are visited by moslems as one of the five pillars of their 
faith 
under the rule of the late ayatollah ruhollah khomeini the 
iranian pilgrims tried to turn the hajj into a political forum to 
spread his islamic fundamentalist teachings 
the worst incidents occurred in the pilgrimage of 1987 when the 
iranian contingent clashed with saudi security forces leading to 
the death of 402 pilgrims most of them iranians 
riyadh severed ties with iran the following april and gained the 
moslems world backing for restricting the number of pilgrims to 
1000 people for each 1 million people of the sending nations 
population 
the iranians boycotted the hajj in 1988 and 1989 as a result and 
there was a fierce war of words between tehran and riyadh 
iran however has moved recently to improve ties with gulf arab 
nations including saudi arabia a pragmatic camp in tehran 
headed by president hashemi rafsanjani is trying to open iran more 
to the outside world 
it is opposed by radicals who view links with the prowestern 
saudi rulers as anathema 
kuwait itself has been a target of several acts of terrorism for 
which responsibility was laid on khomeinis iran these acts 
included an attempt on the kuwaiti ruler sheik jaber alahmed 
alsabah in 1985 and two years earlier the bomb blasts on the us 
and french embassies in which five people were killed and 86 injured 
all these acts were also carried out by activists among kuwaits 
shiite moslem minority many of them identified as members of the 
antiiraqi underground daawa party the shiites in kuwait are mainly 
members of families that came from iraq and iran for livelihood in 
kuwait

helping each other get out said larry martin a social worker 
from brooklyn who was on the boeing 737 with his wife valerie

we were going to go down the slide and onto the runway when we got 
off the slide we were in the water 
flight 5050 from laguardia airport to charlotte nc was 
carrying 63 people when it skidded off a runway into the east river 
killing two people the airline said 
it wasnt a violent crash said frank obrien 25 of 
manhattan we went out the emergency exit there was some 
driftwood in the water that several people clung to 
he said police came by in a boat and picked them up we were 
just hanging on to each other we decided the only thing to do was 
to be calm 
david hawthorne a cbs news producer who was on the flight said 
via a cellular telephone that the engines apparently were cut 
halfway down the runway and went into reverse thrust 
at that time no one thought there was going to be real 
trouble he said 
the pilot seemed to be accelerating but didnt have enough 
power to get the plane up martin said as he and his wife huddled 
in blankets inside an airport terminal 
and it seemed something happened and he put on the brakes he 
said the plane took a dip and the next thing i knew all hell 
broke loose 
hawthorne said he managed to get out onto a wing where he waited 
with several other people to be rescued 
a lot of women and children were screaming that they couldnt 
swim they couldnt swim he said 
most people were pretty calm after we got out onto the wing of 
the plane he said and they waited for boats to come pick us up 
and the rescuers also arrived and i have to say they did a pretty 
good job of keeping everybody calm and getting them safely off 
some people were trapped in the tail section of the plane he 
said and rescuers and crewmembers tried to keep them calm 
jerry murtha a fire department scuba diver said it took him 
about 45 minutes using a metal cutter to rescue one woman trapped in 
the tail section between collapsed seats behind a woman who had 
died 
water started coming into the tail section he said when 
we started it was at 6 inches and when we finished there was 3 feet 
and it the fuselage was rocking 
he said firefighters placed the unidentified woman who was not 
seriously injured into a basket and took her to a boat 
she hugged us kissed us she wanted to know our names she 
thanked us a million times murtha said 
martin said a stranger helped him after they hit the water 
i started to panic he said there was a guy he 
grabbed me he maneuvered me over to the driftwood if it wasnt 
there i dont know what would have happened

president bush is refusing a request by 
colombian president virgilio barco to reinstate a oneyear colombian 
coffee export that has been beneficial to colombian farmers the 
white house says 
colombias coffee earnings have slumped at the same time that the 
bush administration is seeking barcos help in cracking down on 
cocaine exports 
colombian officials have suggested they will have an even harder 
time persuading hardpressed colombia farmers to grow coffee instead 
of coca if coffee export prices continue to slip 
colombian coffee prices have fallen sharply since the 74nation 
international coffee agreement ica to which both the united 
states and colombia belonged collapsed in july after the united 
states pulled out in a dispute over prices with coffeeproducing 
nations 
the agreement set quotas for member nations exports aimed at 
supporting prices of beans at 120 per pound or more some central 
american and others supported by the united states wanted larger 
quotas 
after suspension of the quotas in early july prices fell quickly 
to around 85 cents per pound give or take a few pennies colombia 
has said this will cost 500 million a year in export revenue 
barco whose nation relies on coffee as a major source of export 
earnings had appealed to bush to reconsider the coffee decision and 
to support reinstating the quotas for at least one year 
bush in a letter to barco said the united states was ready to 
negotiate for a new quota system but was unwilling to adhere to the 
nowdefunct agreement presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater 
said wednesday 
fitzwater said that bushs letter to barco was one expressing 
appreciation of the importance of coffee to the economies of 
colombia and other developing countries 
the letter fitzwater continued expressed his bushs 
disappointment that the members of the ica were unable to settle 
two fundamental problems 
the united states wanted an increase in export quotas for 
higherquality coffees enjoyed by american consumers and tough 
penalties against countries secretly selling coffee surpluses to 
eastern bloc nations at prices below those charged the united states 
president bush expresses his confidence that a lasting solution 
which is acceptable to other major members and respects market 
trends can be found fitzwater said

the toronto businessman who bought ptls 
christian theme park for 65 million says he is backing out of the 
deal because of conflicting claims to the land from an indian tribe 
stephen mernick on wednesday said the claims have prevented him 
from getting title insurance on the 2300acre heritage usa park and 
that the dispute is an insurmountable barrier to closing the 
deal by the sept 30 deadline 
mernick bought the christian theme park resort and shopping 
complex in a us bankruptcy court sale a year ago after the tv 
evangelical empires collapse in the sex and money scandal that 
brought down jim bakker 
title insurance protects a piece of property from conflicting 
claims 
title insurers have been unwilling to issue a policy which 
mernick needs to secure financing for the deal because of a claim 
by the catawba indians to 144000 acres in northern south carolina 
that include heritage usa 
mernick sought a oneyear extension of the closing to 1990 to 
obtain insurance but the court and the ptl creditors who stand to 
gain from the sale withheld a decision unless he opened his records 
and offered evidence that he had the financing to complete the deal 
i was fully prepared to submit to such an examination 
mernick said but he said the catawbas claims appear to present 
at this time an insurmountable barrier to the closing of the 
original transaction 
mc benton a trustee appointed by the court for nowdefunct ptl 
ministries was notified wednesday that mernick was backing out 
heritage usa is still for sale said edwin allman an 
attorney for benton 
any sale would still be subject to court approval 
the claim filed in 1980 by the catawba indians seeks to reclaim 
land they contend was illegally sold to the state in 1840 a date 
has not been set for the lawsuit which apparently has halted other 
commercial development including a 100 million mall 
the 175 million theme park was developed by bakker and his wife 
tammy ptl filed for bankruptcy in 1987 bakker is on trial in 
charlotte nc on charges of defrauding followers of nearly 4 
million

nato and the warsaw pact would limit most 
military maneuvers in europe to 40000 soldiers and 800 tanks under 
a proposal offered by nato today at eastwest talks on conventional 
forces 
the proposal the first to limit european military maneuvers was 
presented to warsaw pact delegates at the start of the latest round 
of the talks 
chief west german delegate ruediger hartmann called the package 
the most comprehensive most detailed and most ambitious arms 
control system that was ever worked out for conventional forces 
the nato offer expands on a proposal the west made july 13 based 
on a blueprint for deep reductions in arms and troops that president 
bush unveiled at a nato summit meeting in may 
hartmann said the nato package provides all the negotiating 
material needed to reach an agreement on conventional arms next year 
it proposes limiting the size of military maneuvers to 40000 men 
and 800 tanks one maneuver every two years would be allowed to 
exceed those limits 
the nato paper also requires each side to give 42 days notice 
when calling up more than 40000 reservists and would impose 
ceilings on the number of tanks artillery pieces and personnel 
carriers in active units 
it is little changed from a package offered two weeks ago at the 
opening session of the vienna talks on reducing conventional forces 
in europe a dispute among nato members delayed its presentation 
seven warsaw pact countries and 16 nato members are taking part 
in the talks on conventional forces in europe which began in march 
and cover all of europe from the atlantic ocean to the ural 
mountains 
the measures proposed by the west today also provide for an 
extensive exchange of information as part of detailed verification 
including routine inspections to see each side carries out pledged 
reductions and maintains agreed upon ceilings western allies are 
divided on this issue with the united states and canada seeking 
strict surveillance and their european partners objecting to 
frequent inspections of their facilities by the warsaw pact 
under the proposal removal of equipment from monitored storage 
or units with a low level of readiness would be permitted only after 
prior notification 
in its july proposal nato suggested each alliance have no more 
than 5700 combat aircraft and 1900 combat helicopters the july 13 
initiative also would restrict any one country to 3420 aircraft and 
1140 helicopter gunships 
heavy armaments cuts are recommended with a suggested ceiling of 
20000 main battle tanks 16500 artillery pieces and 28000 armored 
personnel carriers for each side 
nato also is proposing that us and soviet troops stationed 
outside their national territory in europe not exceed 275000 each 
diplomats for east and west are optimistic that preliminary 
agreements can be reached next year and implemented by 1992 or 1993 
negotiators have said the biggest problem in the current sixweek 
round of talks is weapons categories 
the most serious differences exist in aircraft 
the warsaw pact while not presenting specific figures insists 
air defense interceptors based near moscow and the urals be 
excluded 
nato objects western experts have expressed concern that 
defensive aircraft could be reconstructed for strike capabilities 
the warsaw pact has not yet responded to the wests july 
proposal but in march proposed reducing six kinds of weapons 
including aircraft by 10 to 15 percent by 1994 that would be 
followed by a further 25 percent cut by 1997 with the ultimate goal 
of purely defensive forces by the year 2000

recovered flight recorders today in an effort to learn why a usair 
jet carrying 63 people aborted takeoff and skidded into the east 
river killing two passengers 
about 10 people were rescued clinging to driftwood while others 
huddled on the wing of the 9monthold boeing 737400 that broke 
apart late wednesday at the waters edge at laguardia airport 
we just grabbed on to a big piece of wood and held on for dear 
life said tom newberry 27 of new york city 
this morning the planes data and cockpit voice recorders were 
recovered port authority spokesman mark marchese said officials 
from the national transportation safety board arrived and began 
talking to the crew 
something happened and he put on the brakes the plane took a 
dip and the next thing i knew all hell broke loose said passenger 
larry martin of new york city who huddled in blankets with his 
wife valerie 
people were on top of each other people were screaming there 
was the smell of gas everyone was saying get out get out get 
out he said the martins got out and held fast to driftwood 
until a police boat plucked them from the water 
officials said two women who had seats in the rear of the plane 
near where the fuselage snapped were killed their bodies were taken 
from the cabin the cause of death was not immediately known 
fortyfive people were taken to the hospital two were reported 
in serious condition and a third was in stable condition after a 
heart attack 
the coast guard said overnight that up to six people were missing 
and divers were sent to look for them but an airline spokeswoman 
susan young said all 57 passengers and six crew members were 
accounted for as of 8 am 
flight 5050 bound for charlotte nc originally scheduled for 
departure at 727 pm was delayed by heavy rain but officials 
said weather was not a factor in the 1129 pm crash 
the plane split into three pieces its nose remaining above water 
on a pier that holds runway approach lights the other pieces were 
partly submerged in 25 to 40footdeep water just beyond a runway 
that extended onto pylons 10 feet above the water a crane raised 
the wreckage at dawn 
what held it up was a lighting bridge mayor edward i koch 
said of the front section the back section god held that up 
stephen berger executive director of the port authority which 
operates the airport said several people walked away from the 
crash and at least one took a taxi home 
some survivors crawled onto the wing to await rescue others 
some shoeless slid out exits into the water at least one person 
was cut from the wreckage they were hanging from the pier 
hanging on the wing hanging from the front of the plane said 
police lt larry johnston 
the airport reopened this morning after six hours 
the plane was delivered new to usair in january and had no 
history of mechanical problems said nancy vaughan another usair 
spokeswoman 
coast guard lt tom blisard said most of the passengers were 
saved because the water was not cold the plane went down close to 
the lighted runway and the impact was not harsh he said the only 
problem was a strong current 
david hawthorne a cbs news producer who was on the plane said 
he moved toward the back and got out onto a wing a lot of women 
and children were screaming that they couldnt swim they couldnt 
swim hawthorne said 
coast guard boats and planes police vehicles a cherry picker 
and divers responded 
frank obrien 25 of new york city said he helped a few 
passengers 
a couple people couldnt swim so we got them on the 
driftwood he said it was a kind of row row row your boat 
it was kind of funny but not really you cant think about what can 
happen here 
the planes engines apparently cut off halfway down the runway 
and went into reverse thrust hawthorne said at that time no one 
thought there was going to be real trouble he told cbs via 
cellular telephone 
most people were pretty calm after we got out onto the wing of 
the plane he said and they waited for boats to come pick us up 
and the rescuers also arrived and i have to say they did a pretty 
good job of keeping everybody calm and getting them safely off

causing heavy damage to nine offices of colombias main political 
parties and to one bank police said at least two people were 
reported injured 
bombings have occurred almost daily since the government declared 
a crackdown on colombias powerful cocaine traffickers on aug 18 
the explosions came hours after lawmakers urged the government to 
publicize reported black lists of corrupt politicians and 
officials 
colombian newspapers today published the names of 25 lawmakers 
and politicians including a liberal party presidential candidate 
who the papers said had their us visas denied or canceled 
us embassy spokesman pablo urutia today said he did not know if 
the visas were withheld because of links with traffickers he 
refused further comment 
police said the bombs went off around 3 am 
they damaged offices of the liberals and conservatives 
colombias two main political parties in several neighborhoods of 
the capital of 6 million people another blast ripped through a 
bank banks have been a favorite target of the cocaine cartels 
police said the two injured people were taken to hospitals there 
were no other details immediately available 
this shows the total decadence we are living in in this 
country its a senseless war said emilio barguch 
secretarygeneral of the conservative party he said one blast 
destroyed national party headquarters 
liberal party leader julio cesar sanchez a former bogota mayor 
called for an emergency meeting of the congress to discuss 
additional security measures 
liberal party presidential candidate alberto santofimio botero 
said today his us visa was canceled in march in miami because he 
met medellin cartel leader pablo escobar eight years ago when both 
were congressmen 
i barely knew him and met him only during a political rally 
the liberal politician told radio caracol a private radio chain he 
accused the united states of retaliating for his criticism of 
american intervention in nicaragua and panama and other parts of 
latin america 
on wednesday the senate asked the government for a us list 
with names of politicians denied visas because of suspected drug 
connections 
it also passed a resolution urging the government to make public 
other lists with names of politicians and government leaders alleged 
to have links with the cartels barco has said hes not aware of any 
such lists 
also wednesday the head of the countrys criminal investigation 
office said british and israeli mercenaries smuggled weapons through 
panama to train assassination squads for drug cartels teaching them 
tactics used in political killings and bombings 
gen miguel maza marquez head of the department of 
administrative security told the senate that the mercenaries 
working for the drug cartels since 1987 cant escape 
responsibility for the bank bombings and political assassinations 
the slaying aug 18 of sen luis carlos galan a popular 
presidential candidate and antidrug crusader led to the government 
crackdown 
as part of the crackdown president virgilio barco revived 
colombias extradition treaty with the united states where the top 
traffickers are wanted so far one person has been extradited but 
the drug barons on the nations mostwanted list have eluded capture 
maza said foreign military trainers smuggled weapons from 
neighboring panama to train four paramilitary groups squads of 50 
to 80 men each received up to four months of training maza said 
he said at least nine israelis trained the squads its unknown 
how many british mercenaries were involved but the british embassy 
has acknowledged trainers were in colombia 
maza said his information was based in intelligence 
investigations but he charged that many in the military and 
government in an attempt to discredit him and have been slow to 
act on his reports 
maza who has had at least four recent attempts on his life 
headed the investigation that led to the government issuing an 
arrest warrant monday for yair klein a former israeli army colonel 
accused of training paramilitary squads for drug cartels 
mercenary training for both the cali and medellin cocaine cartels 
consisted of supplying weapons and martial arts and explosives 
training maza said

a special committee today proposed streamlining 
death penalty appeals to assure swifter executions but only after 
guaranteeing condemned prisoners competent legal help 
capital cases should be subject to one complete and fair course 
of collateral review in the state and federal system said the 
panel appointed by chief justice william h rehnquist when this 
review has concluded litigation should end 
retired supreme court justice lewis f powell the committee 
chairman said the current system encourages endless delays 
repetitive appeals and frenzied lastminute activity as death row 
inmates approach scheduled executions 
the hard fact is that the laws of 37 states that have the 
death penalty are not being enforced by the courts powell said 
i respect those who argue for outright abolition of death 
punishment but it seems irrational to retain the penalty and 
frustrate its fair implementation 
powell noted that there are some 2200 death row inmates but 
there have been only 118 executions since the supreme court 
reinstated the death penalty in 1972 
he said the average delay between conviction and execution is 
more than eight years and the longest has been 14 years 
delay of this magnitude is hardly necessary for fairness or for 
thorough review powell said 
the committee he heads recommended that states enact laws to 
assure that death row inmates have adequate legal help throughout 
their appeals at taxpayer expense the committee did not estimate 
the potential cost or the likely reduction in time between 
convictions and executions 
if the state chose not to adopt the plan the current system 
would remain in effect for that state permitting repetitive state 
and federal court appeals 
one feature of the new system would be a sixmonth period to file 
a federal appeal after the prisoner exhausts state appeals there is 
no such time period now 
the current system permits death row inmates to file repeated 
appeals to federal courts to challenge alleged violations of their 
constitutional rights 
under the committees proposal there would be one round of such 
federal appeals unless condemned prisoners could produce new 
evidence to demonstrate innocence

prime minister margaret thatcher of britain called 
today for strong western support for soviet economic and political 
reforms saying they are in the interest of liberty 
mrs thatcher in japan for an international conference of 
conservative parties also said she is confident that trade issues 
raised in meetings with japanese leaders and business executives 
will be resolved satisfactorily 
the british leader has frankly criticized what she called japans 
unfair trade barriers and urged fast action to open its markets to 
foreign goods 
in a meeting with former prime minister noboru takeshita and 
later in comments to reporters mrs thatcher stressed japans 
responsibility to contribute to global economic growth and called 
for stronger support for reforms spearheaded by soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev 
this is the most bold and courageous leader the soviet union 
has had while its been under communism what mr gorbachev is 
attempting to do is in the interests of liberty as a whole and 
in the interest of all other nations who believe in the cause of 
democracy as well 
we should do therefore everything we can to support this 
great historic movement and do all we can to see that it is 
successful 
mrs thatcher will visit moscow for talks with gorbachev when she 
leaves tokyo on friday 
she noted a trend in favor of western democratic political and 
economic views but cautioned against relaxing defenses predicting a 
period of instability in eastwest relations and elsewhere 
a time of great uncertainty is no time to reduce your 
defenses she said you dont prevent wars by disarmament you 
prevent wars by quietly being prepared and having a sure defense 
mrs thatcher pointed to china as an area where unexpected 
political developments had created great uncertainty and she urged 
japan to provide increased investment and support to hong kong 
confidence in the future of that british colony which reverts to 
chinese rule in 1997 was shaken severely by beijings military 
assault on prodemocracy demonstrators in china in june and an 
ensuing crackdown on political dissent 
it is absolutely vital we should do everything we can to keep 
up the confidence of the people in hong kong she said 
mrs thatcher who arrived tuesday in tokyo to attend a 
conference of the international democratic union a grouping of 
rightofcenter political parties called her visit timely 
with so many changes taking place in the world it is very 
important that the great democracies and particularly the economic 
summit seven countries should consult very closely with each 
other she said 
she said she hoped to create an unprecedented partnership 
with japan in the 1990s and to resolve lingering trade problems

intelligence during tours at the armys field station berlin 
listening post and in frankfurt west germany fort monmouth nj

judges wont be able to let violent criminals off 
without prison unless they explain their sentences in writing under 
a new state law 
gov michael s dukakis who signed the legislation wednesday 
along with a bill increasing aid to victims of violent crime 
acknowledged the law would probably lead to more crowded prisons 
but he said he is committed to expanding prison space 
if a judge is not going to sentence someone to prison for a 
crime of violence he should have very good reasons reasons that 
will hold up to public scrutiny dukakis said were going to 
expect judges in this state to be accountable 
judges are fallible and make mistakes occasionally he said 
adding that that would be much less likely to happen under the new 
law because judges will be forced to think carefully about their 
rulings 
chief justice paul liacos said through a spokeswoman that he 
isnt against the concept but is worried it will require more work 
of judges without providing extra staff 
the other bill signed by dukakis at least doubles the fine 
imposed on criminals to help victims 
a sponsor said the legislation would raise 5 million a year for 
services such as translation and counseling as well as 15 million 
toward direct compensation to victims

the only known horse ferry left in america 
will be preserved at its underwater location in lake champlain 
where divers will be allowed to examine it and take photographs 
just as were protecting the natural beauty of lake champlain 
what todays event marks is the protecting of the historic 
resources said vermont gov madeleine kunin who dedicated the 
wreck wednesday along with state and local officials historians and 
representatives of the diving community 
the horsepowered ferry which cruised 150 years ago and three 
other shipwrecks are marked with surface buoys and underwater signs 
that encourage divers to look but keep the wreck intact a bright 
yellow sign placed on the horse ferry advises divers to take 
nothing but photos 
the horse ferry or teamboat was powered by two horses or 
mules who walked on a large turntable mounted beneath the deck the 
turntable drove a pair of paddle wheels that allowed the ferry to 
travel the lake between vermont and new york state 
the identity and date of the boat are still unknown but it most 
likely cruised the lake in the first half of the 19th century the 
design is based on an 1819 patent and the vermont legislature 
granted the first teamboat charter on lake champlain in 1821 the 
last teamboat was retired around the time of the civil war 
kevin crisman a marine archaeologist who is documenting the 
wreck said the twohorsepower boat would have been heard several 
miles away with the horses hooves clumping on the deck and the 
iron gears clanking 
today its remains are in 45 feet of water less than a mile 
northwest of the burlington breakwater it is 63 feet long and 23 
feet wide and is extremely fragile said giovanna peebles vermont 
state archaeologist 
divers can see the algaecovered wreck from five to 15 feet away 
crisman said the most spectacular part is the paddle wheels with 
the iron hubs and oak spokes still complete although badly 
deteriorated rising 10 feet above the bottom

nato on thursday offered the warsaw pact 
sweeping new proposals for reducing the threat of war in europe and 
senior western negotiators expressed confidence agreement could be 
reached by next year 
the proposals would regulate exchange of information on numbers 
and locations of forces and weapons systems of the two military 
pacts over a zone stretching west from the atlantic ocean to the 
soviet ural mountains in the east 
western delegation heads said their new presentation at the talks 
on conventional armed forces in europe completed initial nato 
concepts on curbing the possibility of nonnuclear war on the 
continent 
in earlier proposals the 16nation north atlantic treaty 
organization suggested weapons ceilings on arms categories including 
combat aircraft and helicopters and the scrapping of all withdrawn 
equipment 
chief west german delegate ruediger hartmann called the total 
nato package the most comprehensive most detailed and most 
ambitious arms control system that was ever worked out for 
conventional forces 
his canadian counterpart david peel told reporters now that 
our package is there i think chances of our reaching agreement 
next year are extremely good 
reflecting nato confidence of quick progress chief us delegate 
stephen j ledogar said the alliance was planning to present a draft 
treaty possibly before the current round of talks ends oct 19 the 
talks resume nov 10 
the new 13page nato initiative includes the following 
proposals 
exchange of detailed information on combat and support units and 
air defenses to the squadron or batallion level 
providing the numbers and locations of main battle tanks 
artillery pieces armored troop carriers combat aircraft and combat 
helicopters as well as nato arms depots and their warsaw pact 
equivalents 
information on the number and location of us and soviet troops 
in allied european countries 
advance notification of major changes in force organization and 
strength mobilization of reservists if they number 42000 or more 
and of major movements of main battle tanks artillery and armored 
troop carriers 
limits on the numbers of main battle tanks artillery and troop 
carriers in storage 
no more than one military excercise every two years mobilizing 
more than 40000 troops or 800 main battle tanks 
inspection of designated bases and depots and the right to ask 
for inspection of nondesignated ones requests to look at 
nondesignated bases and depots may be refused 
monitoring of the destruction of withdrawn equipment 
a warsaw pact negotiator who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said in an interview that the new proposals showed promise but 
that it was too early for substantive comment 
the sevennation warsaw pact still has to formally respond to a 
nato initiative presented in july 
that initiative incorporated proposals made in may by president 
bush including capping the us and soviet troop strengths at 
275000 each and slashing the number of military aircraft 
while acknowledging general superiority in numbers the warsaw 
pact disputes the accuracy of specific nato statistics on personnel 
and weapons 
according to november 1988 nato statistics moscow and its allies 
have 3090000 men in europe compared to 2213593 for nato 51500 
main battle tanks to 16424 for nato 22400 armored infantry 
fighting vehicles to natos 4153 43400 artillery pieces to 14458 
in nato and 8250 combat aircraft to 3977 for nato

president bush today won the support of former 
president jimmy carter for spending 9 million to aid the 
antisandinista opposition in nicaraguas elections next year as a 
way to make the playing field level 
carter who as head of the atlantabased council of freely 
elected heads of state will lead an observer delegation to the 
nicaraguan elections said as long as the money is used in 
accordance with nicaraguan law it will benefit the political 
process he spoke with reporters after meeting with the president 
the nicaraguan election law requires that half of any money 
coming into the political process from outside the country be given 
to the countrys electoral council that runs the elections 
carter reiterated his opinion that indications are the elections 
will be fair although some in the administration remain wary of the 
leftist sandinistas sincerity 
bush was expected to send a formal request for the aid to capitol 
hill as early as today according to congressional sources the aid 
is intended to help long shot opposition candidate violeta chamorro 
get a fairer shot in the presidential election scheduled for 
february 
secretary of state james a baker iii has been sounding out 
prospects for the measure with congressional leaders and one senate 
gop source who spoke on condition of anonymity said responses had 
been encouraging 
sen christopher dodd dconn a critic of past administration 
efforts to aid opponents of the leftist managua regime said late 
wednesday his initial reaction to the package was favorable 
the money to be funneled both directly to the opposition 
political coalition and indirectly through the quasigovernmental 
national endowment for democracy and united nations election 
observers would meet an estimated 80 percent or more of chamorro 
election budget according to administration estimates 
the endowment is a private foundation created by congress in 1982 
to support democratic elections worldwide using money appropriated 
by congress 
proponents of the aid package said the administration believes it 
would lend credibility to the opposition and make it easier for 
chamorros coalition to raise additional money from other countries 
and individuals 
it also would help level the playing field for the fledgling 
opposition coalition against the ruling sandinista party which has 
held power since a 1979 revolution 
administration officials and many in congress believe the 
elections while an uphill battle for the opposition offer the best 
opportunity in a decade to oust the sandinistas and president daniel 
ortega who are closely linked to the soviet union 
most of the aid some 5 million would go to ned for use in 
nonpartisan efforts at voter registration voter turnout and 
election organizing said sources in both parties and both houses of 
congress all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity 
the administration believes those efforts can be at least 
indirectly helpful to chamorro the publisher of the opposition 
newspaper la prensa and the candidate of the opposition coalition 
known as uno 
the move would require no change in neds charter which 
prohibits direct partisan political activities 
another 2 million would go directly to uno but under nicaraguan 
law would have to be split 5050 with the countrys electoral 
commission which will run the elections 
the remaining 2 million would help fund the activities of 
election observer groups such as one to be sent by the united 
nations the sources said 
in visits to washington last week uno representatives asked for 
overt us aid for the electoral process in nicaragua despite 
what they said was the certainty that the sandinistas would seek to 
use american support as a propaganda weapon against them 
earlier this month the bush administration had considered asking 
for 3 million for an open direct donation to chamorros campaign 
but modified that approach in the face of congressional opposition

three men armed with ak47 rifles opened 
fire thursday on a sunni moslem member of parliament killing him 
and his driver and injuring two passersby police said 
across beirut and surrounding mountains syrian forces and 
gunners loyal to lebanons christian leader gen michel aoun 
dueled with mortars and tank cannons 
police said at least one person was killed and six wounded 
raising the overall toll to 927 killed and 2731 wounded since the 
latest round of fighting broke out march 8 
the attack on parliament member nazim kadri occurred as the 
74yearold politician entered his car outside his home in west 
beirut at about 1020 am according to witnesses 
a police spokesman said kadri and his police driver sgt sami 
suleiman were killed instantly and two pedestrians were injured 
one seriously in the shooting 
one witness said the killers jumped out of a red car parked 
behind kadris 
the gunmen called kadri by name the deputy looked at them 
the witness said speaking on condition of anonymity two gunmen 
opened fire kadris driver drew his pistol but another gunman took 
several shots at him from an automatic rifle before he managed to 
open fire 
the witness said the killers sped away shooting into the air 
there was no immediate claim of responsibility 
an official obituary released by parliaments public relations 
department said kadri was first elected as a representative for the 
central bekaa valley in the onechamber house in 1951 the former 
lawyer was repeatedly elected until 1972 when the latest 
parliamentary elections were held 
the civil war which broke out in 1975 has prevented further 
elections kadris assassination brought to 73 the number of 
surviving deputies in the 99seat parliament twentyfive have died 
and the seat of former president amin gemayel became vacant when he 
was elected head of state in 1982

that the peace plan issued last week by the threeman committee was 
inadequate he demanded guarantees that arms supplies to aoun 
would be cut off 
jumblatt said that without guarantees of a halt of weapons to 
aoun the plan would amount to no more than a mere truce 
aoun receives weapons from iraq a bitter rival of syria 
syria has 40000 troops in lebanon under a 1976 mandate to quell 
the civil war aoun says syria violated the mandate by siding with 
the moslems in the civil war and he has vowed to drive them out

blockade of ports run by moslem militias the syrians responded by 
shelling the christian enclave north of beirut home to about 1

from an armed landing party in st croix to a 
station 15 yards from the churning waters off charleston sc the 
coast guard has moved to the battlefront of hurricane hugo 
preparation and recovery 
were a small service but over the years weve learned to be 
very adept in applying our resources said jack odell spokesman 
for the coast guard in washington dc 
as the storm bore down on south carolina and georgia the coast 
guard in charleston sc shut down the intracoastal waterway and 
nearby rivers to commercial vessels and advised private boaters to 
stay put or move upstream 
weve given out warnings over the radios and televisions saying 
please do not sail at this time due to the hurricane said seaman 
apprentice iain wells who said rescuers would venture out only if 
lives were endangered 
if there is a boat thats just drifting basically forget it 
were not going to send someone out there to get it 
coast guard c130 cargo planes capable of carrying up to 20 tons 
of supplies were the first relief flights tuesday to reach puerto 
rico after hugo struck and in an extraordinary move an armed coast 
guard contingent went ashore thursday in st croix after law and 
order collapsed 
we were the maritime agency that was in the area odell said 
thursday we have maritime and peacetime missions but were still 
a military service and we still have to maintain our military 
readiness 
six cutters remained in the area thursday to evacuate anyone who 
wanted off st croix while others stood by to help as needed as hugo 
churned toward the us coast 
the modern coast guard is part of the department of 
transportation but its history of law enforcement dates to 1867 
when its predecessor the us revenue cutter service was the only 
police agency for the alaska territory 
the coast guard has seen active duty as part of the navy in world 
war i world war ii and the vietnam war often escorting convoys and 
operating landing crafts 
although the coast guard is probably best known for its search 
and rescue efforts in modern times it is deeply involved in the 
drug war its cutters have fired on 18 vessels as part of its drug 
interception duties 
you have to be prepared to be ready to use and deploy the ship 
in any kind of operation odell said the cutters are equipped 
with the necessary armaments to carry out their mission 
both the south carolina and caribbean coast guard units are part 
of the 7th coast guard district based in miami 
theres quite a bit of tug of war going on in the 7th right 
now shes getting pulled from about six different directions 
odell said if need be we will have resources moving in from 
cape cod or california

mothers of drugaddicted babies are being 
offered a chance to get treatment as an alternative to prosecution 
but some critics said the program would unfairly force women into 
treatment 
they go into the program they successfully complete the 
program they will not have criminal charges arising out of this 
said mary mckeown the assistant state attorney coordinating the 
program 
charges have been postponed against about 40 women because they 
may be eligible for the 18month residential treatment program 
prosecutors say 
i really think the traditional means of prosecution are not 
going to accomplish what needs to be accomplished she said 
but the experimental program also is raising an ethical and legal 
controversy 
effectively its involuntarily committing someone said 
robyn blumner executive director of the american civil liberties 
union of florida what youre basically saying is look you have 
a choice addicted mother you can either go to treatment or go to 
trial and either way youre a loser 
opponents question whether courts will uphold the convictions of 
women charged with getting their infants addicted to drugs some 
critics say it will force women into treatment even though they 
havent been convicted of crimes 
however prosecutors and other supporters called it an innovative 
way to deal with a complex social problem

the federal courts policymaking arm is being 
urged to continue banning all television radio and photographic 
coverage of courtroom proceedings a spokesman said thursday 
a fivejudge committee told the us judicial conference this 
week that circumstances have not changed so drastically in 
recent years to justify relaxing the ban said conference spokesman 
david sellers 
the 28judge conference headed by chief justice william h 
rehnquist in 1984 rejected a request by news organizations that the 
longtime ban on electronic and photographic coverage in federal 
courts be lifted 
today 44 states allow such coverage in their courts at either 
the trial or appellate level or both 
in its report to the conference the fivejudge committee 
recommended that technological advances and the experiences of the 
states continue to be monitored to determine whether further 
modifications of the restrictions would be warranted at a future 
date 
but one of the committee members federal appellate judge john p 
moore of denver voted to end the blanket ban 
moore a member of the denverbased 10th us circuit court of 
appeals said each federal court should be free to allow electronic 
and photographic coverage to the same extent allowed by state courts 
in the same state 
rehnquist has said he isnt unalterably opposed to allowing 
television and radio coverage of federal courts including the 
supreme court 
if i were convinced that coverage by television of the supreme 
court would not disrupt the way the court works i would give it 
sympathetic consideration he told the senate judiciary committee 
three years ago 
but the chief justice has told reporters that a majority of the 
supreme courts nine members opposes such an innovation 
federal court rules permit electronic and photographic coverage 
of various ceremonial courtroom proceedings and allow use of such 
equipment for presenting evidence and making an official court 
record 
the committee report recommended that federal marshals be allowed 
to use electronic equipment to monitor courtrooms for security 
reasons it also recommended that judges be given more flexible 
authority to permit use of electronic equipment for other purposes 
of judicial administration 
the report was authored by the committees chairman us 
district judge robert peckham of san francisco

the economy grew at a moderate 25 percent pace 
in the second quarter the government said thursday down somewhat 
from the first quarter but strong enough to stop any new predictions 
of imminent recession 
the commerce department reported that apriljune growth in the 
gross national product compared with a 37 percent gain in the first 
three months the secondquarter gnp had been revised downward 02 
percentage point from the 27 percent growth estimate a month ago 
nearly twothirds of the januarymarch strength came from an 
anticipated rebound in farm output without the drought effect 
growth actually was only 15 percent 
the picture is a pretty one said allen sinai chief 
economist for the boston co not too much growth not too little 
right on the nose for a softlanding 
the picture said robert dederick chief economist for the 
northern trust co in chicago is an economy that is continuing to 
climb albeit at a subdued rate a laidback pace but thats 
really what the fed wants 
the federal reserve has moved for over a year to achieve a 
socalled softlanding by dampening inflation by slowing the 
economy without driving it into a recession 
thus analysts said the fed also should appreciate the downward 
revision in the gnps apriljune inflation rate a price index tied 
to the gnp showed a 5 percent gain rather than the 51 percent 
estimate a month ago 
since the apriljune quarter dederick noted inflation has 
ebbed considerably he said the secondquarter gnp rate is the 
worst inflation number well have for the year and for some time 
ahead at least several quarters ahead 
and he predicted were likely to see more of the same on 
growth perhaps a bit lower no more than what it has been in the 
second quarter and more likely less 
the fed which influences the economy by controlling monetary 
growth will not be influenced by this report to reduce interest 
rates further at this time sinai said in fact had it known in 
june that the economy would have risen this much it probably would 
not have reduced interest rates then 
in a companion report the fed said aftertax profits of us 
corporations fell 72 percent in the second quarter a bigger 
decline that the 54 percent drop estimated a month ago 
it was the second consecutive quarterly decline and dederick 
said shows that economic slowing is not without pain 
the gnp is the nations total output of goods and services and 
its broadest measure of economic growth 
the downward revision in the secondquarter gnp reflected drops 
in earlier estimates of consumer and government spending but 
consumer spending which represents twothirds of all economic 
activity still increased a healthy 19 percent in the apriljune 
quarter 
at the same time business investment spending advanced a strong 
86 percent and us exports grew 131 percent for the third 
straight quarter of doubledigit growth 
housing adversely affected by high interest rates fell 123 
percent 
on an annual basis the economy grew at a 31 percent annual rate 
during the first six months of the year it will need to expand only 
at a 23 percent rate for the remainder of the year to match the 
administrations goal of 29 percent growth for all of 1989 
the various changes left the gnp expanding in the second quarter 
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 413 trillion

identity cards of 130000 prisoners of the 
auschwitz concentration camp which once were stored in sealed 
soviet archives have been released and turned over to the red 
cross the tass news agency said thursday

after day hour after hour in 46 huge volumes valentina 
fatyukhina head of the soviet red cross research department told 
tass 
their names the birth dates and the names of parents were 
written down she said 
tass said the information was given to the international red 
cross which will soon begin the task of processing the cards 
making it possible to identify the citizens of many countries who 
were victims of auschwitz 
auschwitz in poland was one of the most infamous concentration 
camps run by the nazis during world war ii an estimated 25 million 
jews were killed at the camp during the war 
ms fatyukhina said the auschwitz material was found by soviet 
soldiers at the end of the war and shipped to the soviet union 
tass said access to the volumes only became possible about a year 
and a half ago as more and more archives were opened to researchers 
under the policy of glasnost initiated by president mikhail s 
gorbachev 
nobody expected that 130000 individual cards of concentration 
camp inmates existed tass said

a cbs producer on his way to cover hurricane hugo 
helped two fellow passengers with small children escape a jet crash 
before going back into the wreckage to retrieve his cellular phone 
for a live broadcast 
david hawthorne was among 63 people aboard a usair jet that 
aborted its takeoff from laguardia airport late wednesday and 
skidded into the east river killing two women 
my first instinct im no hero was to get out of there he 
said in a telephone interview 
hawthorne used a cellular phone he retrieved from the wreckage 
for live reports first for networkowned wcbstv then for a 
sevenminute cbs news special 
a sevenyear cbs employee hawthorne 29 had planned to fly to 
charlotte nc then to wilmington nc to help cover hurricane 
hugo he was sitting near the jetliners front which remained above 
water while other parts of the cracked fuselage were partly 
submerged 
he saw a woman standing with a child farther back in the plane 
and helped them out of the wreckage then he said i went down 
toward the exits and i saw a woman holding a smaller infant and 
she was saying i dont know how to swim i dont know how to swim 
until then i didnt know we were in the water 
he helped that woman and her child out onto a wing 
i was just praying that we wouldnt go down and wouldnt have 
to make a choice of holding up the baby or the mother he said 
after they were clear of the torn fuselage he said he thought 
i need to let cbs know he said he crawled back into the 
wreckage for his portable phone which he had placed beneath his 
seat 
the phone was pinned in between some seats but i was able to 
twist it out he said then i went back to the exit door because 
i didnt want the plane to start sinking with me on it thats when 
i made the initial calls to cbs newsnet and cbs news 
the former for which hawthorne is an associate producer feeds 
news stories and footage to cbs affiliates and cbs news 
when he first called from the wreckage about five minutes after 
the crash startled cbs staff members didnt believe him he said 
they said come on you must be kidding youre in a plane 
crash and i think a string of words that i dont usually spout 
came out i said this calls for real 
after rescue crews took him and the others from the wreckage he 
said he stood on a nearby pier and began live phone reports 
including a special report with dan rather at 1233 am edt 
hawthorne a native of vermillion sd who has lived in the 
bronx for most of his life went to tv studios thursday for 
interviews on wcbstv and cbs this morning rather than on to his 
original assignment 
he said he planned to go home and get some rest although it 
will be difficult 
my adrenalin is telling me that i want to go down there and do 
that hurricane story he said but my back is telling me that i 
better take it easy and my wife is telling me he began laughing 
that if my back doesnt tell me to take it easy shell do it on 
some other part

a new federal tax law aimed at collecting 
unreported daycare income may thin the ranks of baby sitters and 
drive up the cost of child care tax specialists and industry 
spokesmen say 
the law requires parents to provide the internal revenue service 
with the name and social security number of their daycare provider 
if they want to deduct the cost on their federal income taxes 
the irs will check the cost reported by parents with the amount 
reported by baby sitters as the agency goes after an estimated 7 
billion in daycare income that goes unreported each year 
i dont know that theyll send a grandma to jail but it will 
be tough on them said barry barros a tax preparer who 
specializes in daycare provider returns 
the law applies only to day care provided while parents are at 
work 
we will indeed be crossreferencing to see if that baby sitter 
claimed that as income said sarah wreford a spokeswoman for the 
irs in detroit 
daycare providers not claiming the payments as income on their 
tax returns could be required to pay back taxes with interest and a 
50 fine wreford said 
barros of stockton calif says it may take the irs two or 
three years before its equipped to doublecheck a large number of 
returns for daycare income 
baby sitters collecting money under the table may be more likely 
to raise their prices once they are required to declare the income 
barros said 
the national association for family day care a nonprofit 
organization representing about 3000 daycare providers said it 
supports the new law 
the association feels anything that can be done to provide a 
more professional setting for child care is beneficial said kay 
hollestelle accreditation administrator 
the irs says parents who seek the deduction without providing the 
social security number or tax identification number of their 
daycare provider could be turned down for the credit 
we may lose some providers said carole quarterman executive 
director of the child care coordinating council of detroitwayne 
county inc there are some people whose clear intention is to make 
some money on the side and not report the income 
the credit allows parents and those paying for the care of 
mentally or physically incompetent dependents to deduct a certain 
percentage of their care costs directly from their income taxes 
those eligible usually can claim a credit ranging from 30 percent of 
the expense if their income does not exceed 10000 to 20 percent 
if their income exceeds 28000

a shiite moslem cleric linked to the 
captors of western hostages was quoted wednesday as saying 
washington is delaying efforts to gain freedom for eight american 
captives 
sheik mohammed hussein fadlallah spiritual head of the 
proiranian group hezbollah told the prosyrian beirut daily 
ashsharq in my opinion america is following a plan for freezing 
the issue of the hostages at the media level 
hezbollah or party of god is widely believed to be the umbrella 
for shiite factions holding most of the 16 foreign hostages in 
lebanon 
america can free its hostages in a very simple way fadlallah 
was quoted as saying 
instead the united states is using the hostages as a blackmail 
card in its socalled war against terrorism fadlallah added 
without elaboration 
eight americans are among the 16 western hostages held in 
lebanon thehostage held longest is terry anderson chief middle 
east correspondent for the associated press who was kidnapped march 
16 1985 
in kuwait the newspaper alqabas reported thursday that western 
hostages in lebanon could be released soon as a result of recent 
intensive contacts between syria and iran 
numerous articles speculating on the release of western hostages 
have appeared in the lebanese and arab press in the past few years 
but few have been correct 
syria and iran are allies in the 14yearold lebanese civil war 
backing the lebanese moslems against the christians 
in a london dispatch alqabas quoted arab diplomatic sources as 
saying the release of the foreign hostages was the key topic of 
talks this week between iranian officials and syrian foreign 
minister farouk alsharaa 
the sources were quoted as predicting the hostages would be freed 
in stages

a group of federal employees has charged that a 
consumer group is undermining a government auto safety program but 
the head of the organization said thursday that his group serves a 
useful watchdog function 
the facts show that recalls are down and that defective 
vehicles arent being recalled said clarence ditlow executive 
director of the center for auto safety our response is to 
continue to publicize when the agency doesnt do its job 
ditlows comments came after publication in thursdays editions 
of the washington post of excerpts from a letter to him from 50 
career employees at the national highway traffic safety 
administration 
employees of the office of defects investigation said ditlow was 
undermining its safety defects program and that the centers attacks 
were eroding the publics confidence in our ability to pursue 
safety defects thereby discouraging mortorists from submitting 
safety defect information to us 
history proves them wrong ditlow responded whenever we 
have criticized them they get more complaints not less 
ditlow said he had not received a copy of the letter but learned 
of it from media inquiries 
nhtsa spokesman tim hurd called the letter a good clear 
statement of the frustration the workers feel in dealing with the 
cfas 
i think the employees are frustrated by the fact that they 
cant get recalls like they used to ditlow said 
earlier this month ditlow said nhtsa had halted 25 
investigations during the reagan administration under pressure from 
the auto industry 
although some of the decisions were more difficult than others 
to charge that we are captives of the auto industry because 
investigations were closed ignores the facts completely the 
letter said 
it also accused ditlow of selling information obtained from the 
agency to lawyers representing automobile accident victims 
ditlow said the center makes no profit from computer printouts it 
provides to the public not just lawyers with information on 
complaints about cars received by nhtsa along with names and 
addresses of individuals making those complaints

abolishing travel restrictions on american and 
soviet visitors in each others countries would end a relic of the 
cold war that is a nuisance but has little practical effect an 
expert on ussoviet relations said thursday 
us officials speaking on condition they not be identified 
said secretary of states james a baker iii would present the 
proposal to soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze in their 
talks friday and saturday in jackson hole wyo 
it would lift virtually all travel restrictions on soviet 
diplomats trade representatives and journalists the sources said 
it was not known how the soviets would respond to the proposal 
clearly being made in light of the openness policies of soviet 
leader mikhail gorbachev 
it strikes me as a sensible thing to do at this stage said 
raymond l garthoff senior fellow in foreign policy studies at the 
brookings institution and a former us ambassador to bulgaria 
i dont think its a terribly important matter but i think 
its an appropriate a reasonable thing to do 
the late soviet dictator josef stalin placed severe travel 
restrictions on foreigners in the soviet union in the 1950s and the 
united states reciprocated with restrictions on travel by diplomats 
and other visitors from the soviet union and other eastern bloc 
countries 
these restrictions were gradually eliminated by agreements 
between the soviet satellites and the united states in the 1970s 
garthoff said he signed the last such agreement in 1978 when he was 
ambassador to bulgaria 
from then on i and my staff in bulgaria were able to travel 
anywhere in bulgaria that any other foreigner was which meant in 
effect the whole country the brookings scholar said 
reciprocal travel restrictions by the united states and the 
soviet union remained however with close to 90 percent of the 
soviet union closed to americans and much of the united states off 
limits to visiting soviets 
they are more an annoyance than anything else garthoff said 
they dont really prevent the embassies from functioning 
adequately but they do represent something of an anomaly in this 
era i dont think they are really effective in terms of preventing 
access or protecting information they really are more political 
statements or gestures than anything else 
in practice americans and soviets occasionally are granted 
permission to enter the prohibited zones for instance soviet 
ambassador yuri v dubinin was permitted to visit offlimits parts 
of the united states several dozen times an official said 
garthoff said this was usually done on a tit for tat basis 
he also said both the united states and the soviet union have made 
changes over the years in the amount of each others territory that 
is closed 
the us proposal was dubbed open lands 
if it is adopted soviets still would have to register their 
travel plans with the state departments office of foreign missions 
for security reasons officials said they said the proposal had 
been approved by the fbi 
the idea is to abolish the curbs on a reciprocal basis so 
travel theoretically is permitted everywhere an official said

fox and the nba team announced the agreement in a statement 
wednesday but provided no details

20 million

walking naked through the woods 
using the land as a spiritual retreat does not constitute a 
religious activity in the definition of this countys tax 
authorities 
the pasco county property appraisal adjustment board turned down 
an attempt by t ward gulvin president of the naturist religious 
society to win a tax exemption on 80 acres of undeveloped property 
for a kind of openair church for the uninhibited 
it may be a personal religious experience but in my mind its 
not the type of religious activity that meets the statutory 
requirement for a tax exemption said allan sonny safranek 
jr county commission chairman 
the society is based in hudson just up the central florida gulf 
coast from new port richey 
gulvin told the board wednesday that people who are members of 
the naturist religious society use the land as a spiritual retreat 
they want to feel next to nature and enjoy the trees and shrubs and 
birds and flowers and animals and all the beauty of nature 
but property appraiser ted williams told the board gulvin hadnt 
established a church he was unable to provide a list of members 
williams said noting that five members of the corporation were 
related to gulvin 
the society was incorporated in 1944 in new jersey to provide a 
place of worship for those who dont believe that it is a sin to 
expose the unclothed human body to members of the opposite sex of 
like belief incorporation papers state 
it appears to be a closely held corporation said williams 
i think he is saying that because they believe in worshiping 
nature the sun the breeze and things of that sort he should have 
a church exemption in my opinion he hasnt established himself as 
a church 
pasco commissioner ann hildebrand said if the exemption request 
had been granted youd be setting a precedent for everybody to 
communicate with god on their property and get a tax exemption 
nudism is not a religion said joan axford of the city 
retreat nudist resort in hudson nudism is a different way of 
life it doesnt separate people according to their socioeconomic 
backgrounds the only thing you have going for you is whats 
inside

the bush administration official in charge of 
next weeks education summit with the nations governors said 
thursday that the most promising ideas for improving us schools 
dont require more money 
the best ideas including efforts to give parents more choice 
over which public school their child attends revolve around more 
efficient use of the moneys that we are already spending said 
roger porter president bushs domestic policy adviser 
they do not he said require more money 
accompaning bush to wednesday and thursdays charlottesville 
va summit will be virtually the entire cabinet porter said 
the white house he said is expecting perfect attendance from the 
governors of the 50 states and several governors from us 
territories will be there 
the aim of the largely closeddoor deliberations on the 
university of virginia campus will be to find new ideas to improve 
americas schools porter said 
the democratic leaders of congress on wednesday unveiled their 
own goals for the nations schools and promised to press for 
adequate funding to help meet them 
porter said americans are spending 353 billion on education at 
all levels from kindergarten through graduate school including 
more than 5200 for every public school pupil 
were not going to be announcing any goals at the end of the 
summit porter said what we will be announcing will be the 
process by which those goals are going to be developed 
the postsummit process of drawing up those goals will involve 
parents and teachers and administrators and school boards 
porter said the ideas that hold real promise for improving the 
bottom line invariably expand choice for parents and students 
introduce greater flexibility while demanding increased 
accountability for results 
the president believes the current level of performance is not 
acceptable and simply doing more of the same is unlikely to improve 
it porter said new approaches and new ideas are needed 
although the agenda includes a discussion of expanding access to 
higher education and training more teachers the focus will clearly 
be on problems in the lower grades 
porter on leave as a professor of government at harvards 
kennedy school said americas universities are really quite 
phenomenal in part because they are incredibly diverse and 
highly competitive 
the topics for the six working groups announced last week by the 
governors are teaching learning environment governance choice 
and restructuring a competitive workforce and lifelong learning 
and postsecondary education 
bush will participate in each of the six working group sessions 
with 16 or 17 governors and five or six cabinet members 
the working sessions three simultaneous 90minute discussions 
on both wednesday afternoon and thursday morning will be held 
behind closed doors with bush spending 30 minutes in each session 
each working group will be cochaired by a republican governor 
and a democratic governor with a cabinet member moderating the 
discussion a rapporteur will prepare a report that the president 
and the governors will consider in plenary sessions 
the democrats national performance goals include lower dropout 
rates higher college attendance rates and early childhood education 
for all poor 4yearolds by 1995 or earlier

president bush met with soviet foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze today as administration officials said the 
united states will propose to the soviets a mutual lifting of almost 
all travel restrictions for diplomats trade groups and journalists 
the open lands initiative imposed during the stalin era 
surfaced as shevardnadze opened highlevel talks with bush at the 
white house in advance of a weekend of talks with secretary of 
state james a baker in wyoming 
its a big letter shevardnadze said when asked about a 
message he carried from soviet president mikhail gorbachev for bush 
but he and bush deflected all questions the president saying 
this is a photo opportunity 
the soviet foreign minister carried with him stillsecret 
proposals from moscow that could accelerate reductions in the 
superpowers nuclear missile arsenals 
currently nearly 90 percent of the soviet union is off limits to 
americans reflecting the suspicions that marked josef stalins 
rule the united states responded through the years to the curbs by 
imposing similar restrictions on a large part of the united states 
the washington times first reported the removal of the travel 
restrictions in todays editions 
the fbi has approved the proposal and it is ready for baker to 
present to shevardnadze during their talks friday and saturday in 
jackson hole wyo the officials said 
if it is adopted however soviets still would have to register 
their travel plans with the state departments office of foreign 
missions 
this is designed to address security concerns said the 
officials who spoke on condition of anonymity 
in practice americans and soviets occasionally are granted 
permission to enter the prohibited zones for instance soviet 
ambassador yuri v dubinin was permitted to visit offlimits parts 
of the united states several dozen times an official said 
it was not known how the soviets would respond but the open 
lands proposal obviously had in mind the more open policies of 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
the idea is to abolish the curbs on a reciprocal basis so 
travel theoretically is permitted everywhere an official said 
even before bush received the message shevardnadze brought from 
gorbachev the two sides had made siginificant progress on three 
fronts human rights chemical weapons and breaking the ice 
curtain that has divided alaskan and siberian eskimos for more 
than 40 years 
mikhail gorbachevs letter contains some very important 
proposals specifically mostly on arms control and on reducing the 
military standoff between our two countries he said through an 
interpreter and those proposals i have no doubt serve to remove 
most of the obstacles holding up progress and an agreement 
shevardnadze called for a speeding up of developments in 
ussoviet relations 
we believe that we should not stand still we should not mark 
time he said the experience that we have gained thus far 
permits us to hope that there will be further movement 
according to us officials the soviets have given assurances 
that hundreds of jews who were refused exit permits will be 
permitted to depart 
the bush administration had presented lists of more than 500 
socalled refuseniks the soviet union replied during meetings 
at the state department on monday and tuesday that threequarters of 
them would be allowed to leave said the officials who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
it was not immediately clear if in all instances exit permits 
would be granted or if some applicants would be allowed only to 
travel abroad 
also a us official stressed the proof will be in the 
documents issued 
at separate arms control sessions meanwhile the two sides moved 
closer to an agreement to exchange data on their chemical weapons 
program and to open stockpiles and plants to inspection by the other 
side 
left for baker and shevardnadze to resolve were details about the 
extent of the information to be swapped and whether us chemical 
weapons stored in west germany would be included in the inspection 
scheme 
were quite optimistic a us official said 
they also are due to sign an accord for regular visits between 
the yupik and inupiat eskimos of alaska and siberia thereby 
shattering the socalled ice curtain the kremlin forbade travel 
across the bering strait in 1948 
in a tactical switch gorbachev did not send advance word through 
diplomatic channels of the contents of the message for bush 
speculation centered on a new approach to break the deadlock on a 
treaty to reduce by 30 percent to 50 percent us and soviet 
stockpiles of the deadliest nuclear weapons longrange bombers 
missiles and submarines 
but whatever gorbachevs letter contained and gennady 
gerasimov the soviet foreign ministry spokesman would not say 
wednesday on american television bush and baker were determined to 
deflect criticism by some congressional democrats that the 
administration was reflexive in dealing with the east 
bush said monday that we do want to move forward and are 
working inside our own administration to have the proposals that i 
think will capture the imagination of the soviet people 
baker at a news conference tuesday announced that to start 
the ball rolling on strategic weapons negotiations the united 
states would withdraw its proposal for a ban on mobile missiles 
the move has limited consequences the administration already is 
asking congress to fund the development of the midgetman mobile 
missile and in the geneva negotiations the united states has long 
taken the position that a ban would be dropped after ways to keep 
track of the elusive weapons were perfected 
still baker offered assurances the administration had not taken 
a waitandsee approach toward moscow

a teenager whose steer won grand prize at 
the ohio state fair will forfeit her ribbon and 28000 following 
charges the animal had been entered another name in illinois and its 
hide dyed to conceal the ruse 
the ohio expositions commission approved 100 today an agreement 
reached with the family of 17yearold susan shealy whose 
anguscross steer hank won the blue ribbon in august 
the message is not to cheat at the livestock show at the ohio 
state fair said jack foust general manager of the fair 
foust said officials could not prove suspicions that hank had 
been shown under the name carl at an illinois farm show in july a 
violation of the rules 
but there was no question officials said that a white spot on 
hanks belly had been dyed black at the ohio fair also a violation 
under the agreement the shealy family admitted no wrongdoing 
but the girl from tiro will not get her prize money and must give up 
the ribbon she and her family also were barred from competition for 
five years 
family members did not return messages today 
farm shows have become increasingly lucrative for farm children 
who raise champion livestock hank was sold for 28000 at the fair 
aug 14 
hanks credentials came into question when fair officials 
received a tip five days later that hank might be carl a 
secondplace steer at a farm show in illinois on july 24 
investigators said black dye had been used to cover a swirl of 
white hair on hanks belly a similar white patch can be seen in a 
photograph of carl 
fair rules prohibit misrepresentation of an animals history or 
ownership and any alterations in an animals natural appearance 
hank was impounded when the investigation began so investigators 
could wait for his hair to grow out 
the family of 12yearold jeremy simmons who exhibited carl at 
the illinois fair has also denied any wrongdoing they said carl 
was destroyed after the illinois fair

us troops sent to restore calm to the 
hurricaneravaged virgin islands are having an obvious impact in 
controlling the looting and other lawlessness white house press 
secretary marlin fitzwater said today 
our purpose is to help out in an interim and temporary way 
until the local law enforcement can handle the problem fitzwater 
told reporters 
president bush authorized the use of the troops to halt a looting 
frenzy and protect residents and tourists from the lawlessness 
gripping st croix two days after hurricane hugos devastation 
the situation there is improving somewhat fitzwater said 
the troops are having an obvious impact in controlling the looting 
and other lawlessness associated with the destruction 
he said it was impossible to predict how long the troops which 
began arriving this morning would remain on st croix 
we stay in close contact with the police authorities on the 
islands and the governors and will be guided by their feelings about 
when theyre in control and when they can handle the situation 
fitzwater said 
the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff adm william j crowe 
said in an interview today that the troops have been issued rifles 
and ordered to shoot if necessary to defend themselves 
certainly we never deploy troops if they dont have the right 
to defend themselves crowe said weve had reports of shooting 
on the island were not going to permit people to be totally 
defenseless 
the chairman said the decision was made to send in the troops 
after federal authorities on the scene were reporting chaos and 
nearanarchy and the situation as being out of control 
crowe added that he envisioned the troops would remain on the 
island a very short period of time but he did not define the 
time any further 
the task force commander brig gen walter b moore is now on 
the scene and is assessing the situation said lt comdr ned 
lundquist a pentagon spokesman he will deploy troops as 
necessary 
lundquist said moore was on board the first plane of some 76 
military personnel that arrived at 740 am edt the contingent 
formed an advance team that planned to secure the airfield set up a 
mobile control tower and organize the command structure for the 
other troops that will be arriving later in the day 
members of the armed forces of the united states will be used 
to suppress the violence and to restore law and order in and 
about the virgin islands bush said in a statement wednesday night 
it appeared to be the first time in more than 20 years that a 
president ordered active duty military personnel into the nations 
streets 
about 700 soldiers began leaving pope air force base nc early 
today 
i think the show of force is going to go a long way in ending 
the looting said lt gen carl w stiner commander of the 18th 
airborne corps and fort bragg 
the pentagon said in a statement that 1105 military police would 
begin arriving in st croix by early morning on 16 air force c141 
starlifter transport planes 
the units were to include 635 military police from fort bragg 
nc and 470 military police from companies in fort polk la fort 
hood texas and fort leonard wood mo 
on wednesday armed coast guard crewmen from at least one of the 
six coast guard ships in the area went ashore on st croix the 
largest of the three main us virgin islands at 84 square miles to 
try to restore order 
after hugo hit st croix damaging virtually every building on 
the island of 53000 looters stripped stores of merchandise and 
many residents armed themselves with guns and knives 
to counter roaming lawless mobs merchants posted armed guards 
local national guardsmen and police reportedly joined in the 
looting a spokesman for the pentagons national guard bureau maj 
bob dunlap said the reports involving guardsmen were not confirmed 
on wednesday the popular tourist retreat still lacked water 
power and telephone service hurricane winds that stripped trees 
turned the lush island southeast of puerto rico into a brown 
wasteland 
the islands governor said hugo caused no deaths but hundreds of 
people were reported injured and thousands left homeless holland l 
redfield ii a territorial senator said as much as 90 percent of 
the island was destroyed 
coast guard cutters evacuated frightened tourists and residents 
some of whom had pleaded with arriving reporters to take them off 
about 145 st croix tourists arrived in miami late thursday night 
on an evacuation flight arranged by us marshals the injured 
elderly and pregnant women were given first priority and other 
passengers were taken on a spaceavailable basis 
we just got lucky said bob mcmanus of west point conn 
the looters were everywhere there they said were in charge 
now at one grocery store they just rolled up trucks and loaded 
them up 
us district judge stanley brotman of camden nj who was on 
temporary assignment in st croix said he first had to protect 
himself from the storm then the armed looters 
meanwhile virgin islands gov alexander farrelly said wednesday 
night he did not ask for the federal troops bush had said the 
governor of the islands requested the them and white house 
spokesman steve hart said later the governors denial was contrary 
to the information i have 
usually in cases of civil disturbances it is the guard that is 
called out to help restore order but federal law allows the 
president to declare an emergency during civil disturbances and to 
use federal troops to restore calm 
at the white house presidential assistant james cicconi was 
asked what orders would be given the troops about the use of force 
he replied im sure theyd use only that which was necessary and 
appropriate 
the pentagon also was dispatching three small reconnaissance 
oh58 helicopters some transport vehicles and appropriate medical 
support the agencys statement said 
the last time federal troops were used to suppress riots was in 
1968 in washington dc after the assassination of martin luther 
king jr administration officials said 
president reagan authorized the use of troops in 1987 to deal 
with prison riots in atlanta but that trouble subsided before they 
were deployed

the bush administration told congress on 
thursday that it remains committed to enhancing economic cooperation 
and dialogue with asian pacific nations but that it will take time 
effort and patience 
but sen alan cranston dcalif criticized us diplomacy in 
the area as complacent despite an economic boom in east asia 
thats bringing unparalleled prosperity and trading opportunities 
and problems 
richard h solomon assistant secretary of state for east asian 
and pacific affairs told the senate foreign relations committee 
that the bush administration believes its essential to build a 
framework to help manage the increasingly interdependent economies 
of the asianpacific region 
consultations he said are under way with nations along the 
pacific rim to strengthen the consensus for an open trading and 
investment system essential for sustaining global economic growth 
into the 21st century 
consensus building is a delicate and measured process that is 
difficult to rush solomon said 
however cranston said there is insufficient initiative from 
washington to prepare for the challenges of the pacific century 
and key asian powers appear too willing to trot out the same 
tired excuses to avoid the tough decisions necessary to organize for 
the challenge of the 21st century said cranston chairman of the 
foreign relations subcommittee on asia 
a pacific basin forum cranston said would allow us to pursue 
such crucial issues as free trade economic development and security 
confidence building 
cranston called for the establishment of a permanent secretariat 
to do research and pursue dialogue on a wide range of concerns 
unless we undertake a deliberate effort to establish a more 
mutually beneficial business climate trade tensions with asia may 
well increase in the years ahead as exportled development by the 
remarkably successful capitalist nations of east asia continues 
he said

amtrak claims in a federal lawsuit the 
state shouldnt be allowed to prosecute the rail service on criminal 
charges over the dumping of human waste from train toilets 
the enforcement of the statutes in question would impose undue 
burdens on amtrak the only interstate passenger railroad and 
threaten the continuation of intercity passenger service in 
floria said amtrak lawyers robert warren and edward booth 
some train cars used by the national passenger service dump waste 
directly onto railroad bridges and overpasses when toilets are 
flushed other cars have tanks that automatically release waste onto 
tracks when a train reaches a speed of 25 mph 
amtrak contends in the lawsuit filed tuesday that federal laws 
governing rail service supersede state laws under which prosecutor 
john tanner filed charges the railroad is asking us district 
judge howell w melton to halt prosecution in circuit court calling 
the charges an unconstitutional hindrance to interstate commerce 
assistant state attorney dennis bayer rejected amtraks argument 
and said the state would press on with the case 
the railroad already had pleaded innocent to the dumping charges 
amtrak operates 12 trains daily in florida six pass through 
putnam county by crossing the st johns river and rice creek 
tanner filed the charges after fishermen complained they were 
sprayed with sewage beneath a trestle

sixteen shiite moslems from kuwait 
were beheaded thursday for exploding two bombs in mecca at the 
height of the moslem pilgrimage to the holy city the interior 
ministry said 
an interior ministry statement implicitly blamed iran for the 
attacks which killed a man and were believed connected to the 
centuriesold feud between sunni and shiite moslems 
four other kuwaitis were sentenced to 15 years and 20 years in 
prison and 1000 to 1500 whiplashes for the bomb blasts the 
ministry statement said 
nine defendants were acquitted it said convictions and 
sentences were decided and confirmed by lower and appellate courts 
of islamic scholars the statement said 
a pakistani man was killed and 16 other pilgrims of various 
nationalities were wounded when the bombs went off the night of july 
10 as 2 million moslems gathered for the culmination of the 
pilgrimage or hajj 
thursdays report was the first official word that arrests had 
been made in connection with the blasts near the grand mosque in 
mecca islams holiest shrine 
the executions were carried out in accordance with islamic 
law the statement said without elaborating sources close to the 
government who requested anonymity said the kuwaitis were 
blindfolded and beheaded by sword at dawn in a mecca prison compound 
government sources said saudi arabia refused a kuwaiti request to 
extradite the bombers 
full confessions from the condemned men will be broadcast on 
television the announcement said 
it described the blasts as an evil crime an aggression on 
the sanctity of the holy sites and on the pilgrims and of the 
entire moslem nation 
the interior ministry said the defendants plotted the attack at 
meetings in kuwait mecca and the saudi city of medina 
their aim it said was to spread terror and fear in the hearts 
of the pilgrims and show that saudi arabia was unable to 
protect the house of god 
every moslem sunni or shiite has a duty to make the pilgrimage 
to mecca the birthplace of the 7th century prophet mohammed and to 
medina where mohammed is buried 
sunnis and shiites disagree about who should have succeeded 
mohammed 
iran which has an overwhelming majority of shiites among its 
nearly 50 million people had been urging moslems to seize mecca and 
medina 
without naming iran saudi arabias statement said the july 
bombings were perpetrated at the instructions of the mischievous 
ones who are enemies of this nation and for all pilgrims of gods 
house and cooperating with those mischievous ones on such 
debauchery and terrorism in the most sacred spot in the world 
since the late ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis 1979 islamic 
revolution in iran iranian pilgrims have tried to turn the hajj 
into a political forum to spread his fundamentalist teachings 
in 1987 iranian pilgrims clashed with saudi security leading to 
the deaths of 402 pilgrims most iranians 
after that riyadh restricted the numbers of pilgrims this drew 
protests from iran which boycotted the 1988 and 1989 pilgrimages 
saudi arabia citing subversion and terrorism severed relations 
with tehran in april 1988

a conservation group that has been pressing for 
expansion of wolf ranges said thursday that it has agreed to pay two 
montana ranchers for livestock believed lost to wolves 
defenders of wildlife said it will pay 1700 to the ranchers to 
compensate for the loss of a cow and seven calves 
the group said it is paying full market price for the cow which 
animal experts said was a definite wolf kill government officials 
said the calves were probably wolf kills and the group paid the 
farmers 50 percent of their value 
defenders began offering compensation for stock lost to wolves 
three years ago the only other claims under the program came in 
1987 when it paid farmers 3200 in compensation for 10 sheep and 
five cows 
the program is part of the nonprofit groups effort to encourage 
the reintroduction of wolves into the northern rockies including 
yellowstone national park stockmen in that region have opposed 
restoration of wolves to the area fearing losses to the animals 
those of us who would like to see wolves return to select 
locations in the northern rockies are ready and willing to assume 
financial responsibility for such a program said hank fisher of 
defenders of wildlife

cambodians showered vietnamese 
soldiers with flowers thursday as they began their final withdrawal 
from a war that started with a christmas invasion 11 years ago and 
ended the bloody rule of the khmer rouge 
the vietnameseinstalled government said it would carry on the 
fight against a threeparty guerrilla coalition 
our friends go but the special cambodianvietnamese 
relationship does not said a red banner in front of dozens of 
military vehicles that rumbled out of this northwestern province to 
the blare of a pop music band in a governmentorganized ceremony 
the only observers of the fanfare were foreign journalists and 
official delegations from vietnams socialist allies laos cuba 
and the soviet union the main source of arms for the war 
as the withdrawal began phnom penhs prime minister hun sen 
returned home from thailand without a ceasefire agreement the 
thais had tried to patch a truce together after a failed 
international peace conference 
hun sen called on countries to honor pledges to halt aid to the 
guerrillas after the vietnamese pullout 
vietnamese officials said 26000 troops from siem reap and other 
areas will cross the border into southern vietnam by tuesday ending 
hanois involvement in the war that erupted after it invaded to oust 
its former communist comrade the khmer rouge 
leaders of the khmer rouge and two noncommunist guerrilla 
organizations in the resistance coalition say the withdrawal is a 
ploy and charge vietnam is hiding troops in cambodia the coalition 
commands 50000 fighters 
china shared that skepticism thursday it hanoi is still 
employing tricks on the question of troop withdrawal and placing a 
variety of obstacles in the way of a comprehensive settlement of the 
cambodian question foreign ministry spokesman li zhaoxing told 
reporters 
some observers have called hanois intervention vietnams 
vietnam likening its withdrawal from a costly agonizing war 
against forces it could not eradicate to the united states war in 
vietnam 
hanoi says 55300 vietnamese died fighting the cambodians half 
of them in 1977 and 1978 before their christmas invasion vietnams 
impoverished population of 65 million also suffered from economic 
blockades mounted by noncommunist countries outraged by the 
invasion 
it ended the rule of pol pot who led khmer rouge efforts to 
force an agrarian revolution in cambodia hundreds of thousands of 
civilians were slain 
the west should stop supporting the khmer rouge and stop being 
fooled by khmer rouge propaganda senior foreign ministry official 
uch kiman said at the farewell ceremony 
he said his vietnamesebacked government is prepared to continue 
fighting but added he does not believe his country ever would ask 
the vietnamese to return 
phnom penh rejects usbacked demands from the noncommunist 
guerrillas who say they rather would have a transitional government 
including the khmer rouge the most powerful resistance faction 
than continue fighting it 
maj gen huol savorn regional commander of cambodian forces 
said his troops have taken over the fighting from the vietnamese 
this year in the hotly contested provinces bordering thailand 
after the pullout the guerrillas will launch a major offensive 
to try to occupy border areas before striking further into cambodia 
he told reporters 
fighting already has intensified cambodian refugees at a un 
camp on the thai border thursday threatened a strike and demanded to 
be moved to a safer place after four to eight artillery shells 
exploded close by their camp overnight a un refugee worker said 
across the border departing vietnamese troops carried rifles 
along with flowers and miniature flags thrown by thousands of 
cambodians 
the cambodians many looking glum and uninterested stood outside 
a kindergarten school built by vietnamese troops of the departing 
front 479 and waved flags and placards praising and thanking them 
organized by authorities into groups were students soldiers and 
hundreds of children in red kerchiefs young pioneers of the 
communist party 
on a makeshift wooden stage military officers made speeches 
denouncing pol pot genocide and four elderly buddhist monks in 
saffron robes prayed for peace 
maj gen khieu anh lon commander of front 479 hugged a 
cambodian officer and received a kerchief from a young pioneer and a 
bouquet of flowers 
the general waved the flowers as he climbed into his 
weatherbeaten usmade jeep to begin the long journey southeast 
departing soldiers carried back guitars photos of vietnamese 
actresses clipped from newspapers even dogs and a monkey 
some had served in cambodia since 1979 and said they were glad to 
return home to their families 
pol pot soldiers are weak and we are strong said maj chu 
viet duong 32 who in eight years fought many battles against them 
and had five medals on his chest to prove it unlike many vietnamese 
soldiers he said he was never hungry and had malaria only once

authorities have been investigating recent engine 
problems on the boeing 737400 the latest model of the 737 series 
and the type that crashed into the east river from a runway at 
laguardia airport 
officials said the cause of wednesday nights crash was unknown 
and there was no initial indication that the 9monthold plane might 
have had engine trouble 
passengers said they felt the engine power being cut and then 
felt reverse thrust as the pilot apparently tried to stop the 
aircraft 
the twinengine 737 which can carry up to 150 passengers has 
one of the longest and safest histories of any commercial jet 
the 737400 differs from previous models in that it has a more 
powerful version of the cfm56 engine which is produced jointly by 
general electric co and snecma a french company said t craig 
martin a boeing co spokesman 
a 737400 operated by british midland airways crashed jan 8 
beside a highway about 100 miles north of london killing 44 people 
it used cfm563c engines the usair jet in wednesdays accident had 
cfm563b2 engines 
british investigators said initially that the crash may have 
resulted from a fire in one engine and the crew mistakenly shutting 
down the other engine but no official report has yet been issued on 
the cause martin said 
in june the federal aviation administration ordered most of the 
boeing 737400s then in operation grounded because of two incidents 
in one week in which the engines failed 
the faa ordered airlines to replace certain parts on the 3b2 
engines and restrict their power output because of safety concerns 
most of the planes affected were inspected and returned to service 
within a few weeks 
martin said the usair flight that went down was a shorthaul 
flight for which full thrust would not have been needed he also 
said the plane probably was not involved in the grounding because of 
its age

natives of northwest alaska and parts of 
the soviet far east can look forward to streamlined travel across 
the bering strait after the signing of a ussoviet agreement this 
weekend 
secretary of state james a baker iii and soviet foreign minister 
eduard shevardnadze are to sign a document allowing visafree travel 
by 1000 or so alaska and soviet yupiks with relatives on opposite 
sides of the strait 
while meeting at jackson hole wyo on arms control the two 
also are expected to sign another agreement creating a commission to 
resolve minor incidents in the bering strait region since the 
soviet union cut off travel across the strait in 1948 there have 
been occasional bordercrossing disputes 
elimination of the visa requirement means that family members 
will be able to see each other again said janie leask president 
of the alaska federation of natives it means that a people 
divided by an artificial boundary will once again be able to share 
experiences and their culture 
i expect quite a bit of travel especially from those villages 
along the bering sea coast 
one of those planning to go is branson tungiyan secretary of the 
gambell common council 
now that weve seen some of the russians here at gambell 
weve made friends and more than likely we have long lost relatives 
we havent seen since the 1930s tungiyan said 
improved ussoviet relations in the past year have resulted in 
several trips across the strait and reunions this week 34 natives 
from the soviet union have been participating in the bering straits 
region elders conference in nome 
bering air of nome recently began offering charter flights 
between that town 100 miles southeast of the bering strait and the 
soviet port town of provideniya 
although the need for visas will end passports still will be 
required people from each side of the bering strait will be allowed 
nonvisa visits of up to 90 days if they have been invited by 
relatives or other people with whom they share a cultural heritage

the tiny pieces of uta flight 772 first 
appeared like confetti in the sand then big chunks of the fuselage 
shattered in the crash that killed all 171 people aboard came into 
view 
it was hard to imagine during a lowlevel flight over the crash 
scene that the pieces ever came together to form a jumbo jet 
investigators in the tenere desert worked in 113degree heat 
thursday to determine a cause for the crash of the parisbound dc10 
two days earlier they recovered the flight and voice recorders from 
the wreckage a spokesman at the french foreign ministry in paris 
said thursday night 
uta or the union des transportes aeriens a private french 
company that serves africa and the pacific says a bomb was the most 
likely reason that debris spread over as much as 40 square miles 
the proiranian group islamic jihad claimed responsibility in 
separate telephone calls in london and paris although officials 
said they could not authenticate the claim 
strewn across the sand was a piece of the wing of the 16yearold 
white and blue dc10 and miles away the tail the bright colors of 
clothes dumped from shattered bags contrasted with a dull brown 
landscape 
blackened bodies were scattered across the desert 
the dead included seven americans among them bonnie pugh wife 
of the us ambassador to chad robert l pugh other victims 
included a chadian cabinet minister two swiss priests and eight 
children 
two french military helicopters were stationed at a small camp at 
the site two tents and several small vehicles some with red cross 
markings also were seen the force was flown in from neighboring 
chad 
they were gathering the bodies to fly them to ndjamena chad for 
identification according to col jeanpierre job commander of the 
french forces in chad his men were the ones who located the 
wreckage and were the first on the scene 
the french transport ministry appointed a commission to analyze 
the information from the planes flight and voice recorders 
the plane was on a flight from brazzaville congo to paris it 
disappeared 400 miles northwest of ndjamena the chadian capital 
where it had made a stop the crash area is about 150 miles east of 
agadez a city in central niger 
crash investigation experts were en route from the united states 
other officials were on site from chad and niger 
in washington the fbi said it was reviewing information from the 
crash to determine whether to open a criminal investigation 
antiterrorism statutes give the fbi jurisdiction to investigate 
terrorist attacks on americans overseas 
there is always a possibility of an fbi investigation right 
now we are on consultation wth other government agencies said fbi 
spokesman charles w steinmetz its certainly a serious issue we 
are placing a significant amount of importance on before the fbi 
can enter such cases it must get permission of the country where 
the crime occurred 
an anonymous caller to the news agency in london said islamic 
jihad was responsible for the planes downing and demanded the 
release of shiite moslem religious leader sheik abdulkarim obeid 
who was kidnapped from southern lebanon on july 28 by israeli forces 
islamic jihad is among several radical fundamentalist groups in 
lebanon believed to be part of hezbollah or party of god the 
umbrella group thought to hold 16 westerners hostage in lebanon 
obeid is a member of hezbollah

two americans claimed thursday to have 
discovered noahs ark on the southwest side of mount ararat in 
eastern turkey while flying over it by helicopter 
chuck aaron the pilot said a square boat shape was spotted 
14500 feet up on the mountain in a place usually covered by a 
glacier he said the area was exposed this summer because of high 
temperatures in the region near the soviet border 
we are 100 percent sure this is the ark aaron of orlando 
fla said in a telephone interview 
there have been various claims of the discovery of the ark since 
turkey lifted a ban on climbing the mountain in 1982 
many christian fundamentalists who interpret the bible 
literally believe the ark must be on mount ararat the biblical 
account in the book of genesis said that after the great deluge the 
ark came to rest on the mountain with noahs family and a cargo of 
male and female pairs of every kind of animal 
but geologists say even though there is evidence of a flood in 
mesopotamia in sumerian times they maintain it is not possible for 
a ship to make landfall at an altitude as high as mount ararat 
aaron said he and his partner bob garbe discovered and 
photographed the object they believe is the ark during a sept 15 
flight 
he said he and garbe a pharmacist in colombus ohio have made 
five flights in the last three years in search of the ark on the 
16000foothigh mountain 
he said the glacier on the mountain only melts enough to expose 
the boat every 20 or 30 years 
aaron and garbe belong to the orlandobased immanuel expeditions 
foundation aaron said they used donations and 60000 of their own 
funds to finance the expedition 
he said they plan to return next year for a june climb to the 
spot with a team of 20 that will include geologists and 
archeologists 
aaron said they based their search on information provided by an 
american pilot ed davis of albuquerque nm who said he saw the 
same boat shape at the same spot during a flight in 1943 and on 
other reported sightings

the bush administration formally asked congress 
thursday for 9 million to help the election campaign of nicaraguan 
opposition candidate violeta chamorro declaring we are at a 
watershed in nicaragua 
in a message to congressional leaders asking for the assistance 
secretary of state james a baker iii called the february 1990 
election between chamorros opposition coalition and incumbent 
sandinista president daniel ortega a rare chance for us to support 
democratization in a totalitarian society 
most congressional democrats were still evaluating the proposal 
but initial reaction was positive after a white house meeting with 
president bush former president jimmy carter who will be an 
observer at the elections said he would support the initiative 
the administration wants to rush legislation through congress in 
the next week or so in order to make money available in time for 
nicaraguas onemonth voter registration season in october 
baker said chamorro has a chance to win but added we 
shouldnt be under any illusions about the battle they face he 
noted that the sandinistas would use all resources at their command 
the army the secret police the government bureaucracy and mass 
organizations to further their political fortunes 
despite the odds the opportunity to install a new government is 
a rare opportunity he said we are at a watershed in nicaragua 
baker wrote the election pits an underfinanced democratic 
coalition against an authoritarian state 
the aid package would transfer 5 million to the national 
endowment for democracy for activities like election monitoring 
voter registration getoutthe vote efforts and partybuilding 
ned a private foundation created by congress in 1982 to support 
democratic elections worldwide has undertaken similar efforts in 
poland the philippines panama and chile 
another 4 million would be left flexible the administration 
said but could go for election monitoring by groups like carters 
and the united nations civic education and getoutthevote 
campaigns help in registering nicaraguan expatriates to vote and 
to pay necessary taxes to nicaraguas supreme electoral council 
nicaraguan law requires that any foreign money coming into the 
election process be matched by a contribution to the council which 
oversees and runs the elections 
the money would be transferred from unused funds that had been 
earmarked for verification teams overseeing a ceasefire in the 
country and for humanitarian aid for the antisandinista contra 
rebels 
carter who will be an official observer at the elections said 
there is a need to make sure that the opposition parties do have 
adequate funds to make the playing field level as well as a need 
for money to pay for running the mechanics of the election 
he noted that there 4394 polling places and that each needs 11 
observers one from each party that is going to cost some 
money carter said 
bush met with carter to encourage him in his observer effort 
ask that he try to get the sandinistas to allow other observers down 
there as well said white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
the leftist government has blocked some other international 
observers

a former aide at the ptl ministry 
testified thursday that she still thinks founder jim bakker was 
underpaid even though she was laid off during the period he is 
accused of taking hundreds of thousands of dollars in bonuses 
elizabeth sacco told a us district court jury said shes still 
loyal to bakker and im proud of it i feel loyalty because ive 
seen what this man built a greedy man doesnt have his hair turn 
gray in five years 
i wouldnt have taken his job for 10 million a year 
ms sacco who answered correspondence for the ministry until her 
layoff in 1986 was one of the first witnesses to testify for bakker 
as the defense phase of the 3weekold fraud trial got under way 
the defense presented videotapes of old ptl club shows on 
wednesday before calling the first witnesses thursday 
bakker who resigned from the ministry in a sexandmoney scandal 
in 1987 is accused of fleecing his followers by diverting 37 
million raised from ptl partners to finance a lavish lifestyle 
prosecution witnesses testified that he and his wife tammy 
received sixfigure bonuses in the years before his resignation even 
though the ministry was in financial trouble mrs bakker is not 
charged in the case 
if found guilty on all 24 counts he could be sentenced to 120 
years in prison and fined more than 5 million 
partners who contributed at least 1000 were promised a set 
number of days per year of free lodging at ptls heritage usa theme 
park in fort mill sc but most of the lodging planned there was 
never built 
still ms sacco said bakker was very concerned about the 
partners he wanted them treated fairly and politely he said these 
were the people who built this place 
government attorney jerry miller asked ms sacco if she ever 
heard bakker telling people he oversold any of the partnerships 
i believe he did not know if indeed they were oversold she 
said why would a man who worked so hard fleece his partners and 
destroy the place he built 
how about the rollsroyces and 500000 homes miller asked 
wasnt he entitled to have a home she said 
how many homes was he entitled to miller asked referring to 
prosecution allegations about luxury homes in california and florida 
as well as a lavish home at tega cay sc she didnt respond 
in a heated exchange during the crossexamination miller asked 
her how an additional 3 million would have affected ptl 
after being asked the same question several times ms sacco 
replied i guess many people could have been helped yes 
another witness louise grimes of hopkins sc the owner of a 
gas station testified that she bought six lifetime partnerships at 
ptl and was always able to obtain reservations at the christian 
retreat she contradicted other partners who had testified for the 
prosecution that they had been unable to get reservations 
under questioning by defense attorney george t davis she 
described the atmosphere at heritage usa 
i want to say its heavenly but i dont know what heaven is 
like she said i can tell you that people were happy there 
she testified that bakker had helped her kick her cigarette habit 
and that she considered heritage usa to be a holy place 
also thursday vicki liddell who worked at ptls adoption 
agency said the ministry sheltered pregnant teenagers and 
succeeded in placing their babies in good homes 
those families that could were asked to contribute but by and 
large the bills were paid for by ptl she said she described the 
main purpose of the ptl home for unwed mothers as saving babies 
from abortion

the historic bedford springs hotel 
went on the auction block thursday but its owners rejected the high 
bid of 53 million as not enough for the 185yearold building and 
2300 acres of mountain land 
i think the vultures were here looking to scoop up a bargain 
said hobert hobbs vice president of sky group international inc 
which owns the resort weve been in a lot of battles were not 
going to give up the war 
about 200 people crowded into the lobby of the bedford county 
hotel but neither the owner nor auctioneer david fox would say how 
many bids were offered during the hourlong auction neither 
identified the high bidder 
the auction was held nine days before 48 million is due to 
union national bank of pittsburgh the money was spent out of a 75 
million loan made in 1987 for renovations never completed because of 
a dispute between owners that ended up in federal bankruptcy court 
hobbs would not say how much sky group international wants for 
the 244room hotel and surrounding land which includes a golf 
course and wooded trails as for the bidding he said it was 
considerably far off 
he said the owners would continue to seek new financing to pay 
union national bank before it forecloses on the property 
hobbs said the high bid would not have covered second mortgages 
on the property and unsecured debt 
wed rather take our chances that in nine more days we can find 
the financing hobbs said were going to continue and say a lot 
of prayers 
the hotel is a stately stretch of three and fourstory buildings 
in the allegheny mountains in its glory days it attracted notables 
including six presidents but now all but 66 of its 244 rooms have 
been closed to guests

gallo has asked distributors to pull 
thunderbird and night train the drink of choice among derelicts 
from skid row liquor stores across the nation 
ernest gallo chairman of the eampj gallo winery ordered 
retailers in such areas wednesday to halt sales of the highalcohol 
screwtop wines the skid rows were not identified 
at the same time the company said the wines should not be 
blamed for the problem of drinking among street people rather 
retailers who sell the products to obvious alcoholic derelicts 
should be stopped by stricter enforcement of laws the winery said 
this practice has led to the assertion that these products 
cause skid row conditions and therefore that by stopping the sale 
of highproof wine the problem of skid row can be solved the 
company said 
we believe this thinking is naive and that the use of these 
products on skid row is merely a symptom and not a cause 
thunderbird and night train are made with a hint of wine flavor 
and fortified with grape brandy to boost the percentage of alcohol 
to about 18 percent the wines usually sell for 90 cents to 150 
for a threequarter liter bottle 
gallo called the wines an affordable alternative to other 
alcoholic beverages and warned that alcoholics deprived of one 
source will simply find another 
the company claims about 26 percent of the us wine market with 
estimated sales of four million cases of the two wines each year 
gallo with about 20 commercial brands is a privately held company 
with total sales of reportedly more than 1 billion annually

a woman fighting for control of seven 
frozen embryos in an unprecedented divorce case on thursday was 
awarded temporary custody by a judge who ruled that life begins at 
conception and the woman should be allowed to carry them to term 
blount county circuit judge w dale young ruling in favor of 
mary sue davis over her estranged husband junior lewis davis 
declared that their embryos were children not property 
im thrilled its definitely what i wanted mrs davis told 
a news conference in titusville fla where she now lives 
davis said he would appeal in the state court system and 
potentially beyond they are going to force me to become a father 
against my wishes he said 
mrs davis said she would not try to get pregnant immediately 
im waiting to see about the appeal then hopefully after that try 
to have a child she said i could try at any time but i have 
to recover from all of this and then consider starting the program 
she added that the earliest she would try to get pregnant was 
january 
as far as we are aware this is the first judicial decision 
which has declared an embryo a human being said charles clifford 
davis attorney adding that he would ask the court to prevent mrs 
davis from implanting the embryos until appeals are settled 
clifford said the ruling could conflict with the supreme courts 
landmark roe vs wade decision allowing women to have abortions 
janet mayfield the attorney who will handle davis appeal said the 
decision might also conflict with state laws on property interests 
and anatomical gifts 
the case grew out of the decadeold technology of testtube 
babies or invitro fertilization the davises became embroiled in 
the dispute after they were unable to have children and turned to in 
vitro fertilization 
the couple produced nine embryos in december under the guidance 
of dr i ray king at a knoxville clinic two were implanted in mrs 
davis but failed to develop the others were put in cold storage 
but then davis sued for divorce in february 
during testimony in august davis 31 said he would feel raped 
of my reproductive rights if mrs davis were allowed to implant 
the embryos without his consent 
mrs davis 29 argued the embryos represent her best chance of 
becoming a mother she contended that davis was seeking a right not 
normally given to a man whether a child should be born after he 
has fertilized the egg of his mate 
after declaring the four to eightcell embryos to be children 
young in effect treated the case like a custody dispute in which 
the overriding concern is the best interest of the child 
from fertilization the cells of a human embryo are 
differentiated unique and specialized to the highest degree of 
distinction the judge said thus he said human life begins at 
conception 
young said mrs davis could have temporary custody so that she 
could have the eggs implanted in her womb in hopes of becoming 
pregnant child support visitation and final custody will be 
decided if a birth results he wrote 
it was the toughest decision of my life as a judge young 
said in an interview on a scale of 1 to 10 it was a 10 i have 
agonized over it 
youngs ruling relied on a 1988 federal appeals court decision 
from florida affirming the reliability of dna profiling in 
determining a persons individuality that the life codes for 
each special unique individual are resident at conception and 
animate the new person very soon after fertilization occurs 
the judge said the roe vs wade decision was in directly the 
opposite direction from davis vs davis everything the court 
said in roe vs wade dealt with the constitutionality of abortion 
statutes he said that issue was not before this court 
but clifford said the roe decision contains some explicit 
language that says that a fetus which of course is much further 
along than an embryo is not a human being for the purposes of the 
united states constitution 
regina smith executive director of the prolife council of 
connecticut called the courts decision a victory for unborn 
children 
ellen clayton an associate professor of law and pediatrics at 
vanderbilt university called the ruling a disaster that could 
have implications on in vitro research and abortion 
in the in vitro process eggs are extracted surgically from a 
womans body and mixed with sperm in a laboratory dish those that 
are fertilized can be implanted in the womb testimony indicated the 
success rate for the procedure averages about one in five 
the davises divorce is not yet final in his ruling thursday 
young instructed mrs davis to file final papers that would complete 
the proceeding the couple did not contest other issues such as 
division of household property

new projections announced thursday by the 
agriculture department suggest that rising crop yields may reduce 
the amount of land needed to meet us demands more than 40 percent 
by the year 2030 
export needs are expected to increase but growth in yields of 
such major crops as wheat corn and soybeans will more than keep 
pace that will result in less land needed for crops 
the new projections were included in a 280page appraisal of the 
nations soil and water resources ordered by congress in the 
resource conservation act of 1977 
in its first rca appraisal published in 1981 usda analysts said 
that almost 390 million acres would be required by 2030 by 
comparison slightly more than 380 million acres were used for crops 
in 1982 the base year for the new projections 
under intermediate conditions assumed in the latest study 
cropland acreage in 2030 is projected to be slightly less than 220 
million acres 
the differences in the two projections of acreages needed do 
not result primarily from differences in projected demand for 
commodities the report said 
in fact it continued for the major crops corn sorghum 
soybeans and wheat projections of quantities needed are higher in 
the second appraisal than in the first largely because projected 
export demands are higher 
the report said that domestic use of some grains in 2030 may be 
lower than anticipated previously because of improvements in 
livestock feeding efficiency and much greater use of pasture and 
forage also per capita projections of red meat consumption are 
lower in the new appraisal 
but the main reason for the differences in the amount of cropland 
that will be required in 2030 stems from the projected rates of crop 
yields 
for example in the first appraisal average corn yields in 2030 
were projected at a us average of 144 bushels per acre the 1989 
harvest is currently estimated at 1124 bushels per acre 
the new appraisal puts 2030 corn yields at 198 bushels per acre 
sorghum would go to 127 bushels per acre compared with 67 projected 
in the first appraisal and this years average of 626 bushels 
wheat would go to 70 bushels per acre from 42 projected earlier 
and this years average of 329 soybean yields were projected at 69 
bushels per acre compared with 45 earlier and 32 this year 
the assumptions about yield increases mirror the vastly changed 
view of the future that has developed during the past decade the 
report said in the early 1970s many studies indicated that 
productivity was increasing more slowly than in preceding decades 
at that time it appeared to researchers that without 
significant technological breakthroughs and increased investment in 
research and extension programs the rate of growth in productivity 
will probably continue to decline 
but later research provided a basis for greater optimism the 
report said in scientific meetings in 1982 and in 1986 a view 
developed favorable to continued technological progress in crop and 
livestock production as well as in conservation of the nations 
resources

a state appeals court thursday threw out the 
theftbyextortion conviction of former congressman and mecham 
administration aide sam steiger saying political armtwisting 
doesnt constitute an illegal act 
in a 30 ruling the midlevel court of appeals said it did not 
approve of steigers conduct but feared it could have a chilling 
effect on politics if the hardball tactics that steiger used were 
considered a crime 
steiger was convicted april 7 1988 after prosecutors said he 
had tried to extort a vote from state parole board member ron 
johnson he was accused of threatening johnson with the loss of an 
outside job unless johnson voted gov evan mechams way in an 
administrative matter 
just three days before steiger was convicted mecham a 
firstterm republican was removed from office by the state senate 
senate members concluded mecham misused money in a state protocol 
fund and obstructed justice by trying to thwart an investigation of 
allegations that one of his aides had threatened another aide the 
allegations were unrelated to the steiger case 
steiger who served five terms in congress before resigning in an 
ultimately unsuccessful bid for the senate in 1976 said attorney 
general bob corbin had singled him out unfairly when he brought the 
extortion charge 
everybody has forgotten that i was very critical of the size 
and the ineffeciencies that the attorney generals office had 
created he said its the most expensive attorney generals 
office in the united states and we have the second highest rate of 
crime in the united states its crazy 
he was after me not because of mecham steiger added he 
was after me because i was a threat to the department 
corbin was away from his office and unavailable for comment 
immediately aides said they had not decided whether to appeal to 
the state supreme court but they criticized the appeals courts 
decision 
its bad public policy to say that an independent official can 
be threatened with financial harm said steve twist corbins 
chief deputy 
steiger 60 was the only mecham administration offical convicted 
of any administrationrelated crime thursdays reversal was issued 
only hours before the state supreme court was to start hearing 
arguments on whether mechams impeachment and ouster should be 
overturned 
writing for a threejudge panel judge john claborne said the 
theftbyextortion statute was unconstitutionally vague because 
it doesnt spell out clearly enough what is to be considered illegal 
and because it permits arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement 
certainly we do not condone in any way steigers conduct 
claborne added 
the court said an executive assistant to a governor must 
sometimes issue strong orders to carry out the governors policy 
even by suggesting that underlings could lose their jobs if they 
didnt comply 
many of the changes that steiger was trying to make at the board 
have been made since then under the administration of gov rose 
mofford who was elevated from her elected post as secretary of 
state after mechams impeachment 
steiger was fined and placed on probation after his maricopa 
county superior court conviction and ordered by judge ronald 
reinstein to perform public service work for the state bar of 
arizona he completed the public service work even before the appeal 
was decided

at least 780 white men have 
vowed not to perform mandatory military service in the largest 
defiance ever of national conscription laws draft resistance 
leaders said thursday 
the military said legal action would be taken against anyone who 
failed to report for service 
leaders of the end conscription campaign released names of the 
conscientious objectors at news conferences in six cities 
organizers said the protest was part of a nationwide defiance 
campaign waged by antiapartheid groups since early august 
as part of the campaign about 9000 people of all races staged 
an antigovernment march in pietermaritzburg one of many mass 
demonstrations staged since president fw de klerk said his 
government will allow peaceful protests 
police said when the crowd dispersed there was stonethrowing 
several shop windows were broken and goods valued at several 
thousand dollars were looted from stores police said no one was 
arrested and there were no injuries reported 
several major protests have taken place without incident since 
then but justice minister kobie coetsee said the trouble in 
pietermaritzburg can in no way be compared with peaceful and 
orderly protests and will not be tolerated 
in the nearby port of durban police arrested 38 high school 
students and teachers when they broke up a march of about 400 mostly 
black people protesting the acquittal of a black civic leader 
charged with murdering a schoolboy 
riot police in johannesburg turned back several hundred students 
from the university of the witwatersrand who wanted to march to a 
local police station to protest the detention of fellow students 
teachers and students in mixedrace areas of cape town held 
several demonstrations but no incidents were reported 
in pretoria chief justice michael corbett swore in the new 
cabinet a day after de klerks inauguration 
a progovernment afrikaans newspaper beeld said in a frontpage 
story the cabinet probably will decide within a week or so on the 
possible release of nelson mandela walter sisulu and other jailed 
leaders of the outlawed african national congress guerrilla 
movement mandela is serving a life sentence since his 1962 
conviction for sabotage 
the draft resisters include many who have yet to be drafted and 
others who have completed their twoyear training but say they will 
not attend mandatory callup camps 
we are not prepared to serve in a racist defense force to 
uphold a racist system said chris de villiers a lawyer and 
acting chairman of the end conscription campaign 
the military said it will take legal action against those who 
fail to report for service 
military service is mandatory for all ablebodied white men 
unless they qualify as religious objectors or win delays for 
example to attend college 
draft resisters face jail terms of up to six years and several 
men have been sentenced in the past two years including two who 
received the maximum penalty 
a press statement said the new draft resisters included 
professors clergymen executives and engineers 
we will respond to the callup in different ways the 
statement said some will go to jail others will opt for 
religious objector status many of us will choose between a life in 
exile or constant evasion of callups 
de villiers a former army lieutenant urged the government to 
introduce a nonmilitary alternative for political objectors 
the government does not release information on the manpower of 
the armed forces but an estimated 68000 conscripts are on active 
duty and about 325000 men are in the reserves at any one time 
under apartheid south africas 28million black majority has no 
vote in national affairs the 5 million whites about half male 
control the economy and maintain separate districts schools and

children who are hungry sick or homeless are 
poor learners a study by a private educational group said thursday 
calling for greater coordination between schools and social service 
agencies 
the institute for educational leadership inc said the study 
found that changing demographics and lifestyles of american families 
have created problems that schools alone cannot solve 
only 6 percent of families are the socalled traditional ones 
with a breadwinner father housewife mother and two children in 
public schools said the report forty percent of the nations poor 
are children 15 million children are being raised by a single 
parent and 2 million children live with neither parent 
the study entitled the same client the demographics of 
education and service delivery systems said the average income 
for femaleheaded households with children is only 11200 
harold l hodgkinson director of the groups center for 
demographic policy and the author of the report also pointed to 
limited transportation options for the poor such as having to 
travel by bus and subway to get to work day care and school and 
the lack of lowincome housing 8 million lowincome renters 
competing for 4 million housing units as creating great hardships 
particularly for working mothers 
as for health care hodgkinson a former director of the national 
institute of education said 11 percent of americas school children 
are enrolled in special classes for the handicapped roughly 
onethird of these children he said would have a smaller handicap 
or none at all if adequate medical care had been provided during 
pregnancy and in infancy 
it is painfully clear that a hungry sick or homeless child is 
by definition a poor learner yet schools usually have no linkage to 
health or housing organizations outside those run by the schools 
themselves said the report 
at a time when service organizations are increasingly strapped 
financially this kind of interactive organization holds promise 
it may well be that with few increases in funding we could still 
magnify the effectiveness of each dollar several times through 
programs based on interagency collaboration at each governmental 
level 
hodgkinson said that in recent years there has been more 
dialogue among government agencies with the same function but one 
outcome has been organization maintenance not improved services 
for the urgent problems we face this is not enough service 
organizations must begin to see their interdependence across 
functional lines he said

a girl whose steer won first prize at the 
ohio state fair must forfeit the 28000 because the animals hide 
had been dyed allegedly to mask that it had been entered under a 
different name in another fair 
the ohio expositions commission which operates the fair 
approved an agreement reached with the family of 17yearold susan 
shealy whose steer named hank won the prize in august the family 
admits to no wrongdoing but the girl will not get her prize money 
and must give up her firstplace ribbon she and her family also 
were barred from competition for five years 
the message is not to cheat at the livestock show at the ohio 
state fair said jack foust general manager of the fair 
foust said officials could not prove suspicions that hank had 
also been shown under the name carl at the iroquois county fair in 
illinois in july a violation of the rules but he said 
investigators for the ohio fair found that a white spot on hanks 
belly had been dyed black which is also against the rules 
illinois officials did not have nose prints of carl to compare 
with those of hank taken at the ohio fair foust said carl was the 
secondprize steer at the illinois fair 
hank a 1245pound anguscross steer had been impounded at an 
ohio state university barn while investigators waited for his hair 
to grow out the shealy family picked him up on thursday 
were happy ohio is strict but i wish illinois was as strict 
as ohio because if they were wed have nose prints and could prove 
that theyre two separate steers and wed get you people off our 
back said a boy who identified himself only as a family member 
when reached at the shealys home 
the agreement was reached two weeks ago 
hanks credentials came into question when fair officials 
received a tip from an illinois extension agent on aug 19 that hank 
might be carl named reserve champion at the iroquois county fair in 
illionois on july 24 
investigators said black dye had been used to cover a swirl of 
white hair on hanks belly a similar white patch can be seen in a 
photograph of carl 
fair rules prohibit misrepresentation of an animals history or 
ownership and forbid any alterations in an animals natural 
appearance under the rules of both fairs an exhibitor also must 
have owned the animal since jan 1 of the year in which it is shown 
the agreement states that the shealys exhibited hank based upon 
a misunderstanding created by advice provided a professional 
groomer susan shealy and the shealy family believed that 
certain coloring or shading of hank the steer was fair and 
appropriate to successfully present hank the steer for competition 
the groomer was not identified 
foust said that under state fair rules there will be no grand 
champion this year 
the family of 12yearold jeremy simmons who exhibited carl at 
the illinois fair has denied any wrongdoing they said carl was 
destroyed after the fair 
marvin perzee chairman of the illinois fair could not be 
reached for comment thursday telephone calls to him were not 
answered 
the 28000 was the highest bid made for hank at the state fairs 
sale of champions on aug 14 rod link of fremondbased link

the communist party newspaper pravda printed a rare 
public apology thursday for a report that claimed political maverick 
boris yeltsin had gone on a boozing and buying spree in the united 
states 
in another case involving public criticism of an official the 
official news agency tass said the party plans action against two 
prosecutors who accused hardline politburo member yegor k ligachev 
of misconduct 
in its apology for the yeltsin report pravda said the reporter 
who wrote the story had not seen anything of the kind 
a legislative committee created to serve as a watchdog for the 
state media said the account of yeltsins purported american binge 
smacked of the gutter press and was unacceptable 
yeltsin called the piece garbage 
the lengthy expose appeared monday in pravda it was originally 
published by the italian newspaper la repubblica and said the soviet 
legislator left behind in the united states a wake of catastrophic 
prophecies insane expenses interviews and above all the perfume of 
jack daniels black label 
the pravda article was picked up by tass and distributed 
nationwide regional newspapers carried it in full 
a flushed and angry yeltsin who returned home monday from a 
ninecity us tour accused pravda of seeking revenge for the 
fact that americans received us with admiration 
the communist party daily said thursday it had instructed its 
washington correspondent v linnik to contact the la repubblica 
reporter who wrote the original article vittorio zucconi and check 
its accuracy 
asked whether he stood by the authenticity of everything he 
wrote about bn yeltsin in his article zucconi replied he had 
based it on secondary sources on a publication that appeared in the 
washington post sept 13 headlined with drunken embraces toward the 
capitalists and the testimony of soviet emigres who heard talk of 
yeltsins conduct in baltimore pravda said 
the pravda editorial board offered its apologies to yeltsin but 
appeared to do so only grudgingly 
the reprint of la repubblica storys was promoted on the front 
page with excerpts saying yeltsin found the united states a 
holiday a stage a bar 5000 kilometers long 
the apology was on the bottom of page 7 
members of the media watchdog committee the supreme soviet 
committee on glasnost and peoples rights accused pravda of 
deliberately drawing a biased picture of yeltsin a deputy in the 
supreme soviet 
the pravda report apparently did little to dull public enthusiasm 
for yeltsin who revels in his role as an antiestablishment 
gladiator fighting for a better life for average soviets though he 
himself is a member of the elite communist party central committee 
on wednesday night about 10000 people rallied in the moscow 
suburb of zelenograd to show support for yeltsin and for the two 
prosecutors who have made claims of corruption by ligachev and other 
high party officials 
in its report on the prosecutors thursday tass said the 
communist party central committee directed its moscow organization 
to take action against the two prosecutors telman gdlyan and 
nikolai ivanov 
the two publicly accused ligachev yeltsins archrival in the 
soviet leadership of involvement in corruption cases they were 
investigating 
however the soviet procuratorgenerals office cleared ligachev 
tass did not say what type of action would be taken against the 
two prosecutors who have themselves been under investigation on 
charges that they forced confessions during their inquiry 
during his us visit yeltsin warned americans that president 
mikhail s gorbachev could face a revolution if he fails to improve 
living conditions soon 
yeltsin the former communist party chief of moscow was stripped 
of that post almost two years ago by gorbachev who denounced him as 
politically immature and overly ambitious 
in a remarkable political comeback in march yeltsin won 89 
percent of the vote when he ran against an establishment candidate 
to represent moscow in the new national legislature the congress of 
peoples deputies

despite its problems cable television has a 
lot to crow about a cable executive said thursday in urging his 
colleagues to fight back against widespread cablebashing 
national cable television association president james mooney 
saying there is no shortage of cablebashing going on in the world 
today told a cable convention it was time for operators to 
stand up for cable and for what cable has achieved 
he said there were 51 million cable homes today compared with 21 
million in 1981 not because they have to be theyre cable homes 
because they want to be thanks to an upsurge in firstrun 
programming featuring bigname stars since cable was deregulated in 
1984 
mooney spoke to the great lakes exposition cable convention in 
columbus ohio a copy of his speech was released from ncta offices 
in washington 
mooney reminded his audience that many cable programs are highly 
praised by tv critics and that a recent roper organization poll 
showed the public believes that cable cultural childrens sports 
and general entertainment programming is superior to that found on 
broadcast tv 
is it any wonder then that most people voting with their 
wallets think an average of 1450 a month for over 30 channels of 
basic cable is a good buy he said 
a general accounting office report to congress last month said 
the average cable bill including premium services went up 14 
percent during the first 23 months after 1984 rate deregulation to 
2468 
mooney said that increase was significant but hardly 
unreasonable and that the price hikes had abated this year 
according to the governments consumer price index for this 
year cable bills from january through august went up only 14 
percent less than half the the overall cpi mooney said 
clearly what happened during the first 23 months of deregulation 
was an adjustment and today were back on track 
but a host of bills are pending in congress that would reregulate 
cable as lawmakers react to constituent complaints about poor cable 
tv service and increased rates 
in the face of such criticism mooney said it was important for 
cable operators to let people know the value of what theyre 
getting and also to pay very serious attention to good 
customer service 
he said the cable act required cable systems to dedicate more 
channels for public educational and governmental access and that 
increases in cable franchising fees had fattened municipal coffers 
by more than 3 billion since 1984 
weve got to tell our story mooney said weve changed the 
way people spend their leisure hours weve done for television in 
15 years what the broadcasters couldnt do in 30 weve got a great 
story to tell and if we tell it effectively a great future

a statement issued by the interior ministry and carried by the 
state adn news agency formally rejected an application to legalize 
the neues forum new forum opposition group 
neues forum was established two weeks ago by 30 east germans 
pushing reform of the hardline government under ailing 77yearold 
erich honecker 
in a conflicting highlevel signal deputy culture minister klaus 
hoepcke demanded a state probe into why thousands of young east 
germans are leaving their homeland for the west 
the communist party youth newspaper junge welt said hoepcke told 
students and teachers at an east berlin art college that authorities 
should investigate and correct the social problems prompting the 
exodus 
about 18000 east germans fled to the west through hungary after 
budapest opened its border with austria on sept 10 to those 
refusing to return to east germany 
legal emigration from east germany to west germany is also at 
record levels with more than 80000 permitted to leave by early 
september 
west german officials earlier predicted about 100000 east german 
arrivals for 1989 but now say the number could reach 200000 
bolstered by the widely publicized refugee tide reformers 
organized neues forum to press the leadership for change 
but east german communists are likely to be more resistant to 
reforms than their warsaw pact allies in hungary and poland without 
a communist government the nation would have little cause to exist 
as a state separate from west germany 
hoepcke called for news media reforms and more dialogue between 
the east german leadership and its citizens 
on wednesday another prominent politician manfred gerlach had 
questioned whether the leadership should rethink its positions in 
view of the decision by so many children of the revolution to 
abandon east germany for the west 
the main party daily neues deutschland has ignored suggestions 
that reforms be considered 
the ministry statement thursday said neues forums request for 
legalization had been received reviewed and rejected 
the aims and concerns of the proposed organization contradict 
the constitution of east germany and present antistate policies 
it said the signature drive for support of formation of the 
organization was not allowed and is therefore illegal it is an 
attempt to deceive the citizens of east germany about the true 
intentions of the authors 
in bonn west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher told 
reporters thursday he will meet next week with east german foreign 
minister oskar fischer to discuss the refugee problem and conditions 
in east germany 
they will be in new york for the un general assembly session

federal housing auditors have discovered nearly 
300000 in additional payments to consultants who won lucrative 
rent subsidies for developers bringing the known total of such 
payments to 6 million 
the payments detailed in a new report to the senate banking 
committee obtained thursday included 57500 more to former 
department and housing and urban development official joseph 
strauss by far the most highly paid known hud consultant with more 
than 17 million in fees in the last five years 
the report by huds inspector general also revealed additional 
payments to two prominent republicans political consultant lou 
kitchin and frederick bush the top fundraiser for president bushs 
campaign frederick bushs nomination for an ambassadorial post was 
doomed by disclosures about his role in influence peddling at the 
agency 
meanwhile stuart weisberg staff director of the house 
subcommittee investigating the hud scandal said subpoenas ordering 
former hud secretary samuel pierce to appear before the panel were 
being formally served with pierces lawyers late thursday 
the subcommittee voted unanimously tuesday to subpoena pierce to 
testify on at least three occasions the first next tuesday as part 
of the congressional investigaiton into the departments problems 
weisberg said pierces attorneys had agreed to accept the subpoenas 
on behalf of pierce 
payments to five consultants not identified in previous reports 
were discovered during a followup investigation by hud auditors 
those payments totaled 128000 a relatively small amount compared 
to the huge fees paid to more prominent consultants 
all of the 6 million in consulting fees were paid since late 
1983 by developers seeking subsidies from huds section 8 moderate 
rehabilitation program it was an april audit of that program that 
triggered the current congressional internal and justice department 
investigations of fraud mismanagement and influence peddling at hud 
during the reagan administration 
the april audit identified 42 million in fees paid to 
consultants and said those lobbyists some former hud officials and 
other prominent republicans with little or no experience in housing 
appeared to win special treatment from hud officials 
at an august hearing hud inspector general paul a adams said 
his investigators had discovered additional payments that brought 
known consultant fees to 57 million and in a report sent to the 
senate panel this week adams said the total had grown to 6 million 
kitchin southeastern regional director for the reagan and bush 
presidential campaigns received 90000 more than had been known 
just last month bringing his total from 25000 to 115000 the 
report said 
the first 25000 was for his work on a north carolina project 
pierce approved over the objection of several agency experts 
and auditors uncovered an additional 800 paid to frederick bush 
who is no relation to the president but served as a top aide to 
thenvice president bush and as well as treasurer of his 
presidential campaign 
frederick bush was in line to be us ambassador to luxembourg 
but withdrew him name from consideration earlier this month after it 
became clear his work as a hud consultant had doomed his chances of 
senate confirmation 
the new report also put a price tag on the effect of the 1983 
decision to abandon a fair share financing formula which 
distributed moderate rehabilitation funds to based on local housing 
needs and ability to administer the program instead spending 
decisions became discretionary and were made at hud headquarters a 
change auditors have concluded opened the door for influence 
peddling 
of 31 billion spent on the program from october 1983 through 
september 1988 about 40 percent or 12 billion was 
misallocated when compared to the fair share percentages the 
report said

thousands fled georgias barrier islands and 
parts of its coastline thursday but hurricane hugos new northward 
path offered hope that the state would be spared its full force 
i think we escaped the brunt said ed stelle glynn county 
emergency operations spokesman after the center of the storm was 
200 miles east of brunswick 
the national weather service said the georgia coast could expect 
winds of 40 to 50 mph near tropical storm strength but far short of 
the fury closer to hugos center 
beryl diamond of the georgia emergency management agency said 
flooding was expected but hopefully were looking at less 
damage 
earlier gema opened shelters and advised about 142000 people 
more than 95000 of them in chatham county to leave their homes 
by midafternoon tybee island on the north end of the coast and 
st simons island to the south were virtual ghost towns of 
boardedup buildings the only open business on tybee island 
appeared to be nickies lounge where a handful of holdouts gathered 
as he sipped a drink 63yearold island resident charlie dowell 
scoffed at the idea of heading for savannah 
i dont go in there even when the weathers good he said 
authorities said they would cut off electricity to tybee island 
at 6 pm and police prevented most vehicles from entering the 
island 
gov joe frank harris declared a state of emergency in six 
coastal counties 
it is imperative that citizens heed the warnings to flee 
lowlying areas and the barrier islands harris said in a 
statement 
many didnt need much prompting hotels and motels were booked to 
capacity in savannah not far up the savannah river from the 
northern barrier islands of tybee and skidaway and further inland 
at least as far as statesboro and hinesville 
most of tybeees 4500 residents fled across a causeway to 
savannah and many werent stopping there bumpertobumper traffic 
stretched at least 30 miles inland from savannah many of the 
vehicles were towing boats 
but about 25 surfers lingered one of them cannon gould said he 
would be moving to his parents house on higher ground than his 
beach house but still on the island 
its fun gould said of the surfing i think tomorrow it 
will be better 
others fled lowlying areas on the mainland especially people 
living in mobile homes

a veterans housing loan program is having 
financial problems because of high foreclosures and may require more 
aid than the veterans affairs department has requested according to 
a government audit 
the general accounting office audit covered the departments 
financial statements for 1987 and 88 but made special note of vas 
housing loan program 
the primary cause of the loan guaranty funds increased need 
for funding beyond that generated through normal operations was the 
weakened financial condition of certain sectors of the economy 
particularly energy and agriculture according to the report 
released this week 
the loan guaranty fund guarantees a portion of private sector 
loans made to eligible veterans at special terms about 13 million 
veterans have taken advantage of va housing programs 
the fund largely paid its ways through the 1970s but its 
requirement for appropriations and money transfers has increased 
significantly since 1980 
the fund required 900 million in transfers and appropriations in 
1988 the gao said 
congress and the va are making several efforts to address the 
issue and va says the problem is lessening because of a decline in 
foreclosures 
va had 44693 home loan foreclosures in fiscal 1987 and 48963 in 
fiscal 1988 the report said foreclosures totaled 38721 in the 
first 10 months of this fiscal year said va spokeswoman donna st 
john 
we expect further improvements and we expect the numbers to 
continue to decrease she said 
va says the fiscal year appropriation for the fund was 778 
million with 120 million of that in supplemental funds 
the gao report says va will need about 100 million in tranfers 
from the direct loan fund plus about 453 million in additional 
direct appropriations in fiscal 1990 the direct loan fund is a 
separate fund used for direct mortgage loans to severely disabled 
veterans 
the report noted several possible influences that would change 
vas estimates 
a higher foreclosure rate than vas projection 
the continued sale withoutrecourse of loans on properties 
aquired by va through defaults 
when va finances foreclosed property sales it can package 
several loans for sale to an investor the sale with recourse 
guarantees that va will make good on any future default without 
recourse means the investor cannot go against va the 
withoutrecourse loans though supposedly providing less liability 
provide less cash at time of sale gao says 
a law will prevent va from making withoutrecourse sales after 
sept 30 but va is proposing legislation to give it flexibility in 
determining which types of loans to sell 
a significant lapse of vas authority to collect a 1 
percent funding fee on loans the last time there was such a lapse 
six weeks in 1988 va lost 30 million gao said

house democratic leaders struggled thursday to 
sell party members on a deficitreduction plan whose key element is 
a multibilliondollar tax increase for the nations 600000 richest 
taxpayers 
but there was no rush by rankandfile democrats to embrace the 
proposal aimed at staving off president bushs plan to cut the tax 
on capital gains the democratic alternative has a capitalgains 
break of its own 
this is an awful plan rep byron l dorgan dnd a member 
of the taxwriting ways and means committee said of the proposal 
george bush wants to give big tax breaks to the rich and we want 
to give them to the nearrich 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash defended the plan which 
includes taxdeductible individual retirement accounts for all 
workers as fair and sound 
there is very substantial positive reaction to this proposal 
he said 
ways and means chairman dan rostenkowski dill who would be 
expected to manage the democratic alternative in the house said 
after a closed meeting with party whips theres not too much 
unity here 
also attending that meeting was democratic national committee 
chairman ron brown who recently cautioned party lawmakers against 
repeatedly calling for tax increases in the face of bushs 
notaxincrease pledge 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater complained that expanding 
iras amounts to a tax increase 
if you institute a proposal that reduces revenue the 
government deficit gets larger and leaves you with even more 
pressure for a tax increase fitzwater said 
house republican whip newt gingrich of georgia told colleagues 
that he was absolutely amazed that liberal democrats would rush 
into a taxincrease fight after the lessons of 1984 and 1988 when 
democratic presidential candidates portrayed as favoring higher 
taxes were swamped 
the democrats stillemerging plan is intended as a substitute 
for the capitalgains tax cut that republicans and six maverick 
democrats pushed through ways and means last week the cut which 
bush endorsed is part of the committees deficitreduction plan 
democratic leaders note estimates that 80 percent of the benefit 
of the capitalgains reduction would go to those with annual incomes 
over 200000 after briefly accelerating revenues they contend it 
would deepen the budget deficit in 1992 and beyond 
as an alternative democratic leaders proposed 
expanding iras so all workers regardless of income could have 
a deductible plan the money could be withdrawn without penalty to 
finance the down payment on a first home or for college education 
eliminating a quirk in the 1986 tax overhaul in a way that would 
raise taxes on the richest 600000 couples and individuals the 
quirk requires some uppermiddleincome americans to pay a higher 
rate of tax on part of their earnings than applies to the wealthiest 
taxpayers 
under that law for example a single person with 75000 taxable 
income pays a top rate of 33 percent on a 10000 pay raise or 
investment windfall but a 250000ayear earner pays only 28 
percent tax on a similar increase in income 
the democratic plan would apply the 33 percent rate to all 
taxable income above 44900 for a single person and to all above 
74850 for a couple 
assuring that the 33 percent rate would not apply to any 
capitalgains income thus the maximum tax on capital gains which 
for some uppermiddleincome people is 33 percent would be cut to 
28 percent 
rep william h gray iii dpa who as house majority whip is 
the democrats chief votecounter called the proposal a 
continuation of the simplification of the tax code that would 
encourage saving and investment 
rep dan glickman dkan said the plan gives the party a chance 
to stand for something rather than just oppose the capitalgains 
cut the capitalgains reduction has drawn little public response 
he said but the mere mention of iras caused the phone to ring 
rep mike synar dokla calling any capitalgains cut a blow 
against deficit reduction said there would be a large group of us 
that will vote against any kind of change 
i think its a mistake for the democratic party to be 
advocating an increase in taxes until the president has done that 
said rep ed jenkins dga chief sponsor of the capitalgains cut 
that won ways and means approval

the us border patrol is hoping to enlist the 
help of the marines to help intercept illegal aliens and drug 
smugglers crossing the usmexican border an immigration official 
said thursday 
the immigration and naturalization service which oversees the 
border patrol is negotiating an agreement with the marine corps 
that would allow the platoon of about 45 marines to conduct 
surveillance to help detect smugglers said ins spokesman duke 
austin

the border patrol and the marine corps are discussing what type 
of equipment the marines will use he said 
they would not have any arrest authority whatsoever austin 
said federal law forbids use of regular military forces in civilian 
law enforcement 
the marines will have to receive a special legal designation to 
enable them to accompany the border patrol officers onto private 
property austin said us law prohibits military personnel without 
such a designation to enter private property the border patrol is 
empowered to patrol private property within 25 miles of us borders 
austin declined to say what part of the southern border the

the public health service said thursday many of 
its 1990 objectives for a healthier nation wont be met but said 
the agenda for the next decade calls for a longer life expectancy 
and a reduction in infant mortality 
substantial progress can be made in the 1990s also in areas like 
obesity where little improvement was made in last 10 years said 
dr j michael mcginnis director of the office of disease 
prevention and health promotion 
we know more now about what the risk groups are he said 
areas where goals for 1990 apparently will not be reached are 
immunization of children before age 2 and flu vaccinations for 
highrisk populations the atlantabased national centers for 
disease control said in its morbidity and mortality weekly report 
the report referred to a draft of the health services year 
2000 objectives for the nation released thursday 
tentative targets for the next decade include cutting the 
percentage of adult smokers in half to about 15 percent and 
reducing infant mortality from 104 infant deaths per thousand in 
1986 to no more than seven other goals include raising life 
expectancy from 749 years to at least 78 and increasing years of 
healthy life to 65 years from an estimated 60 in 1987 
smoking is a good example said mcginnis a deputy assistant 
secretary for health based in washington dc its accountable 
for 390000 deaths a year its an example of where we can target 
low income and minority populations where the most difficult 
challenges lie 
mcginnis said that for goals to be reached every sector of 
society must get involved 
the most important component is the work of voluntary 
organizations he said we have to have leadership at the state 
and local levels 
in the area of infant mortality mcginnis said it has been 
said that one of the truest measures of civilization is the care 
society gives its children we have had a 35 percent reduction in 
infant mortality since the 1970s when the 1990 goal was set 
he said infant mortality is an area where progress has been 
reasonably good but we need to target areas where the population is 
most vulnerable we have not been able to close the gap between 
blacks and whites and have missed the target for 1990 of reducing 
the rate for blacks 
the service listed 21 areas for improvement by the year 2000 
we ought to be able to anticipate progress in each of them 
mcginnis said the biggest challenge will be in the area of 
violent and abusive behavior 
the 21 areas include nutrition physical activity and fitness 
tobacco alcohol and other drugs sexual behavior violent and 
abusive behavior vitality and independence of older people 
environmental health occupational safety and health and 
unintentional injuries 
others are maternal and infant health immunization and 
infectious diseases aids other sexually transmitted diseases 
cholesterol and high blood pressure cancer other chronic 
disorders oral health mental and behavioral disorders health 
education and preventive services and surveillance and data systems 
we need to emphasize that these are national goals and not 
federal goals mcginnis said federalizing is not the way to do 
this we hope by laying out a common framework well be able to 
focus our collective resources 
mcginnis said in a telephone interview that the planning process 
was not complete and that comment was welcome

a legislator called thursday for international 
pressure on west germany to charge a former nazi ss general after a 
new book alleged wilhelm mohnke ordered the massacres of british 
us and canadian prisoners of war 
meanwhile west germany which promised 15 months ago to reopen 
investigations announced it would send a government prosecutor to 
britain next week to examine stillsecret government files on the 
78yearold mohnke 
the governments of britain canada and the united states must 
either bring enormous pressure on west germany to charge mohnke on 
the facts available or remove his name from the united nations list 
of suspected war criminals and explain why legislator jeff rooker 
said 
he was speaking at a publication party to launch the book 
hitlers last general written by two nazi era researchers ian 
sayer and douglas botting 
the book said that evidence in the british files includes 
deathbed testimony in 1947 by an ss corporal oskar senf to a war 
crimes investigator that mohnke ordered the 1940 killing of 80 to 90 
unarmed british prisoners at wormoudt france 
the book also described mohnke as a key link in the chain of 
command during the killing of 72 american prisoners shot at malmedy 
in the ardennes on dec 17 1944 and in the shootings of some 35 
canadian prisoners in normandy in june 1944 
mohnke has denied all the charges 
the authors published the names of 11 of the 12 ss troopers who 
they say are identified in the secret british files as having 
herded the captured troops into a barn at wermoudt near dunkirk 
and mowed them down with gunfire and hand grenades the authors said 
three or four of these men were believed to be alive 
after world war ii allied investigators entered mohnkes name in 
the un war crimes commission list as one of some 25000 a 
class suspects accused of serious crimes 
but mohnke who was in hitlers bunker in berlin when the nazi 
leader committed suicide april 30 1945 was captured by the soviets 
and they refused to extradite him after 10 years in a soviet jail 
mohnke was released to west germany 
he became a businessman and attracted scant publicity 
in 1973 west german prosecutors said they had dropped 
investigations on grounds there was insufficient evidence 
britain asked west germany to reopen the inquiry last year after 
sayer said he had traced documents showing mohnke had been sought 
separately by british american and canadian investigators 
mohnke told german newspapers he had done nothing wrong but took 
no action against sayer or newspapers that published the claims 
neighbors described mohnke as a nice quiet friendly old man 
the west german authorities have grudgingly opened their own 
investigation but the safest refuge on earth for a fugitive nazi 
war criminal is west germany sayer said thursday 
he added that during the previous west german investigation the 
prosecutors never asked to see the british files they had also 
never asked to see 70 boxes of files with references to mohnke held 
by the us justice departments nazihunting office of special 
investigations or the relevant canadian government records said 
sayer 
after the war 77 ss officers and men were convicted of taking 
part in the massacre of the americans at malmedy and jailed 
rooker whose constituents include one of five veterans who 
survived the wermoudt massacre said publicspirited people had 
given the authors access to some of the secret files on the wermoudt 
massacre 
the material has been classified under britains official secrets 
act as confidential until the year 2021 rooker said government 
ministers have told him that this is to avoid embarrassment 
apparently to relatives of the men of the ss hitlers notorious 
stormtroopers 
rooker the authors and the five elderly surviving veterans of 
the wormoudt massacre all said thursday they thought there was scant 
chance that mohnke would be prosecuted 
if anyone wanted to do it theyd have done it sooner said 
76yearold veteran charles daley who survived in the barn his leg 
blown off under a pile of corpses 
next month legislators are to vote on whether to allow the first 
war crimes trials in britain a government inquiry this year said 
there is sufficient evidence to charge three british residents 
former nationals of sovietoccupied territories with atrocities 
against jews

the us government announced thursday 
it was putting 14 panamanian companies and individuals on a trade 
blacklist including a former presidential candidate supported by 
gen manuel antonio noriega 
the blacklist prohibits any us company from dealing with the 
14 with a possible penalty of 10 years imprisonment or a 50000 
fine or both 
the move was announced in a press release by the us embassy in 
panama city and in a treasury department announcement published in 
the federal register in washington 
it was part of a continuing campaign by the us government to 
force the ouster of noriega who was indicted by two us federal 
grand juries last year in florida on drug trafficking charges 
noriega holds the real power in panama through his command of the 
panamanian defense forces 
former opposition presidential candidate guillermo endara entered 
the second day of a hunger strike to back his plea that panamanians 
refrain from gambling or playing the lottery in an effort to cut 
government revenue 
international observers say endara won last mays elections by a 
3to1 margin but the noriegacontrolled government nullified that 
vote and installed a provisional president 
carlos duque endaras main opponent and a noriega associate 
headed the list of individuals and companies residing in panama that 
are banned from doing business with us firms 
many panamanian companies do business with us operations such 
as the panama canal commission and the us southern command which 
has military installations in panama with about 14000 soldiers 
the united states has moved all its personnel on base and 
restricted off base movement 
washington imposed economic sanctions on the panamanian 
government early last year freezing its assets in the united states 
and barring us companies from paying panamanian taxes 
canal revenues due to go to panama were also frozen 
the treasury department blacklist is made up of associates or 
friends of noriega and will probably be expanded said a us 
official speaking on condition of anonymity 
noriega denies the drug charges and says us economic help to 
the political opposition in panama made fair elections impossible 
he says moves against him are part of a us plot to renege on 
its obligations to turn the panama canal over to panama at the end 
of the century

the environmental protection agency said 
thursday it halted enforcement against a polluting louisiana 
wasteburning plant for more than two years because it didnt want 
to damage a criminal investigation of the facility 
the epa action frustrated area parents whose children had a 
higherthanusual incidence of cancer the house government 
operations environment subcommittee was told 
the enforcement halt also stymied state officials who 
aggressively sought civil penalties against the marine shale 
processors plant near morgan city la louisiana officials found 
air water and hazardous waste violations at the plant 
edward e reich acting assistant epa administrator for 
enforcement said the agency declined to take action under an 
agreement with the justice department which believed that any civil 
enforcement could lead to dismissal of criminal evidence and other 
problems 
subcommittee chairman mike synar dokla said theres something 
fundamentally wrong with a system that allows violations for 
years to go unabated 
its unfair to the community to say that a pending criminal 
investigation means we cannot protect the safety of people he 
said 
the criminal investigation ran from november 1986 when the epa 
and fbi searched the plant to last july 24 when the company 
pleaded guilty to three pollution violations one felony and two 
misdemeanors and was fined 1 million 
the violations involved hazardous waste storage creating an 
obstacle to navigation and allowing contaminated storm water to 
enter a waterway 
reich said only an imminent health danger would have changed the 
policy and it didnt find one 
but rep w j billy tauzin dla who represents the 
district where the plant is located said there is a higher than 
average rate of child cancer in the area and a state study has tried 
to determine if the marine shale plant is responsible he said there 
is no conclusive evidence to implicate the facility 
marine shale processors is located along bayou boeuf part of the 
heavily traveled gulf intercoastal waterway system the facility 
burns hazardous waste producing a byproduct known as aggregate 
which is used as a substitute for gravel in road building 
robert c olde jr an attorney representing the company said in 
an interview there are no hazardous releases from the firms 
operation 
he said the company was not responsible for child cancer in the 
area saying he suspected chemical companies that have been 
dumping chemicals all around his region of louisiana 
were not making hazardous waste were trying to clean up 
hazardous waste he said we make a clean product 
state officials first discovered pollution violations beginning 
in august 1985 but were asked by the epa to place enforcement on 
hold while the criminal investigation continued according to 
elizabeth megginson assistant secretary of legal affairs for the 
louisiana department of environmental quality the state has has 
proposed 55 million in penalties against the plant 
under prodding by synar reich acknowledged that the agency only 
did routine inspections during the criminal probe out of concern 
that the criminal investigation not be interfered with he 
admitted the epa lacked hard data on health hazards 
i find that incredible youve been telling people for three 
years theres no imminent helath threat and you have nothing to back 
that up synar said 
tauzin told the panel i wish you could have seen the 
frustration of the families who believe epa let them down he 
said local residents from morgan city were traumatized by the 
lack of action because they couldnt get answers to why children 
are dying of cancer

the head of the farmers union rural 
solidarity proposed thursday the creation of a new political party 
an action that could splinter the solidarity movement 
though nominally independent the farmers union has battled 
alongside solidarity for eight years and backs its new parliamentary 
coalition its initiative to form its own party could augur the 
breakup of solidarity into more narrowly defined parties 
however solidarity leader lech walesa said in gdansk a variety 
of parties in poland was inevitable and that he was not disturbedhe 
said the proposal should be treated naturally 
in his statement rural soldarity chairman jozef slisz said the 
new party should be called polish peasants partysolidarity 
it is only the polish peasants partysolidarity that can 
abolish monopolies i believe that this party will help build a 
civil society he said in the statement printed in the 
prosolidarity gazeta wyborcza newspaper 
the new party would rival the existing united peasants party 
which rural solidarity criticizes for its long alliance with the 
communist party and its support of collectivation of private farms 
in the 1950s 
the united peasants party switched allegiance last month to 
solidarity creating the parliamentary bloc that allowed solidarity 
activist tadeusz mazowiecki to take over as prime minister on aug 
24 his government is the first east bloc admiministration led by a 
noncommunist since the communists consolidated control of eastern 
europe after world war ii 
rural solidarity members have been unhappy with their role in the 
new government the farmers union received only one post of 
minister without portfolio in the 24member cabinet despite its 
long alliance with solidarity 
sliszs statement implied criticism of how the new government was 
formed he said the countryside viewed with astonishment recent 
parliament reshuffles 
in this situation after due consideration i came to the 
conclusion that it is necessary to establish our own political 
organization he said 
he said that the united peasants party was not equal to the 
problems facing poland 
agriculture needs immediate changes however it is to delude 
oneself dangerously to believe that these changes can be effected by 
the renovated united peasants party a stalinist product established 
by the communist party to fight against private farming said 
slisz 
the people who earlier acted against the interests of the 
countryside will not cure its ills now he said 
united peasant party chairman dominik ludwiczak issued a 
statement read on state television thursday night saying mutual 
complaints and conflicts do not serve effective action he added 
one cannot blame currently active members of the party for 
mistakes of 40 years ago 
he suggested instead that farm leaders of all stripes hold 
meetings to work out their differences 
earlier thursday slisz told leading solidarity parliament 
deputies and senators about the plans for the new party the state 
pap news agency reported 
in response to fears that the caucus would break up into 
factions slisz promised that deputies or senators who join the new 
party will continue to operate as members of the solidarity caucus

federal investigators examined flight data and 
cockpit voice recorders thursday in an effort to find out why the 
pilot aborted takeoff of his usair boeing 737 the plane slid into 
new yorks east river killing two people 
national transportation safety board technicians displayed the 
recorders for reporters one machine was still dripping with water 
it had been removed from the crash site at laguardia airport 
the data recorder measures 70 functions in the airliner and its 
engines and should quickly provide clues to any problems that might 
have caused the pilot to put on the brakes and reverse engine thrust 
before the plane crashed late wednesday said board spokesman allan 
pollock 
the data recorder in the ninemonthold aircraft is 
stateoftheart and provides much more information than earlier 
models polock said 
the voice recorder was connected to a microphone in the cockpit 
and should have picked up the last 30 minutes of conversation among 
pilots and anyone else in the cockpit 
technicians said both of the tapes and recorders appeared to be 
in good condition 
content of the recorders is generally not made public before 60 
days but preliminary information that may give investigators some 
idea of any problems that existed could be available right away 
pollock said 
an investigative team remained at the crash site and other board 
personnel were attempting to interview passengers and members of the 
crew in new york 
according to safety board records 737s used by us carriers 
have been involved in 56 accidents since 1969 when the airliners 
were first produced more than 1700 of the planes have been built 
with 800 of the newer models on order said boeing spokesman george 
weiss 
a 737 model similar to the one that went off the runway in new 
york crashed jan 8 in england killing 44 people investigators 
have reached no final conclusion on the british midlands crash but 
they initially said that the pilot shut down his right engine after 
his left engine malfunctioned leaving the plane without power 
the accident led to inspections for crossedwires in warning 
systems in several boeing models 
four of the 737 crashes of us carriers have involved fatalities 
the worst was the jan 13 1982 crash of an air florida 737 that 
plowed into a bridge crossing the potomac river into downtown 
washington seventyeight people were killed in the accident which 
was blamed on the flight crews failure to ensure that ice had been 
removed from the wings 
an april 28 1988 the top ripped off of an aloha airlines 737 in 
maui hawaii sparking concern over aging and overused airliners 
one flight attendant was killed

a vatican statement calling for a convent 
at the edge of auschwitz to be moved has not changed the feelings of 
local residents who want the nuns to stay 
this is poland and they the vatican are very far away said 
an elderly man hoeing vegetables thursday in the welltended garden 
on the convent grounds adjacent to the walls of the former german 
death camp 
the nuns need to be here and nobody has the right to throw 
poles off polish soil said a woman who has worked more than 20 
years in a bookstore inside the camp under the cloisters shadow 
all the poles interviewed seemed wary and refused to give their 
names 
most said they had not heard of the vatican statement in rome 
monday it was not prominently reported in the polish media 
the 14 nuns of the carmelite order who in 1984 moved into the 
abandoned theater used by nazis as a storehouse during world war ii 
are at the center of a controversy that is straining catholicjewish 
relations 
mondays vatican statement appeared aimed at persuading the 
polish church to reverse its stand and honor a 1987 agreement 
between church representatives and jewish leaders to move the 
convent 
led by cardinal jozef glemp the primate the roman catholic 
church in poland has yet to officially react to the vaticans 
position 
glemp met wednesday in london with a british jewish leader and 
according to the state pap news agency further prospects 
surfaced for resolving the dispute 
solidarity prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki quietly asked fellow 
catholic journalist stefan wilkanowicz to help mediate the 
controversy 
wilkanowicz editorinchief of the monthly znak in krakow said 
on thursday the decision to move the convent has been settled in 
principle although many logistical and financial problems remain 
for sure the church in poland will make some moves now to solve 
this problem said krzysztof kozlowski assistant editor of the 
influential churchlinked tydgodnik powszechny weekly in nearby 
krakow and a national legislator 
but kozlowski said in an interview in warsaw on thursday that the 
feelings of jews about the convent are not very easy for the 
average pole to understand 
jews and some christians say the convent and particularly its 
large wooden cross do not belong in a place where 25 million jews 
were killed during world war ii 
they nuns are trying to take away our memories and even our 
cemeteries said zvi samharet an israeli guide at the camp 
thursday who was accompanying a group of children from israel 
jewish leaders in europe israel and the united states renewed 
appeals for the removal of the nuns this spring after the church 
missed a feb 22 deadline set in the 1987 agreement to move the 
convent to a prayer center away from the camp the prayer center has 
yet to be built 
meanwhile relations between polish catholics and jews have 
deteriorated 
tension escalated in july when a small group of american jews 
climbed over the convent fence to try to talk to the nuns workers 
in the convent poured water on the rabbi and his six students and 
dragged them off the premises 
the carmelites now have handlettered signs in english saying 
no trespassing and private property posted in the grass near 
their gate a st bernard patrols the perimeter of the convent 
the nuns seem determined to stay 
throughout the afternoon thursday several nuns worked in the 
vegetable garden tending flower beds or sweeping the front porch of 
the red brick building 
we dont listen to the radio we dont read newspapers we 
dont give out information we only pray said a nun who answered 
the door at the convent she then went back inside 
there are signs of continuing renovations bricks and lumber on 
the porch and a wheelbarrow and sand on the sidewalk 
the sisters are not going to move until they have someplace to 
go and they dont have it yet said a nun of another order 
waiting at a bus stop near the convent entrance 
if the cloister were inside the camp then maybe somebody could 
complain but they are outside the camp and they are praying for 
everybody whether they are christians or jews said the bookseller

daycare centers may be safer than home for 
avoiding childhood injuries a researcher said thursday suggesting 
that injury rates could be lower still with a little more attention 
to playground hazards 
parents have always had the bad news that kids in daycare are 
at increased risk of infectious disease said dr jeffrey sacks a 
medical epidemiologist at the centers for disease control in atlanta 
heres some good news for a change they are probably at less 
risk of injury and death from injury than they are when theyre not 
at daycare he said 
sacks and his colleagues studied 143 injuries among 5300 
children at 71 atlanta daycare centers between june 1987 and may 
1988 centers reported any injury that required medical or dental 
attention to the researchers whose study is published in fridays 
journal of the american medical association 
the researchers said that 354 percent of children in daycare 
could be expected to be injured at the center in a given year they 
extrapolated from their data that if children were to stay at 
daycare 24 hours a day 365 days a year 14 percent would incur an 
injury 
a typical injury rate for children in a community in one year 
is about 35 percent sacks said that suggests to us that 
children in child care are probably safer than when they are in the 
community at large 
an earlier massachusetts study reported similar findings the 
atlanta researchers did not specifically study children injured at 
home but cited previous research on their injury rates 
dr george stern a new orleans pediatrician said although he 
hadnt seen the new study there is a certain amount of logic to 
it 
in a wellsupervised daycare center the environment has been 
looked at for hazards probably more than in the average home said 
stern who edited a daycare manual for the american academy of 
pediatrics 
and many children who are at home do not get the amount of 
ongoing supervision as a child does in a daycare center he said 
in a telephone interview 
in the atlanta study most injuries 58 percent were caused by 
falls and 685 percent were head injuries the researchers said 
most injuries 54 percent occurred outside with outside accidents 
accounting for 76 percent of the most serious injuries the study 
said 
the high number of playground injuries could be cut with a few 
simple measures including the installation of impactabsorbing 
surfaces such as wood chips or sand sacks suggested 
playgrounds should be examined regularly for possible hazards 
such as equipment that is not stable he said 
as i drive by playgrounds i often see staff congregated 
talking to each other while kids play he said when a kid is on 
a playground its time for heightened supervision not less

and had her son gregory walking at her side when the gunfire 
erupted at a housing project in the east new york section of 
brooklyn 
the mother took cover with the children between two parked cars 
but casseus one of eight youths involved in the gun fight ran 
toward them grabbed gregory and then held him up as a shield 
he released gregory only when a bullet went through the boys 
chest penetrating his lungs and grazing his left arm as it exited 
casseus was shot in the leg and identified by ms alvarez at a 
hospital where he and the boy were treated

a visiting west german official 
said thursday that more than 500 east germans are camped out at the 
west german embassy in prague seeking free passage to the west 
peter glotz head of a visiting west german parliamentary 
delegation said many were determined to stay until their demands 
were met 
well over 500 refugees including 170 children and two pregnant 
women are camping out on the embassy grounds glotz told a news 
conference in prague 
there are very many young people and there are people who 
quite strongly say they will not return to east germany the 
official said 
the flood of east germans emigrating to the west through hungary 
continued thursday with 465 crossing into neighboring austria in 
the previous 24 hours austrian border officials said nearly 18000 
east germans have entered since hungary opened its western border 11 
days ago to the emigrants 
from austria the east germans are heading to west germany where 
they are granted automatic citizenship west german officials said 
304 arrived overnight 
most have cited east germanys hardline communist government as 
their reason for leaving 
in east berlin deputy culture minister klaus hoepcke was quoted 
in the youth newspaper junge welt as calling for an investigation 
into the causes of the refugee wave and social changes needed to 
stem it 
about 250 wouldbe emigrants last week accepted an east german 
offer of impunity and the chance to apply for legal emigration and 
left the prague embassy reducing the number there to about 150 
over the past few days however hundreds more have scaled the 
6foothigh fence around the compound 
many were reported to have come to the embassy after having been 
turned back at the hungarian border by czechoslovak authorities 
hardline czechoslovakia has condemned hungary for allowing the east 
germans to go west 
our delegation tried to urge a humanitarian solution in talks 
with czechoslovak officials and foreign minister jaromir johanes 
glotz said but at this point i cannot raise any hopes 
many east germans have told reporters in hungary and west germany 
that czechoslovak authorities were trying to prevent them from 
traveling to hungary reports have emerged of people illegally 
crossing from czechoslovakia to hungary by crashing through road 
barriers or swimming the danube 
czechoslovak officials denied the charges 
the hungarian news agency mti meanwhile said thursday that east 
german refugees who left for the west through hungary will be able 
to reclaim hundreds of cars they left behind 
it said 200 cars abandoned by refugees were previously returned 
to east germany but about 600 cars remain mti said they will be 
sent to austrian and west german motor clubs so refugees can recover 
them

the foreign minister said thursday 
he will meet with his british counterpart next week in new york to 
discuss restoring diplomatic and commercial ties severed at the 
outbreak of the 1982 falkland islands war 
it would be the first meeting between argentine and british 
foreign ministers since the 74day war in the south atlantic which 
left dead nearly 1000 people 
foreign minister domingo cavallo said his meeting with foreign 
secretary john major of britain will take place wednesday at un 
headquarters in new york 
cavallo will fly to new york on saturday with president carlos 
menem who is scheduled to address the un general assembly 
argentine and british diplomats are scheduled to meet oct 1718 
in madrid to discuss renewing diplomatic and trade relations 
such a move would in effect set aside for now the dispute 
stemming from their rival claims of sovereignty over the falklands 
the islands off argentina have been ruled by britain since 1833 
argentina claims it inherited the territory which it calls the 
malvinas when it declared independence from spain in 1810 
argentina invaded the islands inhabited by about 1800 people of 
british descent on april 2 1982 britain counterattacked and 
defeated argentina in a war that helped contribute to the downfall 
of the military junta that ruled from 1976 until raul alfonsin was 
elected president in 1983 
alfonsin who by law could not run for reelection was succeeded 
in july by menem who defeated alfonsins candidate cordoba gov 
eduardo angeloz in the general election

new doubts were raised thursday over prospects 
for the bush administrations strategy to reduce the 13 trillion 
third world debt burden as delegates from 152 nations began arriving 
for talks on global economic issues 
questions about world pollution political upheavals in communist 
eastern europe and china and the roller coaster ride of the us 
dollar were all expected to be addressed during the annual meetings 
of the international monetary fund and the world bank 
but the us debt plan unveiled last march by treasury secretary 
nicholas brady was the major topic on the agenda because resources 
of the imf and world bank are crucial to the success of the effort 
the administration found itself facing new questions about the 
brady plan after three of the largest us banks this week decided 
to set aside more than 4 billion in reserves to cover losses 
related to third world loans 
jp morgan amp co said thursday it was setting aside 2 billion 
to cover loan losses earlier chase manhattan corp the countrys 
third largest bank had said it was setting aside 115 billion and 
manufacturers hanover corp said it was boosting its loan loss 
reserves by 950 million 
the decisions will translate into big thirdquarter losses for 
all three banks 
the increase in loan loss reserves which are expected to be 
followed by other banks came after brazil the third worlds 
largest debtor with 110 billion in loans outstanding missed making 
a 16 billion interest payment this week 
banking analysts cited the brady debt plan as another factor 
driving banks to boost loan reserves under the plan banks are 
encouraged to forgive a portion of their loans to debtor countries 
in exchange for guarantees supplied by the imf and the world bank 
that the remaining debt will be repaid 
thus the brady plan forces the banks to formally acknowledge 
that they will receive less than full repayment on their loans 
executives at both chase and manufacturers hanover cited this as one 
reason for boosting their loss reserves 
last week final agreement on debt reduction terms was reached 
with mexico the first country to qualify for assistance under the 
brady strategy 
some banking analysts said they feared that the actions by major 
banks to boost loan loss reserves could be a signal that these 
institutions would no longer lend new money to third world countries 
paul getman an economist with the wefa group said that so far 
the only bank that is even considering making new loans to mexico is 
citicorp 
robert litan an economist at the brookings institute said the 
question of new money on the part of commercial banks was a concern 
and he said it pointed to the need for a commitment of much greater 
government resources to make the brady plan work 
the bush administration doesnt want taxpayer bailouts for the 
banks and they seem to equate substantial imf and world bank 
guarantees as the equivalent of a taxpayer bailout he said but 
i think you are going to need those kinds of guarantees on both old 
and new debt in order to move the program forward 
a treasury department official praised the decisions to boost 
loan loss reserves as a further move to realism by these 
commercial banks that we welcome and denied that the actions 
represented a threat to continued lending to debtor nations 
by strengthening their financial position banks really have 
more flexibility to participate in a broader range of options 
incluidng debt reduction or debt service reduction and new money 
said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
while both the imf and the world bank are expected to spend 
substantial time discussing the brady debt strategy analysts said 
they expected little to be committed in the way of increased funding 
imf managing director michel camdessus told reporters the mexican 
debt package offered encouragement to other debtor nations to push 
forward with negotiations with their creditor banks 
on the issue of assistance to hungary and poland camdessus told 
reporters that imf officials were holding discussions with officials 
of both countries aimed at providing assistance to support economic 
reforms in eastern europe 
the problems of china were also expected to be taken up at the 
meetings world bank president barber conable told reporters 
wednesday that he hoped to be able to resume lending to china soon 
seven loans totaling nearly 800 million were suspended in june 
following the confrontation between chinese troops and student 
protesters in tiananmen square 
before the opening of the formal sessions of the imf and world 
bank finance officials of the worlds seven richest countries were 
scheduled to hold talks all day saturday to review global economic 
issues 
the closeddoor meeting hosted by brady and federal reserve 
chairman alan greenspan will likely focus on efforts by the rich 
nations to stabilize the value of the dollar which has been rising 
for most of this year despite efforts by the united states and its 
allies to drive it lower 
the rising dollar threatens to derail the administrations effort 
to lower the huge us trade deficit a stronger dollar makes us 
goods less competitive on overseas markets and invites higher 
imports

a woman on life support died after a utility 
company disconnected power to her home instead of the house next 
door a company spokesman said thursday 
northern indiana public service co president gary neale said an 
employee was sent to disconnect a customers service in this chicago 
suburb because the bill had not been paid however the employee 
accidentally turned off the power to the sick womans home 
service was disconnected about 10 am tuesday and a relative 
notified the power company about a half hour later that power had 
been cut off and that lifesupport equipment was in use neale said 
a customer service representative working with the relative 
immediately initiated a call to dispatch an employee to the home to 
restore service neale said service was restored by 1110 am 
the woman described as in her late 50s or early 60s was taken 
to saint margaret hospital and health centers in hammond where she 
died about 3 pm 
we have expressed our sincere regrets and condolences to the 
customers family and offered any assistance we can provide neale 
said he said the electric company would pay for any medical or 
funeral expenses 
the accidental disconnection of service was a tragic mistake 
and we take responsibility for it neale said 
the womans name and medical condition were withheld at the 
familys request 
the woman was not on the companys life support registry which 
lists customers who use life support and medical treatment machines 
in their homes 
people on the registry get priority service whenever there is a 
power outage their meters are tagged and service is never shut off 
neale said 
because we had no record of the customers life support 
equipment the electric meter was not tagged had it been tagged it 
would not have been disconnected neale said

the defense departments planned 48 billion 
system for jamming enemy radar is seriously flawed and 
production of the joint navy and air force program should be put on 
hold a senator charged thursday 
i believe we have discovered a pentagon embarrassment and a 
potential waste of billions of dollars said sen david pryor 
dark 
the airborne selfprotection jammer under development since 
1969 is used to deceive or jam enemy radar and will be used on navy 
and air force fighters including the f14 f18 f16 and av8b 
the defense department plans production of 2369 jammers 
to date 577 million has been spent on research and development 
of the system 
pryor in a speech on the senate floor said unclassified navy 
documents quote testers as saying the system is marginally 
operationally effective in order to become potentially effective 
aspj effectiveness must be improved for all threats not meeting 
reference criteria 
the senator complained that further testing on the system is not 
planned until 1991 when more than 300 systems will have been 
produced or committed to production at 2 million a copy 
all arrows point to a multibillion dollar ripoff pryor said 
in a letter to the us comptroller general charles bowsher 
pryor asked that the general accounting office the investigative 
arm of congress review the testing costs and possible alternatives 
to the jammer system 
the defense department declined comment on the charges until it 
has seen pryors comments

jesus rides into jerusalem on a donkey instead of 
an ass in a new englishlanguage bible that is careful not to upset 
us readers the editor said thursday 
the old usage is a classic example of offense being caused in 
the united states for obvious reasons said roger coleman 
coordinating editor of the revised english bible 
in britain the word ass doesnt have as many meanings as it does 
in american use 
references to ass have been adjusted to the inoffensive and 
unambiguous donkey he said 
the change is one of thousands in the 1294page revision of 
the new english bible which appeared in 1970 and which in 
britain has largely replaced the authorized version or king james 
bible of 1611 and its late 19th century revised version 
coleman said american viewpoints reached the translators through 
the new york offices of the oxford and cambridge university presses 
which are jointly printing the new bible 
they came largely from people who want to use the bible 
literally with only the meanings they attribute to the words 
although a large number of americans are used to the authorized 
version where ass is used liberally coleman said 
the publishers describe the new bible as a linguistically updated 
version whose style relates less to the vocabulary of a 
19thcentury clergyman and more to the needs of a 20thcentury 
congregation 
it substitutes you for thee and thou did for 
didst and abandons the o in references to god such as o 
lord 
god is still referred to as he but without a capital h in 
faithfulness to the original writings coleman said but in other 
references to gender the version grapples with sexism for the first 
time in a britishproduced bible 
english is not too well equipped to express gender coleman 
told a news conference 
we carefully looked at all cases where maleoriented language 
was used men or brethren applied to people of both sexes and 
we used an inclusive gender term or adjusted the translation to 
sidestep the problem he said 
brethren becomes friends in some places and a man 
sometimes is changed to a person 
elsewhere corn has been changed to grain in many cases 
because it means wheat in some countries maize in others and oats 
in scotland 
william duff mchardy formerly regius professor of hebrew at 
oxford university the revisions director was asked why the 
phrase vanity of vanities all is vanity from the first 
chapter of ecclesiastes was changed to futility utter futility 
we discussed it for a long time he said vanity did not 
represent all that the original hebrew ought to represent but 
futility was the best we could do we still have slight misgivings 
morna hooker professor of new testament studies at cambridge 
university and the only woman among the revisers said if god was 
referred to as she it wouldnt be the bible which one must 
remember is 19 centuries old you must always stand at a slight 
distance from it 
scholars of all britains mainstream churches cooperated for the 
first time in the revision which took 15 years anglicans roman 
catholics presbyterians methodists baptists quakers the 
salvation army and the bible societies 
literary advisers included the poet philip larkin before his 
death in 1985 and novelist mary stewart 
lord coggan former archbishop of canterbury and a scholar of 
ancient hebrew who presided over meetings of the project committee 
said they aimed to produce the first fully ecumenical bible in 
straightforward language for reading in church that can be 
immediately understood 
the bible is one of the main tools of the christian church but 
tools get blunt and the edges need resharpening knowledge increases 
as the years go by language changes and style alters he said 
the new bible officially published sept 28 but already on sale 
will be used immediately in protestant churches but still needs the 
imprimatur license to publish of catholic authorities before 
their congregations can use it coleman said 
the revisers met in the jerusalem chamber of 900yearold 
westminster abbey where the compilers of the first revised version 
met from 1871 to 1881 
the work is being printed in a first run of 300000 copies for 
the englishspeaking world including 200000 for the united states 
said geoffrey cass chief executive of cambridge university press

vice president dan quayle joined conservative party 
leaders from around the world thursday at a meeting expected to 
focus on ways to help drives toward greater democracy in eastern 
europe 
quayle came to japan from a twoday trip to south korea where he 
toured the demilitarized zone and denounced communist north korea as 
an astonishing dictatorial regime 
he shares the spotlight at the tokyo meeting of the international 
democratic union with britains margaret thatcher who asked the 
west to give stronger support to reforms initiated by soviet 
president mikhail gorbachev 
british officials said prime minister thatcher and quayle had a 
halfhour meeting and discussed eastwest relations and cambodia 
where vietnamese troops began final withdrawal moves on thursday 
on saturday quayle will visit us military bases in japan with 
his wife marilyn next week he holds talks with prime minister 
toshiki kaifu and other japanese leaders before traveling to the 
philippines and malaysia 
the international democratic union founded in 1983 groups 26 
rightofcenter political parties and holds leaders meetings every 
two years representatives from 17 nations are attending this 
meeting with kaifu head of japans longgoverning conservative 
liberal democratic party acting as host 
the threeday conference ends saturday comments by idu officials 
and advance texts of speeches indicated a major theme would be moves 
toward greater democracy in such east bloc countries as poland and 
hungary 
a senior us administration official said that in quayles 
keynote speech at a luncheon friday the vice president will urge 
his fellow conservatives to help democratic forces in central 
america as well as in eastern europe 
in central and latin america the crunch is really coming 
now said the official briefing reporters on condition of 
anonymity 
andrew peacock leader of australias opposition liberal party 
said in a speech prepared for delivery friday that eastern europe 
is today at a watershed in its history and many states in the 
asiapacific region are also searching for a new strategy 
who would have thought when we established the idu in 1983 that 
we would six years on be witnessing such changes we must renew 
ourselves in the battle of ideas and lead the agenda 
peacock who is to become idu chairman said the organization 
should examine ways in which we can give practical assistance to 
those sympathetic parties that are developing in eastern europe 
south america asia and the pacific 
the outgoing chairman norwegian former prime minister kaare 
willoch told a news conference european conservatives have been 
traveling in eastern europe to make contacts with prodemocracy 
activists 
i think this is very important because through such contacts 
it is possible to help those groups fighting and working for freedom 
in eastern europe he said 
this is a very complicated issue because we all want to help 
and we know that some sorts of help may be counterproductive so 
thorough study of whats going on and what can be done are very 
useful 
willoch said it was premature to think of having eastern european 
groups join the idu since forming noncommunist political parties 
was still difficult 
mrs thatcher flies to moscow friday to meet with gorbachev she 
had lunch thursday with emperor akihito 
in comments to reporters she praised gorbachev as the most 
bold and courageous leader the soviet union has had while its been 
under communism what mr gorbachev is attempting to do is in 
the interests of liberty as a whole and in the interest of all other 
nations who believe in the cause of democracy as well 
we should do therefore everything we can to support this 
great historic movement 
mrs thatcher noted a trend in favor of western political and 
economic views but cautioned against relaxing defenses she 
predicted a period of very great uncertainty in eastwest 
relations and cited unexpected developments in china as a strong 
example

flight attendants had to throw seat cushions to 
passengers evacuated into new yorks east river after a usair 
jetliner broke apart in an aborted takeoff because the plane was not 
required to carry life vests a spokeswoman for the flight 
attendants union said thursday 
cindy yeast of the association of flight attendants said the 
aircrafts cabin crew was unable to open all exits as the floor 
buckled and the plane broke apart 
seat cushions on commercial aircraft are designed to float with 
enough buoyancy to support a person some flight attendants have 
been critical of rules that require inflatable life vests only on 
flights that spend appreciable time over major bodies of water ms 
yeast said 
as it became apparent the boeing 737400 carrying 61 people would 
not stop safely the attendants began yelling brace commands to 
get passengers to grab their ankles and put their heads down to 
reduce injuries she said 
the floor of the plane buckled up and down like a roller 
coaster ms yeast said based on information the union received 
from flight attendants and others 
some passengers were sent down an inflatable slide into the 
water others scrambled onto the aircrafts wing passengers in the 
water hung on to floating timbers and other debris untio rescued 
later ms yeast said flight attendants and the planes captain 
tried to use the slide as a raft as slides are designed to be used 
in a pinch to reach several passengers caught in the rear of the 
cabin as the plane sections filled with water but the slide 
deflated apparently punctured by debris she said 
the interior of the plane was dark and shifting in the current 
ms yeast said as at least one passenger yelled for help from 
behind a place where the floor had buckled all the way up to the 
ceiling that passenger and others were rescued but two other 
passengers died in the accident 
ms yeast said the pilot and last flight attendants stayed in the 
aircraft trying to free passengers and left only after rescue 
workers arrived and ordered them to evacuate 
when the flight attendants realized passengers were going into 
the water they ripped of seat bottom cushions and began throwing 
them out the door she said 
people were in the water for as long as 30 minutes she said and 
some started singing as they awaited rescue 
ms yeast identified the flight attendants on the flight as wayne 
reed jolynn galmish susan harrelson and kelly donovan all based 
in baltimore

a grand jury has indicted a federal drug 
agent his wife and the owner of a construction company on charges 
of conspiracy tax evasion and laundering large amounts of cash 
officials said thursday 
the federal indictment named drug enforcement administration 
agent dennis harker his wife mary ann and susan k terry who 
owns skt construction in west des moines 
ms terry was one of five recipients of the women of enterprise 
award sponsored by the us small business administration last 
year said william kutmus her lawyer shes a business partner of 
roxanne conlin a former us attorney and democratic gubernatorial 
candidate 
kutmus said she is a widow with two young children whose husband

the 11count indictment alleges that between 1986 and 1988 harker 
and his wife spent invested and profited by cash transactions 
exceeding 1 million 
kutmus said he had advised ms terry not to comment on the facts 
of the case but the charges themselves are ruinous to her and her 
business 
kutmus said he would enter an innocent plea at arraignments 
scheduled for oct 2 
she feels she is wholly innocent and that the charges are very 
ridiculous kutmus said 
harker and ms terry were charged with using a business they 
established to launder substantial amounts of currency which 
harker had acquired and to funnel the cash through what would appear 
to be legitimate business transactions and loans between the two 
partners 
the indictment also says harker loaned thousands of dollars in 
cash to other drug agents and spent more than 30000 in cash to buy 
rare coins 
there was no mention of drugs in the indictment and us 
attorney joe beck refused to elaborate on it 
harker 42 is a supervisory agent for the dea in miami who 
joined the agency in 1971 and previously was assigned to st louis 
and laredo texas before coming to live in west des moines he 
could face 40 years in prison and 2 million in fines if convicted 
on all the charges the harkers also could owe taxes and penalties 
mrs harker 40 faces up to 20 years in prison and 1 million in 
fines if convicted ms terry 38 faces up to 30 years in jail and 
fines of up to 15 million 
the us attorneys office said in a statement released thursday 
that the indictment was handed up wednesday it resulted from an 
investigation that began in spring 1988 as a result of information 
received by the fbi the statement said 
in the indictment harker was charged with one count of 
conspiracy three counts of tax evasion and four counts of using an 
interstate facility to promote illegal activity presumably the 
mailing of bundles of cash his wife faces a conspiracy count and 
three tax evasion charges 
ms terry faces three counts of arranging bank deposits to avoid 
a federal law that requires banks to report cash deposits larger 
than 10000 
the indictment details real estate transactions many in cash 
in texas florida california colorado and other locations 
farmland resort properties and homes were bought the indictment 
said 
the harkers filed returns for 1986 claiming taxable income of 
38999 but it actually was more than 416000 the indictment 
charged for 1987 the couple claimed just over 34000 but it 
really was nearly 680000 the indictment charged 
there was no mention of the source of the income in the 
indictment or accompanying statement

reduce injuries she said 
the floor of the plane buckled up and down like a roller 
coaster ms yeast said based on information the union received 
from flight attendants and others 
some passengers were sent down an inflatable slide into the 
water others scrambled onto the aircrafts wing passengers in the 
water hung on to floating timbers and other debris untio rescued 
later ms yeast said flight attendants and the planes captain 
tried to use the slide as a raft as slides are designed to be used 
in a pinch to reach several passengers caught in the rear of the 
cabin as the plane sections filled with water but the slide 
deflated apparently punctured by debris she said 
the interior of the plane was dark and shifting in the current

ceiling that passenger and others were rescued but two other 
passengers died in the accident 
ms yeast said the pilot and last flight attendants stayed in the 
aircraft trying to free passengers and left only after rescue 
workers arrived and ordered them to evacuate 
when the flight attendants realized passengers were going into 
the water they ripped of seat bottom cushions and began throwing 
them out the door she said 
people were in the water for as long as 30 minutes she said and 
some started singing as they awaited rescue 
ms yeast identified the flight attendants on the flight as wayne

the fbi said thursday it will not appeal a 
sweeping court order that sets in place mechanisms to end what a 
judge found was systematic discrimination against hispanic agents 
the decision against appealing the may 5 decision by a federal 
judge in texas was made by solicitor general kenneth starr the 
bureau said the fbi made the announcement after receiving word of 
starrs decision 
fbi director william s sessions said in a statement that after 
weighing the myriad legal operational and institutional 
considerations he recommended to the justice department that no 
appeal be pursued in the case 
sessions said the decision not to pursue the appeal is in the 
best interests of fbi employees we must move beyond the frictions 
caused by this case to address the many vital challenges facing the 
fbi in the 1990s 
the court order in the classaction suit by 311 of the bureaus 
approximately 400 hispanic agents directed the fbi to adopt changes 
to end the unsystematic excessively subjective method of 
promoting special agents 
in his order us district judge lucius bunton iii of midland 
texas stripped the special agents in charge of fbi field offices of 
the power to override decisions of career promotion boards 
that system the judge said was anathema to nearly every 
reform advanced by the bureau and ordered by this court to improve 
the fairness and reviewability of promotion decisions 
bunton also appointed an outside panel of three attorneys to 
conduct a casebycase review to determine if as many as 200 
hispanic agents should be promoted to compensate for past 
discrimination 
under the terms of the order the fbi can appeal the panels 
findings to the judge 
buntons order came as a result of more than two years of 
litigation in the classaction case in which he had earlier found 
discrimination against hispanics in promotions and working 
conditions 
the judge had found that hispanic agents were often relegated to 
undesirable assignments such as monitoring the wiretaps of 
spanishspeaking suspects in a criminal investigation 
since taking office in november 1987 sessions conducted a review 
of the fbis personnel and recruitment practices he reorganized the 
bureaus equal employment opportunity office going outside the fbi 
to recruit a manager of that unit who now reports directly to him 
in his order bunton acknowledged that the changes ordered by 
sessions demonstrate energetic and goodfaith effort to correct 
the disparities found by this court 
the suit was filed in early 1987 by bernardo mat perez the 
fbis no 2 agent in el paso the bureaus secondhighest ranking 
hispanic agent after he had suffered a series of demotions 
the judge ordered perez promoted to a job with responsibilities 
commensurate with his experience and training but denied any 
monetary damages or back pay to him or the other plaintiffs who 
eventually joined the lawsuit 
as a result of the court order perez was promoted to deputy 
assistant director of the fbis laboratory division in washington 
the fbi said 
the fbis decision not to appeal was praised by rep don edwards 
dcalif chairman of the house judiciary subcommittee on civil 
rights 
thats exactly the right decision something weve been urging 
for many months edwards said 
its time for them to move on and get at the root causes of the 
problems associated with perez and rochon the congressman said 
referring to a racial harassment suit by a black fbi agent donald 
rochon 
edwards called the rochon case a thorn in their side day after 
day 
rochon accuses the fbi of tolerating racial harassment by white 
agents of him and his family while he was assigned to the chicago 
field office 
the lawsuit also accuses fbi supervisors of retaliating against 
him for complaining of racial harassment 
david kairys rochons lawyer contended in a telephone interview 
this week that the justice department has filed a series of 
frivolous motions that he said were calculated to immobilize 
the court overseeing the case

boxer tony wilson won his fight in 
three rounds thursday night after his mother climbed into the ring 
and hit his opponent over the head with her stiletto shoe 
opponent steve mccarthy left the ring with blood seeping from a 
head wound as security officers ushered mrs minna wilson away 
when mccarthy refused to return referee adrian morgan raised 
wilsons arms in victory declaring mccarthy had retired 
uproar broke out among the 1000 spectators at the guildhall in 
this south english port where the british light heavyweight title 
eliminator fight between local boy mccarthy and wilson was being 
staged 
the furious crowd kicked and punched wilson before he escaped to 
a dressing room sheltered by his trainer and manager jimmy tibbs 
the first thing i saw was my mum in the ring and then 
everything went wild said wilson from wolverhampton central 
england 
she has been watching my fights for years and nothing like this 
has happened before 
police reinforcements were sent but no one was arrested and no 
one was reported injured 
the british domestic news agency press association quoted an 
unidentified senior police officer as saying we sent a large 
number of police officers when the problems first arose but 
thankfully the people there calmed down 
wilson later said the uproar was worse than the haglerminter 
fight at in london in september 1980 when american marvin hagler 
was bombarded with bar glasses after taking the world middleweight 
title from britains alan minter in one of the worst scenes in 
british sporting history

the soviet unions top policeman interior minister 
vadim v bakatin said 292 people were killed 5250 were wounded 
and 360000 had to flee their homes in ethnic violence since january 
1988 tass reported thursday 
bakatin reported on the magnitude of the problem on wednesday 
final day of a twoday meeting of the communist party central 
committee devoted to trying to resolve the countrys ethnic turmoil 
he said thousands of homes were robbed or burned down in the past 
20 months 
it has been months since soviet officials issued any nationwide 
statistics on ethnic violence unofficial counts had put the number 
of dead at slightly more than 200 and the number of refugees at 
about 200000 bakatin did not break down the statistics by ethnic 
groups 
the central committee passed a policy statement calling for the 
15 soviet republics to take on more economic and political autonomy 
including ownership of all natural resources but drew a line at 
calls for independence 
at the end of the longdelayed session the central committee 
accepted the retirement of ukrainian party chief vladimir v 
shcherbitsky former kgb chief viktor m chebrikov and viktor p 
nikonov from the ruling politburo 
in a major power play president mikhail s gorbachev also 
succeeded in promoting his new kgb chief vladimir a kryuchkov and 
economic planning chief yuri d maslyukov 
ethnic activists interviewed by telephone on thursday cheered the 
three retirements but said the development may not change official 
attitudes toward their demands for sovereignty 
everybody thinks it was a good riddance journalist tarmu 
tammerk of the newspaper kodumaa said of the reaction in the small 
baltic republic of estonia 
shcherbitsky 71 the last holdover from the 196482 era of 
president leonid i brezhnev was regarded as one of the politburos 
most conservative members he kept a tight rein on the ukraine for 
17 years 
he did not immediately resign as ukrainian party chief but that 
is likely when a central committee meeting can be held in his 
republic 
ukrainian activists said they did not know who might replace him 
and doubted whether his successor would pursue more moderate 
policies 
all the members of the ukrainian politburo are more or less 
like shcherbitsky even the younger ones said bogdan gorin a 
leader of the ukrainian helsinki group formed to monitor human 
rights in the soviet unions secondlargest republic 
gorin said in a telephone call from lvov he was disappointed in 
gorbachevs speech setting out his ethnic policy the speech smacked 
of old stereotypes that regard the country as being under a 
unified government rather than a federation of equal governments he 
said 
he started for the first time to threaten those political 
figures and organizations who are raising the issue of 
independence gorin said 
gorbachev said moscow would not tolerate anarchy in the soviet 
republics or separatist demagogues 
tonis avikson a spokesman for the estonian peoples front said 
his political movement found little new and nothing to worry about 
in gorbachevs speech for estonians the retirement of conservative 
politburo members was more important he said 
he said the activists particularly were pleased by chebrikovs 
retirement some people accused chebrikov of knowing beforehand of 
an attack by soldiers on a nationalist protest in the georgia 
republic twenty protesters were killed 
avikson noted that maslyukov who was promoted in the shakeup 
does not share the baltic republics enthusiasm for economic 
selfmanagement he takes a particularly hard line on the idea of 
transferring control of staterun enterprises from moscow to the 
republics avikson said 
maslyukov is not a big radical he said we have our 
differences with him but i think its possible to talk to him

portauprince haiti ap the secondincommand of the haitian 
communist party was released thursday after six days in jail and 
accused the military government of trying to kidnap him 
i escaped by the skin of my teeth the three police who 
broke into my courtyard wanted to kidnap me they roughed up the 
guard but he didnt have a key so they couldnt get into my house 
without making noise max bourjolly said after he and his guard 
were released from the national penitentiary 
bourjolly was arrested last friday several hours after his 
security guard jean wilfried herard had been taken into custody for 
illegal possession of an uzi submachine gun 
the kidnapping failed so they arrested me instead if the 
kidnapping had succeeded i might have been killed he said 
bourjolly admitted his guard did not have a permit for the 
weapon but said he had been targeted by the government because of 
my opposition to its economic policy 
on aug 29 the government of lt gen prosper avril decreed a 
series of tax measures that drew protests from politicians and labor 
leaders they claimed tariffs and tax hikes for small shopkeepers 
allegedly imposed by the imf would provoke social upheaval 
haiti one of the poorest countries in the western hemisphere 
recently negotiated a 265 million standby loan with the imf it 
owes the imf 41 million 
on monday bus horns honked and people beat on pots and pans in a 
15minute symbolic protest called by 18 organizations 
the six political parties including the haitian communist party 
and the centrist parties of louis dejoie jr and hubert de ronceray 
four labor unions and eight other groups threatened to call for a 
general strike if the government did not rescind the measures 
on thursday the haitian chamber of commerce said the measures 
might lead to a social explosion 
in a news conference last month bourjolly was the first to 
denounce government negotiations with the imf 
bourjolly 48 said he was welltreated during his week in jail 
although he claimed herard was beaten 
bourjolly was arrested twice during the duvalier regime and was 
jailed in the dreaded fort dimanche prison he was released and 
expelled from haiti in 1977 in a general amnesty of political 
prisoners after 13 months in jail

resort but the white house later said the situation was improving 
the marine radio band monitored on nearby st thomas said two 
looters had been shot in st croix the largest and most populous 
island of the chain however there was no word of their condition 
or independent confirmation

marshals and fbi agents that the us attorney general ordered to 
the island 
on thursday dozens of marshals with shotguns were posted in 
front of the downtown federal building while others patrolled the 
streets on foot 
one woman checking her destroyed yacht screamed insults at 
marshals when they aimed weapons at her apparently mistaking her 
for a looter 
go after the bloody criminals not the honest citizens she 
shouted 
territorial sen holland redfield said that in many cases 
supermarkets gave people permission to take the food because it was 
spoiling he said only a few looters were hardcore criminals 
people were reported carrying guns after widespread looting 
convulsed the island which still lacks water power and telephone 
service in the wake of hugos wrath 
there were new reports thursday that looting was rampant too on 
neighboring st thomas the second most populous of the us virgin 
islands and also a popular tourist site for americans 
hugo damaged virtually every building on st croix an island of 
53000 about 70 miles east of puerto rico authorities reported one 
drowning and hundreds were reported injured and thousands homeless 
chief warrant officer layton timmons of the virgin islands 
national guard who was at the airport watching mainland forces 
disembark said there were only 900 guardsmen in the us virgin 
islands 
he acknowledged that the coast guard had videotaped some 
guardsmen who had taken part in looting 
when two people start looting the whole guard gets the wrap 
thomas said dont condemn the organization i dont loot 
by late thursday it appeared most unprotected stores had been 
sacked and there appeared to be little left to loot 
the coast guard on wednesday began evacuating to puerto rico all 
people who feared for their safety a c146 transport plane with 70 
aboard mostly tourists arrived late wednesday at old ramey air 
force base in agua dilla about 75 miles west of san juan 
coast guard officials expected to bring up to 200 more people 
from st croix on thursday 
john curren a writer from washington dc said after stepping 
off the plane that mobs had established the law of the revolver 
by shooting and breaking into stores 
on st croix lt col ned longsworth spokesman for the 18th 
airborne corps from fort bragg nc said his units mission is to 
assist local civilian authorities in restoring order and protecting 
public and private property 
we will stay until the mission is accomplished he said 
in miami weary residents and tourists who arrived thursday from 
st croix said they armed themselves with makeshift weapons and 
watched in horror as looters rampaged through the island 
drew simpson of toronto told of forming a dynamic team with 
several dozen others who took refuge in a hotel outside of 
christiansted 
he said they used machetes to sharpen flag poles into spears and 
blocked roads to the hotels with trees and debris because of fears 
of potential violence 
once it became dark you really got spooked he said 
describing hearing weapons fire but he and others said they were 
not attacked by looters 
the first contingent of us military personnel landed at 740 
am edt on the island and moved quickly to establish a mobile 
control tower and prepare the airfield for the arrival of 1105 
military police said lt cmdr ned lundquist a pentagon spokesman 
by late afternoon thursday five aircraft carrying a total of 230 
people and 105 tons of cargo had arrived on st croix three more 
aircraft were en route with 120 people and 40 additional tons of 
cargo pentagon officials said 
longsworth said the rest of the soldiers were to arrive later 
thursday and friday he said most of the units consist of military 
police 
martial law has not been declared we are just here to assist 
local authorities we are authorized to make arrests only in the 
total absence of local authorities longsworth said 
by late thursday the helmeted heavily armed soldiers equipped 
with flak jackets and backpacks were still at the airport with only 
the federal marshals deployed downtown 
harry brandon head of the fbi in san juan said the fbi agents 
and federal marshals will help local authorities get back on their 
feet he said the fbis first priority was to stop the looting 
the looting is still going on brandon said i think that 
by the end of the day things will begin to return to normal 
in washington presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
the troops are having an obvious impact in controlling the looting 
and other lawlessness associated with the destruction it is 
impossible to say at this point how long they will have to be 
there 
he said the local officials of course are still in charge of 
law enforcement there 
another military spokesman fred hoffman said the troops had 
encountered problems landing on st croix because the small airfield 
was crowded and there were no night lights planes overturned by the 
storm littered the airport 
two guided missile carriers the stephen groves and the clifton 
sprague have been moved into the area as a precaution hoffman said 
the troops the first active duty military personnel sent onto 
the nations streets in 20 years were ordered by president bush 
wednesday night 
adm william j crowe chairman of the joint chiefs of staff 
said earlier thursday the troops had been issued rifles and told to 
shoot if necessary to defend themselves 
all told the troops would include 635 military police from fort 
bragg nc and 470 military police from companies in fort polk 
la fort hood texas and fort leonard wood mo 
generally the national guard is summoned to restore order in 
civil disturbances but presidents are allowed to use federal troops 
by declaring an emergency 
the last time federal troops were used to suppress riots was in 
1968 in washington dc and other cities after the assassination 
of martin luther king jr administration officials said president 
reagan authorized the use of troops in 1987 to handle prison riots 
in atlanta but they were never deployed

newspapers thursday identified 25 politicians denied us visas 
following days of rumors the united states has a blacklist of 
colombian officials on the payroll of drug traffickers 
nine bombs in bogota went off shortly after 3 am in nine 
offices of the governing liberal party and opposition conservative 
party another explosion damaged a savings and loan bank 
two people were injured in the blasts 
there have been reports the government has a list of politicians 
journalists army and police officials allegedly spying for drug 
cartels during debate this week senators asked the government to 
make the alleged list public but president barco has denied such a 
list exists 
a list was published in newspapers thursday naming 25 legislators 
and other politicians recently refused entry to the united states 
foreign minister julio londono paredes said he will ask 
washington for its blacklist 
we want to establish the context in which the information was 
made public he told reporters 
three senators claimed thursday they were denied visas for 
political reasons rather than links to drug traffickers 
liberal party presidential candidate alberto santofimio botero 
accused the united states of retaliating for his criticism of its 
intervention in latin america 
he claimed one reason he was denied a visa is that he met 
medellin cartel leader pablo escobar the most wanted man in 
colombia eight years ago at a political rally while both were 
congressmen but he said he barely knew him 
sen juan slebi also of the liberal party said this is part 
of the war the united states is waging in our country for us to 
submit to them on extraditions but i will never approve of the 
extradition of colombians to battle narcotraffickers 
the us embassy refused to comment on the list citing the 
privacy act embassy spokesman pablo urutia said he did not know if 
those denied visas are suspected of links to drug merchants 
barco declared war on the cocaine cartels after the aug 18 
assassination of leading presidential candidate sen luis carlos 
galan a staunch enemy of drug dealers barco then decreed emergency 
measures empowering him to bypass congress to extradite colombians 
to the united states 
only martinez romero accused of being the medellin cartels 
financier has been extradited top drug barons remain at large 
including escobar

the groom survived a plane crash but the wedding 
site was in the path of hurricane hugo which had just rendered the 
intended honeymoon resort a disaster area 
ive had everything possible go wrong with this wedding so 
far said tom newberry shortly after the crash of usair flight 
5050 the plane skidded off a laguardia airport runway into the 
water late wednesday two people died and 59 survived 
the flight was headed for charlotte nc newberry was going to 
wilmington nc on the coast 1 hours north of myrtle beach 
hes to be married there to connie bland on saturday 
unfortunately hurricane hugo was expected to arrive about midnight 
thursday 
the couple both 27 then plan to take a honeymoon 
youd laugh if i told you where said newberry virgin 
islands 
the caribbean resort has been declared a disaster area hugo 
passed through a string of islands sunday and monday leveling 
buildings killing 26 people and leaving 50000 homeless 
only once during the crash ordeal did newberry a new york city 
banker question if hed make it 
its not a pleasant feeling he said there were problems 
maneuvering the police boat and we got caught sort of sideways 
near the boat i was really mortified 
we just grabbed onto a big piece of floating wood and held on 
for dear life he said i was just hoping and thinking that if 
we just held onto the wood wed be alright surely some boat would 
come get us we were all screaming bloody murder at whoever was up 
on the runway 
those aboard knew what was coming about 30 seconds before the 
crash newberry said 
everybody was kind of grim and just got down he said 
there was no indication given that there was going to be a crash 
everybody just knew it 
barely three hours later newberry seemed quite calm as he spoke 
to reporters hed already called his fiancee twice 
east river water doesnt taste real good he recounted my 
shoes are at the bottom right now along with all my clothing 
newberry got off the plane via an emergency slide next he had to 
figure out how to get to north carolina at last report he was 
planning to drive

secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
said thursday the dominican republic el salvador and equatorial 
guinea are so far behind in their dues they risk losing their vote 
in the general assembly 
the un charter says any nation two years behind loses the right 
to vote in the assembly 
the assembly may let the country vote if it is satisfied that 
failure to pay is due to circumstances beyond the countrys control 
the dominican republic which is assessed about 224000 
annually must come up with 223600 to keep its voting rights said 
the un chiefs letter 
el salvador assessed more than 74000 annually must pay 
12057 and equatorial guinea assessed the same must pay 46300 
to keep their votes 
when a small impoverished nation has been unable to pay in the 
past its former colonial power or a major ally quietly paid the 
dues 
south africa is also in arrears but has refused to pay since the 
general assembly suspended its voting rights in 1974 as punishment 
for its racial segregation policy if its voting privileges were 
restored south africa would have to pay more than 35 million to 
regain its vote 
dues are based on a formula that largely relies on a nations 
gross national product 
the united states still owes more than anyone as of aug 31 
america was 2788 million in arrears for past years and owes more 
than 216 million for this years dues bringing the total close to 
500 million 
the united states is assessed for onefourth of the regular un 
budget about 216 million a year 
president reagans administration began withholding a large 
portion of the us dues starting in 1985 to spur reforms and budget 
cuts at the world body reagan announced a year ago he was satisfied 
with un progress along these lines and authorized full payment of 
us dues and payment of all back dues on a sixyear plan 
congressional committees refused to pay back dues this year 
citing constraints imposed by the us federal budget deficit

a protein found in the brain of alzheimers 
patients has been located elsewhere in their bodies and that may 
lead to better diagnosis and treatment of the disease that afflicts 
2 million americans 
the protein deposits appear in several tissues including the 
skin and intestines indicating they may come from an unknown 
substance that circulates in the blood said dennis selkoe 
codirector of the center for neurologic diseases at brigham and 
womens hospital in boston 
if so finding ways to block delivery to the brain may help in 
fighting alzheimers disease he reported today 
but he said it is too early to know if such an approach would be 
useful and another scientist said the research provides only 
suggestive evidence for the idea that the protein deposits come from 
a bloodborne source

people who sleep wearing contact lenses face 1015 
times the usual risk of potentially blinding eye ulcers researchers 
warned today 
but many eye doctors already discourage patients from routinely 
wearing their lenses to bed 
you significantly increase the risk of complications when you 
wear any contact lens overnight and the more nights you wear it in 
a row the greater the risk said dr ronald e smith of the 
university of southern california 
socalled extendedwear lenses are designed to be kept in the eye 
for several days at a time when approved in 1980 they were 
recommended for use up to one month but because of concern about 
complications the us food and drug administration reduced the 
limit last may to one week

a very upset auto industry predicts many 
more recalls will result from the swift collapse of a bush 
administration plan to let carmakers meet pollution targets by 
averaging vehicle emissions 
a house subcommittee removed the averaging plan from the 
presidents clean air bill wednesday in a unanimous voice vote that 
shocked a standingroom crowd that expected a closely divided tally 
the vote means the bush bill would require each car sold in this 
country to pass antipollution requirements for hydrocarbons carbon 
monoxide and nitrogen oxide current law has the carbycar 
requirement but the bush plan would make the standards tougher to 
meet 
tim maccarthy of the auto industrys motor vehicle manufacturers 
association said the new standards would be too tough for each car 
to meet after theyre driven for several years

the nasty boys a tough antidrug police unit 
with a penchant for breaking down doors and manhandling drug 
dealers touts the motto we make house calls 
thats the plan tonight when the tv version of the drug busters 
visits homes across america nbc 911 pm edt 
television crews spent several weeks here last spring putting 
together a twohour movie they hoped might evolve into a new series 
this fall 
the show failed to make nbcs series schedule but producer dick 
wolf hopes the nasty boys may still achieve that status if the 
public reacts well to the movie 
the show with hollywoods usual poetic license is based on the 
activities of a crack antidrug unit formed by the north las vegas 
police department last year to fight the citys growing drug problem 
the nasty boys an elite band of undercover cops wage a high 
profile battle against the citys drug dealers breaking into crack 
houses while wearing black ninjatype outfits and masks to hide 
their identity 
city officials say the nononsense approach using tactics 
befitting the groups name is paying off by making a dent in the 
drug problem 
wolf whose credits include coproducer of miami vice and 
executive consultant on hill street blues sees nasty boys 
as the first of the 90sgenre cop shows 
we want to tell the story that there is literally a war going 
on against drugs wolf said this is unapologetically 
propolice this is proattitude that this drug problem has got to 
stop 
shooting locales ranged from a cemetery to crack houses to 4 
million mansions there were helicopter shots along the las vegas 
strip and shooting in and around the las vegas hilton hotel and 
casino 
the idea was brought to wolf after a segment on the antidrug 
unit was featured on the reporters tv show the nasty boys had 
allowed a reporters camera crew to follow them around on some 
drug raids 
they showed me this picture of the nasty boys with their 
masks ninja outfits and exotic weapons posed against a brick wall 
covered with graffiti wolf recalled i told them this is a 
hit show 
wolf said he took the idea to brandon tartikoff president of nbc 
entertainment in midjanuary and received the green light 
network executives did not see the finished version before 
setting the fall schedule wolf said 
therell be some touching stuff some stuff with families 
wolf said it will show how five guys with diverse backgrounds are 
molded into this very special team 
it is exploitative in a most positive way these cops are 
heros weve stayed away from gory violence there are no gratuitous 
killings 
these guys are waging a war but theyre not vigilantes 
theyre good cops they use weapons most police wouldnt use but 
theyre facing guys who do the same theyre not up against guys who 
play by the rules 
wolf admits to use of poetic license in developing a nasty 
boys story line in the movie six members of a police tactical 
team are killed by drug dealers and the citys mayor orders 
formation of a group to handle the drug problem by using some of the 
enemys tactics in fact no such incident spawned the group 
there is no name star in the show the five principals play cops 
who are used to being free agents and must now learn to work as a 
group 
a brother of one of the team members is dirty obligated to 
the mob because of what else gambling debts his involvement 
puts members of the team in jeopardy and wolf isnt tipping his 
hand on the outcome 
the actual nasty boys team members are used in some of the 
scenes including a mock raid that was staged for the cameras

on saturday night james earl jones a tony 
awardwinner will portray rev vernon johns an early civil rights 
activist in alabama a docudrama sort of but its from cbs news 
not the networks entertainment division 
the dramatization appears on saturday night with connie 
chung a new series whose executive producer andy lack ran the 
west 57th series that chungs series succeeds 
he calls the new effort a contemporary you are there 
thats the cbs news series of the 1950s that with walter cronkite 
anchoring recreated such historical events as lincolns gettysburg 
address 
but theres a difference 
chung says the technique her show uses is that of the warren 
beatty film reds which in telling the story of john reed an 
american radical interspersed interviews of people who knew him 
the first half of saturdays show will use that technique she 
says cbs wouldnt provide a tape of the show for advanced 
screening but the balance is apparently devoted to interviews 
concerning the modern relevance of johns urging his middleclass 
black congregation to fight their complacency and stand up for their 
rights johns died 24 years ago 
lacks new venture comes at a time old network strictures against 
recreations in news programs are easing at least in nbcs 
yesterday today amp tomorrow 
but saturdays show is not lacks first recreation for a news 
program 
he did it in 1983 with the plane that fell from the sky a 
cbs reports special about a jetliner that plummeted 33000 feet 
before its pilots regained control 
in that reenactment he used the planes real crew and 39 
passengers from the nearfatal flight but his use of an actor 
however distinguished in a news series has raised eyebrows among 
news traditionalists 
some like abcs sam donaldson oppose recreations in general 
saying that no matter how responsibly and honestly done they cause 
questions in the minds of viewers about what is real and what isnt 
lack says there wont always be recreations on chungs show 
but were certainly not shy about them and well do them often 
asked how he would respond to critics of recreations in a news 
program he responded this program speaks for itself it needs no 
defense or explanation 
for that matter he says he finds debate over rerecreations 
academic pointless foolish i think its just dumb 
chung says she doesnt feel uncomfortable about dramatizations 
at least the kind that will be in her show not one bit she 
says youll see very clearly how it works i think it works 
beautifully 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in addition to chungs series lack is working on an outside 
project commissioned by cbs entertainment a proposed dramatization 
about hedda nussbaum and her role in the muchpublicized beating 
death of 6yearold lisa steinberg in new yorks greenwich village 
two years ago 
lacks wearing of two hats as a cbs news producer and as an 
independent producer of a show for cbs entertainment is unusual but 
not unprecented 
in 1977 nbc made a formal effort to combine a news producers 
experience and background in making entertainmentdivision 
docudramas the network set up what proved to be a shortlived 
experiment headed by the respected news and documentary producer 
robert shad northshield 
the unit had no involvement with nbc news neither did 
northshield while he headed the unit he was on loan from the news 
division no projects were ever made and northshield moved on to 
cbs news 
lack says his cbs news colleagues have no problem with my work 
outside the cbs news division he says he believes everyone here 
knows where my heart is in news but im allowed to dabble in other 
areas from time to time without it threatening the institution 
the story of hedda nussbaum would seem ripe for a dramatization 
her lover joel steinberg was sent to prison last march for killing 
his illegally adopted daughter lisa nussbaum who had observed the 
childs abuse for years but said she had also been beaten by 
steinberg testified against him and charges against her were 
dropped her life with steinberg and her failure to prevent lisas 
death brought her both public sympathy and condemnation 
no script has been written for the nussbaum program yet and the 
proposal is still in discussion stages lack said he declined to 
say if nussbaum is being paid for her story i have nothing to say 
about that he said

they called in a statement for review of christian policies and 
theological formulations seen by jews as erosions of earlier 
positions that were theologically more forthcoming and politically 
more sensitive to jewish concerns they also said jews need a 
more effective instrumentality that can conduct a wideranging 
dialogue with christian counterparts 
we hope to advance constructive relations between us and 
international protestant catholic and christian orthodox bodies

one of the most intimidating threats to peace of 
mind is a congress searching for new sources of revenue because 
somewhere somehow someone will have to pay 
the threat is all the more real because in this if not in other 
matters congress mind seems to be made up never on details 
perhaps but on the general idea that government forever will need 
more money 
in ways most people do not understand proposals for tax cuts 
become tax increases and whenever a tax decrease escapes into law 
it is thereafter stripped of all its benefits leaving little more 
money in taxpayers pockets 
throughout the 1980s tax cuts have been eroded by subsequent 
increases some of them imposed with little publicity why because 
they appeared almost insignificant at the time but as they say 
little increases do add up 
consider the economic recovery tax act of 1981 it promised 
corporate tax reductions averaging 51 billion in the years 198789 
but by 1986 says the tax foundation this reduction became a 
20 billionayear increase 
somehow such things happen when congress goes rummaging through 
the tax code and it may happen again as your neighbors might tell 
you it is one of the most fearsome things that can happen to good 
americans 
the latest tax goround probably was initiated by president bush 
who proposed that capital gains taxes the kind imposed on 
investment earnings be cut substantially from as high as 33 
percent to as low as 15 percent 
to do so he said would raise revenue for a couple of years at 
least because lower taxes would encourage people who owned stocks 
to redeem them for cash and thereby declaring their capital gains 
and paying their taxes 
besides he suggested it was only fair such investments involve 
risk he observed the benefits from such investments are delayed 
rather than immediate and much of the tax is imposed on inflated 
rather than real returns 
some members of congress rebelled saying such a cut would be a 
gift to the rich and could not be permitted the rich should be 
taxed more they said and so they proposed a tax increase which 
congress is now considering 
in such manner has a tax cut generated the threat of a tax 
increase 
seldom however is any tax matter as open clear and 
understandable as that in the past congress has actually passed 
taxes it never meant to pass and has ommitted items it thought it 
had included always there are surprises 
in the recent tax increase proposal for instance the emphasis 
is on making life more expensive for the rich even though the 
definition of rich is highly suspect 
in tax logic for instance a person who never made 20000 a 
year but who through lifelong discipline may be rich for the one 
year in which the funds are redeemed is defined as rich and so 
taxed 
somehow in this latest proposal the matter of private pension 
funds was introduced they have lots of money 2 trillion or more 
so it wasnt askew of tax reasoning to go after them 
and so the suggestion is being made why not tax these taxexempt 
entities every time they are involved in a shortterm securities 
trade 
typically the rationale being offered is not that congress wants 
more money but that those pension funds should be investing for the 
long term too much of america it is said is thinking shortterm 
this will help correct it 
it could do more than that it could become the foot in the door 
or if you prefer the nose of the camel in the tent that is more 
could follow drawn irresistibly by the vast possibilities of such 
vast sums of money

at the science lab in midtown manhattan the same 
studio where irving berlin composed standards keyboardist david 
frank and singer mic murphy churn out funk 
dont disturb this groove and youre in my system wont 
make anyone forget blue skies or white christmas but frank 
and murphy whose songs have climbed the charts arent complaining 
neither are phil collins phillip bailey stevie winwood chaka 
khan and nona hendryx some of the artists who have received help 
songwriting or production from the twoman funk band appropriately 
called the system 
one day the phone rang and i woke up and picked it up frank 
recalled mic said i know what the name of the group should be 
he said the system i said i dont like that i thought it should 
be more colorful the next morning i called him and woke him up and 
said i liked the name 
that was in 1982 frank and murphy had just met written a song 
in times of passion and persuaded atlantic records to release 
it one problem what should they call themselves the 
frankmurphy project was definitely out it sounded too much 
like an albumrock band murphy considered fiberglass and this 
record itches before thinking of the system and phoning frank 
it has so many meanings its political the body a manner of 
the way things work together we can go on i was thinking dave is 
from boston and im from jamaica queens i used to say we are 
america we have the whole spectrum on the east coast murphy 
said 
names matter frank and murphy insist when they start writing a 
song the title often comes first music and lyrics are filled in 
thats why ballads are rare for the system working titles such as 
groove and youre in my system just dont seem right for 
slow songs neither do midnight special nor wicked tracks 
off their new album rhythm amp romance 
a lot of times well fit things together frank said the 
beatles used to do exactly the same thing lets just take this 
bridge and inject it into this song 
their childhoods had little in common except a love for music 
frank grew up in the roxbury section of boston literally on the 
wrong side of the tracks 
i lived at the edge of town frank said and wlib was the 
only rampb station in the boston area and only during daylight hours 
right when we crossed into our town id be listening to my mothers 
car radio and it would fade out and wed get a top 40 station from 
baltimore 
while frank had to fumble with the radio dial to hear the music 
he loved rhythm and blues was practically in murphys backyard the 
local barbershop was owned by the father of future funkadelic 
guitarist eddie hazel and several other aspiring funk stars eddie 
martinez marcus miller and ronnie drayton were in the 
neighborhood 
i was in bands when i was 10 or 11 murphy recalled 
little mic and the soulshakers we played a lot of social clubs 
and dances at the time my parents and their friends went to these 
clubs and because we were the only young kids who had a band we got 
to play every weekend 
people would say theyre so cute we were getting paid 50 
bucks a night wed be the midnight floor show wed play all the 
new songs and the audences loved it we were like the local jackson 
5 
frank meanwhile was being groomed for a more highbrow career 
studying classical piano at the new england conservatory and 
berkeley college of music rock n roll won out but he did not 
forget his early training 
it affects the way i think of music frank said ill refer 
to a song as a concerto a vocal concerto 
thats what happened with dont disturb this groove murphy 
added thats the first movement soul to soul on this album is 
the second movement 
the sytem has other influences including the rolling stones sly 
and the family stone parliamentfunkadelic and led zeppelin frank 
and murphys musical tastes ranged so wide they at first had no 
idea into which radio format or formats their songs would fit 
wed never been on a chart frank said i looked at the 
label and saw our names as producers and thought so thats what 
producuers do we didnt have any plan in mind we just did it were 
getting paid more money than we had ever gotten before

the federal agency that polices the commodity 
markets has been called a snoozing watchdog since scores of chicago 
traders were indicted for fraud this summer but its top cop says 
the charges show the system works 
you wouldnt have had the results you had without our 
involvement in this said dennis klejna enforcement chief of the 
commodity futures trading commission 
klejna reluctantly agreed to an interview to talk aobut the work 
of the commission which is under congressional review for 
reauthorization of its authority it faces extraordinary scrutiny 
partly because of a major fraud scandal in the freewheeling 
commodity pits of chicago 
more than 40 traders and brokers at the chicago board of trade 
and the chicago mercantile exchange were indicted in august the 
result of a 2year undercover investigation in which fbi agents 
posing as traders taped conversations 
to congressional critics the scope of the indictments suggested 
that the defendants had used the commodity pits as their personal 
profiteering club and that the commodity commission had been lax in 
detecting and stopping it 
yes a lot of people were indicted klejna said i guess 
people can say thats a large number and there may be more 
potentially we dont know that yet or at least were not going to 
comment on it 
but klejna pronounced clayneh said the chicago indictments 
should not be seen as a sign of weakness but rather as a sign of 
strength 
the commodity commission is an independent agency that oversees 
13 futures markets in chicago new york and other cities much like 
its sister agency the securities and exchange commission which 
oversees the stock and bond markets 
while it considers the exchanges and their rules as the first 
line of defense against fraud the commodity commission is 
responsible for keeping the futures markets fair 
klejna a 42yearold lawyer with prematurely gray hair knows 
about that strength first hand he has been with the commission 
almost from its creation by congress in 1974 
he was an officer with the armys judge advocate general corps 
when he read about a new federal agency seeking lawyers 
a 1971 law school graduate from fordham university in his native 
new york klejna joined the commission as a staff attorney in august 
1976 and rose to special counsel in 1978 deputy director of 
enforcement in 1981 and director since april 1983 
this past week he was one of several senior federal agency 
executives who received the presidential award for distinguished 
service 
fiscal year 1989 was one of the most challenging and active 
years in the history of the commission the agencys 1991 budget 
proposal for congress says but to klejna theyre always busy 
years 
to get to his sixth floor office in downtown washington visitors 
must thread through a maze of receptionist desks and crowded 
computer work stations that suggest the commission is outgrowing its 
space 
klejnas corner office reveals little of the man who oversees the 
commodity police force there is a large desk and table some chairs 
and an american flag in one corner two works of art decorate a 
wall both of them framed posters one from the american ballet 
theater 
among the many undisclosed details of the chicago probe is 
whether the commission uncovered the wrongdoing first and alerted 
the fbi or vice versa the commission has no criminal authority and 
can seek only civil sanctions for trading violations tapping its 
enforcement staff of 140 half of them lawyers 
i do think you could say they are attempting an enormous job 
with inadequate resources and that there is no question of the 
integrity and concientiousness of that division said alton 
harris a prominent chicago lawyer and expert on securities and 
commodities regulation 
having said that however i think there are substantial 
questions as to whether they have their priorities properly 
aligned harris said a number of market problems he said are 
best left to rulemaking procedures and interpretative guidance 
rather than enforcement or disciplinary actions 
that sentiment seems to be shared by several commodities lawyers 
just a few weeks before the indictments were announced klejna 
was a panelist at an american bar association function in chicago 
and not one but two defense lawyers that were on that panel 
talked about how trading abuses had gone on all the time and whats 
the big deal klejna said 
he said the lawyers also questioned the appropriateness of 
prosecuting traders for what had been seen in the past as 
essentially parking ticket violations 
but to klejna they are still illegal 
in july klejna announced that a new yorkbased commodity futures 
trading concern and three affiliates had agreed to pay a record 4 
million to settle allegations of fraud in cocoa contracts 
this year klejna also concluded what he called the largest 
antifraud sales solicitation case the commission ever brought with 
lawsuits against two commodity options firms 
they were accused of misleading customers on investment risks 
that ran up millions of dollars in losses over five years while the 
firms took hefty sales commissions 
klejna has appeared uncomfortable in the glare of television 
lights his voice trails off behind a thicket of microphones and he 
masks emotion with a stern face 
despite his ill ease with publicity klejna says it will be 
worthwhile if he shows the high level of commitment and 
professionalism from the enforcement program at this agency which 
has been doing its job all along

the national farmers union and agriculture 
secretary clayton yeutter would agree that profitable familyowned 
agriculture is a noble dream of american farmers 
but the nfu has its own ideas how best to achieve mastery of the 
agricultural dream machine and yeutter has a few of his own 
theyre not alone 
many other agricultural and commodity organizations individuals 
analysts and special interest groups of all sorts are jockeying for 
position as congress works on the 1990 farm bill to replace the 1985 
law 
and yeutter is not the only one who has a say in what the bush 
administration wants in the 1990 bill trade policy budget 
requirements white house political nitpicking and dozens of other 
factors litter the road ahead 
yeutter has said repeatedly that the administration doesnt have 
its specific farm bill proposals ready for congress but hopes to 
outline those by the end of the year 
but a look at some of nfus legislative desires and a few of 
yeutters ruminations might help a bit to clarify some of the 
thinking as farm bill debate unfolds 
earlier this month about 150 nfu members from 16 states mainly 
in the midwest and great plains participated in a twoday 
flyin to washington that included brisk lobbying treks to 
capitol hill 
the current farm law the food security act of 1985 covers a 
multitude of programs from conservation credit and fish farming to 
food stamps rural development research and trade 
but the heart of the 1985 law and its predecessors for more 
than half a century is the array of commodity programs that 
provide federal price supports and related benefits for milk sugar 
wool and major crops such as wheat feed grains cotton rice and 
soybeans 
among other things the 1985 law gave the agriculture department 
more discretionary authority in administering commodity programs 
including reductions in some of the price support benefits a goal 
supported heartily by the reagan administration was to help make 
us products more competitive in foreign trade 
supporters of this approach say the 1985 law has been successful 
in this regard the nfu disagrees 
low farm prices are not the answer to our problems says nfu 
president leland swenson low prices are the problem 
in letters to members of congress swenson and nfu vice president 
michael v dunn said farmers and consumers alike are all 
interested in promoting the sustainability of our natural resources 
promoting the sustainability of our communities and ensuring a 
stable safe food supply 
the nfu is proposing a 10point legislative list that features 
a voluntary supply management program based on using bushels or 
other units of production instead of acres to control crop output 
it also would encourage participation in the program by offering 
farmers higher price support loan rates and higher target prices for 
base levels of crop production these are key items that the 1985 
farm law allowed to be reduced 
the nfu says a bushelbased system of supply management would 
allow the government to better predict farm program costs and give 
farmers income protection without sacrificing crop rotation 
flexibility 
yeutter also thinks there should be more flexibility for farmers 
to rotate crops and have more management control 
a primary objective for the price and income support elements 
of the new farm bill should be to reduce the rigidity of present 
programs yeutter told the american soybean association in july 
one proposal called the triple base plan would limit crop 
deficiency payments under the target price formula a subsidy 
making up the difference between the market price and the target 
price for a specific crop to the existing base acreage or a 
portion of it farmers could then plant other crops on the remainder 
without losing any of their acreage base 
flexibility is not just a backdoor way to cut target prices 
as some have labeled it yeutter said even though budget 
constraints must be addressed in all 1990 legislative proposals 
greater flexibility should and can be achieved because it is the 
right thing to do 
the nfu wants congress to include in the 1990 farm bill a 
statement that would reaffirm policy designed to foster and 
sustain the family farm system of agriculture 
it also would recognize that the objective is to ensure that 
us consumers have ample quantitites of domestically produced 
nutritious safe and reasonably priced food and farm products such 
an objective is longterm and nonnegotiable 
one of the paragraphs according to nfu should declare that the 
1990 farm bill must enhance promote and be fully supportive of 
the family farm structure and must avoid measures which would be 
detrimental to familyscale operations 
at a white house news conference on sept 15 yeutter was asked 
about his role and the usual perception of farmers that the 
secretary of agriculture is their champion 
yeutter said he intends to be a champion for the interests of 
american agriculture and believes that he can be as vigorous and 
effective as anyone who has ever held the job 
but im not always the champion for some of the programs that 
some would prefer to be enacted into law he said the 
question is what does one champion and im going to be the champion 
of agricultural programs that i believe are in the best interest 
the best longterm interest of american agriculture

nancy mckeon was so frightened the first time 
she read the script for a cry for help the tracey thurman story 
that she couldnt look at it again for a week 
the nbc movie to be broadcast monday tells the story of a 
connecticut woman who in 1983 was permanently crippled and almost 
killed by her estranged husband after police ignored her pleas for 
protection 
it was a scary story for an actor to do mckeon said but i 
also felt it was too important to let go i talked to tracey and 
that convinced me to do it 
for a woman whos gone through all that tracey is very 
strong said mckeon she has a great perspective on things 
people need to see that someone who went through that can come back 
and have a positive attitude people need to see theres someone 
that strong out there 
the attack in which thurman was stabbed 13 times and suffered a 
broken neck left her partially paralyzed thurmans lawsuit against 
the torrington conn police prompted reforms in police response to 
domestic violence there 
they told her shed never walk but she can walk her left side 
can work but has no feeling her right side does not function and is 
hypersensitive her 3yearold son watched while his father did this 
to his mother hes still trying to get through those feelings 
mckeon said 
this is not a fun movie people are going to watch it and see 
parts of their own lives in it 
the tracey thurman story which stars dale midkiff as the 
husband buck and bruce weitz as thurmans attorney is the first 
time mckeon has been on the screen since the end of the facts of 
life in 1988 
i took a year off and turned down everything she said id 
been on the show for eight years and every hiatus id done a movie 
ive never had any time off i needed time to get some things into 
perspective 
i traveled i spent a lot of time with my family when youre 
working everything else has to take second place you dont want it 
that way but your work comes first i love to work i could work 
all the time i had to force myself to take time off 
mckeon had been scheduled to star in a television series based on 
the hit movie working girl but quit the show 
she cited personal reasons for leaving the show scheduled as 
a midseason replacement for nbc she was to play tess mcgill the 
role that brought melanie griffith an academy award nomination 
harris katleman president of twentieth television corp said in 
a statement that a new actress would be cast in the role mckeon 
will remain under contract to twentieth to develop a television 
series 
mckeon has been working as an actress since she was 2 her 
brother philip was on alice and now divides his time between 
acting and working as an assistant director 
i grew up in queens so i feel at home in new york she said 
we lived in forest hills and when they still had the tennis 
tournament there some of us kids ran a parking concession wed save 
spaces on the street and charge 5 those were my hoodlum days 
philip and i did commercials and modeling in new york he was 
in a couple of plays i was 12 when philip got alice and we moved 
here i didnt work for a long time because nobody knew me then i 
started doing things for aaron spelling like starsky and hutch 
the love boat and fantasy island i started facts of life when 
i was 14 
mckeon came into facts of life when it was revamped at the 
end of the first season she played jo the tough kid from the bronx 
i think they thought id play off well against blair who was 
spoiled and rich she said i wasnt too enthusiastic about 
doing it i thought id only have about a half a line a show then 
when i got the script i saw it was a character i could play

its not quite a replay although it comes close 
president bush is accused of timidly yielding the diplomatic 
initiative to moscow but insists he isnt going to be pressured into 
hasty offers on arms control 
when that script was written only last may bush produced the 
ending silencing his critics with a proposal for conventional arms 
cuts in europe that upped the soviet ante now the complaints are 
about footdragging on strategic arms reductions 
theres no hint that the administration has a september surprise 
ready to match its springtime comeback but the white house does 
control the agenda and that carries with it the power to undercut 
democratic attacks on bushstyle diplomacy 
it happened before less than four months ago with the same cast 
and similar dialogue bush got the last word and democratic leaders 
had to switch overnight from complaints to applause 
in both cases soviet officials also criticized the 
administrations diplomatic pace this time 10 days before his 
thursday meeting with bush soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze said the administration had been restrained indecisive 
and timid in arms talks 
the white house called that complaint mystifying 
senate democratic leader george mitchell of maine said monday 
that bush must reach beyond the status quo thinking that appears 
to dominate administration policy 
he must cast aside the ambivalence the hesitation and the 
timidity and adopt a more energetic and engaged policy toward the 
soviet union and eastern europe mitchell said the 
administration appears to have become complacent about the arms 
control process trusting that the soviets will do the work and 
provide the results 
secretary of state james a baker iii dismissed mitchells 
comments as political talk when the president of the united 
states is rocking along with a 70 percent approval rating on his 
handling of foreign policy and i were the leader of the opposition 
party i might have something similar to say he said 
baker and shevardnardze are spending the weekend in jackson hole 
wyo discussing arms control and other ussoviet issues 
now will we conclude a treaty in wyoming the answer to that 
is obviously no baker said i think if you will judge us at the 
end of the day hopefully next sunday that you will agree that 
weve moved the process forward substantially across the full range 
of our arms control agenda 
he said that includes strategic arms reductions chemical 
weapons and longstalled negotiations on nuclear testing baker 
said he also hopes the soviets will move toward acceptance of bushs 
proposal that both sides cut their conventional forces in europe 
that was the us proposal that stilled the earlier round of 
criticism after months during which the soviets seemed to be 
outmaneuvering the new administration soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev announced unilateral cuts in troops and weapons in the 
east scoring public relations points in western europe while bush 
was silent awaiting a review of us policy 
at home the democrats complained about the presidents pace but 
bush turned that around at the end of may proposing conventional 
arms cuts with solid allied support at the nato summit in brussels 
he said the offer put the united states on the offense and tested 
soviet intent we may be at an important turning point in history 
one in which the security environment in europe can be 
transformed sen mitchell said at the time 
now the cycle is recurring with a new agenda 
bush said anyone who thinks the administration is reluctant to 
move forward on strategic arms talks is misreading his intent 
perhaps because the conventional arms proposal was his first 
priority 
were working inside our own administration to have proposals 
that i think will capture the imagination of the soviet union 
bush said monday he didnt say when 
i think we have to be careful not to become frantic and rush 
out here to negotiate a treaty on strategic arms or anything else 
for that matter that would be nonratifiable baker said the 
president said he was in no rush to stage a summit meeting with 
gorbachev 
and hes calling the plays

ethel flippen was diagnosed with cancer in 
january but a daily 160mile round trip from her home to a hospital 
was daunting and so was the cost of a hotel for the week of 
radiation treatments 
flippen of emporia wasnt the only one faced with the dilemma 
we were having patients call us from out of town saying they 
needed transportation into richmond for their radiation therapy and 
we were finding that these people were coming from long distances on 
a daily basis said norma rawls of the local american cancer 
society 
financially it was hard on them physically it was hard on 
them 
the society turned to the metro richmond hotel and motel 
association which began offering patients free room and board 
about a dozen including flippen have taken advantage of the offer 
since the program began in march 
ive had one patient tell me that she would not have been able 
to get her radiation therapy had it not been for the hotel lodging 
program said rawls this is true of most of these patients 
they could not afford to stay in a hotel monday through friday for 
eight weeks 
flippen who underwent 25 radiation treatments at massey cancer 
clinic of the medical college of virginia hospitals has stayed at 
four of the two dozen participating inns if it hadnt been for 
the hotels and motels i guess i would have just died she said 
to see them come together on something like thisto do 
something good for the community in a very competitive industry is 
something very special said jim b poppell executive director of 
the societys state chapter 
weve talked to a lot of our counterparts across the country 
and we know of no other program where its being made available at 
no cost to patients 
each of the participating hotels agree to provide two weeks of 
complimentary lodging a year referrals come from social workers 
hospitals and oncologists such as dr dean goplerud at the medical 
college of virginia 
the typical patient will have treatments of four or five weeks 
they often feel tired and may suffer a loss of appetite diarrhea 
and nauseau he said the reason they require a place to stay is 
because many of them live a long distance from richmond and have to 
come in every day for treatment they get tired out from the long 
drive 
if free lodging werent available goplerud said hospitalization 
or missing treatments would be the only options for some patients 
some would continue to commute back and forth and feel miserable 
richmond area hotel rooms range from 40 to 90 a night said 
robert m ramsey executive vice president for the virginia and 
metro richmond hotel amp motel associations which are helping other 
groups set up similar programs 
its going to be a natural for these other organizations to 
pick up on this for us this made sense he said it was a very 
positive thing to do

food engineering students cooked up 800 
pounds of popcorn in an effort to combat the toothjarring plague 
that afflicts popcorn lovers everywhere upks also known as 
unpopped kernels 
there are two basic problems that appear to cause an increase 
in upks and a decrease in popping volume shelling of the kernel off 
the cob and the moisture content of individual kernels at the time 
of popping said steven eckhoff a food engineer at the university 
of illinois at urbanachampaign 
during the summer food engineering students using a movie 
theater popper found that unpopped kernels were most likely those 
that were too moist or too dry large kernels at the butt of an ear 
of corn have the highest moisture content small kernels near the 
tip have the lowest 
it follows then that companies could process kernels of 
uniform size to decrease the number of unpopped kernels the 
university said 
the researchers also found that if a kernels outside covering is 
damaged when kernels are removed from the cob steam cant build up 
inside the kernel that also creates those dreaded upks 
were looking at ways to precondition the corn to loosen the 
attachment of the kernel to the cob so you wouldnt need as much 
mechanical force eckhoff said then you wouldnt damage the 
kernels so much 
the research was funded by beatricehuntwesson foods parent 
company of popcorn maker orville redenbacher

on the bookcase behind biologist jim 
milestones desk at crater lake national park is a reminder that the 
national park service is gravely concerned about geothermal 
development just outside the park 
the park service was so concerned that drilling for heat left by 
a volcano might rob the lake of clarity that it paid more than 
600000 for a series of dives to look for hot springs it also 
focused attention on deep lakes long the neglected stepchildren of 
oceanography 
it is finally begining to sink in that gee if we really want 
to know this planet weve got to get down under not only the oceans 
of the world but the fresh water as well said sylvia earle an 
oceanographer and head of deep ocean engineering the maker of deep 
rover a oneperson submarine 
it awaited the last couple of years a couple of crafty 
oceanographers the park service and an issue concern about 
geothermal development to awaken people to how much we did not 
know earle said 
in august oregon state university oceanographers jack dymond and 
bob collier led 23 dives 13 seeking hydrothermal activity five 
for geological samples and five studying biology to the floor of 
1932footdeep lake 
theyre convinced hot springs exist but didnt find conclusive 
proof they will spend a year on a report to help determine whether 
crater lake stays on a list of national parks with significant 
thermal features if it does interior secretary manuel lujan could 
block geothermal development to protect the lake 
what dymond and collier did find were mysterious blue pools of 
dense salty water on the bottom laden with carbon dioxide and radon 
fluffy orange mats of ironeating bacteria elevated temperatures in 
rock anchoring the bacteria and rustcolored spires resembling 
stalagmites 
at the deepest point of the lake park biotechnician mark 
buktenica found tiny craters and a midge fly larva 
last year earle found ordinary green moss growing at the 
freshwater record depth of 725 feet part of it is the clarity of 
the water but i think there may be more to it than that said 
oceanographer bruce robison of the monterey bay aquarium research 
institute 
indian legends ascribe the formation of crater lake to a battle 
between llao god of the underworld and skell god of the surface 
world geologists date the cataclysmic eruption of mount mazama to 
6850 years ago the volcano collapsed leaving a caldera that 
filled with rain and melted snow and became a world standard for 
lake clarity 
scientists became concerned that the lake was losing clarity and 
in 1982 congress ordered a 10year study the clouding appears to 
be cause by growth in the population of microscopic plants called 
phytoplankton the park service discounts a theory that nitrates 
from a septic system on the rim were feeding the plankton but is 
going to remove the system anyway 
california energy co filed leases just outside the park in the 
winema national forest and in 1986 began drilling in search of 
geothermal energy the company says it would be impossible for its 
work to affect the lake 
dymond began studying the lake in 1984 we found these unusual 
chemical and temperature variations at that time 
findings of a helium isotope he had seen in conjunction with 
ocean hot springs bolstered the theory that hot springs could be 
bubbling up through a crack ringing the lake bottom producing heat 
and salts that stir up the lake 
a remotecontrolled submersible made five dives in 1987 on one 
dymond and collier saw what looked like a plume of smoke curling up 
from a crack but they failed to get a temperature reading or a 
water sample for proof 
they returned last year for the first dives in deep rover 
navigation problems plagued them and after 17 dives they were 
unable to claim more than encouraging evidence this year a system 
called ultrashort baseline acoustic navigation which uses sound 
waves from four ground stations to locate the sub in three 
dimensions cured the echo problems 
on aug 19 collier piloted deep rover to a depth of 1400 feet 
in the south basin where hydrothermal explorations were 
concentrated and poked a probe into a bacterial mat where it 
registered 61 degrees fahrenheit 
three days later navigator james cooley of land and sea surveys 
peered into the colored plots on his computer screen and directed 
dymond back to the area where he found a temperature of 639 
degrees fahrenheit in another mat 
the temperatures met the us geological survey test for a 
thermal spring 18 degrees higher than the mean annual air 
temperature at the surface which is 378 degrees the water at the 
lake bottom is 383 degrees 
so it is a thermal spring in some sense said usgs engineer 
manuel nathenson in menlo park calif whether its a significant 
thermal feature as required by law is a judgment call by the 
secretary of the interior 
california energy geologist joe lafleur is skeptical and suggests 
that any flow at the lake bottom comes from cold mineral seeps 
certainly an objective scientist would have to appreciate that 
nothing they have found would have any significant effect on the 
lake he said 
though the bacteria mats suggest something is flowing dymond and 
collier couldnt see it or devise any way to measure it they hope 
other data will show some fluid seeping through bottom sediments 
one significant finding was made by ray weiss a geochemist at 
the scripps institution of oceanography at the university of 
california san diego whose team measured the amount of freon in 
the water at the bottom of the lake and found it had been at the 
surface just three years ago 
nathenson said it appears the lake is like a layer cake with the 
top layer turning over like a normal lake in the spring and the 
fall and a series of thinner layers mixing from one to the other to 
the bottom in this way oxygen works down from the top and heat and 
salts work up from the bottom 
dymond said the blue pools one of which he dubbed llaos 
bathtub could be the source of unexplained salts found in the lake 
those found in the south basin have no apparent source others found 
on the north side of the lake appear to be fed by tiny streams that 
pop out from under rocks 
excited by their successes dymond and collier are talking about 
expeditions to other deep lakes first on their dream list is lake 
baikal in siberia the deepest in the world at 5315 feet 
we are continually amazed collier said at how little is 
known about deep lakes

japans trade ministry is considering tax incentives 
for companies that boost imports as a way to correct its 52 billion 
trade surplus with the united states officials said 
we realize that japan accounts for half of the total us trade 
deficit and therefore we are trying to vigorously increase our 
imports yuzuru hatakeyama of the ministry of international trade 
and industry told reporters wednesday 
hatakeyama director general of the international trade policy 
bureau said the ministry is considering a plan to grant special tax 
incentives for importers 
during japans industrial buildup after its defeat in world war 
ii incentives granted to exporters allowed them to reduce their 
taxes by from 1 percent to 3 percent of the value of their exports 
the system was discontinued in 1964 
hatakeyama said the government is considering a similar system to 
promote imports the tax breaks would not extend to importers of raw 
materials he said 
japan is under pressure from the united states to increase its 
imports and institute other economic and trade policy changes to cut 
its surplus 
earlier this month the two countries began a yearlong round of 
bimonthly talks on structural impediments to trade in each nation 
and us officials have said they expect measurable improvement 
in the trade imbalance by next spring 
japan also has been named along with india and brazil as a 
possible target of retaliation under us trade laws for policies 
that allegedly hinder the sale here of supercomputers lumber 
products and satellites 
us commerce secretary robert a mosbacher in a threeday visit 
to japan last week welcomed the idea of tax incentives to japanese 
importers as a farreaching method of increasing imports and cutting 
the trade imbalance 
total japanese imports have risen 165 percent in the first eight 
months of this year and imports from the united states have 
increased by 199 percent from the same period last year the trade 
ministry says 
the senior trade official said the proposed tax breaks are not 
likely to be implemented until next spring at the earliest since 
parliament would have to approve legislation 
but hatakeyama admitted the tax breaks could take even longer 
because of political uncertainties 
plagued by a series of scandals and an unpopular new sales tax 
the governing liberal democratic party lost its majority in the 
upper house of parliament in july for the first time in 34 years 
a general election for the more powerful lower house must be held 
by next summer 
it is not clear whether the proposed tax incentives would be 
legal under rules of the international trade body known as the 
general agreement on tariffs and trade 
but we hope no countries would complain about this scheme 
hatakeyama said

the securities and exchange commission and 
italys securities market watchdog have announced a tentative mutal 
assistance agreement 
the announcement wednesday came in a joint communique issued by 
sec chairman david s ruder and franco piga chairman of the 
commissione nazionale per la societa e la borsa consob 
the communique covered only the exchange of information between 
the two agencies 
it was issued at the 14th annual conference of the international 
organization of securities commissions in venice which ruder is 
attending in one of his last official acts before stepping down at 
the end of the month 
the communique was described as an interim understanding 
between the two agencies to provide the fullest mutal assistance 
permitted by law or regulation in their countries to exchange 
information that will help each agency oversee markets conduct 
investigations and prosecute wrongdoers in their own jurisdictions 
it is in the best interest of all nations to expose and 
prosecute those who would abuse the integrity of the securities 
markets the twopage agreement said 
it noted that italian transactions in us corporate securities 
grew from about 269 million in 1985 to 18 billion in 1988 
conversely us transactions in italian corporate stock increased 
from about 457 million to some 656 million over the same period 
both agencies contemplate that it will be a preliminary step to 
a more expansive and comprehensive memorandum of understanding 
after they obtain the legal authority to do so the communique said

ford motor co the us automaker with the 
largest and longest presence in europe wants more 
during the past two weeks ford has acknowledged it is holding 
talks with the swedish car and truck maker saabscania ab and has 
started acquiring up to 15 percent of jaguar plc of england 
ford may be positioning itself in the european luxury car market 
as it gets ready for the evaporation of trade barriers among the 12 
members of the european community in 1992 analysts said wednesday 
i think they want to move their image a little up market in 
europe analyst mary anne sudol of fitch investors service inc 
said from new york they really have been a massmarket producer 
and never have been regarded as having some specialities 
and theres a benefit for jaguar too said analyst scott merlis 
of morgan stanley amp co in new york 
ford could help jaguar with product and technology he said 
ford has declined to describe the nature of its talks with saab 
some analysts have speculated that ford is interested in saabs 
heavy truck business an area where ford is weak in europe 
fords heritage in europe dates back to the early years of this 
century company founder henry ford started the automakers european 
connection in 1903 by exporting cars to england from the united 
states five years later ford opened an office in france the 
companys first overseas branch 
the continent has been important to ford not only as a car and 
truck market but as a base for its earnings during the past two 
years profits from fords european operations have risen to 146 
billion last year while north american earnings have fallen 
ford which has a number of european assembly plants isnt the 
only us automaker moving to increase its presence in europe before 
1992 
robert lutz president of chrysler motors corp the 
vehiclemaking arm of chrysler corp said wednesday that the no 3 
us automaker has developed a network of 770 dealers in europe the 
company recently introduced usmade versions of the dodge spirit 
and plymouth acclaim to the european market he added 
he said chryslers european sales would reach 100000 annually in 
a few years while thats far behind fords 17 million in european 
car and truck sales last year it marks a return to the european 
market for chrysler 
chrysler sold its european plants more than a decade ago when it 
encountered financial trouble that led to a us government bailout 
in february it announced it would return to european production 
through a joint venture with frances renault to build a 
sportutility vehicle now named the jj at plants yet to be 
disclosed in europe and the united states 
general motors corp sold 145 million vehicles in europe last 
year through its general motors europe subsidiary in zurich 
switzerland gm began exporting us cars to europe in 1911 and 
started making cars on the continent in the early 1920s it now has 
seven assembly and 30 component plants in europe 
gm owns all of group lotus plc of britain and has a european 
joint truck venture with isuzu motors ltd of japan 
us automakers must have assembly capabilities in europe when 
the trade barriers fall in about two years sudol said 
it will be a fortress europe and if they have no manufacturing 
over there they will have to jump over a high tariff wall she 
said

the nations major airlines are pondering whether 
they should match an american airlines proposal that would raise 
some discount fares by more than 15 percent and double cancellation

the increases proposed by american one of the largest carriers

effort by airlines to partly recoup revenue lost from bargain fares 
offered this summer to fall vacationers 
spokesmen for competitors of dallasbased american said wednesday 
those airlines were considering matching the increases but hadnt 
decided 
i think there are several carriers out there that are inclined 
to match said edward starkman an airline analyst at the 
investment firm painewebber inc 
under americans proposal the popular maxsaver cutrate fare 
often used by vacationers which must be purchased 14 days in 
advance would be increased by 10 to 20 per round trip a 
maxsaver ticket on american between dallas and los angeles for 
example would go from 338 to 358 round trip the maxsaver 
tickets would remain nonrefundable 
in addition american would raise fares on sevendayadvance 
tickets by 30 to 60 round trip the same dallaslos angeles round 
trip ticket bought seven days in advance would go from 378 to 438 
the penalty for changing or canceling a reservation would double to 
50 percent of the ticket price 
were trying to get the yields up said john hotard a 
spokesman for american 
an airlines yield which reflects the average revenue from 
passengers for each mile flown is the lifeblood of the competitive 
air transport industry 
starkman like many industry analysts is expecting little 
improvement in yields overall for the rest of the year and into 1990 
in midaugust the airlines announced steep fare cuts for the 
fall extending summer travel bargains they slashed roundtrip 
fares by as much as 160 to lure passengers in the historically weak 
autumn season most fares to europe were reduced by 100 into next 
spring 
last week in an effort to recover some of the losses the 
airlines boosted supercoach oneway fares by about 20 for a 
oneway ticket these fares are favored by business fliers because 
they have more lenient advancepurchase requirements than cheaper 
discount fares and dont require a saturdaynight stay 
spokesmen for united airlines continental airlines delta air 
lines northwest airlines usair pan am and eastern airlines said 
wednesday those airlines were studying americans proposal but 
hadnt decided if they will match it 
if they dont follow suit it would be difficult for american to 
raise the fares alone and remain competitive but hotard said the 
airline planned to go ahead next week in any case 
american also announced wednesday an increase in service from 
miami to become a larger competitor in that market historically 
dominated by eastern which has been hobbled by a prolonged strike 
americans efforts to buy easterns latin american route network 
recently collapsed when eastern decided not to sell it but american 
officials said the airline would seek government approval for routes 
on its own

chase manhattan co has become the second major 
us bank this week to strengthen itself against problem third world 
debt reflecting a growing realization among bankers that the money 
lent years ago may never be fully repaid 
in a major recapitalization plan announced wednesday chase said 
it would add 115 billion to its loanloss reserves in the third 
quarter and issue 500 million in new common stock the move is 
expected to result in a loss of more than 1 billion in the quarter 
manufacturers hanover corp said monday it would add 950 million 
to its reserves and also issue up to 500 million in common stock 
but unlike chase it is raising muchneeded capital by selling a 
controlling interest in its financial services unit cit group and 
a 49 percent equity stake to daiichi kangyo bank ltd of japan 
the worlds largest bank for about 14 billion 
chase said it would have an aftertax charge totaling 126 
billion in the third quarter which would result in a net loss of 
112 billion for the period chase said it didnt have an earnings 
estimate for the full year 
for the first six months of 1989 chase earned 269 million or 
257 per share vs 501 million or 553 a share a year earlier 
included in chases aftertax charge is the 115 billion 
addition for the loanloss reserve an 85 million charge reflecting 
the lower value of problem real estate assets in chases arizona 
banking subsidiary and a 25 million charge relating to securities 
trading activities 
the basic core earnings of the bank have been going well but 
they have been masked by these three drags chairman willard c 
butcher told a news conference 
butcher said the actions would eliminate a current aftertax 
earnings drag of about 200 million a year this will result in 
chase entering the 1990s with renewed financial strength and 
enhanced earnings potential he said 
chase with 100 billion in assets is the second largest us 
bank behind citicorp which has assets of more than 210 billion 
the chase announcement came after the close of trading wednesday 
on the new york stock exchange chase was up 162 at 3950 a 
share before trading was halted late in the day 
some industry analysts predicted the market would act favorably 
to chases actions 
its a big step for chase said james j mcdermott jr of 
keefe bruyette amp woods by stepping up and taking a big hit and 
getting the problem into a different zone its going to allow for 
greater focus on its core earnings base 
with the big charge chases total reserve for possible credit 
losses at the end of the third quarter will be about 37 billion 
this includes about 29 billion for loans to developing nations 
or about 46 percent of chases total 62 billion of medium and 
longterm loans to third world countries the ratio had been 26 
percent 
the major new york money center banks generally have loan loss 
reserves equalling roughly a third of their outstanding third world 
loans chases new reserve ratio will lead the pack 
major banks have been under increasing pressure lately to boost 
their reserves to cover third world debt in the aftermath of the 
recent mexico debt agreement and the plan by treasury secretary 
nicholas brady that emphasizes bank forgiveness of these accounts 
this action resulted from our ongoing review of economic and 
political conditions and our belief that recent developments 
including the brady initiative have resulted in increased pressure 
on banks to reduce their claims and an increased resistance on 
the part of some lesser developed nations to meet their contractual 
obligations butcher said 
he said the pressure has become apparent in the nowcompleted 
mexican negotiations and the negotiating positions announced by 
other countries 
chases new stock issuance amounts to about 14 million shares as 
of june 30 chase had 902 million common shares outstanding 
the charge involving the arizona subsidiary reflects the 
continuing economic downturn in the southwest by establishing the 
provision for the real estate loans and foreclosed property chase 
anticipates improvement in the core earnings in that area aftertax 
losses for the first half of 1989 for that subsidiary totalled 30 
million 
chase said it lost 25 million after taxes in the first half from 
securities trading it said the thirdquarter charge reflected its 
decision to get out of marketmaking in british government bonds and 
us mortgagebacked securities

adobe systems inc is hoping to keep apple 
computer inc from stealing its thunder in a battle over typefaces 
that has the computer industrys biggest names choosing sides 
adobe said wednesday it would take the unusual step of making 
public some valuable technical information about the way its 
postscript software creates letters numbers and other figures on a 
page 
that step while helping adobes competitors should confirm the 
adobe system as an industry standard and deal a blow to a joint 
effort by apple and microsoft corp to create a new standard 
analysts said 
the seemingly obscure battle will affect the course of desktop 
publishing which makes it possible for personal computer owners to 
create professionallooking documents and publications using special 
software and laser printers 
john warnock adobes chairman chief executive and cofounder 
announced the decision to publish postscript specifications in an 
emotional speech at a conference in san francisco 
he said he feared apples unspecific plans for new software 
amounted to vaporware that could jeopardize a valuable existing 
standard 
steve jobs of next inc lined up on the side of adobe at the 
seybold computer publishing conference and exposition while bill 
gates of microsoft sided with apple 
this is like a soap opera its melodrama at its best bill 
mcglynn marketing manager for the boise printer division of 
hewlettpackard co said in a telephone interview from the 
conference 
an agreedupon standard makes things easier for makers of 
computers printers and new typefaces as well as computer users 
with adobes announcement companies that already use postscript may 
decide to stick with it instead of spending their efforts on the 
applemicrosoft plans analysts said 
a lot of people think this is a very good move said david 
nelson an analyst at shearson lehman hutton inc he said customers 
attending the conference overwhelmingly indicated in a show of 
hands that they would stick with adobe 
adobes stock was hurt wednesday by the applemicrosoft 
combination which came after the close of trading tuesday but 
helped by adobes counterploy it closed the day off 37 cents at 
1975 in overthecounter trading 
adobe of mountain view calif rose rapidly in recent years to 
dominate the software that goes into laser printers and controls 
their output 
apple which had been adobes biggest customer signalled its 
intention to go its own way earlier this year when it sold its 16 
percent stake in adobe 
apple and microsoft which are battling each other in an 
unrelated copyright suit set aside their differences tuesday to 
announce they would swap technology on advanced printer fonts the 
plan is for macintosh computers and ibmtype computers using 
microsoft base software to have identical font capabilities 
gates the microsoft chairman said the plan is to improve upon 
postscript but he acknowledged that the improvements could render 
the two sets of software incompatible 
jonathan seybold the host of the san francisco conference 
predicted that the first software from that alliance would not be 
shipped before 1991 
adobes president charles geschke said in a phone interview 
that the company had planned to publish the postscript 
specifications within a matter of months anyway but speeded up its 
plans in hopes of keeping the industry standard from splitting

magazine and a media industry newsletter identified it as readers 
digest association inc 
owen lipstein head of american health partners said wednesday 
the partnership was having discussions about selling the 
magazine but refused to identify the prospective buyer 
media industry newsletter reported that sources it did not 
identify were saying readers digest association and american health

subject that has not been announced said spokesman bruce s

comment on its business plans he noted the company is currently 
operating under added regulatory constraints because it is preparing 
to file registration material that will enable some of its 
shareholders to offer nonvoting stock to the public for the first 
time the filing is expected by early 1990 
american health magazine is published 10 times a year and has 
seen both circulation and advertising pages rise this year

another round of auto plant closings 
is looming for the 1990s but nothing should happen in the next year 
despite an expected drop in vehicle sales a chrysler corp 
executive says 
there absolutely will be more plant closings in the united 
states robert lutz president of chrysler motors corp said 
wednesday if over a period of time market demand is insufficient 
then we would be forced to realign capacity 
lutz president of chryslers vehiclemaking arm predicted that 
142 million vehicles 94 million cars and 48 million light 
trucks will be sold in 1990 that will be down 4 percent to 5 
percent from 1989 sales and 101 percent below the 158 million 
vehicles sold in 1988 the secondbest year in automotive history 
chrysler the no 3 us carmaker closed its kenosha wis 
assembly plant last year last week general motors corp announced 
it would shut its lakewood ga assembly plant in march ford motor 
co hasnt recently announced any plant closings 
over the 90s the market is not going to grow sufficiently to 
absorb all the capacity lutz said 
a large percentage of the new us automaking capacity in recent 
years has come from transplants or foreignbased companies 
operating assembly plants in the united states 
recently nissan motor corp of japan increased capacity at its 
smyrna tenn plant chrysler and mitsubishi motors corp of japan 
began production at their jointventure plant in illinois a 
cooperative venture between gm and suzuki motor co ltd of japan 
opened in canada and hyundai motor co of korea began operating in 
canada 
honda motor co begins production at a second us plant later 
this year in east liberty ohio and isuzu motors ltd and fuji 
heavy industries ltd join together for production later this year 
at lafayette ind all three companies are japanese 
all that adds up to a lot more production capacity for cars and 
trucks 
chrysler is using less than 30 percent of the capacity at its 
bramalea ontario plant but that will rise next year when the 
company begins building a new dodge monaco derived from the eagle 
premier it assembles there now 
on other matters raised wednesday as chrysler wound up its 1990 
model introduction lutz said 
the 2300 whitecollar jobs chrysler tagged for extinction in a 
1 billion costcutting program should be gone by the end of the 
year as expected 
the minivan market segment will continue to grow chryslers 
dominant 56 percent share will slip a little mainly because of the 
entry of new minivans including those from gm and mazda motor corp 
of japan 
chryslers 5 percent average price increase for 1990 cars and 
trucks was due mainly to the companys decision to put driverside 
air bags on all of its usmade cars to meet federal safety 
standards

amerada hess corp has confirmed that its big st 
croix refinery sustained major hurricane damage and will not resume 
full operations for about 60 days 
the company said in a statement after the markets closed 
wednesday that there had been considerable damage to the plant and 
to its administrative buildings and employees housing 
the new york company said the refinery with a capacity of 
545000 barrels a day would resume partial operations in about 30 
days the refinery supplies markets in the eastern united states and 
the gulf of mexico 
reports that there might be major problems at the refinery sent 
gasoline futures surging wednesday on the new york mercantile 
exchange 
the october contract for unleaded gasoline closed 207 cents 
higher at 5974 cents a gallon after trading as high as 6020 cents 
heating oil for october delivery jumped 160 cents to 5655 cents a 
gallon other contract months also had strong gains 
an amerada spokesman said the refinery had been shut down 
saturday in preparation for hurricane hugo the refinery had been 
producing about 400000 barrels a day of gasoline distillates and 
other products most of which are used in the united states said 
the official who asked that his name not be used 
he said amerada officials traveled to the us virgin islands to 
inspect the refinery earlier in the week but that damage from the 
hurricane made communication out of st croix difficult 
amerada said despite the shutdown it planned to maintain normal 
sales arrangements with all of its customers on the mainland of the 
united states 
traders said the strength in product prices helped buoy crude oil 
prices the october contract for west texas intermediate the 
benchmark grade of us crude oil rose 8 cents to close at 1964 a 
42gallon barrel november crude rose 29 cents to 1968 and 
december jumped 32 cents to 1946 a barrel 
energy analysts said the small gains in october crude on the last 
trading day of the contract reflected the markets belief that it 
was oversold 
buyers decided they cant justify paying the price said bob 
baker an analyst with prudentialbache securities inc 
traders said the market started out relatively calm until 
gasoline prices surged early in the day on word that amerada hess 
was buying large amounts of oil and gasoline in new york and gulf of 
mexico markets to make up for the shortfall from st croix 
but some analysts said they were surprised by the strong buying 
activity given the recent buildup of inventories particularly 
gasoline 
its hard to see why we had this kind of move baker said 
the latest weekly report by the american petroleum institute 
showed gasoline stocks rose 244000 barrels in the week ended sept 
15 distillate stocks rose more than 16 million barrels while crude 
supplies fell 96 million barrels 
baker also said a department of energy report indicates that the 
st croix refinery provides only about 50000 barrels a day of 
gasoline to us markets while the rest of its production is 
composed of products such as distillates

president bush has rejected a plea by colombian 
president virgilio barco for a 1year reinstatement of a 
coffeeexport quota system that had been beneficial to colombian 
farmers the white house said 
colombian coffee prices have fallen sharply since the 74nation 
international coffee agreement to which both the united states and 
colombia belonged collapsed in july after the united states pulled 
out in a dispute over prices with coffeeproducing nations 
barco whose nation relies on coffee as a major source of export 
earnings had appealed to bush to reconsider the coffee decision and 
to support reinstating the quotas for at least one year but the 
white house said wednesday that the decision would stand 
colombias coffee earnings have slumped at the same time that the 
bush administration is seeking barcos help in cracking down on 
cocaine exports 
colombian officials have suggested they will have an even harder 
time persuading hardpressed colombian farmers to grow coffee 
instead of coca if coffee export prices continue to slip 
the agreement set quotas for member nations exports aimed at 
suporting prices of beans at 120 per pound or more some central 
american nations and others supported by the united states wanted 
larger quotas 
after suspension of the quotas in early july prices fell quickly 
to about 85 cents a pound colombia has said this will cost 500 
million a year in export revenue 
bush in a letter to barco said the united states was ready to 
negotiate for a new quota system but was unwilling to adhere to the 
nowdefunct agreement presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater 
said 
fitzwater said bushs letter was one expressing appreciation of 
the importance of coffee to the economies of colombia and other 
developing countries 
the letter fitzwater continued expressed his bushs 
disappointment that the members of the ica were unable to settle 
two fundamental problems 
the united states wanted an increase in export quotas for 
higherquality coffees enjoyed by us consumers and tough 
penalties against countries secretly selling coffee surpluses to 
eastern bloc nations at prices below those charged the united states 
president bush expresses his confidence that a lasting solution 
which is acceptable to other major members and respects market 
trends can be found fitzwater said 
bushs letter may have opened the way for negotiations on 
restoring coffee export quotas a colombian representative said 
while bush rejected barcos plea he also said the united states 
was prepared to resume discussions on quotas at any time 
possibilities for restoring the international coffee 
organizations export quota system may be explored next week at a 
weeklong session of the 74member group 
the aim will be to maintain the momentum towards an economic 
agreement for coffee that brings back export quotas nestor 
osorio colombias permanent coffee organization delegate said in 
london 
the council will look at the market situation and could set a 
timetable for negotiations he added 
coffee prices have dropped by more than 30 percent since the ico 
export quota system was suspended on july 4 and prices touched a 
14year low of less than 67 cents per pound last month allowing for 
inflation coffee is now at its lowest level since the 1920s

us commerce secretary robert mosbacher 
has signed investment and tourism agreements and extended his stay 
to negotiate a pact to persuade american companies to do business in 
the new poland 
the proposed accord would address the concerns of us companies 
considering investing in the economically and politically volatile 
country which has the east blocs only noncommunistled government 
mosbacher and polish foreign trade minister marcin swiecicki are 
discussing how far the new government is willing to go to increase 
western investment through a series of favorable agreements 
the pacts would address removing profits from poland offer 
guarantees against expropriation of property protect technology 
patents and other intellectual property and govern taxation 
i think this will add confidence and comfort and a level of 
excitement for american businesses and bring more to invest in 
poland mosbacher said wednesday 
mosbachers visit which he extended by a day until today comes 
as poles are looking to the west for support of the new governments 
efforts to dismantle four decades of communist rule amid what 
solidarity prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki calls economic 
chaos 
in washington democrats contending the bush administration is 
failing to back the reforms have proposed a 18 billion aid plan 
that would dwarf a 100 million package offered so far by the white 
house 
neither the comprehensive business and economic agreement 
under discussion nor the agreements signed wednesday has any 
significant cost to the us government mosbacher said 
but they do represent a largely unprecedented encouragement of 
us commerce with a communist country in transition 
solidarity leader lech walesa met with mosbacher in gdansk on 
wednesday and said it will likely be some time before the benefits 
of investment are felt 
the americans propose that poland reduce inflation first and 
then they will provide us with some specific help he said 
i think i managed to persuade mosbacher that it should be the 
other way around because i am sure that without this help we will 
not make it walesa said it would be a vicious circle 
mosbacher and swiecicki one of four remaining communist cabinet 
members signed an agreement to foster contact between american 
business and the developing private sector in poland 
under the pact business experts will be brought to poland and 
management training programs will be developed for an economy in 
which companies have been run by a centralized bureaucracy 
the other agreement is to improve tourism and expand 
opportunities for us investment in hotels and other travel 
projects in poland 
mosbacher stayed at the marriott hotel expected to open next 
month in a skyscraper that was unfinished most of the decade due to 
lack of funds the project is considered a prime example and key 
test of the potential for us investment 
tourists now have legal access to a more favorable exchange rate 
that had been only available only on the black market until currency 
laws were changed earlier in the year 
but they still are required to exchange set amounts and pay for 
lodging and other services at the lower official exchange rate 
a series of programs now before the us congress include a 100 
million fund to promote development of private firms in poland and 
the rewriting of tariff laws to allow 4100 products to be imported 
to the united states without tariffs 
about 70 million of current polish exports would be covered 
including furniture and light machinery

wage and price projections point toward increased 
productivity by salaried workers in 1990 according to a private 
study that found salary increases lagging behind inflation this year 
the survey of 1260 businesses indicates the companies plan to 
give slightly bigger raises next year while inflation is expected to 
ease a bit 
with higher compensation costs in an atmosphere of greater price 
restraint employers will likely demand more from their employees 
said eddie smith an executive with hewitt associates which 
released its study wednesday 
hewitt a compensation consulting firm based in suburban 
lincolnshire asked a crosssection of us businesses how much they 
increased their budgets for salaries in 1989 and how much more they 
expected to budget in 1990 
the companies projected increases averaging 54 percent next year 
while the bush administration is projecting an increase of 42 
percent in a consumer price index that tracks the prices of goods 
and services bought by urban wage earners and clerical workers 
those projections compare with salary increases averaging 53 
percent this year while inflation for wage earners and clerical 
workers is running at an annualized rate of 51 percent through 
august according to the labor department 
the increased income taxes on the 53 percent raises will more 
than offset the apparent edge over inflation so salaried workers 
will actually lose some purchasing power this year for the second 
year in a row smith said 
the loss of spending power is small but significant he said 
its more of a statistical concept than something the average 
person is going to feel but if it continues over time youre going 
to feel it 
the projected loss of purchasing power extends a pattern 
established in 1988 the first year this decade in which inflation 
outstripped the average rise in salaried workers takehome pay 
smith said 
the survey did not include wage increases for union workers who 
comprise 168 percent of the work force according to labor 
department figures 
on the brighter side smith said an increasing number of 
companies are shifting compensation dollars to bonus plans or other 
incentive programs that reward salaried employees for achieving 
stated goals 
for a large number of salaried workers there is a second source 
of earnings he said 
the consumer price index used in hewitts study known as cpiw 
is a narrower indicator of inflation than the more widely cited 
cpiu index which tracks the prices of products purchased by all 
urban consumers not just wage earners and clerical workers 
the labor departments cpiu index shows inflation running at an 
annualized rate of 48 percent through august 
the salary increases in hewitts study are substantially greater 
than those reported by the labor department for wage and salary 
earners in private industry because the governments numbers include 
hourly and union workers whose raises are typically smaller than 
those of salaried workers 
the labor department said wages for those workers rose 33 
percent in 1987 41 percent in 1988 and 41 percent through august 
of this year

west coast retailers have fared better than their 
east coast rivals this year and sales at chain stores in oilpatch 
states have grown faster than elsewhere in the country according to 
a new report 
department stores and discounters in the el paso texas 
metropolitan area posted the best sales gain for the first half of 
1989 while akron ohio retailers suffered the worst decline 
these were among the findings in a regional retail sales report 
based on results from 6000 stores with at least 25 employees each 
in the 125 largest us metropolitan areas the stores account for 
110 billion in annual sales 
the retailers which regularly submit sales figures to the us 
census bureau include such national chains as sears roebuck and 
co k mart corp and jc penney co inc mass merchants and 
department stores 
using data collected by the census bureau the international 
council of shopping centers is compiling a new monthly report that 
complements other government retail sales publications the premier 
issue released wednesday covered sales for june and the first 6 
months of 1989 
ike lagnado director of research for the shopping center trade 
group said the report indicates a regions health because consumer 
spending at general merchandise stores is a key element of economic 
activity 
nationwide consumer spending accounts for about twothirds of 
economic activity 
walter loeb a retail industry analyst at morgan stanley amp co 
said at a news conference that the new reports will help analysts 
determine store traffic trends and sales momentum which are crucial 
factors in assessing a retailers prospects 
according to the report for january through june the west south 
central or oil patch area of the country including parts of 
texas louisana arkansas and oklahoma had a sales gain of 112 
percent for the first half from the corresponding 1988 period 
the increase was by far the best of any region and compared with 
a national median increase of 45 percent 
since the oildominated economies have suffered through an 
extended widespread economic contraction a recent turnaround has 
apparently been sufficient to usher in a wave of consumer 
spending the report read 
the west had a 63 percent sales gain in the first half of 1989 
on the east coast the south atlantic states showed a growth rate of 
only 13 percent and the new england states trailed all other 
divisions within geographic regions with a 26 percent drop in 
sales 
in the midwest the report said department store sales rose 43 
percent in the first six months of the year from a year earlier but 
accelerated in the second quarter posting a rise of 53 percent 
among specific metropolitan areas el paso had a sales rise of 
187 percent in the first half of 1989 to lead gainers while akron 
sales fell by 8 percent to lead the decliners

a senate panel has passed legislation that 
would increase securities and exchange commission funding by 70 
million over the next two years and lift salary caps for sec 
staffers 
the senate banking housing and urban affairs committee approved 
a package of secrealted legislation without amendements and little 
discussion on wednesday 
in addition to increasing the secs budget for 1990 and 1991 the 
proposed package would let the sec lift caps on employee salary 
especially crucial entry level staff attorney posts 
most other federal financial regulators were given that authority 
by the savings and loan bailout bill passed earlier this year 
at his confirmation hearing before the same committee last week 
richard breeden the bush administrations nominee for the sec 
chairmanship said raising staff pay was one of his top priorities 
we dont want a thrift crisis in the securities markets said 
sen christopher dodd dconn chairman of the subcommittee that 
drew up the legislation 
noting the high turnover rate caused by salaries that are not 
competitive with the private sector dodd added we simply must 
have an agency that has the funds and expert staff to keep our 
markets clean and keep them sound 
the legislative package must still clear the senate 
appropriations committee and the full senate and house 
the passage of these bills as well as the lifting of the pay 
caps at the sec is long overdue said sen donald w riegle jr 
the committee chairman i do not anticipate any difficulties 
enacting this legislation into law the michigan democrat added 
the packages also calls for action that would 
bolster the secs ability to fight international fraud by 
allowing the commission to guarantee the confidentiality of 
documents provided by foreign regulators in sec probes 
extend to mutual fund shareholders the protection of the 
shareholder communications act which equires banks and brokers to 
notify shareholders about proxy materials and other documents not 
sent directly to the individual 
streamline the law regulating the disclosure language for the 
issuance of corporate bonds 
the package of four bills was passed by voice vote with little 
discussion 
under the sec reauthorization bill the agency which oversees the 
stock and bond markets stock exchanges and other aspects of the 
securities industry would get 178 million for 1990 and 2126 
million for the following year 
by contrast the sec budget for 1989 was 1426 million 
dodd said it may be the panels most important single task in 
the securities field 
we can pass countless laws against insider trading or market 
abuses but we need an expert agency to administer and enforce those 
laws he added

the former head of g heileman brewing co says 
he is discouraged by the companys troubles since it was acquired by 
australian alan bond but he declined to speculate whether the 
countrys fifthlargest brewer might be sold again 
its unfortunate russell cleary said in a telephone 
interview from la crosse wis where heileman is based i 
certainly hope they get their act straightened out for the sake of 
the employees 
cleary said he would not speculate on whether heileman might be 
sold a spokesman for heileman referred calls to bonds headquarters 
in australia but officials there could not be reached for comment 
its a tough business and he has an enormous amount of debt 
cleary said we didnt have that debt 
through a series of acquisitions cleary built heileman into a 
national power before it was bought by bond in 1987 for about 13 
billion 
but the purchase of heileman has contributed to bonds mounting 
debts which reportedly exceed 4 billion on tuesday bond 
announced he was selling half of his brewery empire to new zealands 
lion nathan ltd for more than 760 million 
under the transaction lion nathan will buy a 50 percent interest 
in and management of bond corps swan tooheys and castlemaine 
breweries in australia and the groups hotel and associated liquor 
interests 
bond said in a statement that the brewery deal was another 
positive step in the restructuring and strategic refocusing of his 
group he said it would create a formidable brewing alliance in 
the region aimed at the pacific as well as asia 
under the proposal the brewing assets will be folded into a new 
joint venture company australian breweries pty ltd equally owned 
by bond corp and lion nathan 
bond deferred for 12 months any decision to part with heileman 
analysts say however bond is bound to lose money whether he 
sells heileman or decides to keep it 
heileman today is to some extent painted in a corner said 
robert weinberg a professor of marketing management at washington 
university in st louis 
the question is whether you operate it and bleed a little or 
take a big hit and move on said john collopy an industry analyst 
and chairman of the milwaukee investment firm cleary gull reiland 
mcdevitt amp collopy inc 
while the overall beer market has stagnated heilemans share has 
eroded falling from a high of 94 percent in 1983 to a current 
level of about 7 percent industry observers say heileman was worth 
far below 13 billion when it was sold and bond would have a hard 
time finding a buyer 
youre not getting anyone to pay 13 billion for the 
breweries said ben steinman associate publisher of beer 
marketers insights an industry newsletter 
analysts point out that heilemans sales started to slip before 
the company was sold but cleary was able to keep the company 
efficient and profitable 
his helmsmanship helped hold it together better than anyone 
could collopy said when you lose that the underlying softness 
got exaggerated

the government today cleared hoylake investment 
ltds 21 billion bid for the british conglomerate bat industries 
plc 
the decision follows last weeks ruling by the panel on takeovers 
and mergers allowing hoylake to suspend its allpaper bid until it 
resolves regulatory problems with state insurance commissioners in 
the united states 
thursdays approval came in the form of a decision by trade 
secretary nicholas ridley not to refer the bid to the monopolies and 
mergers commission 
however the notice from ridley said the matter could be 
reconsidered if there is a material change in the terms of the 
bid or other material facts 
bat shares were up the equivalent of 11 cents at 1296 on the 
london stock exchange thursday morning 
hoylake an investors group led by the anglofrench financier sir 
james goldsmith offered 1387 worth of securitie for each bat 
share 
bat said it regretted ridleys decision 
the british conglomerate comprising holdings in tobacco paper 
retailing and financial services said a referral to the monopolies 
commission wouldve provided an opportunity for the government to 
establish a coherent policy on the controversial question of highly 
leveraged bids for major companies using junk bonds with their 
negative potential for the markets for companies and for small 
shareholders 
bat chairman patrick sheehy said seeing off hoylake remained 
the companys first priority 
we are continuing our strategic review in light of the historic 
undervaluation of our shares he noted adding that the company 
was determined to take suitable measures to provide a sustainable 
longterm increase in shareholder value 
hoylake had requested that the takeover panel grant it a 
lengthier bid timetable because of the need to secure approval from 
the us state insurance commissioners for a change in ownership of 
bats farmers insurance group inc of los angeles 
bat last week appealed the takeover panels decision allowing 
hoylake to renew its offer for bat within 21 days of overcoming its 
regulatory obstacles in the united states 
normally in britain a bidder is given 90 days to win a majority 
stake in its target if the bidder fails he must wait at least a 
year before bidding again

pan am is being fined 630000 for alleged 
security breaches mainly involving its flight that blew up over 
scotland but federal aviation officials say the violations did not 
lead to the bombing 
the federal aviation administration announced the fines involving 
the dec 21 flight on wednesday giving the airline 30 days to pay 
or appeal 
the action came as the house of representatives prompted by the 
pan am bombing and another apparent airliner bombing over northern 
africa on tuesday passed a bill to bolster international aviation 
security 
the faa fine covers charges of improper screening of passengers 
and cargo boarding flight 103 at west germanys frankfurt and 
londons heathrow airports as well as five other european flights 
within a few days after the bombing 
the agency said its letter announcing the fines to pan am 
contained no allegations that any of the violations contributed to 
the flight 103 tragedy all 259 people aboard the flight were 
killed as well as 11 on the ground in lockerbie scotland 
the faa said all of the problems cited in the accusations have 
been corrected 
pan am chairman thomas g plaskett called the alleged security 
lapses administrative rather than substantive and also said they 
did not contribute to the bombing 
there is no evidence that any of the items noted in the 
inspection by the faa were in any way related to the bombing of our 
aircraft last december said plaskett 
investigators are still trying to determine who planted plastic 
explosives in a radiocassette player found in debris from the 
boeing 747s cargo hold 
the fines came as a team of us investigators was setting out 
for niger in northern africa to look into the crash of a dc10 en 
route from ndjamena chad to paris the french airline uta said a 
bomb apparently downed its plane carrying 170 people 
a spokesman for pan am flight 103 victims relatives bert 
ammerman reacted to the fines by saying the government not 
airlines should be responsible for aviation security the relatives 
have called for a federal investigation into the bombing 
sen james exon dneb praised the faa action saying the fines 
would serve notice not only on pan am but all other airlines that 
we are going to be insistent on not only proper maintenance of the 
aircraft but proper screening of passengers and baggage that goes on 
airplanes today 
the house on wednesday passed a bill that would have the 
government pay 270 million for modern weaponsdetection equipment 
at many us and foreign airports the transportation department has 
ordered airliners to install and pay for the devices 
the legislation approved 39231 also would require for the 
first time that commuter airlines screen passengers and luggage 
require airlines to acknowledge that they have received faa warnings 
of possible security threats and urge agreements with other 
countries to require detectable chemicals in plastic explosives 
the faa accused pan am of failing to properly check 31 passengers 
at heathrow airport and another five at frankfurt where the flight 
to new york originated 
other violations were cited in the handling of passengers or 
cargo for three other flights from london and two from frankfurt 
within three days after the bombing of the boeing jumbo jet 
in some cases in which passengers were identified for further 
checks handheld metal detectors were used on their carryon 
luggage rather than having it opened for physical inspection as 
required the faa said 
pan am said in may that all passengers and cargo boarding flight 
103 were thoroughly inspected the airline said the allegations of 
security lapses appear to be based on a misunderstanding of pan 
ams procedures 
a new york lawyer who handles aviation cases james stengel said 
that despite the faas failure to connect the lapses with the 
bombing the fine might still be used by plaintiffs as evidence in 
support of suits against pan am he said it could support 
allegations that pan am was not meeting all of its security 
responsibilities at the time of the incident 
another aviation lawyer keith gerrard of seattle said he 
thought the faa fines would be excluded as prejudicial evidence in 
liability cases since the government has not concluded that the 
violations contributed to the bombing

the us economy grew at a healthy annual rate 
of 25 percent from april through june slightly slower than 
previously believed the government said today 
in its final look at overall economic activity in the spring the 
commerce department said growth in the gross national product was 
02 percentage point lower than it estimated a month ago 
the small downward revision did nothing to change the view that 
the economy was performing remarkably well during the spring 
bolstered by a rebound in consumer spending strong business 
investment and continued doubledigit growth in us exports 
many economists believe that growth will slow during the second 
half of the year however the momentum provided by the second 
quarter has erased fears that the country was in danger of toppling 
into a recession 
the gnp revision also bore good news for the federal reserve 
boards goal of restraining inflation a price index tied to the gnp 
rose at an annual rate of 5 percent from april through june a bit 
lower than the estimate a month ago 
the overall growth rate of 25 percent represented a modest 
downward revision from a 27 percent rate estimated a month ago 
however both estimates were well above the inital government 
projection which had put gnp growth at an anemic 17 percent rate 
in the second quarter 
before the first gnp estimate was revised there was widespread 
concern that a yearlong effort by the fed to dampen inflationary 
pressures was going to push the country into a recession 
the gnp is the nations total output of goods and services and 
its braodest measure of economic health 
in a companion report the government said aftertax profits of 
us corporations fell 72 percent in the second quarter an even 
bigger drop than the 54 percent drop in aftertax profit estimated 
a month ago 
the fed reported on wednesday the economy started the second half 
of the year with its growth mixed ranging from slow to modest from 
region to region other recent government reports also indicate more 
sluggish growth in the months ahead 
i basically see us muddling along without falling into a 
recession said samuel d kahan chief financial eocnomist for 
kleinwort benson government securities inc in chicago 
therell be a little weakness here a little there but nothing 
really to collapse us one way or the other he said 
nevertheless the peacetime record of economic expansion appears 
likely to reach its seventh year in november 
on an annual basis the economy grew at a 31 percent annual rate 
during the first six months of the year the administration is 
predicting gnp growth of 29 percent for all of 1989 
in contrast to past overly optimistic economic forecasts by the 
reagan administration the bush outlook is generally viewed as well 
within grasp indeed the gnp will only need to expand at an annual 
rate of 23 percent in the second half to reach that goalthe 
reasons for the modest revision in the second quarter gnp were 
slightly smaller levels of government and consumer spending than 
estimated a month ago 
but even with the revisions consumer spending which accounts 
for twothirds of all economic activity rose at a solid annual rate 
of 19 percent 
other areas of strength came from a big 86 percent increase in 
business spending on investment and a 131 percent rise in american 
exports the third consecutive quarter in which exports have climbed 
at a doubleldigit rate 
the various changes left the gnp expanding in the second quarter 
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 413 trillion 
in its report wednesday the fed said inflation continued to ease 
over much of the nation as the third quarter got undeway indicating 
the central bank continues to attain its goal of easing inflationary 
pressures without slowing the economy so much that it is driven into 
a recession 
the commerce department reported tuesday that consumer inflation 
was running at a 48 percent annual rate compared to 44 percent 
for all of last year 
most of the newfound strength in the august gnp revision came in 
consumer spending which accounts for twothirds of total economic 
activity government spending business investment and us export 
sales also provided momentum during the spring 
but during the summer consumer spending tapered off except for 
automobiles analysts believe auto sales which had been driven by 
incentives and fears of steep increases in 1990model prices will 
slacken in coming months 
exports which also grew strongly during the first half of 1988 
are expected to slow because the rising value of the dollar is 
making us goods more expensive overseas 
capital spending after being a shining star during the first 
half of the year should ease back a bit kahan said in terms 
of government spending its likely to chug along the housing 
market should show a bit more life down the road but not a lot

winstonsalem nc ap rj reynolds tobacco co today 
announced a plan to cut excess customerheld inventories by the end 
of 1989 by reducing domestic cigarette shipments for the rest of the 
year 
the company also will refocus its distribution incentive programs 
in the future reynolds tobacco will better balance its sales 
to direct customers with consumer purchases of its products said 
james w johnston the companys chairman and chief executive 
officer 
we will replace our existing trade incentive programs with a 
comprehensive new program that will provide performancebased 
financial incentives to our direct customers and assist us in 
improving our retail share of the market he said in a news 
release 
details of the new program which will become effective jan 1 
1990 will be announced to customers in december the program is 
intended to prevent imbalances in what are known as trade 
inventories 
a company spokeswoman betsy annese said reynolds tobaccos 
trade inventories are unsold cigarettes held by customers 
during certain periods of the year the company offers incentives 
to customers to encourage them to buy more cigarettes than they 
expect to sell the practice is a commonly used method in the 
consumer goods industry to move products into retail channels 
because tobacco industry unit volume is generally reported based 
on manufacturers shipments rather than on actual consumer sales 
the plan will result in a reduction from comparable periods in 1988 
of reynolds tobaccos reported shipment volume of about 29 percent 
for the third quarter and 17 percent for the fourth quarter 
however the plan will not have an impact on the companys share 
of actual consumer shares which is expected to decline only 
slightly in 1989 
the plan is expected to reduce operating earnings for reynolds 
tobacco by about 170 million in the third and the same amount in 
the fourth quarter 
however it is also expected to have a moderate positive impact 
on the companys cash flow for 1989 reynolds tobacco expects the 
plan to have a positive impact on its financial performance after 
1989 because of reduced costs for returned product and increased 
manufacturing and sales efficiency 
this is a milestone decision that eliminates a longstanding 
problem for our company in a short time johnston said 
it will ensure fresher more consistent products for our 
customers provide more efficiency in our planning production and 
distribution and help us build a stronger partnership with our 
direct customers we are also pleased that we can accomplish our 
plan without any reduction in staffing he added

agriculture department economists say rising 
incomes and a decline in the attrition rate are reasons the farm 
situation is looking up these days 
recent surveys show farm bankruptcy filings in 1988 were down 50 
percent from 1986 the peak year for the decade the departments 
economic research service said wednesday in a preliminary report 
despite the 1980s farm financial crisis farm numbers fell less 
than in preceding decades the report said farm numbers 
declined by 266600 during 198089 compared with 17 million in the 
1950s 1 million in the 1960s and 516000 in the 1970s 
the brief analysis is in a summary of the october issue of 
agricultural outlook magazine to be issued later this month 
greg gajewski the magazines economics editor said the 
summarys account do not portray fully however the impact of the 
decline in farm numbers during the 1980s 
there were proportionately more of the large commercial farms 
that went out of business in the 80s than in the earlier decades 
gajewski said in a telephone interview 
but the peak of financial stress for farmers collectively has 
passed he said there are still exceptions including many who are 
having problems repaying loans made by the departments farmers home 
administration 
others with debts to commercial banks and the farm credit system 
are faring much better than they were a few years ago 
gajewski cited a recent american bankers association survey of 
commercial agricultural banks which showed that 28 percent of their 
farm borrowers went out of business during the year that ended last 
june 30 
fifty percent of those quitting business did so because of 
normal attrition such as retirement and death he said 
in 1986 62 percent of the farms served by the agricultural 
banks went out of business and only 29 percent of those were due to 
normal attrition 
the usda report said 1989 net cash income of farmers is still 
expected to decline 5 percent to 13 percent from last years record 
of 599 billion that was unchanged from the forecast a month ago 
higher expenses associated with larger crop plantings are major 
factors in the expected decline in cash income this year also 
federal payments to farmers will be lower 
net cash income is the amount of gross cash income generated by 
farmers during the calendar year minus cash operating expenses it 
includes the sales of inventory stocks build up over previous years 
last years drought helped push up 1988 net cash income as 
farmers sold accumulated inventories at higher prices 
another measure used by the agency is net farm income 
accounting which measures the value of the current years 
production plus government payments minus total costs allowances 
also are made for the value of family dwellings and other factors 
by this method net farm income could rise 5 percent to 16 
percent this year to a range of 48 billion to 53 billion from 
457 billion in 1988 also unchanged from the august forecast

this years federal crop programs little more than half the 542 
million acres taken from production in 1988 according to the 
agriculture department 
the final 1989 contract figures were released wednesday by the 
departments agricultural stabilization and conservation service 
the final landidling figure was up slightly from 292 million acres 
announced in a preliminary report on may 24 
to be eligible for price supports and related benefits farmers 
who produce feed grains wheat cotton and rice are required to take 
a percentage of their base acres from crop production and put the 
land in conservation uses that help protect the soil 
after drought reduced 1988 production usda relaxed some of the 
idling requirements in order to boost plantings for this years 
harvest 
total land idled or diverted under the 1989 programs included 
corn 101 million acres sorghum 29 million barley 22 million 
oats 300000 wheat 97 million cotton 35 million and rice 
12 million 
the agency report said farmers enrolled 1712 million acres of 
land used to produce feed grains wheat cotton and rice in the 1989 
program which represented 778 percent of the 220 million acres in 
the national base area for those crops the idled acres are part of

some forecasters expect frost in minnesota and northern iowa 
saturday night with the cold moving into the eastern corn belt 
sunday night 
if frost occurs it would be about a week ahead of normal 
analysts said the greatest threat would be to soybeans in indiana 
and ohio where crops were planted late due to heavy spring rains 
in the western corn belt where the crops are more mature i 
dont think youre talking about yield losses i think youre 
talking about quality problems said dale gustafson an analyst 
with drexel burnham lambert inc 
frost could slow the natural drying of mature corn and lock some 
chlorophyll into notquiteripe soybeans causing some 
discoloration gustafson said 
in early trading wheat futures were cent lower to cent 
higher with the contract for delivery in december at 391 a 
bushel corn futures were cent to 1 cent higher with december at

american and japanese 
entrepreneurs are making deals in the desolate soviet far east best 
known to outsiders as the area where border gunners shot down a 
korean airlines jumbo jet 
most foreign investment in the resourcerich lightly populated 
region is still in the startup stage 
moscow sees foreign trade and foreign investment as ways to boost 
the soviet economy although so far no largescale foreign projects 
have been started in the soviet sector of the booming pacific basin 
nonetheless enthusiasm abounds on both sides when the ideas 
mesh and a small projects are envisioned for ventures ranging from 
sportfishing to seafood canning to volcano tours 
the key factor is the soviet desire to do business and its 
there in spades wk nichoson said after signing a preliminary 
pact to go into business with the district government in yuzhno 
sakhalinsk capital of the island of sakhalin and the remote kuril 
islands 
nichoson originally from long island ny but a longtime 
resident of japan accompanied a group of tokyobased journalists on 
a recent sovietarranged tour to sakhalin previously off limits to 
foreigners 
sakhalin became a household name worldwide six years ago when 
the soviets shot down a kal 747 en route from the united states to 
south korea all 269 people aboard died in an incident that 
aggravated eastwest tensions 
sakhalin also was an area nichosen knew 35 years ago then he was 
an electronics officer in the us air force flying reconnaissance 
missions from japan and dodging soviet fighters based on sakhalin 
he said 
he has been in business in japan since leaving the military and 
started his own company asia dynamics japan ltd in 1969 
ive been selling things in tokyo for 30 years and im tired 
of selling things in tokyo said nichoson 58 explaining why he 
was exploring this new frontier 
the initial business nichosen foresees is small processing 
local wild berries for a health drink and canning highquality 
seafood both for export he is pledging 500000 to be half the 
capital of a jointstock company with local soviet government 
enterprises putting up the rest in rubles 
but further down the line he said there were possibilities in 
tourism plywood dairy products and other exportable goods and the 
venture would need very large sums from wall street investment 
bankers 
the soviet far east is terra incognita now to wall street but 
since president mikhail gorbachev put the region on the perestroika 
course of economic restructuring business tours have been trickling 
through 
problems abound the ruble isnt convertible to foreign currency 
it is hard to repatriate profits roads telephones and hotels are 
poor soviet products often dont meet export standards 
worst of all the soviets are new to business but the soviet far 
east has such rich resources fish forests minerals oil coal 
that a growing number of foriegn businessmen are exploring for 
profitable opportunities 
some japanese firms have embarked on deals even though tokyo 
does not want economic relations to expand before the resolution of 
the dispute over kuril islands captured by soviet troops in the last 
days of world war ii 
japan insists on the return of the islands moscow refuses and 
the issue lies like a tall barricade between big japanese investors 
and the soviet desire to join the economic boom now enjoyed by many 
countries in the far east 
nonetheless small japanesesoviet operations include two 
fishfarming joint ventures on sakhalin the southern half of which 
was owned by japan until 1945 a japanese company is taking a 30 
percent interest in a project to refurbish a hotel in yuzhno 
sakhalinsk and participate in management 
yoichi okada is running a japanese restaurant as a joint venture 
with a soviet enterprise in the sakhalin port of holmsk and says 
its already profitable 
the kuchiro restaurant in a nicely trimmed building with a giant 
red lantern outside stands out in drab holmsk like a peacock in a 
piggery it draws 300 customers a day okada said 
a problem he said is how to take out his sides 49 percent of 
the profits and convert them to japanese yen there are ways to do 
it maybe buy fish or go into further enterprises to export fish to 
japan okada said 
perestroika seems to have unleashed a torrent of new soviet 
businessmen on sakhalin with sometimes eccentric ideas requiring 
foreign money ties or technology a geologist wanted to organize 
tours of the islands volcanoes an electronics specialist wanted to 
deal in computer technology 
ilya sukharev a local television producer is organizing a 
cooperative to export art he said permission came in only three 
months i never imagined it could be done in such a short time 
he said it was a miracle 
two sakhalin journalists vladimir ardunov and grigory kireev 
said their young company is embarking on a deal to develop a resort 
on an island in vietnam and wants foreign expertise 
one way to exploit the areas bountiful fish is with rod and 
reel preferrably wielded by a hardcurrencyspending foreign 
anglers to find out how to please them the soviets invited fishing 
the west of milwaukie ore to sakhalin to try the rivers and give 
advice 
kerry e brown of the company said the salmon fishing had been 
great but accommodations and roads were poor the russians want 
to do it right but theyve got a long way to go he said

than 21 million for an alleged breach of contract by mobil oil 
corp to buy pure phosphorus produced at plants in idaho and 
tennessee 
monsanto contended mobil violated a fiveyear agreement to buy 
the phosphorus and other products including detergents and 
lubrication additives at mobil plants in suburban cincinnati and 
charleston sc 
a sixmember jury in us district court deliberated two hours 
wednesday before awarding 21126557 to monsanto

koito manufacturing co said thursday it will not 
give t boone pickens jr more power just because he is increasing 
his stake in the japanese auto parts supplier to 26 percent 
but the company which pickens has railed against for repeatedly 
refusing him a spot on its board said the larger ownership by the 
american takeover specialist could threaten its position on the 
tokyo stock exchange 
pickens said wednesday in washington that his boone co koitos 
largest shareholder was buying another 10 million shares above the 
324 million it currently holds but has no plans to mount a takeover 
battle 
he said he expected to request a special koito shareholders 
meeting in early october 
we just dont have to allow pickens to have seats on our board 
even though he increases the stake from 202 percent to 26 
percent koito spokesman mikio tsuruta said there is no such 
law 
tsuruta also said pickens could not request a shareholders 
meeting until at least the end of september to make such a call a 
shareholder must hold more than a 3 percent stake for at least six 
months 
we havent even been notified anything about this from pickens 
side he said the deal is strictly between pickens and the 
azabu group which has nothing to do with us in the first place 
azabu a large japanese car sales and real estate concern owns 
about 10 percent of the shares in koito an automobile lighting 
company closely associated with toyota motor corp 
additional purchases by pickens could endanger koitos position 
on the tokyo stock exchanges first section which permits stock 
dealing on a credit basis and makes raising capital easier 
how come pickens has to do this to us it wouldnt be good for 
any of our shareholders even including pickens tsuruta said 
about about the danger of falling to the exchanges second section 
a dealer for nomura securities inc said pickens increased stake 
could pressure koito into a compromise allowing pickens to name 
executives to play a leading role in koito management 
koito would fall from the first section if its top 10 
shareholders total stake exceeds 80 percent the top group 
including pickens at 202 percent and toyota at 19 percent now 
holds a total 67 percent stake pickens new purchases would boost 
the level to 73 percent 
in addition a company is supposed to have at least 3400 
shareholders to qualify for the first section while koito now has 
3120 tsuruta said who charged that a stake increase by pickens 
would scare off other potential shareholders 
noting that toyota has three representatives on koitos board 
pickens said he and boone co have been denied our rights because 
we are americans 
not only do they want to keep out americans from participating 
in japans economy but they also dont want the japanese public to 
see how their closed corporate structure benefits a few elites to 
the detriment of the public he said wednesday

hoylake investments ltd won an important second 
round in its takeover battle for bat industries plc thursday when 
the british government cleared the groups 21 billion hostile bid 
for the conglomerate 
trade secretary nicholas ridley said he would not refer hoylakes 
offer to the monopolies and mergers commission upholding the 
conservative governments freemarket policies and sweeping aside 
concerns about the advent of giant highly leveraged junk 
bondfinanced buyouts in britain 
however ridley said the matter could be reconsidered if there 
were a material change in the terms of the bid for bat or other 
material facts 
the decision followed last weeks ruling by the panel on 
takeovers and mergers giving hoylake which is led by financier sir 
james goldsmith more time for its bid the offer has been delayed 
by regulatory hurdles in the united states 
bat stock rose 22 cents to close at 1307 a share thursday on 
londons stock exchange 
hoylake is offering 1387 in securities for each bat share 
bat noted ridleys decision with regret but said it was 
pleased the trade secretary left open the possibility of referring 
the bid to the mergers commission if its terms were changed 
bat said a referral to the monopolies commission would have given 
the british government a chance to establish a policy on takeovers 
that rely heavily on risky junk bonds 
junk bonds have a negative potential for the markets for 
companies and for small shareholders bat said 
securities analysts have said hoylake would have to raise its 
offer and include cash to succeed 
hoylake wants to retain bats tobacco interests and sell its 
retailing financial services and paper and packaging operations 
bat chairman patrick sheehy said his company would try to defeat 
the hoylake bid on its merits he said bat was determined to take 
suitable measures to provide a sustainable longterm increase in 
shareholder value 
because hoylake was formed by goldsmith british merchant banker 
jacob rothschild and australian entrepreneur kerry packer 
specifically to make the bat bid it was unlikely the offer would be 
referred to the monopolies commission on competition grounds a 
common basis for review 
the bids opponents have argued for an investigation into whether 
the offer is in the public interest contending that such 
highlyleveraged takeovers could strap british companies with debt 
cut down on their investments and distract executives from 
daytoday management 
ridley said he based his decision on a recommendation by director 
general of trading sir gordon borrie who advised there were no 
competitive problems raised by the buyout offer 
in the first instance it must be for the shareholders to 
decide ridley said in an interview on british broadcasting corp 
radio i would not wish to interfere in a purely market 
situation 
bryan gould an opposition labor lawmaker who serves as his 
partys spokesman on trade matters said this is a triumph of 
narrow ideology over the wider interests of british industry 
hoylake requested that the takeover panel grant it a lengthier 
bid timetable because of the need to secure approval from us state 
insurance commissioners for a change in ownership of bats farmers 
insurance group inc which is based in los angeles 
insurance regulators in nine states have undertaken reviews of 
the deal 
hoylake wants to sell farmers to the french insurance company axa 
midi assurances goldsmiths group is hoping the move will speed up 
us approval for their bid 
bat immediately appealed the takeover panels decision allowing 
hoylake to renew its offer for bat within 21 days of overcoming its 
regulatory obstacles in the united states 
normally in britain a bidder is given 90 days to win a majority 
stake in its target if the bidder fails it must wait at least a 
year before bidding again

opec ministers will meet this weekend to 
tackle the troublesome issue of how to fairly divvy up 
oilproduction shares among the 13 nations some want much more than 
their current allotment 
but analysts were skeptical the eightmember committee of the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries would do much more 
than review proposals for reworking output quotas assigned each 
member 
fergus macleod analyst at the investment firm of barclays de 
zoete wedd in london said he expected not very much to come out 
of the meeting that begins saturday in geneva switzerland 
failure to reach any meaningful conclusion on current production 
however could be very dangerous because countries might widen 
their oil taps and increase their already high production level he 
said 
another analyst nick antill of londons county natwest 
predicted the ministers would leave the fighting until november 
when all 13 ministers are scheduled to gather for a key yearend 
meeting in vienna 
they will discuss quotas but they will take no decision 
said pierre terzian editor of the oil publication petrostrategies 
in paris 
the ministers are at odds over how the cartel divides up and sets 
the ceilings for each countrys crude output 
some countries like kuwait and the united arab emirates want a 
larger share of the production pie both have been ignoring their 
quotas in recent months and pumping at higher levels 
moreover iraq just opened the second phase of a twin pipeline 
across saudi arabia which will add more than a million barrels a 
day to its export capacity the move increases the likelihood it 
will want a higher quota 
analysts estimate opecs current production at close to 22 
million barrels a day well over the cap of 195 million set in june 
for the last six months of the year 
prices have been lower than earlier in the year a basket of 
seven crudes monitored by opec was priced at 1704 a barrel last 
week under the cartels target of 18 
west texas intermediate the benchmark grade of us oil has 
been trading in the range of 1950 to 20 for a 42gallon barrel 
us crude normally sells for about 2 above the opecmonitored 
crudes 
indonesian oil minister ginandjar kartasasmita was quoted earlier 
this month as saying he was not satisfied with the markets recent 
performance 
we have not been able to reach the 18 per barrel price level 
that we wanted except for a few weeks earlier this summer he 
told opecna the cartels news agency 
at their june conference the ministers agreed to begin the tough 
task of finding a more acceptable way to figure out each countrys 
take of the cartels daily output 
but analysts detected less willingness now with higher 
production and weaker prices to try to solve the problem 
nevertheless they expected opec secretarygeneral subroto to put 
forth proposals for drawing up quotas that would consider only 
oilrelated factors some members have suggested that quotas take 
into account a countrys need for oil revenue as determined by 
its foreign debt balance of payments and population 
while quotas were likely to grab most of the attention the 
ministers were also expected to decide whether to boost their supply 
cap to 20 million barrels a day in the last quarter 
an opec official who demanded anonymity said there was a 
slight possibility they would do so 
they may want to narrow the gap between the quota and actual 
production said bahman karbassioun an oil consultant in vienna 
austria 
but he said production could go even higher if countries 
failed to agree to abide by their ceilings 
the international energy agency reported in its monthly oil 
market report that the nations lifted output in august to 216 
million barrels a day the highest so far this year the agency is 
an arm of the organization for economic cooperation and development 
made up of twodozen western nations 
the eightmember longterm strategy and pricemonitoring 
committee includes ministers from algeria indonesia iran iraq 
kuwait nigeria saudi arabia and venezuela the other five nations 
gabon ecuador libya qatar and the united arab emirates were 
also invited to attend 
saudi arabias oil chief hisham nazer was reported recovering 
from surgery earlier this month in the united states and was not 
expected to attend

ferranti international signal plc said thursday it 
plans to sell 158 million in assets to reduce its debt and that it 
had reached agreement with its creditor banks on a support program 
the program is to help ferranti weather any financial 
difficulties resulting from losses related to irregularities it 
recently discovered in its accounts 
ferrantis discovery of possible contract fraud by its lancaster 
pabased subsidiary international signal and control led the 
company to seek assurances from its banks they would hold open lines 
of credit 
ferranti chairman derek alunjones announced the latest 
developments in a thursday letter to employees a copy of which was 
obtained by the apdow jones news service 
it said the company has now reached agreement with its bankers 
by which credit facilities for the company are in place to take it 
forward 
the letter didnt elaborate on the extent of the credit 
it said ferranti was in talks with parties for the sale of about 
158 million or 100 million british pounds of peripheral 
assets 
alunjones said monday that an investigation of contract 
irregularities at international signal and control suggested that 
ferranti was at least misled and possibly made the victim of 
serious fraud 
but he said these problems affected only a few transactions and 
were not connected with other important contracts 
the sunday times of london reported that the company might have 
to write off 237 million or more against nonexistent contracts for 
which the company had previously believed it had been paid 
the newspaper also reported that international signal and control 
has been the target of a secret twoyear investigation by the us 
justice department for allegedly selling arms illegally in the 
middle east and south africa 
trading in ferranti shares was suspended last week and the annual 
shareholders meeting postponed due to problems with the companys 
accounts 
ferranti merged with international signal and control two years 
ago in a 656 million deal

some concern about the dollars strength but at regularly scheduled 
meeting of bundesbank officials thursday failed to result in an 
expected hike in west german interest rates 
some traders are anticipating higher west german and japanese 
interest rates in tandem with softer rates in the united states a 
scenario that would depress the dollar 
that would take away the interestrate differential which is 
sustaining the demand for dollars flanagan said 
separately the dollar failed to respond to the commerce 
departments downward revision in the secondquarter gross national 
product the government pegged economic growth at a moderate 25 
percent during the apriljune period

grain and soybean futures prices rallied strongly thursday on the 
chicago board of trade as the markets braced for the first hard 
freeze of the season in the midwest 
on other markets silver futures were sharply higher for the 
second consecutive session energy futures were mixed and livestock 
and meat futures were mixed 
wheat futures settled 2 cents to 3 cents higher with the contract 
for delivery in december at 394 a bushel corn futures were 
unchanged to 3 cents higher with december at 231 a bushel oats 
were 1 cents to 2 cents higher with december at 141 a bushel 
soybeans were 3 cents lower to 7 cents higher with november at 
582 a bushel 
the rally was rooted in forecasts for freezing temperatures this 
weekend and early next week possibly reaching as far south as 
northern arkansas and tennessee 
this is recordbreaking or nearrecordbreaking type cold 
coming in said charles notis of freesenotis weather inc a 
private forecasting firm in des moines iowa 
most corn and soybean crops west of the mississippi river and in 
illinois have matured beyond the danger stage but the crops in 
other midwestern states east of the mississippi especially 
soybeans are susceptible to freeze damage 
notis estimated that 500 million bushels of soybeans a little 
less than a quarter of the crop were still vulnerable to frost 
damage and that 45 million to 70 million bushels could be hurt by 
the arctic high pressure system sweeping down from northwestern 
canada 
most of that damage is likely to occur in indiana and ohio he 
said 
in the western corn belt where the crops are more mature i 
dont think youre talking about yield losses i think youre 
talking about quality problems said dale gustafson an analyst 
with drexel burnham lambert inc 
frost could slow the natural drying of mature corn and lock some 
chlorophyll into notquiteripe soybeans causing some 
discoloration gustafson said 
dennis michelsen a meteorologist with murray amp trettl inc of 
northfield ill predicted a lesssevere freeze than notis 
still he said i would expect to see a killing frost over a 
great portion of the upper midwest by early next week weve got 
quite a cold snap here

immunex corp on thursday announced a plan that 
will transform it from a researchdominated firm in medical 
biotechnology into a conventional pharmaceutical company 
the 8yearold company based in seattle said it would achieve 
the transition primarily by reacquiring rights to sell 
immunexdeveloped products in the united states in return its 
business partners will get rights to some other immunex products 
primarily for overseas distribution 
immunexs plan will require the company to build a sales staff 
from scratch but it should permit it to keep more of the profits 
from its work said joseph edelman an analyst at labe simpson amp co 
overall i think its an aggressive strategy edelman said 
in overthecounter trading thursday immunex stock fell 50 cents 
to 1650 
immunex uses genesplicing and other biotechnology techniques to 
create products for medical treatment mainly products that either 
promote or inhibit the activity of the immune system 
products that are being tested on people in governmentsupervised 
trials include ones for cancer therapy wound healing and protection 
of bone marrow from the harmful effects of radiation therapy and 
chemotherapy 
the biggest threat to immunex is that other companies developing 
products in the same field could challenge its patent position 
edelman said 
at the end of 1988 immunex had marketing rights for only two of 
its own products after the changes announced thursday some of 
which occurred earlier this year it will have rights to more than a 
dozen 
like many small biotech companies immunex had given marketing 
rights for its products to other companies in exchange for research 
funding and help in manufacturing even after the deals other 
companies will retain foreign marketing rights for many 
immunexrelated products 
immunexs partners include eastman kodak co west germanys 
behringwerke ag and syntex corp 
the restructuring will give immunex a fiveyear head start on its 
plan to transform itself into a conventional pharmaceutical company 
by 1995 stephen duzan the chairman and chief executive said at a 
new york news conference 
were going to be a modestsized but fully integrated 
pharmaceutical company duzan said in an interview 
immunex said it is poised to enter the cancer market in the 
coming five years and the infectious disease and autoimmune disease 
markets in 1995 to 2000 autoimmune diseases are those such as 
arthritis and diabetes in which the body is attacked by its own 
immunesystem defenses 
immunex reacquired worldwide marketing and manufacturing rights 
to interleukin1 receptor and interleukin4 receptor products by 
restructuring its joint venture with kodaks sterling drug co 
it also reacquired us comarketing and manufacturing rights 
from behringwerke ag for cmcsf granulocyte macrophage colony 
stimulating factor interleukin3 and other csf products 
in return it gave behringwerke the foreign rights to a package 
of receptor products including receptors for interleukin1 
interleukin4 and other undisclosed receptor products 
it retained all north american rights for all receptor products 
receptors can block the destructive action of the immune system by 
serving as decoys for attackers

itt consumer financial corp agreed thursday 
to pay what could total more than 50 million for allegedly bilking 
hundreds of thousands of californians with loans later packed with 
extra requirements 
california attorney general john van de kamp called the civil 
settlement capping a threeyear investigation one of the largest 
and most sweeping consumer fraud settlements in american history 
he said minneapolisbased itt lured applicants into expensive 
loans packed with extras such as various forms of insurance and 
thrift club memberships applicants were bilked of as much as 2000 
each he said 
itt is the parent company of codefendants aetna finance co 
which van de kamp said had no connection with aetna insurance co 
itt lyndon property insurance co and itt lyndon life insurance co 
all the consumers involved are to be sent letters explaining the 
settlement 
van de kamp estimated as many as 300000 victims but said only 
about one third are expected to seek restitution with the total 
return between 25 million and 50 million 
itt also will pay 105 million to establish consumer protection 
trust funds 867 million in civil penalties and 575000 for legal 
costs and a tollfree phone number for consumers claiming refunds 
van de kamp said itt took advantage of people in desperate need 
of money and charged up to 35 percent interest on loans and 
attached items 
itt said in a statement it agreed to restitution at the same time 
a civil suit was filed thursday in alameda county superior court it 
neither admitted nort denied wrongdoing 
itt said the accusations without doubt were contraventions to 
our procedures and not a pattern of behavior condoned by the 
company but added that preexisting safeguards existed on 
loans and insurance 
claimants will be entitled to interest paid interest on the 
interest for years involved and the cost of all extras

jp morgan amp co inc moved ahead of other major 
banking companies thursday by adding 2 billion to its cushion of 
reserves for loan losses indicating deeper pessimism about the 
chances of repayment by developing countries 
morgans action was far more severe than those taken earlier this 
week by chase manhattan corp and manufacturers hanover corp 
morgans reserves now equal 100 percent of its medium and 
longterm loans to developing countries in contrast chases equal 
46 percent after its addition this week and manufacturers hanovers 
36 percent 
morgan the parent of morgan guaranty trust co said it would 
continue doing business in developing countries but would focus on 
merchant banking rather than general lending merchant banking 
involves providing advice trading and investing and finance 
we will continue to consider lending in appropriate specific 
transactions we intend to continue to play a constructive role in 
developing countries morgan spokeswoman kathleen baum said 
the bigger cushion indicates morgan has gotten tired of prolonged 
and unfruitful negotiations with debtor nations on repayment said 
stephen berman a banking analyst at county securities usa 
i think they just want to say the hell with this he said 
morgan the nations thirdlargest bankholding company also is 
one of the financially strongest that means it was able to take the 
punishment of the 2 billion addition which will result in a loss 
of about 18 billion in the current quarter 
morgans action could be an indication of trouble for the 
negotiations on debt relief under a plan devised by treasury 
secretary nicholas f brady berman said less developed countries 
have debts of 13 trillion 
early on in this process everybody sort of pulled together 
followed the lead of citibank berman said everybody is sort of 
cutting and running now and pursuing their own interest 
this weeks round of additions to loanloss reserves was 
triggered by the conclusion last week of an accord to provide debt 
relief to mexico under the brady plan which emphasizes debt 
forgiveness by the banks 
the terms of the mexico accord made banks acknowledge that they 
had been overly optimistic in their earlier expectations for 
repayment but morgans action seemed to go beyond necessity berman 
said 
economic and political problems have intensified in several 
countries where we have significant exposure including problems in 
paying interest when due lewis t preston morgans chairman 
said in a written statement 
preston said he was concerned that debtor countries could be 
expecting more help from the brady plan than the industrial 
countries are likely to provide 
he also said achieving satisfactory loan restructuring 
agreements will also be more and more difficult because of 
increasingly divergent approaches to ldc lessdeveloped country 
debt problem among bank lenders and among governments 
morgan now has a total of 3 billion in loanloss reserves with 
28 billion of that unofficially allocated to loans to developing 
countries that 28 billion is equal to 70 percent of morgans 
total loans to developing countries and 100 percent of the 
mediumand longterm loans to those nations in an indication of 
morgans financial strength moodys investors service and standards 
and poors both confirmed their investmentgrade ratings on morgan 
senior debt 
the last big round of additions to reserves was in late 1987 and 
many banking companies have not taken any action since then 
for example chemical banking corps loanloss reserves equal 
just 28 percent of its loans to developing countries the level it 
reached in late 1987 spokesman charles salmans said 
chase manhattan said wednesday it would take a 131 billion 
charge in the third quarter largely to boost its reserves for 
troubled loans to developing countries 
chase also announced plans to raise 500 million by selling new 
common shares 
chase said its reserve increase would boost its reserves for 
losses on loans to developing countries to 46 percent of its 62 
billion in such loans and would produce a thirdquarter loss for the 
holding company of 111 billion 
manufacturers hanover on monday added 950 million to its 
loanloss reserves and sold control of its assetbased lending unit 
cit group to japans daiichi kangyo bank for 128 billion 
manufacturers hanover also agreed to sell a 49 percent stake in 
the parent company to daiichi kangyo for another 120 million 
manufacturers hanover said the addition to its loanloss reserve 
would produce a thirdquarter loss of 775 million

chinas figure for 1988 was not in yet in 1987 the average 
chinese had an income of 510 no figure was given for taiwan which

for 1989 we expect to see a modest correction in what have 
been very high rates of growth down to more sustainable levels for 
india china and several middleincome countries said attila 
karaosmanoglu the banks vicepresident for asia 
the world banks figures deal largely with third world countries 
since it is the largest source of loans to raise their standards of 
living statistics for 1988 are not yet complete officials said 
scattered reports for a few european countries that borrow from 
the bank showed increases in cyprus from 4810 to 5010 and greece 
from 4310 to 4440 but in yugoslavia there was a drop to 3080 
from 3180 in 1987

since 1980 when the average income for the area was 570 a year in 
1988 it was 440 the republic of south africa is not included in 
this calculation

china prefers to sell its goods for western 
hard currency but its imports from the soviet union paid for by 
bartering are way up the central intelligence agency reports 
chinese imports of goods such as timber and fertilizer where 
the quality of the soviet commodity is comparable to that elsewhere 
will probably grow this year as beijing turns to barter to conserve 
foreign exchange the cia said in an analysis prepared for 
congress and released this week to the press 
sinosoviet trade grew 27 percent least year to a twoway total 
of 33 billion and figures for the first half of 1989 show even 
stronger growth with chinese imports surging by 63 percent and 
exports up 12 percent the report said 
trade along the sovietchinese border has risen swiftly to 
account for 10 percent of the two countries trade welcomed by 
remote chinese provinces lacking easy access to other markets it 
noted 
the report also disclosed that 8000 chinese laborers are working 
on projects in the soviet union under arrangements generally 
providing payment to china with a percentage of the production at 
least 5000 more are expected to follow it said 
the two countries normalized relations last spring providing a 
boost to their economic relations which however appear to be 
reaching their limits since beijing will continue to favor western 
technology said the cia

the board of governors of the chicago mercantile 
exchange said thursday it had approved a proposal to allow traders 
to buy or sell blocks of standard and poors 500 stock index futures 
outside the trading pit 
the rule approved wednesday at the boards regular meeting is 
comparable to rules on block buying and selling on major us stock 
exchanges the board said in a release thursday 
the rule will help lessen the impact of large trades on the 
market said john geldermann chairman of the board of governors 
the board said the merc is the first futures exchange to adopt 
such a plan 
under the rule a member firm with a customer order to buy or 
sell more than 300 sampp futures contracts could attempt to find a 
counterparty to the trade outside of the trading pit 
once a counterparty is found the firm would notify an exchange 
official and announce to the trading pit the size and type of order 
the intended price would not be disclosed at that point 
members in the pit would have the opportunity to trade with all 
or part of the order the remainder of the order not filled within 
the open outcry process in the pit would be traded to the 
counterparty at the agreedupon price 
the rule will be submitted to the commodity futures trading 
commission for approval if approved it will be used on a pilot 
basis for the sampp futures contract which is the most heavily traded 
stock index futures contract in the world according to the board

with thursdays announcement of the states 113th 
bank closing this year texas tied last years record on a scorecard 
of failure that experts say may slow but wont end for several 
years 
we believe that 1990 is going to show a slight increase in the 
number of independently chartered banks that fail said texas 
banking commissioner kenneth littlefield but we will continue to 
have bank failures for two more years that are the result of past 
lending decisions 
we have seen the peak as far as the absolute numbers are 
concernedadded sandy flannigan a houstonbased analyst for 
painewebber inc 
nationally the numbers should remain about the same next year 
according to alan whitney a spokesman for the federal deposit 
insurance corp in washington dc 
the failures will continue whitney said even though the 
economy in texas and other parts of the southwest has begun to 
stabilize somewhat because changes in the banking industry always 
lag from 18 months to 24 months 
on thursday littlefield shut down rose capital bank in tyler 
the bank which had assets of 646 million and deposits of about 
611 million was purchased by first city bancorp of texas inc for 
25000 first city also will purchase about 464 million of rose 
capitals assets 
the fdic will provide 168 million in assistance and retain 
assets with a book value of 182 million 
the 113 texas failures this year included 20 involved in the 
federal seizure of mcorp banks and 24 from the shutdown of banks 
owned by texas american bancshares inc 
the number does not include the 12 banks of national bancshares 
corp of texas that were bought by equimark corp of pittsburgh in a 
federally assisted transaction 
last years 113 included 40 banks taken over from first 
republicbank corp those banks became ncnb texas national bank 
which remains the states largest bank 
nationally rose capital was the 160th failure this year a huge 
jump from 10 years ago ten banks failed each year from 1979 to 1981 
and we thought it was armageddon the fdics whitney said 
since then the numbers have grown each year 42 in 1982 48 in 
1983 80 in 1984 120 in 1985 138 in 1986 184 in 1987 and 200 last 
year 
although regulators frequently cite poor management and 
inadequate supervision as reasons for specific failures robert 
rieke a banking analyst at rauscher pierce refsnes inc in dallas 
said regulators themselves are partially at fault 
he said that from 1982 to 1985 the regulators just 
indiscriminately approved bank charters and these banking 
organizations never had the opportunity to grow in size 
rieke predicted it would take five years to clean the slate 
littlefield who took over as texas banking commissioner three 
years ago said in hindsight its easy to make that conclusion 
that there were too many banks chartered

do takeover battles really end when the power 
system blows during a climactic board meeting 
probably not but that was about the only thing clearly out of 
character thursday as twa chairman and investor carl icahn and a 
cast of corporate and civic heavyweights including the rev jesse 
jackson put some of their wellhoned moves on public display in a 
threehour simulated takeover 
i think its been incredibly realistic arthur r taylor the 
dean of the graduate school of business administration at fordham 
university said shortly before the lights dimmed and the 
microphones went dead 
he said the participants in the program that people from his 
school designed were acting as they do at real board meetings 
robert o anderson the former head of the atlantic richfield co 
who played the role of the chief executive of the company under 
siege rated the interplay among the board members surprisingly 
good 
but frederick h joseph the chief executive of the investment 
banking firm drexel burnham lambert inc cautioned that there were 
limits to the imagined reality what we are doing in 10 minutes 
takes 10 days he said 
in the game joseph played an investment banker advising icahn 
who was cast as an investor with a small stake in the beleaguered 
target company and was considering launching an alternative takeover 
bid 
the program was put on at a conference run by the world 
management council an international organization of management 
groups 
the simulation went a step further than recent exercises in which 
prominent people in various fields are brought together for a 
moderatorled discussion about a hypothetical case 
in this corporate war game the directors of the imaginary main 
street industries inc a southern retailing company met in one 
room to mourn the death of their chairman and to assess their 
options should the swirl of takeover rumors produce an offer 
at the same time icahn was closeted in a room across the hall 
talking onebyone with with financial advisers union officials and 
representatives of a foundation that had an 18 percent stake in the 
company about his plans to make a bid for the company 
several hundred people attending the conference were invited to 
walk back and forth between the rooms as they wished as the scenario 
unfolded through a series of twists and turns 
conference staffers added to the atmosphere with periodic updates 
on the companys stock price and news headlines such as icahns 
notice that he bought an 8 percent stake in the firm 
observers got to watch icahn court the unions and the foundation 
for support before going to the board they saw him needle his 
investment bankers about the fees they wanted to finance the bid and 
get so swept up in the franctic pace of activity that he chided an 
inattentive assistant by blurting out come on youre not at 
smith college 
when icahn finally got in to see the board he found they had 
been doing their homework as well and felt that neither his offer 
nor a competing bid was worth accepting 
board members said they would investigate a recapitalization 
instead 
the reallife power outage cut short any additional countermoves 
and the game was declared finished 
i enjoyed it anderson said icahn concurred saying it was 
entertaining it was fun 
jackson the civil rights activist who played a foundation 
representative interested in protecting the communities and workers 
served by the stores said the game created a healthy 
environment for discussion of tough issues 
i hope it increases all of our sensitivity he said

investors who say they lost 250 million on 
junk bonds sold by lincoln savings amp loan association sued the state 
of california on thursday claiming state officials never should 
have allowed the bond sale 
the suit alleges the department of corporations disregarded its 
own findings and warnings by savings and loan regulators when it 
approved the sale of bonds by lincolns parent company american 
continental corp 
it accuses top department of corporations officials including 
christine bender the head of the department of conflict of 
interest because of their ties to the law firm representing american 
continental the phoenix company that federal officials are suing 
for 11 billion american continental is operating under chapter 11 
of federal bankruptcy laws 
bender who once worked for the law firm declined detailed 
comment but said our actions were appropriate we think we did 
more than what was required by the law and we are persuaded that a 
court will find in our favor 
attorney joseph cotchett added the state as a defendant in an 
orange county superior court classaction suit filed on behalf of 
23000 bondholders the suit says many of the investors were elderly 
people who believed the bonds were insured because they were 
purchased in lincoln savings offices 
the suit seeks return of the 250 million unspecified punitive 
damages and attorneys fees 
lincoln savings is insolvent and has been seized by thrift 
regulators with estimated losses to taxpayers running as high as 
25 billion the largest sampl bailout in history 
federal thrift regulators have sued american continental 
officials for 11 billion with additional penalties that could 
bring the total to 24 billion 
that suit accuses lincoln officials of racketeering insider 
trading illegal loans sham realestate and tax transactions and 
the fraudulent sale of lincoln stock to employees of the parent 
company 
the orange county suit amended thursday says state regulators 
had enough documentation that they knew or should have known that 
american continental was near collapse in 1986 when the regulators 
approved the sale of 200 million in uninsured junk bonds known as 
subordinated debentures 
junk bonds are highrisk highyield securities usually offered 
by companies with a great deal of debt on their books or in weak 
financial condition 
in addition state officials approved the sale of 150 million 
more in american continental junk bonds in 1988 
the suit says the bonds were extremely risky to investors because 
of american continentals precarious financial condition the 
companys speculative investment portfolio and the high 
probability that the subordinated debentures would be sold to 
persons seeking to make federally insured deposits and who would 
not understand the risks of subordinated debentures 
when a company goes bankrupt holders of its junk bonds are among 
the last creditors to get paid 
the head of american continental arizona businessman charles 
keating contributed 366250 to california politicians from 1986 to 
1988 including 79000 to gov george deukmejian most of it for 
his 1986 reelection bid 
at a department of corporations meeting on the bond offering in 
march 1988 los angeles attorney karl samuelian deukmejians chief 
fund raiser personally represented american continental the 
meeting helped lead to approval of the bond sale 
bender once worked for samuelians firm 
deukmejian spokesman tom beermann said thursday that mr 
keating was one of 56000 individuals who contributed to the 
governors reelection campaign campaign contributions in no way 
influenced any action by the deukmejian administration
