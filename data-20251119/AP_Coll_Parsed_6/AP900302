president bush on friday claimed 
progress in the war on drugs saying the days of the drug lords 
are numbered and asking tv producers to help portray the 
destructive potential of narcotics 
bush compared antidrug efforts to nations casting out 
oppressive governments saying people across america are casting 
off the oppression of drugs 
week by week day by day millions of americans in thousands 
of towns are standing up to make the same courageous choice 
drugfree neighorhoods drugfree schools drugfree kids he 
told several thousand school children at a rally sponsored by 
orange countys drug use is life abuse program 
earlier in los angeles bush urged television industry 
producers to make antidrug themes part of their programming 
he called on the academy of television arts and sciences to make 
tv a force for positive change 
at the celebritystudded santa anna rally attended by 15000 
people movie star chuck norris pledged to conquer drug traffickers 
in his next film 
the president broke the news of a massive local drug bust 
nearly a half ton of cocaine worth 30 million on the street the 
orange county sheriffs office said it would not be able to release 
details on the street but according to lt dick olson bushs 
remarks would not hurt the prosecution 
bush told the santa ana rally that the drug abuse is life 
abuse message is beginning to sink in 
recently we have seen some scattered but hopeful new signs of 
progress against the horror of drugs he said citing antidrug 
community efforts around the country 
he said cases against 14 accused international drug traffickers 
are pending in us courts following their extraditions 
the days of the drug lords may not be over yet but their days 
are numbered bush said 
bushs optimistic assessment on drugwar progress comes as his 
administration seeks 106 billion from congress to combat drugs in 
fiscal 1991 
administration officials including bushs drug policy director 
william bennett recently have been claiming there are signs of a 
turnaround in the countrys drug abuse problem 
weve covered a lot of ground in the drug war but tough 
challenges remain bush told the santa ana rally drug abuse in 
this country is still far too widespread 
continuing his lobbying for widespread community support bush 
praised the television industry for antidrug commercials and for 
programming that portrays the negative side of drugs 
thank goodness the days when popular culture glorified and 
glamorized drug use are fading fast he said 
he said he did not seek tv depiction of a fantasy world where 
drugs dont exist but rather treatment of drugs with the same 
degree of realism tv brings to so many other subjects to show 
in the real world how drugs destroy 
bush sandwiched the antidrug events into a fourday california 
trip that was primarily oriented to republican party politicking 
and a meeting with japans prime minister toshiki kaifu 
fridays rally featured appearances by los angeles rams 
cheerleaders and remarks by tv evangelist robert schuller 
the antidrug events friday followed bushs appearance at a 
california chamber of commerce dinner thursday night where he 
called on businesses to prescreen job applicants for drug use 
we need to make it very clear to every american that if you 
do drugs you dont get hired he said 
socalled casual users and their money keep these merchants of 
death in business he said 
america now condemns what has too long been condoned the 
country has had enough he declared

a housing policy that denied an 
unmarried couple a place to live because of their relationship will 
be revised the states american civil liberties union chapter said 
thursday 
the tentative agreement with the woonsocket housing authority 
which needs the approval of us district judge ronald r lagueux 
would consider unmarried couples a family if they meet certain 
criteria including the length of the relationship whether the 
applicants have children together and the existence of joint bank 
accounts 
were going to review our policies and make some changes 
said ernest lafond the housing authoritys director who rferred 
other questions to his attorney 
the new policy stems from a lawsuit filed by susan arseneau and 
dana dagnese who sued after they were denied emergency housing in 
december 1988 following their eviction from an unsafe apartment 
a married couple in the same building was given emergency 
housing by the wha while the plaintiffs were turned down for such 
housing solely because the agency did not consider them a 
family said steve brown executive director of the aclus 
rhode island affiliate 
arseneau and dagnese had lived together for six years and were 
expecting their third child when they were evicted 
the case drew national attention when lagueux at a hearing a 
year ago at which he denied an emergency restraining order against 
enforcement of the policy said heres a couple in an illicit 
relationship who are creating children for the welfare rolls while 
others who qualify for housing are shunted aside 
brown hailed the pending agreement which affects all public 
housing as a blow to discrimination against unmarried couples 
resolution of this lawsuit will simply affirm a growing trend 
across the country in which housing authorities are recognizing 
that discrimination on the basis of marital status is unfair and 
inappropriate he said 
but the attorney for the housing authority steve rodio said 
the main reason the couple was evicted was because dagnese was 
legally married to another woman at the time 
rodio said dagneses marriage to someone else prompted lagueux 
to cite the states criminal statute against bigamy and said if 
the agency had let the couple stay in the apartment it would have 
encouraged a potentially bigamous relationship 
whether he was single or not wouldnt have mattered said 
john dineen the couples lawyer the existing rule is you have 
to be married to each other to live together 
dagnese was awaiting his divorce in massachusetts after having 
been separated for many years when he and arseneau were 
evicted said dineen 
the lawsuit filed by the aclu and rhode island legal services 
on behalf of arseneau and dagnese claimed the agencys action 
violated the couples constitutional rights to freedom of 
association family privacy and equal protection under the law 
dineen also said the policy was in violation of federal and state 
housing laws 
dineen and rodio didnt know when lagueux would rule on the 
agreement nor whether the couple still wanted to live in city 
housing 
theyre still seeking housing and they continue to want to be 
together dineen said

president bush opening a twoday 
desert summit assured japanese prime minister toshiki kaifu on 
friday that a cutback of us troops in asia will not undermine 
stability or security there an official said 
the two leaders avoided discussing japans huge trade surplus 
and the growing trade tensions between the worlds largest economic 
powers leaving those subjects for saturday 
welcome sir a smiling bush said as he shook hands with 
kaifu across a conference table at a posh country club 
despite the economic conflicts bush emphasized the positive in 
his opening remarks noting there are so many areas of common 
interest where we have such a strong relationship with japan 
the very fact that kaifu responded to his invitation for the 
hastily arranged meeting was an important display of your 
feelings about our relationship bush said 
certainly my inviting you here is a strong indication from us 
about the importance of this relationship bush said 
the two leaders met for an hour before gathering again for 
dinner at the heavily guarded estate of millionaire publisher 
walter annenberg 
emerging from a oneonone meeting bush said we had a very 
good discussion 
there was no sign of friction although white house press 
secretary marlin fitzwater said bush would warn the prime minister 
that congress was in very tough mood in insisting that japan 
lower barriers to us goods and services 
in a statement afterward fitzwater said the opening session was 
devoted to security issues 
the united states is considering reducing its 120000 troops in 
asia by about 10 percent that would mean a reduction of 5000 
troops in japan 
in addition washington is pressing tokyo for a sizeable 
increase in japans 24 billion annual support for american troops 
stationed in the country 
bush told kaifu that the changes in the us defense posture 
will not affect either deterrence or stability nor its 
commitment to its asian allies fitzwater said 
referring to us hopes that japan will increase defense 
spending fitzwater said the two leaders discussed the issue of 
burden sharing noting the need for suitable arrangements for 
balanced costsharing 
fitzwater said kaifu stressed the importance to coordinate our 
policies and tackle the issues from the standpoint of mutual 
cooperation 
shigeo takenaka deputy spokesman for the japanese foreign 
ministry said that to solve the difficult trade issues we must 
continue to strengthen cooperation in other areas such as aid to 
latin america and the emerging democracies in eastern europe 
we certainly didnt sense any ambush here he said when 
asked whether the americans were coming down hard on tokyo over 
trade 
the meeting room at morningside country club was decked out in 
two large floral arrangements and overlooked landscaped gardens and 
manicured lawns that contrasted sharply with the barren nearby 
desert and snowcovered mountains in the distance 
the meeting room at morningside country club was decked out in 
two large floral arrangements and overlooked landscaped gardens and 
manicured lawns that contrasted sharply with the barren nearby 
desert and snowcovered mountains in the distance 
bush and his guest were to dine informally at the sprawling 
heavily guarded estate of millionaire publisher walter annenberg 
bush and kaifu both arrived in nearby palm springs los angeles 
within minutes of each other and rode in from the airport together 
in the presidents armored limosine 
during the 25minute ride bush congratulated kaifu on his 
election victory last month and emphasized the importance of our 
security relationship fitzwater said 
the president will stress the importance of opening japans 
markets and emphasize the possibility of us sanctions if action 
isnt forthcoming to cool tensions between the worlds largest 
economic powers fitzwater said 
in los angeles earlier bush himself said of kaifu weve got 
to convince him that weve got to move forward with some of the 
tough problems 
still there was concern in both washington and tokyo that the 
hastily arranged meeting had raised unrealistic expectations about 
a breakthrough in trade conflicts 
economists of all persuasions and the administration admit that 
even if japan abolished all trade restrictions of which the united 
states has complained the major part of japans 49 billion annual 
trade surplus with the united states would remain because of 
american appetites for cars electronics and other highquality 
japanese goods 
i dont think we expect any action on the major issues before 
us fitzwater said i could be surprised 
us business leaders also said they expected no breakthrough 
but raised the possibility that the discussions could set the stage 
for a fullfledged trade summit between the two leaders later in 
the year 
congressional sources said they understood kaifu might be 
prepared to offer some small concessions in an effort to show 
progress in the trade talks 
one congressional source who spoke on condition that his name 
not be used said that kaifu was expected to propose lower tariffs 
on a portion of us finished wood products although the reduction 
would cover only a small portion of us lumber sales to japan 
wood products satellites and supercomputers are three key areas 
where negotiators have been focusing their attention in an effort 
to lower japanese barriers to sales of american products 
kaifu flew to palm springs in response to an invitation issued 
by bush during a middleofthenight telephone call last friday 
asserting itself congress has imposed deadlines for talks on a 
dozen issues ranging from supercomputers to lumber and even the 
cultural foundations of the two societies 
us trade representative carla hills said this week the 
usjapanese relationship was at a difficult point and needs to 
have the highest level of attention 
for its part japan wants the united states to reduce its huge 
budget deficit and increase americans savings rate thus reducing 
demands for japanese imports 
kaifus standing in the ruling liberal democratic party is 
considered tenuous and a successful summit could bolster his 
status 
last may the united states put japan on a trade hit list 
for alleged unfair barriers to american wood products satellites 
and supercomputers 
the administration has until june 16 to negotiate a removal of 
the barriers if negotiations fail the administration can impose 
retaliatory tariffs which japan argues would violate international 
rules on fair trade

the doors of deposed dictator nicolae 
ceausescus palatial planned headquarters were opened to the public 
for the first time evoking awe and outrage from the visitors 
about 2000 romanians paid about 25 cents each on thursday to 
enter the unfinished monumental house of the republic one of the 
worlds largest buildings situated on a manmade hill in the heart 
of the capital 
in groups and individually they shuffled through the mammoth 
ballrooms meeting halls amphitheatres living suites and offices 
they gawked at hundreds of marble columns red velvet drapes 
extensive gold ornamentation and diamondstudded chandeliers 
including one said to be the biggest in europe in 800seat column 
hall ushers urged visitors not to touch the elegant furniture 
the massive building built entirely with local materials was 
meant to house the leading bodies of the state and communist party 
and included imperial suites for the dictatorial couple ceausescu 
and his wife elena 
the municipality has not yet decided what to do with the 
building which has cost 1 billion over six years of construction 
one of the reasons for the open house which is to last two 
months is to solicit suggestions from the public 
so far according to chief engineer alexander baumgarten the 
most popular suggestions are making it an international conference 
and exhibition center or a sort of home for romanias artists 
some people finding the buildings extravagance offensive in 
this impoverished country have also proposed destroying it 
but baumgarten who headed the buildings qualitycontrol team 
until construction ceased when ceausescu was overthrown dec 22 is 
lobbying hard for the building to be finished 
he said it can be completed in two years with another 200 
million to 250 million 
in addition to food and shelter we need beauty in our lives 
what would the world be without art museums and palaces 
we admit the exterior is less attractive because the former 
president imposed his views on the architects sighed baumgarten 
but if you take an architecture textbook and inspect the 
ornaments and columns in the interior you will see that this is 
in fact a monumental work of art 
he proudly reeled off the buildings vital statistics two huge 
halls two amphitheatres 60 large salons 540 offices and another 
thousandodd smaller rooms including its three underground levels 
the building reaches a maximum height of 100 yards 
the total surface area of the sprawling structure at 360000 
square yards is three times bigger than the versailles palace 
and also bigger than the pentagon said baumgarten 
the palace wryly dubbed the house of the people by the romanian 
press is only one of several unfinished buildings in an area known 
as the civic center encompassing several square miles where 15000 
buildings once stood they were razed over the past decade by 
ceausescus master builders 
at the height of the construction 20000 workers a day entered 
the building with en estimated million workers in the project over 
the past six years 
but for the average citizen the building site was strictly 
offlimits 
on thursday they shuffled through on wooden planks laid out on 
the walltowall carpeting most staring in silent awe at the 
extravagant luxury which evoked both angry indignation and 
patriotism 
in the vast empty romania hall an old woman commanded foreign 
journalists to write more take more pictures to show what 
beautiful things we romanians can create 
others were less enthusiastic 
one middleaged man silently shook his head in ceausescus huge 
relaxing room last visited by the dictator on dec 10 
while we starved while we had no heating at night he built 
this unbelievable monument to himself and elena 
mrs ceausescus adjacent room was slightly smaller but more 
ornate with lace curtains and elaborate wood carvings rimmed with 
gold studs 
monstrous said another man he must have hated us 
horribly 
no it wasnt hate said another woman we were in the 
grip of an unspeakable insanity

the opposition victory in nicaragua 
strips el salvadors leftist rebels of their only government ally 
in central america and tests the mettle of the regional peace 
process 
the nicaraguan conflict has absorbed most of the energy of the 
negotiations since their outset in 1987 suddenly the war is all 
but over and that leaves el salvador in the spotlight 
the full implications of the sandinista defeat remain to be 
seen but it is clearly a blow to the farabundo marti national 
liberation front 
el salvadors rightist president alfredo cristiani was elated 
by the outcome of the nicaraguan election 
the fmln is going to be left isolated like mr fidel castro 
in cuba he said of the rebel front that has been battling a 
series of usbacked governments in el salvador since 1979 
the fmln has long counted on managua for logistical and 
political support 
the salvadoran rebel front has offices in managua uses 
nicaragua for safe haven and according to us officials 
maintains a vital radio installation that serves as a command and 
control center for guerrillas in the field 
nicaragua which has the only leftist government in central 
america is also a source of arms for the fmln although the 
details are hotly debated 
the united states and the salvadoran government insist that 
nicaragua is a crucial source of weapons the sandinistas and the 
fmln dispute this 
the fmln one of the bestorganized and highly motivated rebel 
forces in the world can fight on if nicaraguas new prous 
government evicts them after taking office april 25 but the battle 
will be harder 
the loss of the only sympathetic government in the region 
clearly is serious for the fmln richard fagen the director of 
ltin american studies at stanford university and an international 
observer during the election 
some observers say the end of the nicaraguan war and the 
electoral loss of the sandinistas might pave the way for a 
negotiated solution in el salvador where a decade of war has 
claimed an estimated 73000 lives others say it might make the 
situation even more intractable 
maybe there will be a new focusing of attention a high 
priority on salvadoran peace prospects said former president 
jimmy carter another election observer 
sen christopher dodd dconn said he was afraid the 
sandinistas would pour arms into el salvador before leaving office 
on april 25 
dodd an election observer also said he feared hardliners in 
the salvadoran military and government might abandon the idea of 
negotiating assuming the sandinista loss was such a blow to the 
fmln that battlefield victory is now possible 
much depends on washington which has poured 4 billion into el 
salvador in a decade to fend off an fmln victory 
fagen said the united states will have to pressure the rightist 
government into serious talks with the fmln 
the only way to do this is to take a very active role with the 
salvadoran army he said 
the united states in central america has never been able to 
exercise its full power over local governments when it didnt have 
substantial control over the army 
one good sign for the peace process is the prospect of better 
relations between honduras and nicaragua if the 10000man 
usfinanced contra army in honduran border camps demobilizes 
if the new nicaraguan government manages to exert control over 
the sandinista army a 150000member giant armed by the soviet 
bloc regional tensions also should cool 
another strong motivation to continue the process is economic 
recovery war has sapped the regional economies and frightened away 
investors condemning millions of people to poverty 
new honduran president rafael callejas has been hoping get his 
nations staggering economy going again but like everyone elese in 
the region the fundamental condition is peace 
the prime mover of the central american peace process costa 
rican president oscar arias will be leaving office soon but a 
peaceful transition of power in nicaragua could go a long way 
towards helping the region reach the goal for which he won the 
nobel peace prize 
after the election arias said el salvador should follow 
nicaraguas example and seek a negotiated solution to the war that 
has claimed an estimated 73000 lives 
he said events in nicaragua should send a message to el 
salvador there is no sympathy in the world for those seek power 
through violence 
both the cristiani government and the fmln have said they are 
willing to talk but they are poles apart the last attempt at 
negotiations ended in midnovember when the rebels launched a 
monthlong offensive 
the fmln high command has praised the sandinistas and president 
daniel ortega for holding the election here and advancing the cause 
of democracy 
we will redouble our struggle for an authentic democracy in el 
salvador for which so much blood has been shed by our people 
the high command said after the election

offthecuff summary of a 7yearold ruling 
oconnor recently erred in describing a freespeech decision 
stemming from demonstrations at the courts imposing building on 
capitol hill 
oconnors mistake came during oral arguments over a federal 
regulation that bans soliciting donations on postal service 
property and was sparked by justice antonin scalias questioning 
of a lawyer 
after the lawyer contended that the areas outside all post 
offices are freespeech zones scalia asked what about us would 
we have to let people demonstrate outside on court property 
in what seemed to be an effort to get back to the case at hand 
oconnor interrupted to say the court already has ruled there is 
no right to picket on court property but only on the surrounding 
public sidewalks 
well not exactly whether federal law can make the courts 
property off limits to demonstrators remains an open question 
in a case called united states vs grace the court in 1983 
unanimously struck down as unconstitutional part of a federal law 
that banned demonstrators from court property and the public 
sidewalks surrounding it 
the court said the public has a constitutional right guaranteed 
by the first amendment to use a city sidewalk as one long soapbox 
subject to reasonable time place and manner regulations 
but the decision specifically left unanswered whether the 
federal laws ban on demonstrators could be applied to the courts 
property within the city sidewalks 
we need not make that judgment at this time justice byron 
r white wrote for the court back then because the ban imposed 
by congress covers the public sidewalks as well as the building 
and grounds inside the sidewalks oconnor joined whites opinion 
the supreme court is infallible when interpreting the 
constitution because no one can secondguess it but the courts 
nine justices are only human sometimes they make mistakes

the national law journal recently polled 805 citizens and 
concluded as have previous polls that americans do not know very 
much about their highest court 
fewer than onefourth of those asked knew that the court has 
nine members only one in three could name one of the nine 
among the justices john paul stevens is the least known by 
americans only 1 percent of those asked could name him oconnor 
is the bestknown justice with a 33 percent rating 
the polling was conducted among people over 18 the results 
might have been more encouraging if elementary schoolchildren were 
included

the administration is letting rhetoric 
outrun the reality by proposing spending cuts in forestry 
programs needed to implement president bushs plan to plant a 
billion new trees sen wyche fowler says 
the georgia democrat chairman of the senate agriculture 
subcommittee on conservation and forestry told administration 
officials thursday that bushs america the beautiful 
treeplanting proposal wont succeed without the support of private 
landowners 
those landowners he said wont support the program if theyre 
hit by new expenses that were covered by the forestry assistance 
programs the administration wants to cut 
one thing we cannot do is let the rhetoric outrun the 
reality fowler said if we tell people were going to plant a 
billion trees the resources have to be there 
patricia m kearney acting assistant secretary of agriculture 
for natural resources and environment said bushs 175 million 
initiative will help demonstrate americas commitment to address 
worldwide concerns about deforestation and global climate change 
she said it includes 110 million to provide matching funds to 
private rural landowners for tree planting and forest improvements 
30 million for a community treeplanting program that will rely on 
volunteers and 35 million to start a private foundation to 
promote tree planting 
but fowler argued that the program cannot be reconciled with 
other proposals in the administrations fiscal 1991 budget such as 
a nearly 50 percent cut in state and private forestry assistance 
funds including a reduction funding for the seedlings and nursery 
program 
with all the new tree planting where are you going to get the 
trees he asked 
dale robertson chief of the us forest service said most of 
the seedlings for the bush initiative will come from commercial and 
state programs the federal program provides only about 5 percent 
of the nations tree seedlings he said 
the administration budget also would reduce funding for pest 
management on private forests from 514 million this year to 417 
million next year and would slash fire protection spending for 
private forests from 133 million to 4 million 
its hard to see how that would be consistent with increased 
tree planting and maintaining healthy forests fowler said 
robertson said the proposed spending cuts for pest and fire 
protection were consistent with past administration efforts to 
shift those costs to the states and to private landowners 
we need to do the job with fire protection and insect 
protection but it gets down to the question of who pays for it 
he said

the twodecade battle over the seabrook 
nh power plant helped cripple the nuclear power industry 
pro and antinuclear advocates agreed on that much thursday as 
the nuclear regulatory commission approved seabrook for commercial 
operation what remained unclear was whether the approval would 
mark the industrys last hurrah or bring about a second life for 
nuclear power 
the facts are plain enough no utility has applied for a nuclear 
power license since 1978 and more than 100 reactor orders have been 
canceled in that time accidents at three mile island in 
pennsylvania and chernobyl in the soviet union spread concern about 
nuclear power from activists to the general public 
the industry is so much in defeat that theres not likely any 
utility thats ever again going to want to order one of these 
machines said robert backus counsel to the seacoast 
antipollution league a new hampshirebased group opposed to 
seabrook 
we feel like we have been instrumental in the collapse of 
nuclear power in this country and perhaps even around the world 
backus said 
seabrook owners waited 17 years from their application for a 
construction permit to the approval of a fullpower license and 
junk bonds used to help finance the plant through the long wait 
likely will not be available in future nuclear projects 
still there were optimists thursday after the nrcs 30 vote in 
favor of a seabrook license 
as our demand for electricity keeps growing we fully expect 
that well get back to building more new nuclear plants said 
harold b finger of the us council for energy awareness an 
association representing the nuclear industry todays vote means 
utilities can look with more confidence to nuclear energy as a part 
of their total strategy for providing americas fastgrowing 
electricity needs 
seabrooks own top executives were either uncertain or downright 
pessimistic about the industrys future 
new hampshire yankee president edward brown said i cant 
predict whether seabrook will become a bellwether for the 
future of the entire nuclear industry in the united states 
browns top deputy ted feigenbaum said the twodecade 
regulatory gauntlet run by seabrook must be changed if nuclear 
energy is to grow its taken too long he said 
the nrc has tried to address the problem with a new set of rules 
enacted last year they would allow a utility to receive advance 
approval if it chose a preapproved site and used a standard 
reactor design that had passed nrc muster said commission 
spokesman frank ingram 
but nrc chairman kenneth carr said i dont have any orders 
for new plants and he said the decline of nuclear power could 
lead to darker days and nights ahead 
as a private citizen it worries me that nobodys building 
power plants out there of any kind carr said power in the 
united states is not going to be sufficient in the next 10 years 
and well see the rolling blackouts that we saw in florida and 
texas over the winter theyll spread 
organized opposition was one key ingredient that discouraged 
utilities from building nuclear plants carr said the other was 
public utility regulators refusal to allow construction costs to 
be passed on to ratepayers until a plant was finished 
such a ruling in new hampshire led public service company of new 
hampshire owner of the largest seabrook share to abandon one of 
two reactors in 1986 and declare bankruptcy in 1988 
some members of congress appear to be moving in the direction of 
even tougher rules a house subcommittee plans to open hearings 
march 15 into the nrcs procedures in reaching the seabrook 
decision 
members of the massachusetts congressional delegation called the 
hearings after accusing the nrc of running roughshod over its own 
regulations to ram through the seabrook approval 
thursday was a day of mixed emotions for combatants in the 
seabrook fight proponents celebrated the licensing decision and 
worried about the nuclear power industry opponents hissed the nrc 
as it issued its ruling but declared victory in the war on nuclear 
power 
for pronuclear activists there is the hope that the seabrook 
experience will lead to a streamlined licensing process the 
attitude of opponents was typified by scott denman of the safe 
energy communication council a washingtonbased group 
seabrook is the last hurrah for a crippled industry denman 
said the nuclear power industry has failed to rally support on 
wall street or main street

a new agreement on sweeping air pollution 
controls is expected to ease senate passage of the measure 
although the accord with the white house is prompting criticism 
from environmentalists and industry not to mention some senators 
senate leaders and the bush administration announced agreement 
thursday on the most contentious parts of the bill including 
controls on acid rain automobile emissions and toxic chemical 
releases by industry 
we have reached agreement on sound and comprehensive 
legislation that expands and strengthens the clean air laws and 
have done it in the most costeffective way possible declared 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine 
mitchell said he plans to bring the bill to the senate floor 
monday 
senate minority leader bob dole called the proposal a giant 
step forward in improving federal air pollution laws for the 
first time in 13 years 
president bush urged senators to move swiftly to pass the 
measure he had called the original senate clean air bill too 
expensive and at one point suggested he might veto it if congress 
passed it 
president bush is extraordinarily pleased with the agreement 
it is a milestone an enormous step forward said roger porter 
the presidents chief domestic policy adviser and head of the 
administration team that helped negotiate the agreement 
although not as tough as the original senate bill the 
compromise calls for broadranging new air pollution controls on 
automobiles factories and electric power plants it aims to 
cut in half the acid rain pollutants from coalburning electric 
power plants by the end of the decade annual sulfur dioxide 
releases would be cut by 10 million tons by 2000 
tighten automobile emission controls so that hydrocarbon 
emissions are cut by onefifth and nitrogen oxides by nearly 
twothirds the two emissions are key components of urban smog 
require industry for the first time to install the best 
available technology to control the release of 192 toxic chemicals 
including a variety of carcinogens plants would have to impose 
further controls to meet new health based requirements if the 
cancer risks are at a certain level to people living near a plant 
require a broad range of industry to curb smogcausing 
pollutants 
however environmentalists complained that the compromise 
weakened major portions of the original senate bill 
the backroom dealing has generated bad deals for the american 
people complained richard ayres chairman of the national clean 
air coalition which is lobbying on clean air issues for various 
environmental organizations 
fred krupp executive director of the environmental defense 
fund added powerful special interests have succeeded in rigging 
the game in their favor 
the agreement eliminated an automatic second round of tailpipe 
emission controls for cars although such controls still could be 
used under some circumstances it exempted thousands of small 
businesses from tougher smogcontrol requirements in the original 
bill and it removed a provision in current law requiring the 
federal government to impose an air pollution reduction plan if 
local officials fail to do so 
there was criticism from the senate as well 
the agreement fails to require the controls we need to provide 
clean air in the nation and in new jersey said sen frank 
lautenberg dnj 
midwest senators were concerned about the high cost of acid rain 
controls although some new provisions were aimed at holding down 
those costs 
its a better bill but well have to continue the fight for 
fairness on the senate floor said sen paul simon dill 
sen robert byrd dwva said the compromise still threatens 
thousands of his states coal miners he promised to seek 
additional changes but added im not going to engage in any 
filibuster 
speaking of the difficulties midwest senators face on the acid 
rain provision sen christopher bond rmo told reporters we 
did not have a choice between the good the bad and the ugly we 
had a choice between ugly uglier and ugliest 
the edison electric institute called the accord unnecessarily 
costly for utilities while the chemical manufacturers 
association contended the tougher toxic chemical controls were the 
product of politics and not science 
the agreement is far from what business and industry would 
consider acceptable said william fay administrator of the clean 
air working group industrys lobbying organization on clean air 
issues

an alderman was accused of pushing the 
politics of violence after announcing he would revive the black 
panther party and train an armed cadre of street gang members to 
advance minority causes 
alderman michael mcgee made his announcement at a city hall news 
conference he described as a state of the innercity address 
mcgee 40 was an active member of the militant black panthers 
in the 1970s and has been an outspoken innercity representative 
since his election to the common council in 1984 
we want complete liberation and control of our communities and 
our destiny mcgee said in an interview thursday a day after 
announcing his plans he added he would begin assembling the 
militant activists by the end of the year 
common council president thomas p donegan who is white said 
he was neither frightened nor shocked by mcgees speech which he 
said enunciates the anger and frustration of the most estranged 
class of people in milwaukee 
but donegan said i personally dont believe in the politics 
of intimidation or the politics of violence if he actually means 
it itll be a totally useless effort and it will set progress 
back for the poor community 
mcgee said he would call the group the black panther community 
militia and those recruited would undergo weapons training 
education and survival programs 
he said he would begin his recruitment among the citys many 
street gangs and the group would formally take up arms in 1995 if 
conditions for the citys minorities arent improved by then 
he gave no details of operations the force might undertake 
theyre just shooting each other and dying for no reason at 
all he said im giving them a reason to die im going to 
show them who the enemy is the government the big private 
interests the multimillionaires 
he called for creation of an emergency 100 million job training 
program for blacks and equal representation of minorities in all 
bodies of city government 
mcgee in the past has staged numerous peaceful protests 
including whistleblowing demonstrations aimed at white 
politicians but said the lack of response to those protests 
convinced him of the need for violence 
he said he his three teenage sons and others would be unafraid 
to die fighting for liberation and freedom for our community 
state rep gwendolynne moore a black democrat representing the 
inner city said mcgees threat was an attempt to highlight the 
serious problems of poverty unemployment teenage pregnancy 
school dropouts and crime in the black community she stopped short 
of endorsing the call to arms 
when you reduce people to nothing theyll want to survive by 
any means necessary she said i have sons 10 and 12 years old 
and i am not eager to see them go into the streets to die 
i am not interested in burying my black sons but i think what 
michael is saying is a barometer of the degree of frustration 
mayor john norquist was out of town but his chief of staff h 
carl mueller issued a brief statement that violence or the 
threat of violence are not the answer 
mcgees previous protests included hanging a black baby doll on 
a tree saying it symbolized racism in milwaukee and wearing a 
paper bag over his head during a photo session of the city council 
to protest lack of funding for minority programs

a computer list of 80 drought payments to 
farmers in excess of the 100000 limit contained a number of 
errors that were subsequently corrected according to agriculture 
department officials 
the departments agricultural stabilization and conservation 
service said such errors and corrections were not unusual 
officials denied the mistakes were the result of sloppy bookwork in 
county offices 
no no evidence of sloppiness that im aware of said 
william e penn assistant deputy administrator of the usda agency 
anytime youve got an organization as large as ours with 3000 
field offices theres going to be some problems 
the 80 names headed a list of more than 600 compiled by the 
departments national computer center at kansas city mo on jan 
4 officials said the payments were made under the disaster 
assistance act of 1988 
as of dec 31 payments of more than 388 billion had been made 
to 805152 recipients 
the 80 payments listed jan 4 as exceeding the 100000 limit 
about half were over by less than 100 each and many of those by 
only a dollar comprised only 001 percent of the total recipients 
according to the agency the office of management and budget had 
requested information on the top 50 payments under the 1988 
drought law the computer search resulting in the jan 4 listing 
disclosed hundreds of ties among the top 50 dollar rankings which 
ranged from 380092 to 99990 
for example the top 43 payments were made to the 80 farms 
listed as having received more than the 100000 limit there were 
more than 600 recipients tied for 44th place at exactly 100000 
finally there were 24 farms listed as sharing the remaining six 
with the 50th payment totaling 99990 
a copy of the payment list was made available upon request to 
the associated press which ran the names and amounts of the top 80 
on feb 20 almost immediately there were complaints that some 
errors were made 
some within ascs were irked that the ap ran the list in the 
first place although the agency has a history of being 
comparatively open about subsidy payments to farmers 
one ascs official who demanded anonymity said the list should 
not have been given out without a formal freedom of information 
request which would have resulted in checking to see if all the 
names and amounts were correct 
we ought to clean up our list before we give it to you thats 
all the official said adding that he knew of no clean list 
that would be available now we would have to go to the county 
offices 
penn who helps directly supervise the agencys field 
operations said he did not have the full details about the jan 4 
computer report 
anytime data is found to be in error that data is 
corrected he said so if you had january numbers theyre 
probably not accurate compared to what they are today there are 
going to be errors that take place 
but penn who was head of the ascs state office in michigan 
before coming here said he felt very comfortable in saying that 
in general no theres no evidence that theres widespread sloppy 
work at the county level 
weve got nothing to hide he said

banished to a remote prairie 130 years 
ago the santeesioux indians are rising again this time with 
playing cards in their hands 
the tribe plans to build a 67 million hotelcasino in council 
bluffs that would dwarf all other gaming operations between nevada 
and new jersey 
im tired of government handouts and dependency said don 
lapoint the tribal councils chairman one of the things we do 
have going for us is gaming im very optimistic this is going to 
succeed 
the tribe has hired harveys resort and casino near lake tahoe 
nev to run the casino which with a convention center and 450bed 
hotel would employ up to 1000 people 
gov terry branstad opposes the casino and much legal wrangling 
lies ahead but local officials said the 1988 indian gaming act a 
federal law providing preferential treatment for indians could 
help the casino become a reality 
the governor feels there is sentiment among iowans that weve 
gone far enough in gambling said dick vohs a branstad spokesman 
chuck shearer vice president of finance for harveys said the 
casino would push ahead with its plans until we have exhausted 
all the legal opportunities available or until the city of council 
bluffs asks us to get out of town 
the santeesioux have an option to buy a 50acre tract for the 
casino in council bluffs across the missouri river from omaha 
neb proponents expect the casino also would lure customers from 
des moines 120 miles to the east and kansas city 200 miles to 
the south 
few employees are likely to be indians but the tribes share of 
the income would go back to the reservation some 200 miles to the 
northwest in nebraska where about 60 percent of the 2300 tribe 
members live 
the siouxsantee were banished to the 12by17mile reserve by 
president lincoln after the bloody minnesota uprising of 1862 
were isolated here lapoint said in a telephone interview 
from the reservation nobody comes here there are no airports 
no industries we need to come back with pride dignity 
the council bluffs city council and business community have not 
taken a formal position on the casino but the general sentiment is 
favorable said city attorney richard b wade 
people fear that if we dont do everything to get it next 
year it will either be in des moines or chicago or kansas city 
wade said 
that the casino is possible at all stems from the iowa 
legislatures decision last year to allow lowstakes casinos aboard 
riverboats beginning in the summer 1991 
the riverboat casino law opened the door to other gambling the 
mesquakie indians who already hold highstakes bingo games on 
their settlement near tama are nearing agreement with the state on 
adding video lottery games and slot machines 
indian tribes nationwide faced with cutbacks in federal money 
and a limited tax base have instituted gambling to raise revenue 
the 1988 act helps them set up operations off their reservations 
in more easily visited areas 
the act states that such gaming is permitted if officials agree 
it is in the best interests of both the community and the indians 
but vohs said his reading of the law is that the governor has 
final say on the establishment of any highstakes casino 
obviously thats not how we see it said shearer 
joel starr a us interior department gaming expert said 
casino advocates would have little room to maneuver if the governor 
turned them down 
seven midwest bishops have issued a statement criticizing the 
casino saying gambling can shred families and hurt communities 
but wade said weve already devised several ways you can lose 
your paycheck a lot of people feel the moral issue has already 
been decided

chemical companies say proposed legislation 
outlawing the export of pesticides banned in the united states goes 
too far in trying to control other nations 
i dont think us regulators should make decisions for other 
countries about what they do and do not need said donna 
jennings spokeswoman for velsicol chemical corp 
her company the only manufacturer of chlordane and heptachlor 
was criticized thursday by sen al gore dtenn who referred to 
the products as deadly poison the products are not registered 
for use in the united states 
gores comments came as he and four other lawmakers announced 
legislation that would prevent us chemical manufacturers from 
selling products abroad that cant be used in the united states 
if the epa says it is too hazardous to be used on us grown 
foods then it is too hazardous to be used on foreign grown 
foods said sen patrick leahy dvt chairman of the senate 
agriculture committee 
he said the legislation he and gore are sponsoring in the senate 
would close a legal loophole that allows us chemical companies to 
manufacture here and sell abroad pesticides that are probable 
carcinogens 
reps mike synar dokla leon panetta dcalif and dan 
glickman dkan are the house sponsors of the same bill known as 
the pesticides export reform act 
the lawmakers said that banned and unregistered pesticides made 
in the united states are showing up on foreign food imported to the 
united states 
these chemicals are killers we know that gore said 
velsicol has the same responsibility of every manufacturer to act 
in a responsible way and to protect public health 
but jennings said chlordane and heptachlor are only temporarily 
off the us market during a review by the environmental protection 
agency 
she said the products are used to kill termites and protect 
germinating seeds from other pests while alternative chemicals 
exist for use in the united states there are some regions of the 
world such as the tropics where weather and pest conditions 
prevent other products from being effective she said 
those same conditions she said also cause the chemicals to 
break down faster than in the united states creating less danger 
to human health 
synar who chairs the house government operations subcommittee 
on environment energy and natural resources said that information 
from the united nations showed many countries especially in the 
third world lack the ability to assure safe pesticide practices 
business in the chemical industry in this country could take a 
downturn if the legislation is passed said national agricultural 
chemicals association president jay vroom 
a unilateral approach to a global issue does no good and only 
puts us manufacturers at a disadvantage and may drive importing 
countries to suppliers that may supply far less environmental 
stewardship with their products he said 
other key provisions in the bill include 
a ban on imports that have been treated with outlawed chemicals 
listing by importers of chemicals used to grow foods shipped 
from abroad 
labeling of exported usmade chemicals in the language of the 
receiving country

it is falling to the prime minister of 
ireland in this season of rapid change to see what can be done to 
anchor the emerging new and more powerful germany in a democratic 
european community 
ireland is the only neutralist country in the 12nation 
community but charles j haughey the prime minister is not 
neutral about the task at hand 
like most europeans he considers unification of east germany 
and west germany inevitable and a good thing but he knows a lot 
of people are anxious and haughey feels the best way to allay 
those concerns especially economic ones is to wrap germany into 
the european community which is on a fast track to economic union 
he also favors stronger us ties to europe 
as the president of the european council a job that rotates 
every six months haughey called on president bush this week and 
held other meetings around town that for a change were not 
focused on the trouble in northern ireland 
to begin with west germany is an economic colossus accounting 
for 25 percent of the gross national product of the 12 community 
countries east germany will integrate its currency with its 
wealthy cousins in west germany and thereby unleash a wave of 
purchasing power that could touch off inflation as east germans 
reach into their savings to acquire longdenied consumer goods 
the fact that germany will be even stronger militarily is 
another source of worry to its neighbors although haughey said any 
european concerns would be directed most at german economic might 
and possible domination 
haughey who has served three unconnected terms as irish prime 
minister is pleased that germany would remain in the european 
community after unification participating in the transition to a 
europe of shared interests and cooperation 
a germany remaining a full and committed member of the 
european community is a great reassurance he said 
still haughey admits the turn of events is unprecedented 
there are no rules or texts that can guide us on how to handle 
it he said 
haughey is counting heavily on the good sense of west german 
officials and a european determination to pull together 
while west germany will bear most of the burden of 
rehabilitating east germany the 11 other european community 
members intend to provide assistance with trade and investment 
programs 
in short he said there will be very big costs to bring 
east germany in and to bring it up to west european standards 
a european community development bank will be ready to make 
loans to all the east european countries as they switch to 
nonmarxist systems and to the soviet union as well 
fortunately haughey said germany is the member ablest 
most easily to bear this burden it can handle it with the greatest 
skill and determination 
moreover germany is anchored by the 35nation european security 
conference this is the grouping of the soviet union and its 
allies west europeans neutralists and the united states and 
canada with a common commitment to human rights 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs proposal for a summit 
later this year to promote a common european home has us support 
provided human rights are enshrined at the summit as a fundamental 
principle 
the summit was to have been held in 1992 
moving it up reflects everyones anxiety to deal with the 
german issue haughey said there are anxieties concerns may 
be a better word i think on the whole people will be relieved by 
these factors 
a strong nationalist who has worked as a barrister and an 
accountant haughey is considered a canny analyst his analysis of 
european integration is that it is unstoppable despite british 
prime minister margaret thatchers reservations 
in seeking stronger us ties to the community haughey worked 
out with bush a plan for semiannual meetings of the presidents of 
the united states and the european council as well as meetings 
twice a year between secretary of state james a baker iii and the 
12 community foreign ministers 
all this is fine with the bush administration the new 
architecture baker has proposed for europe includes closer us 
ties 
but that doesnt mean haughey favors us membership in the 
community there cannot be a 13th seat at the table he said 
the europeans intend to make integration decisions themselves

small cars that should be protected from 
damage by their bumpers at low speeds cost between 769 and 3838 
to repair after four test bumps an auto safety institute reports 
the most damaged among 16 new cars tested at 5 mph by the 
insurance institute for highway safety was the 1990 daihatsu 
charade se and the least damaged was the honda civic dx said 
institute president brian oneill 
every bumper we tested this year did a poor job of preventing 
damage and some were downright lousy oneill said in releasing 
the results of the annual testing thursday 
the institute funded by the insurance industry buys the cars 
runs each one into flat barriers front and back into a front 
angle barrier and then backward into a pole all at 5 mph 
he said bumper performance has deteriorated since 1982 when the 
transportation department rolled back federal requirements that car 
bumpers be able to sustain 5 mph crashes without damage to the

for the second time in her 
life arabisraeli strife has driven fatima sufarin from her home 
this is the price we have to pay for our homeland the 
70yearold palestinian said thursday she said she was first 
displaced when she fled from her home in the village of lifta near 
jerusalem during the 1948 arabisraeli war 
on wednesday israeli troops blew up her twostory house and 
mrs sufarins 12member family carried what was left of their 
possessions to a nearby shack 
the sixroom house was demolished to punish the family for the 
alleged crimes of mrs sufarins 25yearold son imad who is 
accused of throwing a firebomb that wounded an israeli soldier 
family members say imad who is awaiting trial is innocent 
according to the army more than 450 houses have been destroyed 
or sealed in the occupied west bank and gaza strip since the 
beginning of the palestinian uprising in december 1987 
on thursday troops sealed three houses in the village of tamoun 
in the northern west bank the army said palestinian reporters 
said the sealings made 16 people homeless 
the houses belonged to the families of three palestinian men who 
allegedly carried out acts of sabotage in nearby jewish settlements 
and threw firebombs on homes of several tamoun residents suspected 
of cooperating with israeli authorities 
the united states and other western nations have criticized 
house demolitions and sealings saying the practice was a form of 
collective punishment and violated the right to due process in 
nearly all cases houses are destroyed or sealed before a suspect 
has been tried 
israeli military officials say the practice is an effective 
deterrent and is legal under emergency regulations dating to the 
prestate british mandate period 
the demolition of mrs sufarins house left 12 people homeless 
including herself her daughters jamile and wedad and their 
teenage children 
wedad 42 suffers from schizophrenia and has been kept in a 
locked room for the past 15 years because family members said 
otherwise she might harm herself and others 
wedad found refuge in the bethlehem mental hospital which 
earlier had refused to take her in because of her violent 
outbursts but hospital officials said she would have to leave soon 
because she was too much of a burden 
on thursday mrs sufarins family gathered around the rubble of 
the house at the foot of the judean hills and near the site where 
the bible says jesus was tempted by the devil 
mrs sufarin her white headscarf soaked by driving rain wept 
as she found chickens buried under the rubble and looked for 
anything to salvage 
the sufarins spent the night in a nearby shack into which they 
had piled all their possessions including blankets carpets 
wicker chairs a grandfather clock and a refrigerator 
mrs sufarin said thursday she was waiting for un officials to 
deliver an emergency tent that would be her new home 
since the beginning of the uprising 659 palestinians have been 
killed by israeli soldiers and civilians fortythree israelis have 
also died in the violence

a study of twins who served in the military 
during the vietnam era offers new evidence that posttraumatic 
stress disorder is more a product of combat than of any inborn 
susceptibility to stress 
the findings indicate the disorder marked by painful memories 
flashbacks and nightmares is three times more common among 
veterans who served in southeast asia than among their identical 
twins who served elsewhere 
the twins who saw heavy combat in vietnam 179 servicemen 
were found to suffer nine times as often from the problem as their 
identical twins who served in the armed forces in other parts of 
the world 
identical twins are more similar than any two individuals 
said lead researcher jack goldberg an assistant professor of 
epidemiology at the university of illinois at chicago 
and so you have two guys with 100 percent of the same genes 
who grew up together and one guy goes to war and one doesnt and 
15 years later one has posttraumatic stress disorder and one 
doesnt that sort of debunks the idea of predisposition 
a popular myth holds that just the bad eggs were sent to 
vietnam goldberg said in a telephone interview thursday 
thats not the story the average joes went to vietnam 
the study published in todays journal of the american medical 
associaiton was developed from a specially designed registry of 
2092 male twins in military service during the vietnam war era 
from 1965 to 1975 
the registry was established to further scientists 
understanding of health problems believed to be partly due to 
genetic traits and partly to environment including alcoholism 
drug abuse and heart disease he said 
when the survey was conducted in 1987 168 percent of the twins 
who served in southeast asia during the vietnam era had symptoms of 
posttraumatic stress disorder just 5 percent of their identical 
twin brothers who didnt serve in southeast asia had the symptoms 
terence m keane chief of psychology at the boston veterans 
administration medical center said the study represents a major 
advance in our understanding of posttraumatic stress disorder 
the findings closely match those of a congressional study 
estimating 15 percent of vietnam veterans suffer from 
posttraumatic stress disorder goldberg said that means 450000 
veterans are afflicted with it he said 
these guys are hurting he said theyre not psychotic 
theyre not crazy they have nightmares they have problems but 
our sense is that a lot of these guys function very well

the pentagon must provide a realistic 
fiveyear spending plan because the current budget indicates that 
138 billion in spending cuts are needed to meet president bushs 
defense goal a congressional report says 
the congress is faced with budget decisions that will have 
longterm implications but without an updated fiveyear defense 
plan it does not have the information necessary to fully assess 
alternatives comptroller general charles bowsher told the senate 
armed services committee on thursday 
bowsher presented the general accounting offices assessment of 
defense spending the investigative arm of congress found that 
bushs budget for fiscal 1991 includes a fiveyear program that 
projects spending of 15 trillion 
that total is 212 billion less than the recent fiveyear plan 
that the administration prepared in fiscal 1989 however the 
pentagon has come up with only 74 billion in reductions from the 
1989 projections 
the defense department is still faced with decisions on how 
and where to make reductions of another 138 billion between fiscal 
1992 and fiscal 1994 bowsher said 
the pentagon he said has said the dramatic changes in eastern 
europe and the lessening soviet threat to the west has made it 
difficult to decide where and how the reductions will be made 
the comptroller general said the gao does not expect the 
pentagon to act hastily but the decisions must be made soon 
bowsher suggested that the administration rethink our entire 
weapon system acquisition strategy starting with the b2 stealth 
bomber and the multiplewarhead mx nuclear missile 
repeating testimony he gave last week to the house armed 
services committee bowsher suggested slowing down production of 
the costly stealth bomber until critical tests have been completed 
on the radarevading aircraft 
according to the gao the current schedule calls for spending 
more than 48 billion and ordering 31 bombers before critical 
performance tests have been conducted 
the gao also found that the air force plans to make an initial 
production decision on moving the mx missile from fixed silos to 
railroad cars before operational tests and evaluations have been 
done on the completed system 
shortly after the production decision the air force plans to 
buy about 73 percent of the launch cars for the mx 
bowsher said that during the 1980s the strategy of concurrent 
production and testing was designed to get systems in the field 
more quickly but it often resulted in making extensive and 
expensive changes after the systems were fielded 
the b2 bomber and the mx railgarrison program are following 
the same path he said 
overall the comptroller general painted a dire financial 
picture as he accused the bush administration of spending 
projections that are the result of creative bookkeeping they do 
not portray the real situation 
according to bowsher the government is using surpluses in the 
federal trust funds for social security highways and other 
divisions to cover up the real budget deficit 
if we continue along this same path we can expect the 
national debt to increase to 45 trillion by fiscal year 1995 
bowsher said a debt of this magnitude would require annual 
interest payments of over 335 billion and would represent the 
largest single item in the federal budget

the national right to life committee says 
abortion opponents should withhold contributions or drop their 
memberships in three environmental organizations because the groups 
support abortions 
the antiabortion group says the national wildlife federation 
the national audubon society and the sierra club support abortions 
by backing legislation that would allow broader use of federal 
money for birth control in third world countries 
wildlife federation and audubon society officials say their 
organizations have no position on abortion 
nancy walker director of the sierra clubs population program 
said her group supports a womans right to an abortion and has been 
targeted by the righttolife group before 
we believe the true prolife position supports population 
stabilization she said 
the national abortion rights action league called the 
controversy bewildering 
its this kind of activity that shows how extreme they are 
loretta ucelli spokeswoman for the abortionrights group said 
about the national right to life committee 
the antiabortion group issued a call in the march edition of 
its magazine national right to life news for its members to drop 
out or withhold donations to the three groups 
doug johnson the groups legislative director said the step 
was taken because all three groups have endorsed a bill that would 
reverse bush administration policy denying aid to family planning 
organizations that provide abortion information or services in 
lessdeveloped countries 
it is wrong to solicit peoples contributions to protect 
wildlife and then use the money to lobby for proabortion 
policies johnson said 
officials of the three groups said they support global birth 
control efforts because overpopulation threatens the environment 
singling out environmental groups is taking it to an 
extreme said stephanie sklar of the national wildlife 
federation its trying to make an issue out of something thats 
not an issue for these groups 
she said the dispute was touched off last year when 
environmental groups jointly issued a report that urged a 
modification of the administration policy which was left over from 
the reagan administration and embraced by the bush white house 
hope babcock counsel for the audubon society said her group 
opposed the administration policy but she said we have 
absolutely no position on abortion 
we are about educating the world about the relationship 
between population and the environment and the stress put on the 
environment through population growth she said 
none of the targeted groups said they expected to lose much 
money or many members as a result of the action

lithuanians scrambled to move up elections to 
allow their parliament to vote on independence before soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev gains new power they fear could 
thwart their drive 
activists in the baltic republic were making the moves while 
soviet authorities also came under pressure thursday in neighboring 
latvia and in moldavia 
in the neighboring baltic republic of latvia the parliament 
gave some youths the right to refuse conscription in the soviet 
army in the southwestern republic of moldavia communist leaders 
admitted their partys past mistakes and agreed to talks with 
popular political movements the official news agency tass said 
already 22 local election boards in lithuania have moved up 
their runoff elections from march 10 to sunday tass reported 
thursday others are expected to follow said vitoris radjavichus 
a spokesman for the lithuanian peoples front sajudis 
that will allow the new lithuanian parliament to meet and 
possibly vote on independence before march 12 radjavichus said 
that is the opening day of the soviet congress of peoples 
deputies which is scheduled to vote on creating a more powerful 
presidency expected to be occupied by gorbachev 
the bill would give gorbachev the power to declare a state of 
emergency and suspend a republics parliament he could also send 
troops into a locality and even declare war without asking the 
soviet parliament radjavichus described the powers as 
dictatorial 
candidates backed by sajudis which favors independence won 70 
of 90 seats filled in the first round of the election saturday but 
94 of the parliaments 140 seats or a twothirds majority must be 
filled before the body can begin to act sajudis secretary andryus 
kubilyus told the radio moscow news service interfax 
kazimieras motieka a sajudis leader and member of the national 
parliament appealed on lithuanian television for the republics 
new legislature to take office by march 11 tass said 
in the december session of congress motieka asked kremlin 
leaders to begin negotiations on the lithuanian demand for 
independence from the soviet union which forcibly annexed 
lithuania latvia and estonia in 1940 
in its decision thursday the latvian parliament said local 
youths will be allowed to choose three years of alternative public 
service work to the military if they have pacifist or religious 
convictions tass said 
the decision contradicts soviet law which requires all 
18yearolds to serve two years in the army 
all three baltic republics adopted constitutional amendments in 
the past 16 months giving their parliaments the right to overturn 
soviet laws the kremlin has denounced these actions as violating 
the constitution but so far there has been no direct confrontation 
in moldavia the communist party central committee agreed to 
talks with mass movements in hopes of calming tensions between 
russians and moldavians who are ethnically related to romanians 
the party leaders apparently in a debate over some activists 
calls for independence or reunification with romania voted to 
support independence within the framework of a renewed soviet 
federation 
leaders of the moldavian communist party intend to start a 
democratic and open dialogue with rankandfile communists and the 
broad public tass quoted moldavian party chief pyotr luchinsky 
as saying

us and japanese negotiators face a series of 
deadlines on contentious trade issues and the rhetoric is heating 
up on both sides of the pacific as president bush meets with prime 
minister toshiki kaifu 
japanese officials are complaining of highhanded us demands 
while american officials are warning of retaliatory measures if the 
japanese do not grant concessions to reduce the huge trade 
imbalance between the two nations 
the trade dispute was expected to be at center stage when bush 
welcomed kaifu in palm springs calif this afternoon for two days 
of talks 
while no significant breakthrough was considered likely us 
officials hoped the bushkaifu discussions would at least lay the 
groundwork for progress as the negotiations proceed at a lower 
level in coming months 
there is a growing us impatience with japan especially among 
democrats in congress who point to new government figures showing 
that japan accounted for almost half of americas 1086 billion 
trade deficit last year 
the deficit with japan remained stuck at 49 billion little 
changed from a 518 billion imbalance the year before 
congress is getting tired of the games they play we cant 
crack their markets rep marty russo dill told us trade 
representative carla hills at a hearing this week 
i remain optimistic that japan will see the need to open up 
the second largest market in the world hills told reporters on 
thursday 
the japanese are upset about being singled out for americas 
trade problems many of which they believe are a product of us 
inability to compete on international markets on the campaign 
trail kaifu blasted congress for raising a sword against the 
japanese on trade issues 
hills conceded that the usjapanese relationship was at a 
difficult point and needs to have the highest level of attention 
speaking to a gathering of economists on thursday hills 
suggested that it would be extremely helpful politically for 
japan to make some trade concessions so she could point to progress 
in a report she must send congress by march 30 
the bush administration is facing a series of deadlines to 
resolve disputes over a variety of products ranging from lumber to 
super computers 
among the issues in contention 
the united states last may put japan on a trade hit list 
for its alleged unfair barriers against the sale of american wood 
products satellites and super computers the administration which 
acted under a section of the 1988 trade law known as super 301 has 
until june 16 to negotiate a removal of the barriers if the 
negotiations fail the administration can impose retaliatory 
tariffs against japanese products 
the united states and japan are engaged in an ambitious effort 
aimed at tackling the underlying causes of the trade deficit such 
as japanese exclusionary business practices and also the low us 
savings rate american negotiators have expressed disappointment 
that three rounds of discussions in the socalled structural 
impediments initiative have produced little progress an interim 
report is expected this spring and the final report is due this 
summer 
japanese barriers to the sale of american telecommunications 
products a primary source of tension between the two countries in 
recent years also are being discussed negotiators met last month 
in tokyo with the american side demanding more freedom for japanese 
companies to decide which telephone products to buy 
negotiations are going forward on other issues from 
construction to shipbuilding to protection on us patents and 
copyrights 
even as the talks continue some in congress are laying the 
groundwork to force the administration to take a tougher line 
unless the japanese grant concessions 
sen max baucus dmont has introduced legislation that would 
require retaliation if japan does not liberalize its markets for 
super computers satellites and wood products by june 16 
referring to that legislation hills said there was an urgency 
in japanese officials moving quickly before congress takes an 
action that would limit our discretion

what do hubert h humphrey everett mckinley 
dirksen mike mansfield john stennis barry goldwater claude 
pepper henry m jackson margaret chase smith sam rayburn john 
w mccormack and joe martin have in common 
the answer is not the simple one that all are retired or 
deceased members of congress 
it is rather that all are political eminences whom congress 
has chosen to honor by paying out millions of federal dollars to 
establish foundations bearing their names 
total price tag over the last 15 years more than 100 million 
the practice according to an article by julie kosterlitz in 
this weeks issue of the national journal goes far beyond merely 
naming a building for a distinguished congressional statesman 
the name of sam rayburn the late speaker of the house already 
was carved in marble on the walls of the rayburn house office 
building when in 1974 rep wright patman dtexas an old friend 
got a bright idea 
patman noted that congress was about to give 10 million in 
proceeds from the sale of the eisenhower commemorative dollar coin 
to help out financially ailing eisenhower college named for the 
late president 
patman attached an amendment requiring the college to transfer 
1 million of the eisenhower money to the sam rayburn library in 
bonham texas it was opened with private money in 1957 to house 
the papers of the speaker who died in 1961 
the bright idea soon became an established idea 
the most recent example 10 million added to a defense 
appropriations bill to endow a foundation to be named for the late 
rep claude pepper dfla and his wife mildred to carry on his 
work on behalf of the elderly 
other examples 
the 1986 barry m goldwater scholarship and excellence in 
education foundation set up to honor the retired gop senator from 
arizona by providing a recordbreaking 40 million to aid college 
students studying mathematics and the natural sciences 
the 1986 henry m jackson foundation in seattle got 10 million 
to honor the democratic senator from washington who died in 1983 
additionally the henry m jackson foundation for the advancement 
of military medicine in rockville md got 1 million to endow a 
chair in dermatology 
the hubert h humphrey institute of public affairs at the 
university of minnesota received 5 million in the late 1970s to 
honor the late democratic senator and vice president at the same 
time an institute named for the late sen everett mckinley 
dirksen rill received 25 million 
former senate majority leader mike mansfield dmont who also 
served for nearly a decade as us ambassador to japan was honored 
in 1983 by the creation of a 5 million foundation at the 
university of montana in missoula to study the nations of the 
pacific rim 
a 3 million federal grant was approved in 1982 to create a 
john w mccormack institute of public affairs at the boston campus 
of the university of massachusetts mccormack retired as speaker of 
the house in 1971 
a grant of 4 million in the late 1980s created the joseph 
martin institute for law and society at stonehill college in 
northeastern massachusetts to honor the late gop speaker of the 
house 
the john c stennis center for public service development was 
opened in starkville miss in honor of the recently retired 
democratic chairman of the senate armed services committee it 
received 75 million 
in 1989 congress approved 25 million for the margaret chase 
smith foundation which operates a library attached to the 
skowhegan maine home of the 92yearold former republican senator 
sometimes congress is asked to honor a former member and says 
no 
for various reasons it turned down requests to finance 
institutes and foundations to honor the late senate republican 
leader robert taft of ohio former house speaker thomas p tip 
oneill jr dmass and the late sen warren g magnuson dwash 
still pending is a 5 million request by maines bates college 
to house the archives of democrat edmund s muskie a former maine 
governor us senator and secretary of state

andy rooney is bringing his weekly gripe session 
back to 60 minutes on sunday after cbs lifted his suspension 
early with the blessing of the naacp 
im very pleased rooney said thursday after cbs news 
president david burke reinstated the 71yearold humorist whose 
curmudgeonly commentary has been a showending 60 minutes 
feature since 1978 
burke on feb 8 had suspended rooney for three months without 
pay after the advocate a gay magazine quoted him as saying that 
blacks had watered down their genes a remark rooney denied 
making 
on thursday the national association for the advancement of 
colored people said it believed rooney was misquoted didnt object 
to his return to work and considered the matter closed spokesman 
james williams said 
rooney also had drawn fire from homosexuals for a dec 28 cbs 
special in which he cited homosexual unions as among things 
that cause selfinduced death and for a letter to the advocate 
in which he said he found male homosexual acts repugnant 
burke said of the suspension painful though these events have 
been we have all learned a great deal about how sensitive and 
fragile our society is how thoughts and words can be 
misunderstood 
he said rooney has consistently stated publicly that he is not 
a man who holds prejudice in his heart and mind towards any group 
in our society those of us who know him and work with him know two 
things first that is true and second it is time that andy 
returned to his proper place on 60 minutes 
rooney who said he would address the uproar sunday on 60 
minutes said it had sensitized him to some of the problems faced 
by homosexuals 
i think they have really made their point he said i 
believe they are in a more difficult position than i understood 
in a statement the gay and lesbian alliance against defamation 
complained that rooney has yet to make amends with the gay and 
lesbian community regarding the series of homophobic comments he 
made in the last few months 
during his three weeks away from 60 minutes the program 
while still toprated has slipped in the ratings dropping to 18th 
last sunday when it was beaten by a special rerun of abcs hit 
americas funniest home videos 
some cbs executives and researchers at the networks said 
entertainmnent programs at other networks had more to do with the 
ratings drop than did rooneys absence 
cbs has received more than 5000 viewer calls for rooneys 
return 
we all get the bittersweet in our lives rooney said of the 
matter adding that he likes a quotation attributed to abc newsman

secretary of state james a baker iii is 
looking for a response this weekend from israel on whether it will 
accept his proposal for talks with a palestinian delegation about 
elections in the occupied territories 
weve really done pretty much all we can do we think from 
our end and we are waiting for a response from the israeli 
government baker said thursday at a hearing before the house 
appropriations foreign aid subcommittee 
were coming very close to the time when we will know one way 
or the other whether israel will accept a proposal for talks 
concerning elections among the 17 million palestinians in the 
territories baker said 
baker has been expressing growing impatience with israels 
failure to respond to his proposals aired during his meetings with 
the foreign ministers of egypt and israel two issues he raised at 
the hearing seemed certain to add pressure on prime minister 
yitzhak shamir 
the secretary said the bush administration could endorse a move 
to give israel 400 million in loan guarantees to build housing for 
an influx of soviet jewish refugees but only if israel promises 
not to put any new settlers in the occupied territories of the west 
bank and gaza strip 
there might be support if there were some assurance from the 
government of israel that it would not be engaging in any new 
additional settlement activity in the territories baker said 
the money is expected to be added to an upcoming supplemental 
appropriations bill and is likely to win congressional approval 
because of israels strong support on capitol hill 
israel has declined to provide such assurances about future 
settlement but has contended in the past that about 1 percent of 
refugees have settled in the territories 
settlements are not conducive to the peace process because 
they aggravate tensions with palestinian residents baker said 
it is not unreasonable to ask some assurances these funds will 
not be used to create new settlements or expand old settlements in 
the occupied territories 
baker also said the bush administration may support cutting us 
aid to israel and egypt if similar cuts were applied to other 
nations to free money for emerging democracies 
were willing to stand up and be counted on such a plan 
because it would allow foreign aid money to be distributed where it 
is most needed baker said he said administration support for the 
cuts would depend on whether we do it in a nondiscriminatory 
manner 
baker said he has not found any significant reduction in 
tensions in the middle east but he added at the same time we 
must find a way to respond to changes in eastern europe in panama 
and in nicaragua 
if these leaders are not able to produce for their people we 
will rue the day that the united states fell short in providing 
aid he said we are talking about supporting an extraordinary 
outbreak of freedom and democracy 
baker also said he did not want to see a repetition of the 
current years budget crunch in which some friendly countries that 
expected us aid got little or nothing because 90 percent of the 
aid budget was already earmarked by congress for other recipients 
economic aid to all of africa totaled just 14 million this year 
because theres no one up here lobbying for them he said 
his comments were the clearest indication yet that the 
administration would accept cuts to israel and egypt which get the 
largest slice of us aid as a result of their participation in the 
camp david middle east peace accord a decade ago 
israel is receiving 3 billion this year and egypt 21 billion 
from an overall aid budget of roughly 10 billion the 
administration has asked congress for the same amounts for both 
countries next year

the administrations choice of education aide 
robert sweet to head 70 million in juvenile justice programs is 
coming under renewed fire from democrats as republicans try to ease 
him into the post 
youre in a tough spot senate judiciary chairman joseph 
biden ddel said thursday after sweet answered questions from 
the panel for more than two hours at his confirmation hearing 
biden said the administration probably would not have tapped 
sweet for the post if he had refused to support a 90 percent cut in 
the program from 70 million to 75 million proposed by president 
bush this year sweet is a firm supporter of the cut 
biden added however that support for the proposed slash in the 
budget might just sink sweets chances of winning senate approval 
because the program is popular with lawmakers 
the comment came on top of numerous complaints from democrats 
that the 52yearold former white house adviser lacked the 
experience to be administrator of the office of juvenile justice 
and delinquency prevention in the justice department 
the office distributes millions of dollars in federal grants to 
state and local agencies to combat juvenile delinquency 
i am troubled that an individual apparently without the 
requisite credentials would be nominated for this important 
position said sen edward m kennedy dmass 
sweet onetime head of the new hampshire moral majority has 
drawn critics ranging from the national parentteacher association 
to people for the american way a liberal washington group 
at least some opposition appears to stem from fierce political 
infighting at the department of education while sweet was an aide 
there in the early 1980s former education secretary terrel bell 
was highly critical of sweet in his memoirs the thirteenth man 
those urging confirmation of sweet range from the boys clubs of 
america to sen gordon humphrey rnh who has been pointing out 
that many opponents are financial beneficiaries of the governments 
juvenile justice programs 
its understandable may i observe that the grantees would 
like one of their own to be head of this office but that may not 
be such a good idea from the standpoint of prudence humphrey 
told the committee 
sweet a former high school teacher and textbook salesman told 
the panel that he had devoted his life to young people he said his 
background in education should meet a federal law requiring a 
juvenile justice administrator with experience in the juvenile 
justice field 
i want to be an advocate of helping young people have a better 
shot at life than they otherwise would have sweet said adding 
that he has been studying juvenile justice issues and would be a 
quick study once he was in the post 
i believe that bob sweet is fully qualified for this 
position said sen orrin hatch rutah i know him personally 
and i support him 
sen arlen specter rpa however asked for written answers to 
a number of questions about juvenile justice issues he said the 
replies should be more complete than the ones sweet gave verbally

a 125 million bill to kindle the spirit of 
volunteerism will get americans away from the values of wall 
street and go back to the values of main street a lawmaker says 
the measure is aimed at encouraging activities ranging from 
teaching reading to cleanup drives in the nations forests and 
parks it goes to the house after being approved thursday in the 
senate after four days of intense bickering and maneuvering 
it would authorize 125 million for volunteer programs through 
the end of the fiscal year that starts oct 1 
what we do in this bill is begin to get away from the values 
of wall street and go back to the values of main street of 
neighbor helping neighbor sen barbara mikulski dmd said 
after the 7819 senate vote 
the bill would earmark 25 million for schoolbased programs 
involving teachers aides tutoring and teaching reading it also 
would provide 35 million for a youth service corps involving park 
and forest cleanup programs for volunteers 16 to 25 years old 
included would be a full and parttime national service program 
for individuals 17 and older that would focus on service in 
education human services environment and public safety it would 
be authorized at 25 million 
also included would be a 25 million points of light foundation 
sought by republicans in keeping with president bushs campaign 
remark that the needy in america would be helped through volunteer 
efforts from a thousand points of light the foundation would 
encourage volunteerism 
under the plan states would bid for grants and the money would 
be distributed by a 4 million commission on national and community 
service established by the bill 
some of the volunteers would receive living allowances and other 
stipends as well as education and housing benefits under the bill 
sen edward m kennedy dmass the bills floor manager 
needed four days to shoehorn it through a balky senate as lawmakers 
kept attempting to pile on amendments some unrelated to 
volunteerism 
the senate fought for two days over an amendment sponsored by 
sen william armstrong rcolo to allow big brothers and other 
volunteer groups in the district of columbia to bar homosexuals 
from activities involving minors 
the lawmakers finally adopted a kennedy substitute version that 
would allow the volunteer groups to bar homosexuals from such 
activities if they had been convicted of a crime or were currently 
faces charges 
the amendment applied only to the nations capital 
its just plain wrong for any arm of government to force 
private volunteer groups to unite adult homosexuals with minors as 
companions and role models armstrong said 
even after that issue was resolved the debate dragged on for 
hours as lawmakers sought to attach provisions concerning the 
nicaraguan elections and the repression of dissent in china 
as the final vote neared however sen rudy boschwitz rminn 
took the floor to condemn the notion of paying volunteers 
he said benefits paid to some volunteers under the program 
including living allowances and health insurance were not in 
keeping with the spirit of volunteerism sponsors replied that 
poor people needed stipends because they felt the spirit of 
volunteerism as much as the wealthy

us officials say mexico offered upward of 
11 million in covert assistance to nicaraguan president daniel 
ortegas campaign far above the acknowledged us donations to the 
victorious opposition coalition 
mexican officials acknowledged that donations had been made but 
said the us figure was highly exaggerated sources said thursday

contributions were required to have been reported to the supreme 
electoral council half of the cash contributions were to have been 
shared with the council 
the us contribution to the campaign of presidentelect violeta 
chamorro was about 33 million more than 5 million in 
additional funds were provided for nonpartisan activities such as 
registration and poll watching 
efforts to reach the mexican embassy on thursday for comment 
were unsuccessful but nicaraguan vice president sergio ramirez 
denied the us allegation when asked about it by the los angeles 
times 
ramirez said the sandinistas reported all donations the state 
department said media accounts indicated that foreign contributions 
acknowledged by the sandinistas totaled 300000 
according to ramirez no funds were received from the mexican 
government or the ruling pri party the information obtained by 
us officials indicated the contributions came from the pri the 
initial report of the donation appeared in newsday 
while expressing irritation over the mexican contribution the 
officials said it was not clear whether president carlos salinas de 
gortari was aware of it 
the purported donation which included cash tshirts posters 
and other items was consistent with the support mexico 
historically has provided to the sandinista government

shops closed traffic halted and students 
stayed at home today to support a nationwide strike called by two 
outlawed parties to push a movement for multiparty democracy in the 
himalayan kingdom 
the strike was the second called by the nepali congress party 
and the communist party of nepal since they launched the campaign 
feb 18 for restoration of the multiparty system in the national 
assembly called the rashtriya panchayat 
a feb 19 strike sparked widespread violence throughout nepal 
leaving at least three people dead by police gunfire according to 
the government activists claimed five people were killed and 12 
were injured 
the government says at least nine more people died since then in 
sporadic violence but the activists claim at least twice as many 
died 
ganesh man singh a top leader of the nepali congress said the 
government is bent upon unleashing widespread violence to provoke 
the peaceful agitators like they did on feb 19 
no violence was reported today as police patrolled katmandus 
nearly deserted streets a few private vehicles and motor rickshaws 
were seen on the roads 
buses leaving katmandu the capital were escorted by armed 
police in jeeps but few passengers traveled buses coming into 
katmandu were half empty 
nobody wants to travel because of the strike said a 
passenger who arrived from dani 115 miles northwest of the 
capital he did not wish to identified 
the communist party and the nepali congress party demand an end 
to a 29yearold royal decree that banned all political parties in 
the kingdom one of the worlds oldest monarchies 
a home ministry statement said it is common knowledge that 
extremist communists have been active in disruptive force since 
feb 18 
the government would never lag behind legal action against 
those who attempt to disrupt public life the statement said 
power in nepal is shared between the king and the rashtriya 
panchayat onefifth of the assemblys 140 members are nominated by 
the king the rest are elected 
the government of king birendra says the campaign to lift the 
ban on political parties runs counter to a 1980 referendum which 
narrowly voted for retaining the panchayats system of nonpartisan 
membership 
former prime minister surya bahadur thapa one of the earliest 
advocates of the nonpartisan system said today nepals current 
problem should be solved with mutual understanding 
the government has however decided to end political crisis 
with the use of force and repression such an animal instinct will 
not do said thapa an assembly member 
nepals twoyear experiment with westernstyle democracy ended 
in 1961 when king mahendra father of the present monarch 
dissolved the government of the nepali congress party accusing it 
of corruption and poor administration

turkey lifted restrictions on us military 
personnel there after the us senate refused to pass a resolution 
commemorating the alleged genocide of armenians seven decades ago 
the turkish government notified the us ambassador of the move 
saying senators had acted in a statesmanlike manner to quash 
the resolution which the government considered a distortion of 
the historical facts 
the restrictions imposed after the senate judiciary committee 
approved the resolution last oct 18 barred certain kinds of 
meetings on defense cooperation and us activities at the konya 
bombing range suspended visits by us ships and denied permission 
for new construction at four major us military facilities in 
turkey 
the resolution sponsored by sen bob dole rkan would have 
marked april 24 as a day to remember the armenian genocide in 
19151923 dole shelved the measure late tuesday after the senate 
refused to break a filibuster against it 
armenians claim the alleged massacre killed 15 million people 
during the ottoman empire but turkish officials dispute that 
assertion they say some 600000 people died during the period 
including muslims and christians as a result of civil strife and 
marauding bands

israel announced today that it will renew 
diplomatic relations with bulgaria after a 23year hiatus when 
foreign minister moshe arens visits sofia in the near future 
foreign ministry spokesman yosef amihud said the date of arens 
visit has not been determined yet but israel radio said relations 
would be renewed within a month 
the initiative came from the government of bulgaria and we 
praise it amihud said 
bulgaria would become the fourth east european country to renew 
diplomatic relations with israel 
the soviet union and other eastern european countries except 
for romania severed relations with israel in 1967 to protest its 
occupation of land belonging to moscows arab allies in the middle 
east war of that year 
hungary was the first to reestablish relations in september 
followed by czechoslovakia feb 9 and poland on tuesday 
the soviet union and israel have exchanged consular offices but 
the kremlin says renewal of full diplomatic relations is 
conditional on progress in the middle east peace process 
israel has been also negotiating the establishment of ties with 
east germany following its acceptance of some responsibility for 
the genocide of jews during the years of the nazi rule 
east germanys previous stand of denying any responsibility for 
nazi deeds has prevented the two countries from having any

west german politicians are enjoying 
celebrity status in east germanys first free election campaign in 
40 years 
chancellor helmut kohl foreign minister hansdietrich genscher 
and former chancellor willy brandt have been among the visiting 
campaigners who have drawn crowds of up to 100000 at election 
rallies 
some communists and members of other leftist groups say the bonn 
leaders should stay out of the campaign being waged by their sister 
parties for the march 18 parliamentary elections 
but most east germans seem to welcome the support saying kohl 
genscher and brandt are providing their nation with a crucial 
lesson in democracy 
the questions being addressed here concern the people in west 
germany too said karlheinz gandre of erfurt we are one 
people and we belong together gandre said 
gandre was in a crowd of 60000 people waving west german flags 
and chanting germany united fatherland as they greeted 
genscher at a rally for the centrist association of free democrats 
in erfurt 
politicians in east germanys new prodemocracy movements are 
relatively unknown and inexperienced they benefit from the 
reflected fame of the visiting west german politicians who are 
wellknown from west german television broadcasts that blanketed 
the country even before the frontiers were opened last fall 
following a popular movement for democratic reforms 
for the west german leaders the campaign is an opportunity to 
shape the future of a new germany and perhaps establish a power 
base in this nation of 16 million now that uniting the two 
countries appears inevitable 
open politicking is new in east germany and some campaign 
posters have been torn down and defaced under the old communist 
regime political signs were virtually sacrosanct 
partly this is still a very undisciplined campaign said 
ulli mueller another erfurt resident who came to hear genscher 
theres no experience in making democracy work here because 
weve been ruled by one man for so many years 
he referred to former communist leader erich honecker who was 
ousted in october after 18 years of hardline rule 
communist premier hans modrow remains the most popular 
politician in east germany despite the partys fall from power 
according to west german media polls 
despite his personal prestige modrows party is expected to 
finish no better than a distant third in the march vote trailing 
the social democrats and the conservative alliance for germany 
brandt the architect of the 1970s period of detente between the 
two german states kicked off the east german social democrats 
campaign in leipzig 
kohl chose erfurt to make his debut on east germanys campaign 
circuit addressing a cheering crowd of 100000 the rally was 
organized by a threeparty coalition including the east german 
version of kohls christian democrats 
some people in the audience chanted helmut helmut there 
were also a few hecklers and fliers reading kohl do your 
campaigning at home were pasted over campaign posters throughout 
the city 
what mr kohl is doing is just party politics said 
hannelore tauer an east berlin supermarket clerk its not doing 
the west or east german people any good 
but that seemed to be a minority view 
the politicians in west germany have done a lot for east 
germany before so i think its right they come to the election 
campaign here gandre said

draftees in the sandinistacontrolled 
army are deserting their ranks and the military is reportedly 
hiding arms ahead of next months swearing in of an opposition 
government 
sandinista officials on thursday acknowledged the desertions but 
denied weapons and ammunition were being squirreled away 
also thursday president daniel ortega called on the united 
states to resume aid on the day he steps down to the opposition 
coalition that upset his leftist party in sundays election 
the best that could happen would be for the contras rebel 
guerrillas to be demobilized by april 25 and for the united states 
to lift the embargo and send the aid it has promised starting that 
day ortega told nicaraguan journalists 
violeta barrios de chamorro who is due to succeed ortega as 
president on april 25 has echoed ortegas call for the contras to 
lay down their weapons 
her united national opposition uno and ortegas sandinistas 
are beginning to discuss the process of transition the sandinistas 
staked out a tough set of positions tuesday including the 
dismantling of the ussupported contra rebels from their honduran 
jungle camps 
honduran officials today were expected to join sandinista and 
uno officials on shutting down the honduran rebels camps 
the sandinistas who receive soviet and cuban aid have also 
demanded the army and the interior ministry security forces remain 
intact at least until the usbacked rebels disband 
the close link between the sandinista party and army and 
security forces has been a source of strength for the sandinistas 
but the armys integrity was questioned as reports of desertions 
circulated 
the deserters draftees doing two years of compulsory military 
service apparently have decided not to wait for the inauguration 
of mrs chamorro who is committed to banning the draft 
they took our weapons away on monday and didnt give them 
back juan carlos medina 18 told the associated press maybe 
they didnt trust us 
medina said 40 out of 60 young draftees in his unit stationed 
at the main air force base in managua deserted this week he said 
the officers seem to want to ignore the problem 
the desertions are normal under the current situation said 
lt col rosa pasos defense ministry spokeswoman 
we definitely dont want to have people who dont want to be 
with us ms pasos said and anyway were going to reduce the 
army 
the deserters also reported weapons stored by the military 
one deserter told of tunnels being dug in an army post in san 
nicolas near the northern town of esteli in which to hide weapons 
a government official said 600 weapons including 
sovietdesigned ak47 assault rifles were taken from the regional 
military headquarters in juigalpa to the remote town of el rama in 
central nicaragua near the atlantic coast on monday 
on wednesday a witness saw trucks from the ministry of 
construction taking about 600 boxes of ammunition out of an army 
depot an army source said the ammunition was going to be hidden at 
construction ministry facilities 
uno leaders have expressed concern to international observers 
about weapons being taken by boat across lake nicaragua into the 
southern province of rio san juan 
but capt nelba blandon spokeswoman for the interior ministry 
denied the reports 
those are just rumors to try to affect the dignified image of 
the sandinista front ms blandon said 
just the fact that for us it losing the elections was an 
enormous surprise means we could not have set up a plan to 
transport weapons she added 
the episcopal conference of nicaragua the top roman catholic 
religious leaders called for a peaceful transition and said the 
sandinistas must give up all power 
the current government must give up each and every one of the 
powers that correspond to the new democratically elected 
government said the bishops statement released thursday 
juan cueva special representative of honduran president rafael 
callejas was in managua on thursday to meet with mrs chamorro 
ortega and nicaraguan foreign minister miguel descoto 
cueva said the meetings were scheduled to start today and that 
his job was to help hasten the rebels demobilization from honduran 
jungle camps 
israel galeano the contras chief of staff has said his forces 
will not disperse until the sandinistas are out of power

grand jury in los angeles on charges of participating in the 1985 
murder of camarena a drug enforcement administration agent and a 
mexican pilot 
when asked whether the mexican government planned to extradite 
aldana a spokesman at the mexican attorney generals office said 
no 
there was no immediate word from us officials regarding 
aldana who until four years ago headed mexicos interpol the 
international law enforcement agency 
camarenas slaying strained usmexican relations amid 
allegations of corruption among mexican police officials 
the mexican attorney generals spokesman arturo antelmo said 
aldana was arrested in connection with a huge operation to smuggle 
marijuana to the united states five years ago 
the 9000 tons of marijuana seized at the buffalo ranch in the 
northern state of chihuahua near the texas border was the biggest 
drug bust in mexican history

aldana told reporters in january that camarena had been in 
league with drug smugglers and was never killed he alleged the 
slain drug agent had plastic surgery and was living off drug 
profits in california 
the statements were made after the january broadcast of the nbc

government officials were outraged by the program saying that it 
painted a distorted picture of mexican law enforcement efforts 
against drug smuggling

greyhounds 6300 drivers went on strike early 
friday against americas only nationwide bus company the union 
said its drivers would take passengers to their next scheduled stop 
before joining the 50state walkout 
we went on strike because the company has refused to bargain 
in good faith and we have struck because the company insisted on 
imposing its original offer said union spokesman jeffrey nelson 
said in scottsdale ariz 
the strike began at 1205 mst after talks broke off in 
scottsdale despite the arrival late thursday of a federal mediator 
no new talks were scheduled 
also on strike were 3075 of the companys office and 
maintenance workers in the union the amalgamated council of 
greyhound locals whose old threeyear contract with greyhound 
lines inc expired at midnight thursday 
this is a damn pure shame to have to do business like this 
all we want is some of what weve given up over the last few 
years said a driver early friday at a greyhound terminal in 
phoenix he would not give his name 
in dallas pickets forced two greyhound buses to stop just 
outside the downtown terminal about two blocks from the skyscraper 
where the companys corporate offices are located the pickets 
cheered as the drivers left their buses which were then taken over 
by company officials in one instance passengers got off a bus and 
helped guide it past pickets into the terminal 
greyhound which says it serves 9500 us communities and is 
the only public intercity transportation in about 9000 had 
arranged schedules so that no new runs would begin after the strike 
deadline and nelson said working drivers would continue to their 
next stop at that time then join picket lines 
while we regret the decision of the union to strike we will 
be in operation to serve our passengers said greyhound vice 
president p anthony lannie chief negotiator 
lannie said greyhound would operate with replacements and any 
employees who come to work he said the company would give 
preference to routes connecting major urban centers and plans to be 
at full service by the end of the month 
greyhound has declared a war on the members of this union 
said harold mendlowitz president of local 1202 in new york city 
which also covers albany ny hartford conn and montreal 
if its a fight that they want its a fight they are going to 
get said mendlowitz they want to force us out they want to 
bust this union 
elizabeth hale said the company advised passengers this week of 
the possibility of a strike and worked to reduce the number of 
buses on the road at midnight about 22 million people rode 
greyhound last year the company said 
well do our best to get that person to their final 
destination and take care of his or her needs in the interim ms 
hale said 
the company has been advertising for drivers and as of last 
week had 600 in training ms hale did not have an updated number 
of new hires 
amtrak meanwhile told ticket agents to honor greyhound tickets 
when buses are not available railroad spokeswoman sue martin said 
in washington dc she said no additional fare would be charged 
but added that some trains require reservations and that bus 
passengers may find no space on crowded routes 
the 3yearold company earned its first profit last year after 
being created in a buyout of phoenixbased greyhound corps bus 
operations 
drivers wages were the main unresolved issue with the company 
offering a 69 percent firstyear raise and 135 percent during the 
threeyear contract drivers earned an average of 24743 last 
year according to the company 
the company says the union wants a 33 percent firstyear raise 
a figure nelson called false and misleading 
dallasbased greyhound lines inc was formed when an investment 
group led by fred g currey paid 270 million to buy the greyhound 
bus system from greyhound corp four months later the group paid 
80 million for trailways lines inc the countrys largest 
operator of trailways buses 
as part of the deal the union agreed to a 22 percent wage cut 
and greyhound said the drivers were trying to win back the entire 
amount at one time 
the company expects to earn a profit of about 730000 on 1 
billion in revenue in the previous two years the company lost 20 
million

when violeta barrios de chamorro told 
an audience of peasants last year that she was going to europe to 
bring you back a piece of the berlin wall she drew 
disbelieving laughter 
few in the rural town of nandaime had ever heard of the berlin 
wall why would someone bring them a piece of a wall 
although in recent months mrs chamorro and other united 
national opposition uno politicians frequently portrayed 
themselves as riding the tide of democracy that swept eastern 
europe last year that theme had little resonance inside nicaragua 
eastern europe you mean the people who gave us aid said 
mario ramirez a sandinista party activist when asked if he 
thought eastern europe had affected the voting 
i think when people went to the polls they voted with their 
stomachs and i think they thought about the empty stomachs of 
their children said paul reichler a washington lawyer who 
advises president daniel ortega 
sundays vote for change from a fractured economy and the strain 
of civil war against the ussupported contras swept ortegas 
leftist sandinistas from power in favor of mrs chamorro who takes 
office april 25 it marks the end of sandinista government which 
began with the ouster of dictator anastasio somoza in 1979 
but while the example of eastern europe did not reach the 
average voter the forces that caused change there affected the 
atmosphere and structure of the campaign as well as the 
sandinistas decision to hold and accept the consequences of a free 
vote 
they had to change because the world was changing said 
mauricio diaz secretarygeneral of the social christian party 
the bush administration credits the soviet union and president 
mikhail s gorbachev with encouraging nicaraguas move to democracy 
additionally reductions in east bloc aid and the visible 
failures of socialism affected the sandinistas own economic and 
political policies 
the sandinistas started out trying to build a nation on the 
cuban model but they really gave up on that by 1984 diaz said 
he and other analysts say the sandinistas were driven to 
democracy and a mixedeconomy theory by the hostility of the united 
states and the horrible state of their own economy 
the process was gradual both impeded and propelled by the war 
against ussupported contra guerrillas impeded by the need to 
maintain wartime political discipline propelled by the damage the 
war did to the economy 
real change did not take place until the united states halted 
lethal aid to the contras in early 1988 
shortly after the us congress voted to cut off aid the 
sandinistas put in place an economic austerity plan an imf 
international monetary fund plan without the imf as ortega put 
it 
while some of the plans more draconian proposals for firing 
public employees were not carried out enough was done to hurt poor 
people badly according to patricia okane a researcher at the 
regional coordinator for economic and social research in managua 
the sandinistas began wooing the private sector and acknowledged 
errors in some of their confiscation and expropriation policies 
it was tropical perestroika they tried to reform the 
revolution but it was too late diaz said 
still there were noticeable changes in the last year private 
advertising in newspapers and on radio and television picked up 
new cars began to appear on the streets also new streetlights and 
some street repairs were made 
in a strange conjunction that also occurred in poland under 
wojciech jaruzelskis government the country held its first beauty 
pageant in years 
theyre very pragmatic i think they began those moves as pure 
tactics the opening towards democracy a mixed economy 
nonalignment but somehow it became more than tactics said diaz 
they took a big gamble and they really thought they were going 
to win they totally underestimated the effects of the economic 
crisis okane said 
ortega and other sandinistas insist their party is not anything 
like the communist parties of eastern europe 
ortega has said the comparison is invalid because he won 40 
percent of the vote much more than any communist party in eastern 
europe is likely to gain 
diaz noted that nicaragua was never ruled by an allencompassing 
single party 
there were always independent unions though weak there was 
always a private sector there was always a political opposition 
he said 
he believes the influence of a nearby and very interested united 
states was a factor 
people were tired of always fighting the united states he 
said now everyones waiting for the first mcdonalds to open 
the sandinistas are not complete democrats however said diaz 
they linked the party the army and security forces and the 
government in a kind of triangle he said 
theyve lost the government but they are currently fighting in 
negotations with the opposition to hold on to the partyarmy link 
their last hold on power 
diaz said he thought there was real irony in the sandinista 
evolution 
just as they were becoming democratic they lost an 
election he said

the rotc is seeking to recover a 25000 
scholarship it gave to a star recruit who lost his commission after 
disclosing hes gay 
james holobaugh 24 was to have been commissioned by the army 
in may when he disclosed his homosexuality the military withdrew 
the commission and moved to make holobaugh reimburse the reserve 
officers training corps for the scholarship at washington 
university 
the pentagon regards homosexuals as unsuitable for military 
service and does not knowingly permit them to serve 
its policy stating that the presence of homosexuals would 
seriously impair discipline good order morale and security was 
upheld by the supreme court in two decisions monday 
it is not unusual for homosexual cadets to be removed from rotc 
but this is apparently the first case in which the army had asked 
for its scholarship money back said william b rubenstein 
holobaughs attorney 
holobaugh was rated one of the top performers in his rotc class 
and was selected by the army to be in a nationwide advertising 
campaign to attract students 
holobaugh who expects to graduate in the spring said that he 
was dating women when he began college in 1984 it wasnt until 
late 1988 or early 1989 that he realized he was homosexual 
holobaugh said 
holobaugh said he was appalled at the prejudice in the 
military against homosexuals its kind of blowing my mind he 
said 
i will without a doubt fight to not have to pay back my 
scholarship he said 
his case is being reviewed by the commander of the army second 
region at fort knox ky 
at an informal hearing in december the army questioned whether 
holobaugh was masquerading as a homosexual to evade his service 
obligation but later ruled that no such evidence existed said 
rubenstein who is also staff counsel for the lesbian and gay 
rights project of the american civil liberties union 
after completing the rotc program students commissioned as 
officers must serve in the military for four years of active duty 
or eight years in reserves 
washington university supports holobaugh its provost of the 
university edward s macias wrote to lt col robert l bates 
the rotc commander saying the ban on homosexuals was 
inconsistent with the nondiscriminatory values of this and i 
should think virtually all universities

the dollar closed slightly lower against the yen 
today pushed back by rumors that japans central bank will raise 
its official discount rate share prices on the tokyo stock 
exchange gained moderately 
the dollar closed the week at 14975 yen down 003 yen from 
thursdays close of 14978 yen after opening at 15035 yen the 
currency ranged between 14950 yen and 15050 yen 
it was the first time that the dollars trading range rose to 
the 150yen level since june 
prime minister toshiki kaifu commenting on the dollars rise 
told reporters that japans economic fundamentals remain solid and 
that the situation is not such that we are coming to a crisis 
kyodo news service reported 
but finance minister ryutaro hashimoto told a regular news 
conference that he was extremely worried about the yens 
continued decline against the dollar though there has been no 
adverse effect on the countrys economy and prices 
both kaifu and hashimoto said the situation must be watched 
carefully 
currency dealers said the dollar continued to rise in the 
morning session despite the reported dollarselling intervention 
by the bank of japan but the dollar was sold because of the 
interest rate rumors 
the rumor was found later to be groundless 
many market players consider the dollars underlying sentiment 
basically remains bullish because of the currencys actual 
demand said a dealer with the bank of tokyo who spoke 
anonymously 
there has been speculation for weeks that the central bank will 
raise its official discount rate the rate charged on its loans to 
commercial banks in a range of 0510 percent the rate is 
currently 425 percent

a total of 570 million shares changed hands down from 620 
million shares traded on thursday 
securities dealers said the tokyo market is showing a gradual 
recovery despite rising interest rates on japanese bonds and the 
yens relative weakness declining bond prices were partly 
responsible for the sagging stock market over the last two weeks 
today the market proved its strength in spite of such 
negative factors said masahiro umemori an equity analyst with 
nomura securities 
in the bonds market the yield on the no 119 benchmark 10year 
bond closed at 7125 percent up from thursdays close at 7090

costa rica will ask the united 
states to extradite an indiana man for the 1984 bombing of a news 
conference in which four people were killed a foreign ministry 
source said 
the source who did not want to be identified by name said the 
costa rican embassy in washington will present the extradition 
request monday for john hull who skipped bond and fled to the 
united states last july after living 20 years in costa rica 
in an interview thursday from his home in patoka ind hull 
said the charge of planning the bombing is completely false and 
its completely politically motivated he said the costa rican 
government objects to his ties to an american religious 
organization 
hull who owned a ranch near the nicaraguan border was accused 
of supplying weapons to the usbacked contra rebels 
the may 31 1984 explosion in a house in penca nicaragua 
killed three reporters american reporter linda frazier two costa 
rican journalists and a nicaraguan rebel they were attending a 
news conference by eden pastora a contra rebel commander at the 
time who had defected from the sandinista government 
pastora who was believed to be the target of the bombing and 
about a dozen other people were injured 
prosecutor jorge chavarria said hull and felipe vidal a cuban 
planned the bombing to avenge pastoras statements linking hull to 
the cia the whereabouts of vidal and the man who placed the bomb 
have not been determined 
hull said he had not heard from either us or costa rican 
officials by thursday night 
as i understand it before they can extradite a us citizen 
they have to prove the charges in a us court he said they 
could have proved the charges in a court down there because you can 
manipulate judges and everyone else in the judicial system but you 
cant do that here in the united states maximo esquivel a judge 
in northern costa rica was quoted in thursdays editions of the 
new york times as saying he signed the extradition order last 
month esquivels office said the judge would not make any 
statement about the matter when the associated press contacted his 
office by telephone thursday in quesada about 100 miles north of 
san jose 
the status of hulls nationality is unclear while the costa 
rican government claims he has acquired costa rica citizenship 
hull referred to himself as an american on thursday 
hull was released from a hospital thursday in evansville ind 
where he had been treated for heart problems he said recently 
returned from a trip to el salvador for the toledobased americans 
helping america organization providing bibles and securing 
chaplins for the military there 
hull was jailed last year in costa rica accused of drug 
trafficking to help the rebels and of violating costa ricas 
neutrality he fled to indiana after his release on 37000 bond

the seabrook nuclear plant overcame two 
decades of protests legal challenges ballooning costs and the 
financial ruin of its chief investor to capture the ultimate prize 
a license to operate 
the nuclear regulatory commission voted 30 thursday to grant 
the 65 billion reactor a fullpower license but the appeal 
process will hold up the license for at least two weeks and 
seabrook opponents pressed on 
about 125 antiseabrook demonstrators waved signs chanted and 
blocked plant gates after the decision more than 70 were arrested 
at the nrc meeting in rockville md utility executives hugged 
each other after the ruling and maintenance workers at the 
1200plus employee plant hoisted a sign reading startup 90 we 
have the power 
its a milestone in the lives of our employees more than just 
mortar and bricks said edward brown president of seabrook 
operator new hampshire yankee 
seabrook perhaps the nations most hotly contested nuclear 
plant became a symbol of the antinuclear movement and its foes 
claimed a broader victory contending that as a result of the long 
fight against seabrook no utility would risk the costs of trying 
to build and open another nuclear plant 
conceived in 1968 it was proposed in 1972 as a twinreactor 
plant costing less than 1 billion construction delays and cost 
increases forced the cancellation of one reactor in the mid1980s 
and plunged lead owner public service co of new hampshire into 
bankruptcy reorganization in 1988 
the plant was held up largely by concerns over whether the area 
could be evacuated in an emergency the nrc ruling ratified 
recommendations by its staff and several lowerlevel boards that 
the plant is safe and that evacuation plans would work 
i would be happy to live within two miles of this plant and i 
wouldnt worry about it at all said nrc chairman kenneth carr 
weeks before thursdays licensing plant operators raised 
temperatures and pressure in the 1150megawatt reactor to ready it 
for nuclear fission 
were going to stay at temperature and pressure and as soon as 
we get the license in hand were ready to go said brown 
the decision gives opponents seven days to file an appeal seven 
days after the filing the license becomes effective unless a judge 
issues a stay if the appeal fails ascension to full power could 
take two to three months 
seabrook opponents remained undaunted saying the final battles 
now move into an arena more likely to rule in their favor 
massachusetts attorney general james shannon and two 
environmental groups planned to ask for a stay of the license next 
week in the federal appeals court in washington 
its correct to say there has never been a case where the 
court has overturned an nrc license but its also correct to say 
that there has never been a license issued which has been so 
legally vulnerable shannon said 
those vulnerabilities include what opponents consider the nrcs 
violation of its own procedures in rulings on emergency evacuation 
plans for the densely populated new hampshire and massachusetts 
communities near the plant 
one of seabrooks most prominent opponents massachusetts gov 
michael dukakis refused to summit emergency plans in 1986 after 
declaring that safe evacuation was impossible the nrc then 
accepted utilitydrafted plans for massachusetts 
in boston on thursday dukakis held george bush who defeated 
him in the 1988 presidential election partially responsible for 
the nrc action bushs support of the plant has made a 
significant difference here he said 
bush supported seabrook while campaigning for new hampshires 
1988 presidential primary with john sununu then new hampshires 
governor and now white house chief of staff leading his campaign 
sununu is a staunch seabrook supporter 
overall there have been more than 3200 arrests in 
antiseabrook protests which peaked in the mid1970s during 
construction and picked up again last summer as the plant drew 
closer to a fullpower license 
carr on thursday defended the commissions handling of the 
seabrook license 
we see nothing at present that persuades us that seabrook 
cannot be operated safely the nrc chairman said this is one 
of the most closely scrutinized and safely built plants in the 
world

tomato seeds exposed to the rigors of 
space travel for six years seem to be germinating normally 
scientists say 
the first small batch of seeds recently returned from a nasa 
satellite were displayed thursday apparently sprouting normally 
in a germination test that began saturday said dr jim alston of 
park seed co 
everything looked fine no little green critters came flying 
out joked alston whose company provided the 125 million seeds 
for the experiment aboard the space agencys long duration exposure 
facility 
at a news conference called to display the germinating seeds 
officials also cracked open one of eight unopened canisters of 
seeds launched into space in april 1984 
the satellite was supposed to be picked up by space shuttle 
astronauts and returned to earth 10 months after it was launched 
but scheduling difficulties and the 1986 challenger disaster 
delayed its retrieval they were retrieved in december by the 
shuttle columbia 
the seeds most of them in sealed insulated canisters 
appeared to have survived their long space journey said officials 
working on the project with nasa 
in addition to the 125 million tomato seeds of the rutgers 
california supreme variety there were 120 types of seeds 
including corn onion cucumber and sunflower 
scientists will look for mutations caused by the heavy radiation 
they were exposed to in space plants grown from the seeds will be 
examined for differences in color indicating a loss of 
chlorophyll and for differences in leaves stems flowers and 
fruit 
the results may be significant in determining whether food can 
be grown in outer space 
opening the canister is something less than hightech after 
undoing its 36 screws alston first tried to pop the top off with a 
chunk of wood and a hammer but he ended up prying it off with a 
rusty butcher knife a pocketknife and a putty knife 
some of the samples will be analyzed at the seed company but 
most will be shipped to colleges and elementary and high schools 
across the country for experiments 
the results of those experiments will be sent to oklahoma state 
university which is scheduled to publish a report this fall on the 
findings

one might think a tobacco shop would be safe haven for those 
puffing pariahs already persona non grata in restaurants 
elevators trains planes and automobiles 
but tobacco emporium owner lindsay heine who advertised for the 
nonsmoking clerk this week believes even smoke shop customers 
have the right to be exposed to smoke on their own terms 
i can see how that that might be a little contradictory she 
said 
of the shops six employees only one smokes and she smokes 
only at home ms heine said a smoker would disrupt the smokefree

the accuracy of cholesterol screening tests 
varies widely with portable testing machines used by poorly 
trained operators giving highly inaccurate results up to onefourth 
of the time researchers said 
poorly set instruments and inadequate training were mainly to 
blame for misleading readings which can cause people to seek 
unneeded medical treatment or falsely reassure them they dont need 
it researchers said in a study today 
even under the best of circumstances cholesterol is a lot 
like blood pressure said one of the researchers michelle j 
naughton a sociologist at the university of minnesota school of 
public health in minneapolis it will vary by the time of day you 
take it and it will vary from day to day 
excess cholesterol in the blood is one of the three main 
modifiable traits linked with increased likelihood of developing 
heart disease the nations no 1 killer the two others are high 
blood pressure and smoking 
in the journal of the american medical association study ms 
naughtons group said cholesterol screening results were within an 
acceptable range of accuracy in only one of four public screenings 
they analyzed 
in the three other screenings readings often strayed from true 
values by more than 142 percent the largest range of error 
allowed under guidelines of the national cholesterol education 
program researchers said 
true values were established on samples from the same subjects 
measured in a nationally standardized laboratory the researchers 
said 
the highest rate of unacceptable results was 235 percent among 
tests done by a cholesterolscreening company at an unidentified 
worksite the researchers said 
other testing groups had rates of unacceptable error ranging 
from 69 percent at a retail store to 36 percent at a grocery 
store to zero percent at the minnesota state fair the 
researchers found 
at the unidentified worksite where accuracy was worst testers 
had received only one day of training and no apprenticeship or 
refresher courses 
at the retail store and the grocery store testers had undergone 
two days of training and an apprenticeship the researchers found 
at the minnesota state fair testers had undergone four days of 
training an apprenticeship and threehour refresher courses every 
three months the researchers said

homelands to escape communist dictatorships especially cuba and 
nicaragua said samuel burstyn the attorney for former noriega

a state appeals court has struck down a 
company policy prohibiting women capable of bearing children from 
working around lead 
the court ruled that the fetal protection program by johnson 
controls inc which owned a battery manufacuter in fullerton 
assumed that all fertile women would become pregnant and was 
nothing more than sex discrimination 
we are in an era of choice a woman is not required to become 
a victorian brood marethe court said in the ruling released 
thursday 
catherine ruckelshaus of san francisco legal aids employment 
law center which represented the woman in the case queen foster 
said it was the first appellate decision in the country to overturn 
a fetal protection policy 
the ruling was based on california civil rights law and lacks 
direct effect outside the state but could be a model for courts 
elsewhere ms ruckelshaus said 
were ecstatic she said employers can no longer 
discriminate on the basis of ones ability to have children 
gerald griffin a lawyer for johnson controls referred 
questions to corporate officials who did not return a call 
thursday the company makes batteries for some of the nations 
biggest retailers under their house brands 
ms foster had been denied a battery assembly job in 1983 at a 
johnson plant under a nationwide policy the company had started 
three months earlier 
high concentrations of lead which is used in automobile 
batteries have been found to affect adult and child health and 
have been linked by some researchers to birth defects 
in 1987 the state fair employment and housing commission 
ordered globe battery to hire her give her back pay and additional 
amounts to be determined later and rescind its policy the company 
appealed and won in 1988 in superior court 
the appeals court ruling rejected the reasoning of the 7th us 
circuit court of appeals which upheld the companys policy in a 
minnesota case last year the united auto workers has appealed the 
minnesota ruling to the us supreme court 
the policy apparently presumes that the employer is better 
suited to safeguard the interests of a womans future offspring 
should there be an unexpected pregnancy than is the woman 
herself said the california court in the 30 decision

a federal appeals court reversed a 632814 award 
to a servicemans family who challenged the militarys finding 
their loved one was killed in action during the vietnam war 
the ruling thursday by the 11th us circuit court of appeals 
went against the first american family to refuse to accept the 
remains of a casualty of war 
the court reversed the decision of a us district judge in 
florida who in 1988 ordered the government to pay 632814 to the 
family of an air force officer whose gunship was shot down in laos 
in 1972 the judge ruled that the air force recklessly caused the 
family emotional distress by declaring lt col thomas trammell 
hart iii dead 
the appeals court found the government acted within its 
authority and ruled that the lower court both lacked jurisdiction 
and decided wrongly on the merits of the case 
hart 32 was one of 16 crewmen aboard the gunship two crew 
members parachuted to safety the others initially listed as 
missing in action eventually were determined by military experts 
to have been killed 
harts wife mother and daughter challenged the techniques used 
to identify the remains and charged that the methods violated 
military policy anne hart also wanted her husband returned to the 
unaccounted for list 
she said the decision to label him killed in action without 
positive identification could doom him if he were still alive and 
being held as a prisoner of war 
the appeals court noted that searchers reconstructed the downing 
of the plane and dug around the accident site to a depth of 14 
feet unearthing 50000 bone fragments identification tags and 
personal effects 
in reviewing the governments handling of the case the appeals 
court said clearly in cases where the total evidence indicates 
the persons involved in the incident were in fact killed and where 
recovery efforts were thorough and complete we must conculed that 
the individuals have been accounted for 
the government according to the court made its 
identification as best it could and when that proved to be 
insufficient it complied with every request made by the harts 
except their request that lt col hart be returned to 
unaccountedfor status 
the appeals court said the family could pursue its case through 
other channels such as the armed forces board but added that the 
courts shouldnt secondguess discretionary policies

east german authorities have taken another 
step toward the introduction of capitalism by announcing the 
nations stateowned industries will be sold off to private 
investors starting march 15 
however land and fixed assets will not be on sale to foreigners 
in what is seen as a move to prevent a huge sellout to west germany 
also thursday the east german foreign ministry proposed that 
experts from both germanys meet soon to work out a common position 
on german unification for presentation to the world war ii allies 
the united states the soviet union britain and france 
in poland demonstrators rallied thursday in three cities to 
support their governments demand that it also be included in the 
talks poland says it needs access to the talks to win assurances a 
united germany would not claim prewar territory that is now part of 
presentday poland 
details are sketchy on the economic measures by the interim 
government of premier hans modrow which were announced by economic 
reform commissioner wolfgang krause 
the program to sell off east germanys huge industrial combines 
mainly to east german nationals begins three days before 
parliamentary elections scheduled march 18 the first free vote 
this communistled nation has seen in 40 years 
the new parliament would supervise the program and could even 
make substantial changes it could exempt some foreign investors 
from the purchasing ban if that is deemed in line with the public 
benefit krause said 
the privatization plan is a compromise between the concerns of 
west german investors who want full integration of the two 
nations economies and worries in east germany of a complete 
takeover by the west 
government spokesman wolfgang meyer said the interim step toward 
privatization would give industry managers more autonomy while 
hindering arbitrary sale of assets and property 
the lack of specifics apparently reflected the modrow 
governments reluctance to go ahead with major reforms without a 
parliamentary mandate 
modrow however also faces immense pressures to quickly restore 
confidence in his nations ailing economy as up to 3000 people a 
day continue to leave for west germany 
that haste was also reflected by east germanys proposal to form 
a joint committee of experts to work out a german line in the 
reunification talks with the allies who defeated the nazis in 1945 
under the plan announced last month in ottawa the two germanys 
will first discuss their common approach to unification and submit 
that to the four world war ii allies 
according to the official news agency adn a foreign ministry 
memorandum said germanys neighbors should play some role in the 
unification process where their security interests were at stake 
this was an apparent reference to poland 
chancellor helmut kohl of west germany who faces pressure from 
a conservative constituency in december elections has continued to 
hedge on polish demands for guarantees that germany wont reclaim 
territories it lost to poland 
east german parliamentary secretariat chief herbert krause 
meanwhile told the communist party newspaper neues deutschland on 
thursday that 35 parties have so far registered for the march 18 
vote although no candidate lists are available yet 
despite modrows great personal prestige recent opinion polls 
predict east germanys social democratic party will finish first 
followed by the conservative alliance for germany a threeparty 
coalition including the christian democratic union as well as the 
democratic awakening group

the dollar rose against most major foreign 
currencies today in quiet european trading 
gold prices were lower 
dealers said the dollar is strong largely ignoring any bad 
economic news and taking favorable reports as an excuse to advance 
further 
the currency was boosted by continued weakness in the yen and 
the west german mark traders said 
a senior dealer at the bank of montreal said the dollar could 
weaken on expectations that the west german central bank the 
bundesbank will intervene to keep the mark from falling too low 
we have to be careful about the bundesbank it has made a 
policy decision that it wants a strong deutsche mark the bank of 
montreals mark sexton said 
other dealers disagreed and predicted the bundesbank would not 
intervene until after the east german elections march 18 
intervention wouldnt make any sense at this point said

chinese reporters will never again be allowed to 
disseminate western ideas and those who try to change the socialist 
system will be punished communist party chief jiang zemin said in 
a speech published today 
editorials commentaries and speeches on the correct role of 
journalism in china have appeared regularly since the leadership 
cracked down on last years massive prodemocracy movement 
the full text of jiangs speech made nov 28 at a seminar 
organized by the partys propaganda department took up nearly a 
full page in the official party newspaper the peoples daily the 
speech was the lead item in all major newspapers 
there was no explanation for the delayed release of jiangs 
speech but it is not unusual for leaders talks to be published 
months or even years after they were given 
in the speech jiang reminded reporters they should serve as the 
mouthpieces of the party to give publicity to the partys 
basic line 
from april to june all major newspapers ran detailed lively 
and accurate reports of the studentled movement for political 
reforms displaying an autonomy rarely seen in chinese journalism 
the military later crushed the prodemocracy movement 
jiang accused those newspapers of being controlled by advocates 
of bourgeois liberalism or western ideas saying they became 
tools for arousing sentiments against the party and the socialist 
system 
he singled out for criticism shanghais world economic herald 
chinas most liberal newspaper the paper has not been allowed to 
publish since may and sources say it is being disbanded before 
the protests last spring the paper often printed thoughtful essays 
on the need for political and economic reforms 
jiang warned from now on newspapers magazines radio and 
television stations will never be allowed to disseminate bourgeois 
liberalization 
instead the mass media must fight firmly and persistently 
against bourgeois liberalization 
journalistic activity aimed at altering the socialist system 
would be punished jiang said without elaboration 
jiang claimed there is no absolute and unlimited press freedom 
in any country and argued the work environment for reporters in 
other countries was not much better than china 
he added that western countries have always punished 
journalistic activity aimed at changing the capitalist system but 
did not give any examples 
jiang also called for greater party control over reporters 
leadership of the press should be firmly held by marxists 
he said

darkie a popular brand of toothpaste in 
hong kong has been changed to darlie in response to 
accusations the old name was racist a company spokeswoman said 
today 
however the new brand which first appeared on local counters 
thursday still has chinese print that reads black man 
toothpaste 
hawley and hazel chemical co ltd renamed the brand darlie 
after the usbased colgatepalmolive co which bought a 50 
percent share in the company in 1985 faced pressure at home to 
make the change 
in addition to keeping the old chinese name the company also 
continued using the brand logo of a grinning black minstrel with 
sparkling white teeth 
mary kwan spokeswoman for hawley and hazel said the entire 
label will eventually be replaced in a further bid to improve the 
products image 
to many chinese the name does not carry any racist 
connotations she said we believe local customers prefer the 
original name as concluded from our previous intensive market 
research 
a representative of the african national congress visiting hong 
kong to discuss trade matters still expressed outrage over the 
product 
if this company found itself in south africa it would not be 
used eric molobi was quoted by the englishlanguage south china 
morning post as saying there would be a permanent boycott 
miss kwan predicted that the change of names would have minimal 
effect on sales the brand now has a market share of more than 30 
percent 
the toothpaste is distributed only in asia and already has been 
renamed in taiwan malaysia and singapore she said 
in 1987 the taiwan government warned the public not to carry 
darkie toothpaste abroad to avoid trouble or misunderstanding

a smokers sense of smell recedes with every 
passing puff according to researchers at the university of 
pennsylvania who conducted scratch and sniff tests 
the majority still have a sense of smell but not as acute as 
if they werent smoking said richard doty director of the 
universitys smell and taste center 
both current and former smokers lose their ability to smell all 
kinds of odors in proportion to the amount of cigarettes and length 
of time they had smoked the researchers reported today in the 
journal of the american medical association 
the researchers used the scratch and sniff tests to evaluate the 
ability of 638 volunteers to smell 40 different odors of the 
subjects 262 had never smoked 197 were exsmokers and 179 were 
current smokers in addition 14 people said they also smoked 
cigars or pipes 
a person who smoked two packs of cigarettes a day for 10 years 
has less of an ability to smell on average than someone who had 
smoked two packs of cigarettes for five years said the reports 
lead author former research associate richard frye frye is now a 
graduate student at drexel university 
current smokers are nearly twice as likely to show a loss of 
smell than those who never smoked according to the researchers 
a medical psychologist studying the effects of smoking and 
nicotine called the studys results very intriguing 
it could help explain why a lot of the old studies connected a 
loss in the sense of taste to smoking said neil grunberg of the 
uniformed services university of the health sciences in bethesda 
md grunberg pointed out that the sense of taste is linked to the 
sense of smell and the study could shed light on what component of 
cigarettes affects both senses 
the loss appears to be reversible doty said but twopackaday 
smokers would have to quit for as many years as they smoked to 
regain the essential sense he said 
smell is our primary sense for detecting such environmental 
dangers as leaking natural gas spoiled food and smoke doty 
said in addition it may be of diagnostic value for the early 
detection of a number of neurological disorders including 
alzheimers disease and parkinsonism in which the diseases 
victims lose some of their sense of smell 
doty said that the cause of the smell loss was not known but he 
believed that a chemical in the tobacco smoke may kill nasal cells 
the loss of the sense of smell is yet another good reason to 
quit smoking doty said smoking creates the possibility of

miners in the ukrainian coal capital of donetsk 
walked off the job today to press demands that the local communist 
party leadership resign a city official said 
about 1500 miners waving banners calling for the resignations 
gathered in front of party headquarters and 24 miners announced a 
hunger strike until the party leaders quit said nikolai 
ponomarenko a regional strike committee member 
the walkout followed a sixhour warning strike thursday 
strike leaders in the city 500 miles south of moscow said they 
believe the party leadership will interfere in the campaigning in 
the ukraine for sundays multiparty elections which also will take 
place in russia and byelorussia 
they also said there is dissatisfaction that promises made after 
coal strikes in the region last summer are not being implemented 
quickly enough miners had demanded better living and working 
conditions as well as local autonomy 
yuri smirnov the chairman of the donetsk city council said on 
local radio that the walkout shut down two shafts and partially 
idled a third an action he described as a political strike 
the warning strike affected the thursday afternoon shift at a 
number of mines in donetsk according to the tv news show 
vremya but the official news agency tass said many miners at a 
strike committee meeting were reluctant to go along saying the 
walkout would aggravate the grave economic situation 
ponomarenko said that at the rally outside party headquarters 
city officials refused to allow the use of loudspeakers because the 
gathering was not approved and speeches could spark disorder 
this is a provocation ponomarenko said in a telephone 
interview there have never been any disorders during strikes 
because miners themselves keep the discipline he said 
radio moscow said the local party committee put off 
consideration of the miners demand that they resign at least until 
a regional party conference scheduled april 67 
the party committee spoke in favor of holding a conference 
next month which would be authorized the give a vote of confidence 
or elect new party leaders the radio said 
on feb 7 a mass rally held in donetsk forced the resignation 
of the local party chief a vinnik the miners held another rally 
a week later to demand that the entire party leadership of dontesk 
resign

twentyone officials of toppled 
dictator nicolae ceausescus hated security police faced a military 
court today on charges related to the deaths of as many as 1000 
people in decembers uprising 
the defendants are accused of either complicity in genocide or 
facilitating genocide charges arising from the shooting of 
unarmed demonstrators in middecember opposed to stalinist dictator 
nicolae ceausescu 
national outrage over the shooting helped spark the bloody 
revolution that subsequently swept ceausescu and his followers from 
power and resulted in the execution of the dictator and his wife 
elena on dec 25 
the proceedings are the first in timisoara about 180 miles west 
of bucharest and the first against those suspected of trying to 
throttle the uprising before it spread 
it follows similar trials in january in sibiu of several police 
officers accused of firing on demonstrators in that city about 120 
miles northwest of the romanian capital 
fighting was particularly fierce in sibiu stronghold of 
ceausescus son nicu who is awaiting trial on various charges 
sentences of up to 19 years were meted out there 
in bucharest four politburo members were convicted in january 
of complicity in genocide and sentenced to life in prison after 
they testified that they went along with the dictators orders to 
fire on demonstrators 
initially as many as 4000 people were reported killed by 
ceausescu loyalists in timisoara but no authoritative final count 
has been published the actual figure is more likely in the 
hundreds and expectations are that a final toll will be disclosed 
at the trial

age of hope will be based on firm relations of cooperation 
between tokyo and washington

living and to strengthen americas competitiveness he said i

issue is expected to be a major topic 
the united states is pressing japan to restructure fundamentals

a legislator contends that rj reynolds is 
using a tshirt promotion to hook youngsters on cigarettes a 
charge the tobacco company denies 
im 41 and i wear tshirts rj reynolds spokesman dave 
fishel said in a telephone interview from winstonsalem nc 
rep jim slattery dkan attacked the companys tshirt 
promotion thursday at an energy and commerce subcommittee on 
transportation and hazardous materials hearing on a bill to 
restrict tobacco advertising 
i contend that when you give away tshirts you are targeting 
children not targeting adults slattery said adding that to 
deny that youngsters are being targeted is an insult to peoples 
intelligence 
slattery was referring to an rj reynolds campaign that offers 
free tshirts with a cartoon version of the longtime camel 
cigarette mascot old joe 
opponents of the bill to restrict advertising argue that the 
campaign against socalled targeted advertising is an elitist 
and patronizing affront to the judgment of those being targeted 
including blacks hispanics and women 
recent marketing documents surrounding a new rj reynolds brand 
talked about targeting the dakota cigarette to socalled 
virile females young white women who watch television sitcoms 
and go to tractor pulls 
rep alex mcmillan rnc criticized antismoking advocates 
who say target groups are victims and that these people do not 
have the intelligence or wisdom to make their own decision whether 
or not to smoke 
you dont hear cries of outrage over housewives being targeted 
by detergent makers or yuppies being exploited by exposure to 
american express commercials said tino duran president of the 
national association of hispanic publications 
why is that because unlike hispanics nobody would dare 
suggest that those people need to be protected from advertising 
duran said many hispanic publications would collapse if the 
government bans tobacco and alcohol advertising 
antismoking advocates say the tobacco industry is preying on 
hispanics blacks women and youngsters to make up for the lost 
market from people who quit smoking 
under the reynolds promotions people may call a tollfree 
number for the old joe tshirt those who call later receive a 
brochure in the mail offering them free cigarettes 
fishel denied that minors were taking advantage of the promotion 
and said that parents must bear some responsibility in keeping 
their children from doing so 
slattery displayed a brochure that was sent to a 14yearold boy 
who had ordered the tshirt 
the boys mother contacted by the associated press said she 
found the offer when she sorted the mail the brochure offered free 
packs of cigarettes but required signature on a card stating that 
the person placing the order smokes and is over 21 
my son knows of at least four kids who received the coupons 
other than him said the woman who spoke on the condition she 
not be identified by name 
she said she was particularly upset because her father recently 
died from emphysema blamed on years of smoking 
fishel said company records indicated that the boy had given his 
age as 24 and said he smoked marlboro lights 
we dont want kids on our mailing list fishel said 
anytime anybody has complained about something like this the 
name automatically comes off the mailing list 
the legislation sponsored by rep thomas a luken dohio would 
limit tobacco print advertising to text ban advertising directed 
at minors and restrict tobacco advertising on billboards

a man under investigation for two mail bomb 
deaths in december is asking the 11th us circuit court of appeals 
to find news organizations in contempt of a courtimposed gag order 
details of the request were unclear because the attorneys 
representing the man walter leroy moody jr of clayton county 
refused to give lawyers for the news organizations copies of the 
contempt motion 
moodys attorneys who obtained the gag order last month also 
refuse to comment on any aspect of the case 
terry adamson attorney for the atlanta journalconstitution and 
wsbtv said he received a letter thursday notifying him that a 
contempt motion had been filed but it did not give any details 
any suggestion that we or our clients have violated any court 
order is sadly ludicrous and patently frivolous said adamson 
who has appealed the order sealing records and barring official 
comment on the moody case 
meanwhile the white house confirmed that moody has written to 
president bush about the investigation 
cheryl kienel of the white house media relations office said a 
letter from moody was received feb 23 
we had received guidance from the fbi if we received any 
correspondence from mr moody we should forward it to them which 
we did ms kienel said 
bruce harvey one of moodys attorneys declined to discuss the 
letter beyond saying it involves the investigation 
moody is one of three men in georgia and alabama whose 
properties have been searched in the bomb investigation 
federal agents have been working since middecember to solve a 
series of bombings two of which claimed the lives of 11th circuit 
judge robert vance and savannah lawyer robert robinson 
the judges of the 11th circuit have removed themselves from 
hearing matters related to the moody case and the bombing

the governments chief economic forecasting 
gauge was flat in january the commerce department said today in a 
further indication that the economys current sluggishness will 
extend into midyear 
the lack of change in the index of leading economic indicators 
designed to forecast economic activity six to nine months in 
advance followed a revised 06 percent gain in december and a 01 
percent advance in november the index fell 04 percent in october 
many economists had expected a slight increase in the january 
index 
three of the 11 forwardlooking statistics contributed to the 
gain led by a sharp increase in building permits during the 
warmest january on record 
others showing strength were slower business delivery times and 
an increase in the backlog of manufacturers unfilled orders 
the biggest drag on the index in january was a decline in orders 
for consumer goods 
other negatives were a drop in the money supply a decline in 
plant and equipment orders lower stock prices a decrease in the 
price of raw materials a drop in an index measuring consumer 
confidence and an increase in weekly unemployment claims 
one indicator the length of the average work week was 
unchanged 
the various changes left the index at 1453 percent of its 1982 
base of 100 the index rose 08 percent from august through january 
after falling 07 percent the previous six months 
the december index orginally was reported to have risen 08 
percent but was revised downward to 06 percent largely because 
of lower orders for consumer goods 
despite the sluggishness recent surveys indicate that business 
executives and economists generally believe the federal reserve is 
driving the economy down the right road steering it away from a 
recession while braking the growth of inflation 
seventytwo percent of the professional forecasters responding 
to a poll by the national association of business economists said 
the central bank was on the right track 
and 56 percent of the business leaders participating in a survey 
by the national association of manufacturers said fed policies are 
just about right 
but most of the business leaders and economists surveyed project 
continued sluggish growth in 1990 as the fed keeps interest rates 
relatively high to slow the economy and keep prices under control 
fed chairman alan greenspan told congress this week that the 
economy would avoid a recession although it would grow only at a 
modest annual rate of 175 percent to 2 percent this year 
but he added whenever you have economic growth as low as 
this you are vulnerable 
greenspan was referring to the latest report on the gross 
national product released wednesday that showed the economy 
slowing in the fourth quarter of 1989 to a 09 percent growth rate 
down from 3 percent in the third quarter 
in the opposite lane is a minority of economists who believe the 
economy is about to cross into negative growth if it isnt 
already there 
paul getman an economist with regional financial association in 
west chester pa said the economic slowdown has not passed and 
we may be just in the middle of it the question is whether 
the weakness in manufacturing will spread to other sectors of the 
economy 
nevertheless the two surveys completed last month showed 
guarded optimism 
the business economists poll found that 606 percent of the 
forecasters thought the economy while in a danger zone would 
avoid a recession during the next three years 
the manufacturers survey found that 82 percent of the 
executives questioned saw sluggish growth but no recession in 1990

reporters watched half a dozen paramilitary forces fire tear gas 
at hundreds of uniformed high school pupils protesting outside the 
offices of fraternite matin the statecontrolled newspaper that

ended their protest police also beat and briefly detained a priest 
who accompanied the students to guarantee their safety their 
action angered catholic church officials who negotiated the 
detainees release 
amnesty international the londonbased human rights group 
today denounced the police action and said students were beaten for 
merely pressing political demands 
militant students said they were not satisfied by a government 
response to their lesser demands this week the government halved 
costs of university board and lodging and named a new education 
minister 
but houphouetboigny has rejected demands for a multiparty 
democracy which he argues would endanger national unity in a 
country still wrought by tribal rivalries

union leaders angered by plans to cut government employees 
salaries frozen for eight years by between 15 percent and 40 
percent as well as impose a 10 percent solidarity tax on all wage

a cuban foreign ministry adviser says fidel 
castros communist government is considering political and economic 
reforms but will not veer away from oneparty rule 
rolando rodriguez garcia also said thursday that the electoral 
defeat four days earlier of the leftist sandinistas in nicaragua 
a longtime ally does not mean the end of the revolution there 
it is not a bankruptcy the official told a news conference 
at the cuban embassy it is only a bitter blow a transitory 
setback 
rodriguez said cuba is in solidarity with all the revolutions 
of the world cuba is not alone we continue to have many friends 
at our side 
he said the caribbean island nation led by castro since a 
revolution in 1959 began to undergo changes before soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachevs call for perestroika ignited 
changes in other socialist countries 
we undertook transformation before perestroika he said 
he said restructuring began in the 1960s after cuba found social 
systems it copied did not work 
at the cuban communist partys third congress in 1985 the 
countrys system underwent an exhaustive analysis and a fourth 
congress planned for next year will continue to review cubas 
socialist trajectory he said 
we are not perfect we have various problems we are the first 
to say we have defects he said 
recent installation of young leaders in high government posts is 
a guarantee that they will continue transforming he said 
without elaboration 
still he maintained that cuba is not contemplating doing away 
with its oneparty system 
we are are going to maintain our unity through one single

the communist party secretary in a sensitive 
minority region said there are many hot spots of unrest in the 
area that could blow up if not resolved quickly according to a 
report seen in beijing today 
song hanliang the top party official in the xinjiang uygur 
autonomous region in chinas far northwest made his remarks after 
touring portions of xinjiang near the border with soviet kazakhstan 
and kirgizia 
every place and every work unit now has some problems with hot 
spots saturdays xinjiang daily quoted song as saying in his 
report feb 23 the newspaper arrives in beijing one week late 
although they are only contradictions among the people if 
they are not paid attention to and resolved they can become the 
fuse of an outburst he said in marxist ideology a 
contradiction among the people is less serious than one between the 
people and an enemy class such as landlords or the bourgeoisie 
we must handle the problem while it is still in the embryonic 
stage he said 
the newspaper did not explain what hot spots or problems 
song was referring to his statement was the clearest indication 
yet that longstanding ethnic tensions in xinjiang have resurfaced 
recently in unrest 
xinjiang is home to several central asian ethnic minorities 
including the uygurs and kirgiz many of whom are devout moslems 
they are closely related to groups living across the border in the 
soviet union which has seen several bloody outbursts of ethnic 
rivalry in recent months soviet kazakhstan and kirgizia just west 
of xinjiang have been quiet 
chinese authorities have refused to comment on the possible 
impact of the soviet unrest on chinas minorities but have markedly 
stepped up public calls for ethnic unity xinjiang officials also 
have held special meetings to discuss the problem and ordered 
police to improve their antiriot training and intelligence work 
among minority groups 
earlier this week police in xinjiang expelled a french 
television reporter and her french translator for allegedly 
conducting interviews without permission reflecting the 
sensitivity of officials in the region to visits by outsiders 
in regard to the possible appearance of disturbances this 
year it is better to overestimate a little and absolutely not 
relax vigilance or be off our guard song said in his feb 23 
remarks to top party and government officials in xinjiang 
he also called for tighter supervision of religion to stop up 
loopholes remove hidden perils and not allow religious activities 
or religious places to be used for separatist activities 
religion is a key element of the traditional cultures of many 
minority groups including the uygurs and nationalist protests in 
the past often have taken on a religious tinge 
during the last confirmed unrest in xinjiang in may young 
moslems stormed government offices to protest a book they said 
slandered islam an alleged leader of the protest was sentenced to 
life in prison and nine other participants to lesser terms

about 1000 moslems wearing death shrouds 
tried to march to srinagar today one day after troops opened fire 
on proindependence rallies in kashmir and killed at least 49 
moslems police said 
a senior police official said that police deployed to enforce a 
curfew blocked the march in sumbal 15 miles north of srinagar 
they were forced to return back said the officer who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
witnesses contacted by telephone said the demonstrators wore the 
shrouds to symbolize their willingness to sacrifice their lives for 
the movement demanding independence for kashmir a moslemdominated 
region of india 
the shrouds are the large swatches of material in which the 
corpses of moslems traditionally are draped before burial only the 
protesters heads were visible through holes cut in the fabric that 
flowed down to their ankles 
the police officer said at least 49 people were killed and 
between 45 and 100 were injured thursday when indian forces fired 
on two separate processions marching toward srinagar demanding 
secession from predominantly hindu india 
in both cases some marchers tried to seize guns from soldiers 
and paramilitary police and the troops opened fire according to 
witnesses who spoke on condition of anonymity an estimated 1 
million people participated in thursdays demonstrations in 
srinagar 
a curfew confining people to their homes was imposed at 4 am 
today in srinagar and other towns in the northern kashmir valley 
the government in neighboring pakistan which is mainly moslem 
and has fought two wars with india over kashmir today condemned 
the killings as wanton shooting by indian security forces 
pakistans official news agency said the shootings were a 
brutal indian response to the people of kashmir who were 
asking only for their right of selfdetermination a right assured 
them by the untied nations 
by this morning the streets of srinagar a city of nearly 1 
million people were deserted except for heavily armed army and 
paramilitary police other witnesses said also speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
the loudspeakers on mosques which often blare islamic and 
proindependence slogans were quiet at midmorning today the 
moslem weekly holy day which is often a flashpoint for trouble 
thursdays shootings brought to at least 162 the number of 
people killed in kashmirs latest bout of secessionist violence 
that began jan 20 following a government crackdown on the 
militants one person died when he fell to his death in a cold lake 
while troops chased protesters the officer said 
also thursday pushker nath handoo an assistant director of the 
jammukashmir state information department was assassinated in 
srinagar handoo a hindu in 1986 was the private secretary to 
jammukashmir gov jagmohan during jagmohans first term as 
governor of the northwestern state 
jagmohan who uses only one name was reappointed governor in 
january 
big proindependence processions have been staged around 
srinagar for the past week with crowd estimates ranging from 
20000 to 400000 but those processions were generally orderly 
and witnesses said the leaders seemed to be trying to keep their 
followers from provoking government troops 
the kashmir issue has been simmering for more than four decades 
following britains 1947 partition of its former colony into india 
and pakistan 
the division left the former princely state of kashmir in 
dispute srinagar and the surrounding kashmir valley became part of 
the indian state of jammukashmir the western slice of kashmir 
came under pakistans control 
the two nations have gone to war three times since partition 
twice over kashmir pakistan has denied indian charges that it is 
inciting the unrest 
the kashmir portion of jammukashmir state is mostly moslem 
while the southern jammu segment is heavily hindu about 65 percent 
of the states 6 million people are moslems who nationwide make up 
only 12 percent of indias population hindus account for 82 
percent of the 880 milion indian citizens

the slide of drexel burnham lambert inc into 
bankruptcy court is not an indication that us securities markets 
are unsound the chairman of the securities and exchange commission 
said today 
drexel was uniquely concentrated among large securities firms 
in highyield securities and that concentration proved to be fatal 
when these securities became unmarketable and unpledgeable 
chairman richard c breeden told a senate hearing 
drexels insolvency should not be taken as an indication that 
us securities markets or other major participants in those 
markets are financially unsound he testified before the senate 
banking housing and urban affairs committee 
breedon noted that drexels 28 billion business has been 
reduced by about 75 percent since its parent company drexel 
burnham lambert group filed for bankruptcy protection and the 
public was not called upon to pay the creditors of drexels 
unregulated operations 
he called for passage of a marketreform act which would give 
federal regulators information on the holding companies of 
securities firms such as drexel which are not now subject to 
government oversight such legislation he said would go a long 
way toward preventing situations similar to drexels 
sen donald w riegle jr chairman of the senate committee 
has said he wants to know what lessons can be learned from drexels 
situation and whether it calls for regulation of the funds flowing 
between a brokerdealer and its parent company 
on thursday federal reserve chairman alan greenspan told 
another congressional committee that wall streets hohum reaction 
to drexels collapse showed regulators were right to let the 
securities firm fail 
our concern was not with the fortunes of a particular firm 
but with the orderly operation of the financial markets 
greenspan said 
drexel once the fifthlargest securities company in the nation 
sought bankruptcy protection in the wake of a sharp drop in the 
value of its highyield highrisk junk bond portfolio and its 
admission of securities law violations in a plea bargain with 
federal prosecutors 
its parent company sought court protection from creditors under 
the federal bankruptcy law on feb 13 after defaulting on 100 
million in shortterm debt it has listed more than 2000 creditors 
and nearly 3 billion in liabilities 
despite drexels once towering position on wall street the 
stock market took its troubles in stride the dow jones average of 
30 industrial stocks fell 2906 points to 262410 on feb 12 the 
day drexel announced its distress it rose 496 points the 
following day when drexels parent filed for bankruptcy 
this market reaction tends to validate the judgment that the 
failure of drexel while a tragedy for the many involved did not 
present undue risks to the orderly functioning of the financial 
system or the economy said greenspan in testimony before the 
house judiciary committees subcommittee on economic and commercial 
law

in a change of policy the government says 
monthly soviet immigration figures must now be submitted to 
israels military censor prior to publication in the media 
the release of such figures in the past has led to mounting arab 
protests over the influx of soviet jews to israel 
the associated press was not allowed to report the new 
restriction when it was imposed thursday but that order was lifted 
today after the daily maariv carried a story on the new censorship 
procedure on its front page 
an announcement from the censors office said today that all 
material pertaining to immigration of soviet jews must be submitted 
to the censor prior to publication the censors are not expected 
to release the data so the screening process is expected to amount 
to a ban previously the media reported the figures without 
checking with the censor first 
robert slater the head of the foreign press association in 
israel said the new procedure was pointless because the 
immigration story has already been reported in great detail we 
are extremely disappointed at the use of military censorship for 
political purposes slater said 
maariv said the move was recommended by senior government 
officials and approved by prime minister yitzhak shamir a shamir 
aide however said it had nothing to do with the prime 
minister 
the newspaper said the government acted after a government 
official estimated this week that up to 230000 soviet jews are 
expected to immigrate this year as opposed to previous estimates 
of 80000 to 100000 
the new estimate was made by yasha kazakov deputy head of the 
liaison bureau a oncesecret government unit that deals with 
soviet immigration israeli media reports said 
maariv said the figure created panic in the arab countries 
and the protests coming from these countries endanger immigration 
shamirs top aide yossi benaharon agreed saying there is so 
much talk of numbers and forecasts that it caused damage why say 
230000 or whatever 
benaharon interviewed thursday night said he was not aware of 
any order to the censor but added i know there is a campaign by 
all the arab world against the immigration so whats the wonder 
the latest immigration surge began last year when 12000 soviet 
jews came to israel in january 1990 4700 soviet jews immigrated 
israeli leaders have said they expect up to 750000 this decade 
the hebrewlanguage daily davar reported today that 5500 soviet 
jews arrived in israel during february 
concern in the arab world arose after shamir suggested that 
israel needed to retain the occupied lands to settle the immigrants 
israel has denied that it would direct the flow of immigrants to 
the occupied lands where some 200 soviet jews settled in 1989 but 
arab leaders view even mass immigration to israel proper as a grave 
threat 
western nations and the united states have strongly opposed any 
plan to settle the soviet immigrants in the occupied lands 
secretary of state james a baker iii said on thursday that 
israels request for us aid for soviet immigrants should be 
linked to a pledge to suspend all jewish settlements in the 
occupied territories 
bassam abusharif a top adviser to plo chief yasser arafat 
told reporters feb 21 in tunis that the movement of immigrants to 
disputed lands was an act of war against the palestinian people 
and the arab nation 
such an act can only cause similar action on our part that is 
to say acts of war abusharif said 
on feb 23 israeli newspapers warned of a possibility that arab 
guerrillas could target immigrants for a retaliatory attack 
the jerusalem post daily quoted a reliable source as saying 
israel had stepped up security for immigrants because of these 
fears

the sister of hostage terry anderson says a 
2week trip on behalf of her brother has left her cautiously 
optimistic something three previous journeys failed to do 
that isnt to say my optimism means theres going to be a 
release today or next week or next month an exhausted peggy say 
said thursday shortly after stepping off a plane from zurich at 
john f kennedy international airport 
i think we all hope this will be resolved soon for all of 
them mrs say said 
she was referring to 18 western hostages missing in lebanon 
eight americans four britons two west germans two swiss an 
irishman and an italian

press is the longest held of the hostages he was kidnapped in 
beirut on march 16 1985 
since then mrs say has traveled four times to the middle east 
and worked relentlessly on behalf of the hostages 
but she said this trip which included meetings with un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar pope john paul ii and 
palestine liberation organization leader yasser arafat was the 
first to leave her hopeful 
she traveled with a delegation from the ap to the middle east 
europe and africa 
she has said her optimism stems partly from reassurances by us 
officials that they are doing all they can and partly from 
statements from iran recent changes in nations around the globe 
and pledges that the syrians want to help 
the syrian commitment is 100 percent she said 
nbc news on thursday quoted a senior administration official it 
did not identify saying that syrias foreign minister will travel 
to iran in a few days to press for the hostages release

called ridiculous news reports saying there was movement in the 
hostage situation 
i hope the hostages will be released if i see an opportunity 
for talks in private or in public about this to get them released 
ill do it he said as he left his hotel to visit a new los 
angeles county jail 
as to how she believed us officials were working toward a 
solution mrs say said i assume theyre talking as they always 
have done through third parties 
she added i was reassured that my government is doing what it 
should be doing in a positive way to bring this to an end 
she said she was confident that when the hostages are released 
it will be without conditions there will be no ransom

deputy director of world services for the ap which supports her 
efforts financially and logistically while pressing its own efforts

7596 new cases of aids were reported last month raising the total 
by 35 percent to 222740 cases listed worldwide since registration 
began in 1979 
the united states continued to account for more than half of the 
global figure with the number of cases up 33 percent in one month 
from 117781 to 121645 
zimbabwe updating a 3monthold report listed one of the 
sharpest upward trends with a new total of 1632 a 42 percent 
increase australia reported its number went up 73 percent in one 
month to 1707 while canada listed a 69 percent increase to 3509

in europe france reported a total of 8883 cases 10 percent 
more since the end of september during the same period the number

nasas plan to establish a base on the moon 
and launch expeditions to mars appears reasonable but other 
strategies should also be studied the national research council 
said today 
president bush endorsed the basic elements of the plan in a 
speech last july 20 marking the 20th anniversary of the landing on 
the moon of american astronauts neil armstrong and buzz aldrin 
the proposal called for a base to be established early in the 
next century that would have a fulltime longterm staff 
the national aeronautics and space administrations strategy 
calls for frequent flights to the moon and construction there of 
living quarters laboratories and power stations the lunar soil 
would be mined to extract oxygen which then could be turned into 
rocket fuel 
bush outlined no details in his proposal and said he was leaving 
it up to nasa and to vice president dan quayle as head of the 
national space council to come up with timetables 
putting a space station in orbit has already been scheduled for 
after 1995 
nasa scientists say a moon base would be a laboratory for a 
voyage to mars bu others have questioned this saying the moon is 
not sufficiently like mars and that establishing the moon base 
would delay the mars exploration 
the national research council an arm of the congressional 
chartered national academy of sciences was asked by quayle to 
evaluate nasas strategy for the mars exploration 
david beckwith the vice presidents press secretary said 
its a very interesting report and we are pleased and grateful 
the nasa report addresses a reasonable set of technological 
and strategic approaches but not all of the technically credible 
approaches have been analyzed the council said 
it said any program for exploring the moon and mars must 
incorporate ideas from a variety of concepts some that now exist 
and others that will arise in the future 
certainly more intense scrutiny and evaluation of the options 
must take place before decisions are made regarding mission 
architecture said h guyford stever who chaired a 14member 
committee named by the council to perform the study 
this is an initial discussion to offer direction for helping 
the program get under way said stever a former presidential 
science adviser 
the committee said that although nasa does not discuss eventual 
phaseout of the space shuttle in its report on its 90day study of 
moonmars exploration the shuttle fleet will have to be replaced 
continued access of humans to space will require that planning 
begin soon for a new transportation system that will first 
supplement and then assume the shuttles role sometime between 
2000 and 2010 the committee said 
the panel disagreed with the contention of scientists at the 
lawrence livermore national laboratory that humans could be placed 
on mars by the year 2000 it said that underestimates the many 
practical and difficult engineering and operational challenges 
involved 
the nasa plan calls for placing humans on the moon in 2001 and 
on mars by 2011 at the earliest 
the research council study said even those dates depend on 
accelerating completion of the planned space station which could 
result in higher risks and costs 
in addition to replacing the space shuttle a new generation of 
launch vehicles will be needed to lift massive equipment into 
lowerearth orbit the committee said

american held in solitary confinement in a hospital room for the 
past five weeks should be allowed to meet friends and attorneys of 
her choice news reports said 
patricia munday 39 is being treated under police guard at a 
calcutta hospital for injuries sustained when she was attacked by 
villagers in purulia near calcutta 
ms munday who was part of a united nations team that won the 
1981 nobel peace prize is being held for links with a mysterious 
hindu cult called the ananda marg or the path of bliss which is 
based in the purulia district 
membership in the cult is not a criminal offense but police are 
deeply suspicious of the order claiming it practices black magic 
ms munday has not been charged 
the supreme court order said ms munday who is from waitsfield 
vt could see friends and attorneys but a policeman would be 
present during the meetings according to the press trust of india 
arguments on the legality of her detention have been set for 
march 16 
in calcutta a prominent politican who unsuccessfully attempted 
to visit ms munday on thursday called her detention inhuman and 
uncivilized 
mamta banerjee a member of the opposition congress party said 
west bengal state officials cried themselves hoarse for nelson 
mandela but what are they doing to this helpless foreign lady she 
will go mad in this condition 
miss banerjee who said she visited the belle vue nursing home 
in an attempt to meet ms munday said she saw the american woman 
briefly before police pushed miss banerjee away from the door of 
the hospital room 
i raised my voice and told her that i would like to offer any 
help that she might need miss banerjee said she thanked me 
west bengal state of which calcutta is the capital is ruled by 
the communist party of indiamarxist which in the past has often 
clashed with followers of ananda marg 
ms munday who was a member of the united nations high 
commissioner for refugees team that won the nobel peace prize for 
its work in somalia arrived in india from nepal on a private visit 
villagers attacked her and a female companion when they were 
traveling in the purulia district on jan 26 ms munday suffered a 
gash on her forehead and was arrested when she tried to lodge a 
complaint about the attack 
ananda marg is a secretive cult which claims to have branches 
around the world little information about the groups activities 
is available because members are bound by an oath of secrecy 
indian newspapers have said the group uses skulls and daggers in 
its ritualistic dances 
the group says it wants to create a social economic and 
spiritual order that will replace both capitalism and communism and 
rid society of sectarianism and parochialism

thursday such canvas tents are fire hazards and the sheraton put it 
up without consulting the fire department

former us sen lowell p weicker a 
crusading liberal republican who said he was out of politics for 
good when he lost his 1988 bid for a fourth term announced today 
he will run for governor as an independent 
weicker announced his plans to reporters at a packed news 
conference at the state capitol ending months of speculation about 
a political comeback 
both political parties in washington and in connecticut 
dont want to handle the tough answers and the tough problems 
because they are afraid of the heat im willing to go ahead 
and take that kind of heat weicker said 
sixteen months ago when he conceded defeat to state attorney 
general joseph lieberman weicker appeared to rule out any return 
to politics 
the narrow loss to lieberman was weickers only electoral defeat 
in a 26year career during which he constantly flirted with 
disaster by antagonizing republican leaders 
in 1988 you all took me down a peg or two and probably 
deservedly so weicker said today 
his decision to seek the governors job had been a wellkept 
secret only his family and a handful of friends were told 
weicker apparently made no courtesy calls to top republicans 
including connecticuts three gop congressmen to tell them of his 
plans one of those congressmen is john g rowland the perceived 
frontrunner for the gop gubernatorial nomination 
republican leaders had said it would be a mistake for weicker to 
jump in either as a republican or an independent because weicker 
has no clear base of support since he lost in 1988 he always 
enjoyed strong support from democrats and unaffiliated voters and 
was the only republican to win statewide office since 1970 
democrats had been hoping weicker would run since he could 
split the gop and threaten what many view as the republicans best 
shot in 20 years at winning the governors chair 
during his 18 years in the senate weicker was constantly at 
odds with his party starting with his opposition to president 
nixon during the watergate scandal 
democratic gov william a oneill who plans to seek a third 
term said thursday that a weicker candidacy would make it a very 
spirited contest 
since his 1988 defeat weicker has headed a group promoting 
medical research called research america based outside washington 
besides rowland three republicans are seeking the gop 
nomination state senate minority leader reginald smith of new 
hartford new haven developer joel schiavone and fairfield banker

an elderly white couple 
received a rousing welcome today when they became the first exiled 
members of the african national congress to return to south africa 
down with white supremacy up with peoples power shouted 
jack simon 83 upon his arrival at jans smuts airport in 
johannesburg 
simon a university professor and his 76yearold wife rachel 
alexander a trade union organizer previously were banned in south 
africa and fled the country in 1965 for the ancs exile 
headquarters in lusaka zambia 
several hundred activists black and white cheered the couple 
at the airport and sang god bless africa the anthem of the 
antiapartheid movement 
this is a great and joyous occasion after 25 years of exile 
mrs alexander said we must see to it the breakthrough in south 
africa is widened and our people take over power in a peaceful and 
orderly manner 
president fw de klerk last month legalized the anc and more 
than 60 other opposition groups the anc the largest group 
fighting the whiteled government had been banned since 1960 
the anc has an estimated 15000 members in exile and they are 
expected to begin returning in large numbers shortly the anc also 
announced today that it will move its headquarters to johannesburg 
the government has said that ordinary members of previously 
outlawed groups are free to return however the government has not 
clarified the position of exiles suspected of involvement in 
guerrilla attacks 
some members of the other recently legalized groups such as the 
pan africanist congress already have begun to return to south 
africa 
we decided in 1965 to emigrate to lusaka the closest 
independent base from which to work for the liberation of south 
africa simon and mrs alexander said in a joint statement we 
return home to continue the struggle for liberation 
in another development about 1000 people peacefully marched on 
parliament in cape town today to express support for some 350 
prisoners on a 5dayold hunger strike 
friends and family members of the hunger strikers have marched 
in cape town every day this week and dozens have been arrested 
although there were no incidents today 
the inmates at the robben island prison off cape town stopped 
eating monday saying they consider themselves political prisoners 
and should be released under reforms initiated last month by de 
klerk 
de klerk said people imprisoned simply for belonging to those 
organizations that he legalized would be freed several have been 
released and dozens more are expected to be let go 
however the government so far has refused to free people 
convicted of violent acts

the head of the military tribunal that 
condemned communist dictator nicolae ceausescu and his wife to 
death has committed suicide officials said today 
maj gen gica popa shot himself in the head thursday at his 
office in the ministry of justice justice minister teofil pop told 
a news conference 
popa was rushed to the bucharest military hospital where he 
died two hours later with his wife and daughter by his side pop 
said the military officer left a suicide note that asked for 
forgiveness but did not explain the motive for his act 
pop said the suicide was the result of a very grave 
depression and said it is possible that it was related to the 
ceausescu trial 
a source close to the family however said that popa had been 
troubled by anonymous death threats apparently from ceausescu 
loyalists for the past two months 
pop said that he had recently asked popa if he had been 
threatened after the trial and the majorgeneral said no 
the justice minister also confirmed that popas voice was the 
one heard on the videorecording of the dec 25 trial of ceausescu 
and his wife elena which was broadcast repeatedly on romanian and 
international television 
the angry voice was heard interrogating the pair and then 
announcing that they had been sentenced to death for crimes against 
the romanian people the couple was then executed 
the identity of the person was not made public earlier to 
protect the judges while there were still terrorists around pop 
said he used the word terrorists to refer to members of 
ceausescus secret police force who fought revolutionary forces 
for about a week after the dictator was toppled dec 22 
pop said popa who was the head of the military territorial 
tribunal had extraordinary prestige and was one of our best 
judges 
the prosecutorgenerals office and police were investigating

the african national congress today named 
nelson mandela as its deputy president and welcomed him and two 
others to leadership positions they held when they were arrested in 
south africa in the 1960s 
mandela released feb 11 after 27 years in prison becomes the 
no 2 official in the anc behind president oliver tambo who is 
recuperating from a stroke in a swedish clinic the post of deputy 
president is a new position 
mandela effectively becomes the ancs top leader because the 
ailing tambo is widely believed to be unable to resume an active 
political life as the anc sets about establishing a political 
framework in south africa 
the anc the main black group fighting south africas whiteled 
government also reaffirmed its intention to meet soon with south 
african president fw de klerk and said it would soon open 
headquarters offices in johannesburg 
while the anc was outlawed in south africa its political and 
guerrilla leaders operated their headquarters from zambia de klerk 
lifted the 30year ban on the anc on feb 2 
mandela and fellow longtime political detainees walter sisulu 
and govan mbeki resumed seats they held on the national executive 
committee when they were arrested more than two decades ago said 
an anc statement read at a news conference by acting president and 
meeting chairman alfred nzo 
sisulu 77 and mbeki 79 were sentenced to life in prison 
along with mandela in 1964 mbeki was released in 1987 and sisulu 
was freed in october the committee is the ancs main policymaking 
group 
mandela gave few details on his new role in the anc 
i am prepared to serve in any role the national executive 
instructs me to fill he said 
mandela will visit neighboring zimbabwe on sunday and then 
move swiftly to see tambo in sweden nzo said 
mandela is known to have invitations to visit several other 
countries but anc officials indicated the organization will be 
selective about accepting foreign trips and future engagements for 
him out of concerns for his health 
the 71yearold black nationalist treated in prison for 
tuberculosis two years ago receives a daily checkup from a 
physician said a senior anc official who asked not to be 
identified 
for someone who has been isolated in prison for so long its 
incredible he hasnt stopped we all want to be sure he isnt 
overworking the official said 
we have just got him back from prison the last thing he 
should see now is hospital walls the official added 
mandela told reporters he was optimistic about a political 
settlement but said he was unwilling to predict any time frame for 
negotiations or the return of exiles 
we are already making progress there is no reason why we 
should not be able to make further progress he said i am 
optimistic that the process of removing all obstacles to 
negotiations is on i will be surprised if we dont succeed in 
removing the obostacles 
the anc reiterated that it will not enter formal negotiations 
with the south african government until it lifts the state of 
emergency and releases all political prisoners 
de klerk has said he plans to lift the 3yearold state of 
emergency and will free prisoners convicted of belonging to 
previously outlawed organizations that he legalized last month 
however the government has said it will not free people convicted 
of violent acts

a draft proposal to spend 65 billion on two 
of the nations biggest health care problems is running into 
behindthescenes white house opposition even before it comes up 
for a vote 
the us bipartisan commission on comprehensive health care 
planned to vote today on a proposal to provide health insurance to 
more than 31 million uninsured americans and help 9 million 
americans pay the high cost of longterm care 
the commissions closed meeting stretched past three hours this 
morning and continued into early afternoon several sources said 
thursday that approval was not guaranteed noting that the white 
house had been pressuring republicans on the 15member commission 
to withhold their support 
rep fortney pete stark a california democrat who is a 
member of the commission predicted its recommendations to congress 
would be a dead letter because of opposition from the white 
house 
the postmaster in this case is president bush and they 
dont want a plan which would embarrass them in the next 
election stark said 
the commissions draft plan would require all businesses with 
more than 100 employees to provide private health insurance to 
their workers or to contribute to a public plan for employees and 
nonworking dependents 
when fully implemented all americans would be provided health 
insurance through their employer or the public plan 
it also would offer all americans coverage for longterm care in 
their homes and for the first three months in a nursing home 
federal benefits for additional time spent in a nursing home would 
be greatly improved 
the draft plan did not recommend how to pay for the benefits 
saying the commission is committed to raising whatever additional 
revenues are necessary 
the commission including 12 members of congress and three 
white house appointees was created by congress in 1988 to tackle 
the thorny questions of how to ensure quality affordable care for 
the uninsured and for those devastated by the high costs of 
longterm care 
the panel is commonly known as the pepper commission in honor of 
its first chairman the late rep claude pepper dfla an 
outspoken advocate for the elderly and disadvantaged 
stark criticized the draft plan saying it would not guarantee 
health coverage for all americans particularly those employed by 
small businesses he noted it provided extended nursing home 
protection only to those of limited income and assets and 
complained that it failed to recommend how to pay for the 65 
billion program 
but two advocacy groups for the elderly said the proposed plan 
recommended important improvements in the nations health care 
system 
john rother legislative director for the american association 
of retired persons called it a promising start 
were pleased to see that the plan is for all americans 
regardless of age and that it addresses both the needs of those 
without health insurance coverage at the same time it addresses the 
longterm care problem rother said 
ronald pollack executive director of the families usa 
foundation a nonprofit advocacy group for the elderly said the 
plan meets the crucial goals of healthcare reform protection 
from the devastation of longterm care costs at home or in a 
nursing home as well as affordable health care for all americans 
regardless of income or job status 
stark proposed an alternative plan that would require more 
comprehensive insurance coverage and nursing home benefits to be 
paid for by broad new taxes on personal and corporate income 
he conceded that with a 120 billionayear price tag his plan 
is apt not to be very popular however he said an agreement on 
how to meet the nations health care needs will come only after 
people recognize the extent of the problem and the costs for a 
complete solution

neptune the roman god that stirred 
up storms to sink mariners who ventured to sea has caused a storm 
of another sort at a condominium complex 
three weeks ago the island club condo association spent 1300 
for a 1400pound 6foot10 concrete statue of neptune for the 
entrance of the building 
neptune is nude except for a strategically located fish tail 
trouble is some residents are complaining that even the fish tail 
is too graphic 
the condo board decided to let residents vote on the issue but 
for now a mesh fishnet covers the problematic parts 
linley ray owner of paramount concrete the pompano beach 
company that sold neptune to the condo is aware of the controversy 
ms ray said one woman who lives at the complex swore at her as 
she was painting the creamcolored neptune 
theres nothing obscene about it ms ray said its a 
classic standard neptune statue his behind is semiexposed but on 
the front its really a fish tail and its very obvious it was put 
there to hide everything 
gary berletic president of one of the condos association said 
he doesnt find neptune offensive because the fish tail hides all 
its not really lewd he said i think it looks nice

the voice of america responding to pressure 
from its managers and listeners has decided to save six language 
services slated for elimination by budget cuts 
voa director richard carlson informed employees on friday that 
the lao greek turkish swahili slovene and uzbek language 
programs would remain on the air and their 57 broadcasters and 
producers would keep their jobs 
the announcement came just one month after carlson informed 
employees the services would go off the air april 1 to save the 
governments radio network 3 million 
we will be given the money to keep the services on the air 
carlson said but it was unclear where the money would come from 
bruce gelb the director of the us information agency which 
oversees voa wants the money taken out of the construction account 
used to build transmitters and upgrade technical services 
but congress which must approve such a transfer of money is 
opposed carlson said 
he said gelb had assured him that if congress rejects the move 
money would be found elsewhere in usias budget 
carlsons announcement that the six services would be eliminated 
triggered a clash with gelb who reportedly claimed he knew nothing 
about the plan even though he had signed the cuts proposal 
the controversy resulted in both men who are presidential 
appointees holding talks with white house officials and being 
urged to bury their differences 
greekamericans and other supporters of voa have been lobbying 
congress to prevent the cuts

despite the failure of 
communist regimes around the world the south african communist 
party remains an influential and popular force that has not given 
up its goal of a socialist state 
while its actual membership is tiny many blacks respect the 
south african communist party because of its prominent role in 
opposing the countrys whiteminority government red communist 
flags and slogans are common in black townships and at 
antigovernment demonstrations 
nelson mandela the african national congress leader released 
feb 11 after 27 years in prison hailed the party in his first 
speech on the day he left prison 
i salute the south african communist party for its sterling 
contribution to the struggle for democracy we are heartened by 
the fact that the alliance between ourselves and the party remains 
as strong as it always was he said 
the partys call for a socialist state and a redistribution of 
wealth also appeals to many poor blacks who see the whitedominated 
capitalist economy as a pillar of apartheid communists claim that 
whites who make up less than 15 percent of the population control 
98 percent of south africans wealth 
joe slovo the white secretarygeneral of the party says the 
biggest question facing south africa beyond ending whiteminority 
rule is how to handle the economy 
the fundamental aim of economic policy must be the 
redistribution of wealth he said in a recent statement 
president fw de klerk legalized the communist party and other 
antigovernment groups feb 2 to help start talks on ending 
whiteminority rule and sharing political power with the black 
majority the party founded in 1921 was banned in 1950 but 
operates underground in south africa with headquarters in zambia 
for years the south african government vehemently denounced the 
party portraying its members as soviet agents plotting to build a 
marxist slave state government officials routinely claimed that 
black nationalist groups were communist fronts 
little is known about the highly secretive party estimates of 
its strength range from a few hundred members to a few thousand 
members with the communists refusing to give any detailed 
information on the party 
the secrecy makes it difficult to assess the partys strength or 
evaluate what role it may play in south africas future it appears 
to have considerable influence within some black political and 
labor groups 
the main source of strength is its close ties to the african 
national congress the main antiapartheid black force and the 
group most likely to form a future government after the end of 
white rule senior communist party officials also hold important 
anc posts and play key roles in its affairs 
while the communists have few members in south africa the party 
reportedly has been able to recruit many black political leaders 
and intellectuals at least half the members on the ancs ruling 
national executive council are party members or sympathizers 
according to independent south african press reports 
the communist partys strategic position within the anc its 
commitment to socialism and the tendency of township radicals to 
link capitalism with racism means it will not necessarily be 
confined to a minor role in the dramatic years ahead the star 
newspaper of johannesburg said recently 
the party also served as the link between the anc and the soviet 
union and as a conduit for soviet aid but that role has diminished 
following a decline in soviet aid because of moscows internal 
political problems 
the anc denies it is marxist saying it works with any group 
that fights apartheid but anc economic programs lean toward 
socialism and it favors some degree of economic nationalization to 
redistribute wealth 
critics contend slovo and the communists remain hardline 
marxists who have simply adopted new language to conceal their true 
intentions white rightwing groups contend any black government 
will be taken over by communists 
slovo a former head of the ancs military wing says the 
communists will launch a recruiting drive in south africa to build 
up their strength he says the party also will send a delegation 
for independent talks with the government on the future of south 
africa 
slovo has tried to moderate the partys position following the 
collapse of eastern europes communist regimes he has stressed the 
need for democracy and pledged to seek a socialist state through 
peaceful means 
we also believe that if there is real democracy in the 
postapartheid state the way would be open for a peaceful 
progression towards our partys ultimate objective a socialist 
south africa this approach is consistent with the marxist view 
that the working class must win the majority to its side he said 
recently 
but slovo still talks in traditional marxist terms of the state 
serving the working class and people abandoning the pursuit of 
personal gain and working for the common good 
for our part we firmly believe in the future of socialism nor 
do we dismiss its whole past as an unmitigated failure he said 
communists and other activists shrug off questions about the 
failure of communism elsewhere saying they wont repeat the 
mistakes of others 
the socialist countries have only been in existence for less 
than a century they have overcome serious problems and will do so 
in the future said ahmed kathrada an anc leader

misuse of various government programs 
in a statement the special division of the us circuit court 
of appeals here said that adams brings to this investigation the 
judgment experience and ability acquired by many years of service 
as a federal circuit judge as a private practitioner and as a 
recognized leader of the courts and the bar of the nation 
under the jurisdiction set by the court adams is empowered to 
determine whether pierce and other department officials may have 
committed the crime of conspiracy to defraud the united states or 
any other federal crimes relating to the administration of the 
selection process of the departments moderate rehabilitation 
program from 1984 through 1988 
the special courts order also empowers adams to investigate any 
allegations of perjury obstruction of justice and destruction of 
evidence and intimidation of witnesses during the course of the 
investigation 
under the moderate rehabilitation program developers receive 
tax credits and rent subsidies for performing a moderate amount of 
rehabilitation on housing for lowincome citizens 
in his feb 1 application to the court for appointment of an 
independent counsel thornburgh cited reports of a widespread 
perception among developers and municipal officials that funds 
were being disbursed in disproportionate amounts to projects backed 
by prominent republicans acting as consultants or by former hud 
officials 
the justice departments preliminary inquiry included a review 
of voluminous reports compiled by huds inspector general as well 
as testimony before a house government operations subcommittee that 
held hearings on the agency last year 
the original request for an independent counsel was made by 
democratic members of the house judiciary committee they cited 
allegations of political favoritism as well as charges that pierce 
had lied under oath during congressional testimony last spring 
thornburgh found there was no basis for further allegations that 
pierce lied under oath 
pierce refused to answer further questions when called back 
twice to give additional testiony before the subcommittee he 
invoked his fifth amendment privilege against selfincrimination 
under the special prosecutor law the threejudge panel chaired 
by senior circuit judge george mackinnon is required to appoint an 
independent counsel after receiving a request to do so from the 
attorney general

the governments main economic forecasting 
gauge was unchanged in january the commerce department said friday 
in a report that analysts said points to an aimless economy with 
little growth but little chance of a recession either 
economist kevin logan of the swiss bank corp in new york said 
the index of leading economic indicators means the economy is 
moving sideways there is not a lot of strength but neither is 
there pervasive weakness 
januarys report shows that the economy has no clear 
direction said william k macreynolds forecasting director for 
the us chamber of commerce 
i would regard the leading indicators for january as 
suggesting that we continue to be in a period where were not 
likely to tip into recession but where growth will continue at a 
sluggish pace added richard peach an economist for the mortgage 
bankers association 
the index designed to forecast economic activity six to nine 
months in advance followed two months of increases however the 
december figure paled somewhat in the latest report being revised 
downward from an 08 percent gain to 06 percent because of lower 
orders for consumer goods 
the index rose a weak 01 percent in november after falling 04 
percent in october the flat january report means the index 
remained at 1453 percent of its 1982 base of 100 
economists had been expecting a moderate increase 
in another bit of bad news the commerce department also 
reported friday that sales of new homes plummeted 71 percent in 
january to the lowest level in nearly a year 
both the housing and the manufacturing industries have borne the 
brunt of federal reserve efforts to contain inflation by keeping 
interest rates high and thereby slowing the economy 
the leading indicators index is heavily weighted toward 
measuring manufacturing health the service economy such as health 
care and education generally are regarded as healthy 
three of the 11 forwardlooking statistics provided positive 
contributions to the index including a big increase in building 
permits 
but peach the mortgage bankers economist said the 
transitory gain in permits was concentrated in the multifamily 
sector it was expected he explained because of extremely mild 
weather and because of the rush by many builders to beat a deadline 
for expensive new building standards 
the standards required by 1989 fair housing legislation are 
designed to make apartment buildings more accessible to the 
handicapped 
also showing strength were slower business delivery times since 
that indicates strong demand for products and an increase in the 
backlog of manufacturers unfilled orders 
however a decline in orders for consumer goods led the 
statistics providing a drag on the index 
other negatives were a drop in the money supply a decline in 
plant and equipment orders lower stock prices a decrease in the 
price of raw materials a drop in an index measuring consumer 
confidence and an increase in weekly unemployment claims 
one indicator the length of the average work week was 
unchanged

a senior un official friday appealed for more 
relief funds for wartorn afghanistan and urged communist 
authorities and moslem rebels to set up noncombat zones to 
encourage refugees to return home 
sadruddin aga khan coordinator of the un economic and 
humanitarian assistance program for afghanistan said 88 million 
in cash contributions was still needed to meet this years planned 
aid target of 650 million 
he said that without additional cash contributions the united 
nations would find it difficult to make effective use of the 
material and food aid donated to afghanistan 
he said the funds were also needed to continue a program that 
already has trained 20000 afghans to detect and remove the vast 
number of unexploded antipersonnel mines that were planted during 
the countrys long conflict 
noncash assistance accounts for about 70 percent of the 
international contributions to the un program known as operation 
salam he said 
sadruddin said operation salams 1990 program would concentrate 
on agriculture food and health assistance as well as mine 
clearance 
he appealed to kabuls ruling communist government and the 
moslem rebels to reach agreement on the formal establishment of 
noncombat zones which could absorb some of the estimated 5 million 
afghan refugees who fled their country after the soviet invasion in 
1979 
sadruddin said he would discuss un plans to designate a number 
of areas as socalled zones of tranquility when he visits 
afghanistan this month 
in order to qualify as such a zone an area must be peaceful and 
local authorities must accept a un presence he said 
the un high commissioner for refugees thorvald stoltenberg 
is also due to travel to kabul with sadruddin 
despite last years soviet military withdrawal from afghanistan 
and the subsequent reduction in hostilities only about 100000 
refugees are believed to have returned home sadruddin said 
some 3 million afghans are estimated to remain in refugee camps 
in pakistan and another 2 million in iran they account for about 
40 percent of the worldwide total of refugees according to un 
figures 
the refugees have spent their 11th winter in exile we dont 
want to see them spending another year away from their country 
sadruddin said 
i am reasonably confident that with the necessary contribution 
from the international community the number of returnees this 
year could be quite substantial he added 
but he warned of a continuing exodus of afghans into iran to 
escape chronic food shortages in northern provinces where last 
years harvest was ravaged by insects and disease 
he said that despite efforts to assist the stricken areas the 
situation in the north could worsen without extra international 
funds

about 50 south american 
indians who converted to judaism celebrated their first sabbath in 
this west bank settlement friday after immigrating from peru 
the tribes move to the occupied lands comes at a time of 
growing us pressure on israel to stop building or expanding 
jewish settlements in the west bank and gaza strip and demands 
that israel not settle soviet jews in those areas 
the indians who call themselves the sons of moses became 
interested in judaism 40 years ago while living near the town of 
cajamarca in northern peru said israeli rabbi eliahu aviahil 
two tribal elders began studying the old testament at the time 
and about 20 years later the whole tribe abandoned christianity and 
began living a jewish lifestyle the rabbi said on israel radio 
aviahil said he learned of the indians three years ago and 
initiated their formal conversion and immigration 
the tribes men underwent ritual circumcision before everyone in 
the group was converted six months ago by a special rabbinical 
court according to orthodox jewish law 
aviahil heads amishav a society that researches judaisms 10 
lost tribes which according to legend disappeared after the exile 
of the jews to babylonia in 722 bc the israeli newspaper hadashot 
quoted the rabbi as saying the peruvians were descendants of one of 
the lost tribes but did not elaborate 
the indians arrived in israel late wednesday night and were 
greeted by elon moreh settlers who drove them in a convoy of trucks 
thursday to their new home the daily maariv reported 
elon moreh home to some 500 observant jewish settlers is 
located on a windswept and rocky mountaintop four miles from 
nablus the west banks largest city and a hotbed of antiisraeli 
violence elon moreh is reputed to be the site where the biblical 
patriarch abraham first entered canaan 
aviahil said the new immigrants asked to settle in elon moreh 
because if its religious atmosphere they asked and they are 
happy to live in a religious settlement like elon moreh the 
rabbi said 
the settlers turned away journalists friday saying they wanted 
to give the new immigrants some privacy before allowing interviews 
elon moreh settlers meanwhile were preparing for the jewish 
sabbath which begins at sundown friday with the lighting of candles 
and a special blessing said before the evening meal 
settler shoshi ilan who is in charge of the new immigrants 
told the associated press the tribe consisted of about 15 families 
and they would live in houses that have been vacant for some time 
we worked very hard to get them here and dont want anyone to 
bother them mrs ilan said she said some of the indians spoke 
hebrew and that all would take language classes in the settlement 
another settler who would not give his name said the new 
arrivals are not indians but jews in every way 
aviahil said the peruvians were aware of the palestinian 
uprising that has been raging in the occupied lands since december 
1987 they are ready for it he said they want to fulfill 
the commandment of living in the land of israel eretz israel 
the rabbi said the hebrew phrase eretz israel is a reference 
to the biblical land of israel that also includes the west bank 
two elon moreh children have been killed since 1987 including 
15yearold tirza porat who was inadvertently shot by a jewish 
settler guard firing wildly during a confrontation with palestinian 
villagers in the second case 8yearold rami chaban was found 
slain near elon moreh and settlers blamed palestinians 
aviahil meanwhile said the peruvian indians were not a unique 
case and that other communities around the world were adopting a 
jewish way of life 
there is an interesting phenomena today in latin america where 
many christians leave their religion and turn to the old testament 
and some of them become jews he said judaism today is a 
magnet for people seeking the truth

the navys inquiry into the uss iowa disaster 
failed to prove its contention that gunners mate clayton hartwig 
probably set off the explosion that killed himself and 46 other 
crewmen a congressional panel said today 
by the standards of this subcommittee and the standards that 
we think should have been applied in the navys investigation 
there is only a hypothesis and a tenuous one at that said the 
report by the house armed services investigations subcommittee 
the navy in its report on the blast concluded that hartwig 
most likely caused the explosion by inserting some type of 
detonator between bags of gunpowder in one of the ships 16inch 
guns 
navy officials did acknowledge that their evidence was 
circumstantial in light of the fact that all the witnesses 
including hartwig were killed in the blast in the battleships gun 
turret no 2 
navy spokesman cmdr mark baker asked about the panels 
criticism responded we stand by our original report 
the panel found fault with four aspects of the navys 
investigation into the april 19 1989 explosion as the battleship 
sailed near puerto rico 
rep nicholas mavroules dmass the subcommittee chairman 
said the flaws were the structure of the probe the technical 
tests police work and psychological analysis 
first the navy convened a oneman investigation without the 
use of formal hearings mavroules said in a statement 
accompanying the report if the navy had convened a board of 
several members operating through formal hearings the theories and 
hypotheses that evolved would have faced more rigorous questioning 
instead there was an excess of certitude he said 
on the technical inquiry mavroules said that when navy 
investigators were told that hartwig owned a timing device the 
tests proved that a timer was used to trigger the blast 
later he said when the timer information proved to be false 
the technical tests suddenly found a chemical detonator to be the 
logical igniter 
mavroules also criticized fbi psychologists who took part in the 
investigation calling their analysis the real villain of this 
case 
last december three fbi psychologists testified that hartwig 
based on his letters interviews with the seamans family and 
friends and his personal history was egocentric shy not 
sufficiently aggressive had a low selfesteem 
the psychologists cited various bits of information that when 
pieced together according to their assessment form a picture of 
an individual bent on selfdestruction 
mavroules said the fbi analysis was used as a substitute for a 
thorough investigation 
rep les aspin dwis chairman of the full armed services 
committee said the navy probe leaves us with something of a bad 
taste in our mouths 
we are concluding that the navy hasnt definitely found the 
culprit but we havent found the culprit ourselves aspin said 
yet i dont think reopening the original investigation will get 
us anywhere

official efforts to mend uschina relations 
appear to have stalled but recent days have seen a surge in 
peopletopeople exchanges despite the stillintense political war 
of words 
the same week that saw daily chinese expressions of outrage over 
a critical us state department human rights report also saw the 
arrival of more unofficial american delegations at one time than 
any other week since june 
that was when the chinese army opened fire on crowds protesting 
in beijing for democratic reform killing hundreds and possibly 
thousands hundreds of bilateral programs for exchanging students 
scholars artists and scientists ground to a halt 
this week it was almost like old times 
first a team of 17 americans arrived to climb mount everest 
the worlds highest peak together with chinese and soviet 
mountaineers 
then a dozen delegates from five states arrived to explore 
trade and investment opportunities 
a dozen more came with the national committee for uschina 
relations for three days of talks with chinese scholars and 
policymakers on topics from the global environment to bilateral 
ties to the problem of chinese students staying in the united 
states 
the biggest group of all nearly two dozen people from 
washington state reached agreement to hold a huge economic and 
trade seminar in seattle in october complete with a chinese food 
fair a business exhibit and chinese acrobats 
the organizer norman swanson of people to peoples citizen 
ambassador program said as many as 500 chinese might attend 
making it their largest delegation ever to the united states in the 
11 years since relations were normalized 
the week ended with us industrialist armand hammer chairman 
of occidental petroleum appearing on chinese tv with president 
yang shangkun to express his willingness to invest more money in 
china occidental already has invested 200 million in a chinese 
coal mine 
david lampton president of the national committee on 
uschinese relations said individual us scholars also are 
coming back for short periods to renew contacts and research 
projects 
there are whole areas of exchange that we probably wont 
engage in at the moment lampton said i dont want this to be 
construed as business as usual 
but he said groups such as the committee which sponsors a range 
of scholarly and other nonofficial exchanges oppose shutting down 
contacts during times of political strife 
he said the committees symposium with the chinese peoples 
institute of foreign affairs was the fourth in a periodic series of 
such meetings planned to build close personal relations so that 
when times get bad there will be a fabric of relations 
although the us report critical of human rights abuses in 
china prompted an angry chinese response china made no move to 
halt any of these or other planned unofficial exchanges as it did 
several times in the early 1980s when governmental relations 
deteriorated 
nor by weeks end had china tightened surveillance around us 
embassy compounds or otherwise put pressure on american diplomats 
as it did in the months after june the downward spiral in 
government relations may coast to a halt lampton said but there 
are no prospects for improvement either 
both sets of leaders think that any further compromise is 
going to be very costly in terms of their domestic position he 
said stressing that he did not speak for the committee 
the united states sent national security adviser brent 
scowcroft resumed government trade credits and approved airplane 
and satellite sales china lifted martial law released a small 
portion of arrested protesters and agreed to resume fulbright 
scholarly exchanges 
each believes that the other must take the next step 
lampton said but he said he found no evidence that any significant 
faction of chinese leaders want to reduce or cut bilateral ties 
i see a deadlock of indefinite length he said

joseph hazelwood got the flu today 
stopping his trial at a point where the defense was trying to 
puncture an expert witness claim the exxon valdez skipper 
recklessly tried to refloat his grounded tanker 
it seems were missing the star player captain hazelwood has 
the flu attorney dick madson told superior court judge karl 
johnstone 
the judge canceled todays session and ordered jurors to be 
especially careful about avoiding publicity about the case during 
their long weekend recess lawyers said hazelwood should be ready 
to resume monday 
william milwee jr a marine salvage consultant remained 
adamant thursday as attorney michael chalos challenged his 
assertions that hazelwood risked losing his tanker and the lives of 
his crew when he ordered the ship forward after it hit a reef 
but the witness also agreed that in a grounding the captains 
first instinct would be to get his ship afloat 
chalos suggested the ships engines did not have enough 
horsepower to extricate the massive tanker from the reef 
there is absolutely no question this ship would not have moved 
using its engines alone said milwee 
no matter what captain hazelwood did asked chalos 
no matter what captain hazelwood did responded the witness 
but captain hazelwood did nothing to try and determine that 
repeatedly milwee insisted that hazelwood should have had more 
information before he attempted any maneuver in the wake of the 
grounding 
the retired navy salvage expert said a captain should take 
soundings by dropping a piece of lead with a line attached to it 
over the side to ascertain how deep the water is and how the 
vessel is grounded 
but he acknowledged that soundings might have been inaccurate in 
water thick with oozing oil 
the 987foot tanker spilled nearly 11 million gallons of alaska 
crude in little more than an hour after it ran aground in prince 
william sound on march 24 it was the nations worst oil spill 
killing countless birds fish and other wildlife and blackening 
hundreds of miles of rocky shoreline 
the prosecution claims that hazelwoods actions after the ship 
hit jagged bligh reef worsened the problem and risked more damage 
to the tanker 
the 43yearold skipper from huntington ny is charged with 
criminal mischief reckless endangerment operating a vessel while 
intoxicated and negligent discharge of oil he could receive 7 
years in prison and fines of 61000 
milwee the third expert witness for the prosecution this week 
said he has a 25000 contract with the state for his work on the 
case 
chalos confronted milwee with a book on seamanship containing 14 
points of advice for the skipper of a grounded vessel 
as chalos read off the points milwee acknowledged that 
hazelwood followed almost all the recommended procedures including 
alerting the engine room lowering lifeboats sending a distress 
message and remaining calm 
on each of those points chalos asked him was that a correct 
action 
correct action answered the witness 
a good action asked the attorney 
good action said the witness 
but milwee faulted hazelwood on two points failing to sound a 
general alarm to wake the crew and not taking soundings before 
activating the engines 
you shouldnt attempt to move a ship in any way until you have 
knowledge of the water that lies around it he said 
assistant district attorney brent cole asked how certain a 
captain should be of a situation before he attempts refloating 
dead certain said the witness 
as far as hazelwoods failure to sound a general alarm other 
officers have said the skipper didnt want to incite panic among 
the crew members most of whom were asleep milwee ridiculed that 
reasoning 
i cant imagine a crew that sounding the general alarm is 
going to panic the witness said if it does theyre not much 
of a crew

virtual standstill and students were urinating in public and 
passing out drunk

to make students welcome because of the tremendous economic impact 
chamber of commerce officials estimate students will spend 120 
million from early march through midapril the first group of 
20000 students arrived this week just as 240000 bikers 
arrived for motorcycle races at daytona international speedway 
by using a multiplier officials estimate spring break has 
almost a 1 billion impact on the areas economy 
daytona beach became the nations spring break capital about 
three years ago after fort lauderdale tightened law enforcement

better said police chief paul crow it will be a much more 
organized event 
contrary to percepitions crow said our problems havent been 
with the college kids 
about twothirds of last years arrests were florida youngsters 
many of them underage high school students 
we have to deal with the day trippers he said 
this year crow said exits to daytona beach off interstate 95 
will be closed when the beach is full to prevent gridlock 
we are going to close the gate crow said

responsible for law enforcement on the beach said his officers 
will take a nononsense approach to drinking and rowdyism 
we hope they have a good time but we are going to enforce the 
laws kirvan said

federal authorities have taken over two bronx 
apartment buildings described as veritable macys of crack 
sales 
an affidavit supporting thursdays seizures said drug dealers 
who worked out of the buildings terrorized the neighborhood 
including a nearby drug rehabilitation center 
the affidavit said numerous gunshots were fired at the center 
and that on one occasion a resident barely missed being hit by a 
bullet it also alleged that dealers frequently surrounded the 
rehab center and taunted the recovering addicts by dangling vials 
of crack through the fence 
the seizures were announced by us attorney otto g obermaier 
whose office brought the action and bronx district attorney robert 
t johnson who investigated the drug activity 
they said more than 150 drug arrests had been made in the past 
14 months at the two sixstory 53unit apartment buildings where 
police officers had observed up to 100 people lining up outside to 
buy drugs 
the seizures were made under a provision of the federal 
narcotics law that allows the government to take over property 
known to be the site of drug activity 
the buildings owner was identified as john dino and his phelan 
corp in queens authorities charged that dino had not taken 
reasonable action to rid the buildings of drug traffickers and to 
make the building safe for legitimate tenants who occupied a small 
percentage of the apartments 
efforts to get comment from dino were unsuccessful because there 
were no telephone listings for him or his company 
the affidavit said as many as 10 different drug organizations 
used the buildings as veritable macys of crack sales with 
selling occurring on the street in the lobby in the stairwells 
and in apartment doorways 
authorities said 19 people were arrested on drug charges during 
the seizures thursday the other tenants no exact number was 
available were allowed to stay in their apartments said deborah

sales of new homes fell 71 percent in january 
to their lowest level in nearly a year the government said friday 
surprising analysts who had expected a rebound from a steep plunge 
in december 
the commerce department said new singlefamily homes were sold 
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 589000 units in january 
the worst performance since sales had fallen to 556000 homes on an 
annual basis last march 
frankly its a bit of a surprise said david seiders chief 
economist for the national association of home builders i 
thought the weather would give us at least as good a month as 
december 
sales in december totaled 634000 units down 84 percent from 
november 
january sales also were down from the 704000 units purchased in 
january 1989 and marked an ominous start for the new year despite 
the healthy pace at the beginning of 1989 the year itself ended on 
a slack note with sales down 38 percent from 1988 to the lowest 
level since 1984 
john a tuccillo chief economist for the national association 
of realtors attributed the january decline to a rise in mortgage 
rates which he expects to taper off in the spring 
tuccillo also blamed rates as well as a usual january buying 
lull for a 22 percent drop in existing home sales in january 
interest rates rose on average from 983 percent to 1005 
percent in january according to surveys by the federal home loan 
mortgage corp rates continued to rise last month reaching 1031 
percent by feb 23 before dropping to 1023 percent friday 
but richard peach deputy chief economist for the mortgage 
bankers association said rising rates often boost sales because 
buyers want to lock in on loans before mortgage costs go up even 
more 
the housing industry slowed dramatically early in 1989 as the 
federal reserve sought to contain inflation by keeping interest 
rates high and thereby slowing the economy mortgage rates fell 
during the summer spurring sales but moved back into the 
doubledigit range in january 
seiders said a recent survey by the home builders found 50 
percent of its members offering incentives to offset the industry 
weakness they include optional equipment at no extra cost and 
builder payment of closing costs 
it doesnt seem to have worked he admitted 
in its report the commerce department said the median price of 
a new home continued to climb in january rising 14 percent to 
127000 the median means half of the homes cost more half less 
on the other hand the average price of a new home in january

and observe a ceasefire immediately 
whoever gives the order to shoot and whoever obeys such orders 
will be excommunicated sfeir warned including their troops in

observe a ceasefire fighting continued all day although the 
intensity of the artillery duels decreased noticeably police said 
smoke billowed from the contested neighborhoods in the 
310squaremile enclave 
a casualty figure was not available from the fierce clashes in 
the lowincome residential districts of nabaa and sin elfil 
strongholds for geageas militia at least 46 people were killed 
and 77 wounded overnight

toward beirut port to cut off geageas headquarters from a key 
stronghold aouns usmade tanks fired at close range at 
apartments cars and anything that faces them the police 
spokesman said 
they are applying scorched earth combat tactics the whole 
district is on fire the spokesman said 
police said aouns troops fought the militiamen from room to 
room for control of the 12story shalouhi building that commands 
the street linking the embattled districts with the seaside 
boulevard 
a spokesman said the strategic building repeatedly changed hands 
throughout the day it was occupied by aouns commandos in a swift 
attack at first light said the spokesman who cannot be identified 
in line with regulations 
geageas men he said launched a counteroffensive about 10 am 
and regained control of the building

community that has dominated lebanon since independence from france 
in 1943 
hrawi also sharply attacked a mediation effort by the palestine 
liberation organization saying they have come to rescue us 
after they caused our war they started lebanons tragedy we 
dont need their advice 
he was referring to the nearly 15yearold civil war which 
started as a clash between arafats guerrillas and the christians 
in april 1975 
aoun has rejected parliaments election last fall of hrawi who 
has pledged to enact a peace pact aoun says he opposes the peace 
plan because it does not require the pullout of 40000 syrian 
troops deployed under a 1976 arab league mandate to keep the peace 
in the civil war 
hrawi fired aoun as army commander but aoun refused to step 
down

sen juan ponce enrile announced from 
jail friday that he intends to run for president in 1992 if he is 
cleared of criminal charges related to the december coup attempt 
against corazon aquino 
enrile has been in custody since tuesday when he was charged 
with rebellion with murder in connection with the sixth and 
most serious attempt to overthrow president aquino 
he said he will accept the presidential challenge if the 
opposition nationalista party of which he is the 
secretarygeneral nominates him and if he is acquitted of the 
charges 
mrs aquinos popularity remains high among many filipinos but 
the constitution bars the president from seeking a second term 
also friday hotel owner rebecco panlilio and his wife erlinda 
who were charged tuesday with enrile surrendered to the national 
bureau of investigation officials said 
enrile and the panlilio couple were among seven people so far 
indicted in the dec 19 coup attempt 
one of the seven who remains at large is cashiered lt col 
gregorio gringo honasan enriles former chief security aide 
who led an august 1987 mutiny against mrs aquino 
the panlilios were allegedly at enriles home on dec 1 when 
witnesses claimed they saw honasan and about 100 rebel soldiers 
also at the senators residence enrile claims he has not seen 
honasan since 1987 
enrile was defense minister under president ferdinand marcos but 
turned against the autocratic ruler in february 1986 in the 
military mutiny that swept mrs aquino to power he was fired as 
defense minister in november 1986 after his followers tried to 
oust mrs aquino 
the supreme court has set a hearing tuesday on a petition by 
enriles lawyers questioning the legality of the charges enrile 
says they were filed to punish him for opposing mrs aquino 
the high tribunal also ordered government lawyers to answer 
within 10 days the panlilio couples petition challenging the 
validity of the charges against them 
meanwhile about 300 supporters of mrs aquino picketed the 
senate on friday protesting special treatment they say is being 
considered for enrile 
senators have been debating since wednesday a proposal to ask 
the court to put enrile under the custody of the senates 
sergeantatarms so he could attend sessions 
enriles lawyers said they will ask the court handling the 
charges to delay a scheduled arraignment monday pending a decision 
on the petition for freedom 
under the law rebellion is punishable by up to 12 years 
imprisonment and murder carries a maximum sentence of life in 
prison 
about 3000 mutinous troops many of them from the armys elite 
scout ranger regiment launched the december coup attempt in which 
at least 113 people were killed and more than 600 injured

a communist party leader declared 
friday that his party now supported democracy and opposed any 
attempts to restore its former monopoly on power 
communist party first secretary vasil mohorita said the party 
was willing to play the role of a constructive opposition if as 
expected it loses in free elections scheduled for june 8 
our main priority is to convince the people that we do not 
wish a return to the old days not to win the elections said 
mohorita who became first secretary after the partys hardline 
leadership was ousted during last years democratic revolution 
a return to the thesis of oneparty rule must not be allowed 
this monopoly on power must be prevented he added 
after 41 years of orthodox oneparty communist rule 
czechoslovakia underwent a peaceful revolution last november and 
december that introduced political pluralism 
mohorita said the communists should not be concerned about 
winning the elections but rather must convince czechoslovaks that 
they now support democracy 
we have to show the people that we have been participating in 
these democratization processes from the beginning and if we 
have to be in opposition it will be a constructive one he said 
despite losing its hold on power the communist party still has 
some 1 million members or maybe a little less mohorita said 
the party claimed 17 million members before the start of last 
years revolution some 13 million of those people joined the 
party after the purge of half a million members that followed the 
1968 sovietled invasion that crushed the prague spring reform 
movement 
mohorita indicated that party members who do not support the new 
prodemocracy policy would be dropped from the ranks 
he admitted that an unspecified number of party members still 
favor orthodox oneparty rule but stressed that we have to part 
with these people 
mohorita said there was a need for deep critical but very 
serious analysis of the past four decades of communist rule but 
he complained of what he called increasingly sharp attacks against 
the party in the media it once controlled 
a career communist official mohorita led the statecontrolled 
socialist youth union until tumultuous changes in the party 
propelled him into the position of first secretary in december at 
the same time ladislav adamec was named chairman of the party

before carrying out president bushs proposal 
for a base on the moon and a manned mission to mars the space 
agency needs to study new technologies and eliminate unacceptable 
risks to the crew the national research council said friday 
in a report requested by vice president dan quayle the council 
said the exploration plan by the national aeronautics and space 
administration addresses a reasonable set of technological and 
strategic approaches but not all of the technically credible 
approaches have been analyzed 
the council an arm of the congressionally chartered national 
academy of sciences also said 
operation of a us space station by the late 1990s as 
scheduled is a reasonable assumption but present plans for the 
station are not adequate for a moonmars mission the station may 
not be the most appropriate staging base for the moon and mars 
or two stations may be needed 
nuclear power eventually will be essential for the moon and 
mars bases also nuclear propulsion of spacecraft included by 
nasa as an option should be tested the use of nuclear 
technology in space faces formidable barriers of public acceptance 
however especially if employed in earth orbit therefore issues 
of safety are paramount in research and development 
although the nasa proposals envision bases on mars it appears 
that a station in mars orbit requires a less demanding 
infrastructure than a surface base and might serve a useful purpose 
in the early stages of human space exploration 
possiblities for international cooperation should be explored 
because breakthroughs have been made in europe japan and elsewhere 
and most importantly the ussr has substantial relevant 
capability demonstrated continued inerest in mars and an apparent 
strong desire for cooperation with the us in mars exploration 
the councils study made by a 14member committee named in 
january said it was vital to the moonmars mission that the united 
states have the capability to send humans into space maintain 
them in a physical condition that permits them to work 
productively and return them to earth in good health 
however it added it has not been demonstrated after 
longduration spaceflight individuals can readjust rapidly to 
gravity without serious physiological consequences 
it said research into this problem was critical to the 
design of the bases and vehicles it said this should include study 
of artificial gravity not included by nasa in its list of critical 
technologies for the mission 
with the current state of knowledge a multiyear exposure to 
weightlessness even with onboard exercise and countermeasures and 
an intermediate stay on the surface of mars presents unacceptable 
risks to the crew the committee said 
bush announced a us commitment for humans to return to the 
moon and journey to mars in a speech last july 20 the 20th 
anniversary of the 1969 moon landing 
he asked quayle chairman of the national space council to come 
up with recommendations for carrying out the initiative nasa made 
a 90day study and quayle asked the national research council to 
evaluate it 
nasa administrator richard truly said in a written statement 
issued by the space agencys public affairs office nasa is 
pleased that after careful consideration the nrc panel found the 
material developed in nasas 90day study accurate and appropriate 
to the human exploration initiative at this stage in its 
development 
david beckwith the vice presidents press secretary said 
its a very interesting report and we are pleased and grateful 
the council said costs of the program are uncertain and 
likely to remain so for some time 
it said it appeared unlikely for technical and cost reasons 
that the space station could be built in time so that americans 
could reach mars by 2011 as envisioned in the most ambitious nasa 
plan the other nasa option calls for exploration in 2018 
the panel disagreed with the contention of scientists at the 
lawrence livermore national laboratory that humans could be placed 
on mars by the year 2000 it said that underestimates the many 
practical and difficult engineering and operational challenges 
involved

billy joel says he didnt start the fire 
but he certainly helped fan one under cloquet high school freshman 
kevin shutes 
shutes correctly identified and described 116 of the 119 people 
places and events in joels hit song we didnt light the fire 
in a trivia contest sponsored by the carlton county historical 
society 
his reward included the 25 top prize a years membership in 
the society free pizzas car washes and movie passes 
i thought all the entrants really did a great job said the 
societys director ellen quinn who organized the contest to help 
broaden the students knowledge of history 
i was surprised by the amount of time they put in and how 
complete their answers were she said thursday shutes had very 
complete answers and even went into a little commentary 
shutes described woodstock a word in the song as a 
massive rock n roll orgy that involved 500000 young people out 
for a good time they completely took over the area and indulged in 
sex and drugs freely the sanitary conditions were said to have 
been disgusting 
he identified studebaker as a shortlived product of the 
car industry a free pony was offered to consumers who purchased 
the car 
for extra credit shutes noted singersongwriter bob dylan who 
gets a mention in the song was born duluth and reared in hibbing 
the three references he stumbled on were sugar ray pope 
paul and santayana he incorrectly identified boxing 
champion sugar ray robinson as a baseball player he confused pope 
paul vi of italy with john paul ii as the first polish pope and 
misidentified philospher george santayana as the 1960s rock band

signs on an already cluttered retail landscape strictly forbids 
freestanding signs which have the shape in the form of any

in a remarkable mass mea culpa massachusetts 
politicians are lining up to confess their past dalliance with 
marijuana an urge to repent that began when the attorney general 
fessed up to using the demon weed 
state attorney general james shannon 37 went to the 
confessional first during a midweek television interview 
where he was being queried about his tough stance on casual drug 
users within 24 hours more politicians lined up at the booth 
allegations of drug use may have locked federal appeals judge 
douglas h ginsburg out of a us supreme court seat but in 
massachusetts the new political wisdom seems to dictate that there 
is safety in numbers 
on friday the boston herald under the page one headline pols 
who have gone to pot lined up thumbnail photos of some who 
acknowledged dabbling in marijuana use the politicians made their 
admissions when asked by the newspaper 
the growing list includes six democrats us sen john kerry 
us reps joseph kennedy and richard neal lt gov evelyn murphy 
who is a candidate for governor state auditor joseph denucci and 
state sen william golden who is running for lieutenant governor 
there are two republicans both running for lieutenant governor 
paul cellucci and state rep peter torkildsen 
the admissions all sound a similar theme they contain 
references to youthful indiscretion lessons learned and reason 
that comes with age most of those coming forward point out that 
they grew up in an era when drug experimentation was as common as 
doing the twist and wearing beatle haircuts 
kennedy 37 said in a statement like many people my age i 
tried it when i was younger but i certainly believe that there is 
no benefit to drug use and there can be terrible consequences 
and ms murphy 49 who acknowledged using marijuana once or 
twice said the public will have to judge the conduct of those now 
admitting prior drug use i think were much wiser about the 
damage drugs have done she said 
there are of course staunch holdouts who say they never smoked 
marijuana a former us attorney accused his predecessor william 
weld of smoking pot at a party weld now a gop gubernatorial 
candidate was exonerated of that charge his spokesman ray 
howell reiterated friday that the 44yearold weld has never tried 
drugs 
at a shopping center near the statehouse several people seemed 
positively underwhelmed by the news that their elected officials 
had smoked pot in college 
i really think it shouldnt be a big deal said bruce hall 
a 39yearold construction worker 
his buddy jim mooreside 41 agreed i think it might hurt 
their image but i dont see why 
and one 40yearold woman sherry flashman who works in 
planning chastised the politicians for decrying their past drug 
use 
i really think its a problem with this society that there 
cant be an acknowledgment that a lot of people did it and it 
wasnt a terrible thing said flashman i think thats the real 
shame

east germanys army has suffered a loss of 
morale readiness and nearly a quarter of its troops since the 
borders were opened and the perception of a threat from the west 
began to diminish 
east german troops have deserted sold their uniforms in the 
west and some even refused to take part in a military exercise last 
month with soviet troops 
defense minister theodor hoffmann has conceded that reform has 
inflicted many difficulties on the oncefeared frontline force 
of the warsaw pact 
we are practically without subordinates a senior army 
officer said the officers themselves have to walk patrols and 
service tanks 
the officer who spoke on condition he not be identified said 
the army has been hit hard by the departure of thousands of 
soldiers through the open borders with the west 
col gerd aperz of the defense ministry information office said 
reports of the east german armys diminished defense capability 
have been exaggerated in the west but confirmed the emigration to 
west germany has taken its toll on the force 
he also noted that more than 10 percent of the national peoples 
army troops are deployed in factories municipal maintenance crews 
and in other public works to keep crucial industries and services 
operating despite the daily departure of thousands of workers 
more than 40000 soldiers have left army service since jan 26 
when a military reform was announced to cut what was then a 
200000troop force to 110000 by the end of the year aperz said 
but other defense ministry sources said only about half of the 
departures were due to the planned reduction that was to be phased 
in over the year 
increasing numbers have deserted to seek their fortunes in the 
west or failed to report back from furloughs amid a noticeable 
decline in discipline and readiness the sources said 
capt olaf marks said nearly half of the 2000 soldiers 
stationed at his 23rd rifle regiment based in bad salzungen had 
left in recent weeks 
they join more than 400000 east germans who have fled to west 
germany since last summer having abandoned hope that their living 
standards will improve 
reform is being blamed for much of the decline in what was once 
viewed as the strongest fighting force in eastern europe and the 
most strategically located due to its border with nato member west 
germany 
improved relations between the two germanys as well as between 
the two military alliances to which they belong have changed 
perceptions of westerners from enemies to friends and greatly 
reduced east german fears of a military threat emanating from 
across the border 
a young officer at this weeks session of political talks 
between communists and opposition parties said many east german 
soldiers can no longer conceive of circumstances that would prompt 
them to take up arms against their west german brothers 
hoffmann the defense minister also addressed the session 
appealing to politicians not to make the army a campaign instrument 
in the march 18 balloting east germanys first free elections 
expectations of imminent unification of the two germanys has 
encouraged the east german force to seek means of cooperating with 
the west german bundeswehr rather than planning for counterattacks 
that seem increasingly unlikely to be needed 
military strategists from east germany and west germany have 
been discussing ways of sharing defense burdens in the event the 
nations are unified 
a joint east germansoviet exercise near berlin in early 
february had to be scaled back after some east german troops 
refused to take part 
aperz confirmed some soldiers objected because they considered 
the exercise to be in conflict with the new reform character of 
the army but denied reports the soldiers refused to work with the 
soviet troops 
east germany is host for the bulk of the soviet unions 565000 
troops deployed in eastern europe which has long been a matter of 
resentment among residents of the regions where the soviets are 
stationed 
the kremlin has not yet faced significant pressure from east 
germans to pull out its troops but a large withdrawal is expected 
to be negotiated soon at the viennabased negotiations on 
conventional armed forces 
in the meantime signs abound that the army has been taking its 
responsibilities less seriously 
in search of hard currency to buy consumer goods during western 
visits some soldiers sell their uniform jackets hats and ensignia 
at the thriving west berlin flea market near the checkpoint charlie 
border crossing 
on a recent afternoon one brownclad soldier approaching a 
ditchdigging brigade drew a crowd of impressed fellow soldiers 
around him when he displayed what two passing american reporters 
mistook for a grenade launcher 
its a muffler the soldier corrected the foreigners as his 
fellow troops broke into howls of laughter i just bought it over 
in west berlin

the british broadcasting corp announced plans 
friday to expand its news programs in the united states and eastern 
europe 
one of the main principles behind the success of our 
international broadcasting is that we broadcast to our friends as 
well as those who until recently were enemies said john 
tusa managing director of the bbc world service 
we talk to open as well as to closed societies he said 
tusa said that later this month americans will be able to dial 
up the latest bbc news program by telephone at any time for less 
than a dollar a minute one cable television service cspan is 
devoting an audio channel to a 24hour relay of bbc news and tusa 
expects it to grow from its present 1 million subscribers 
he said he also hopes for growth in an arrangement with american 
public radio that permits any of its stations to relay all bbc 
world service material from midnight to six in the morning 
tusa who was born in czechoslovakia said eastern european 
countries still need to hear controversy comment and news from a 
broad international viewpoint he said noncommunist leaders in 
eastern europe have asked the bbc to continue its programing and 
are giving it facilities for local rebroadcast 
to show the influence bbc broadcasts have had tusa held up a 
photograph taken last june in tiananmen square before chinese tanks 
put down the prodemocracy movement students were carrying the 
chinese flag and a sign in both english and chinese in english it 
said thank you bbc 
tusa added that bbc officials are asking prime minister margaret 
thatchers government for more money but declined to say how much 
he insisted that government financing does not lessen bbc 
independence 
the foreign office does not even attempt to tell us what to 
say tusa told reporters

a wide area of southern california rolled 
today with another aftershock of wednesdays big earthquake 
triggering a rockslide on a mountain road but no reports of 
significant damage or injuries 
the quake shook los angeles riverside san bernardino and san 
diego counties it also hit orange county where president bush was 
addressing a noon antidrug rally 
the aftershock measured 47 on the richter scale at 926 am 
said robert finn spokesman for the california institute of 
technology in pasadena 
it was preceded today by a 25 quake at 252 am and followed 
within two hours by about 10 quakes under magnitude 25 including 
a 24 at 1041 am according to caltech 
a rockslide closed mount baldy road in the mountains north of 
upland and only residents were allowed through caltrans spokesman 
anthony hughes said 
it was scary and im shaking but nothing fell or flew this 
time said melina manning of ontario two miles south of the 
epicenter all the pans and the lights swayed back and forth it 
was mild compared to the other day but very scary especially 
because your nerves are shot from the other day 
i was under the desk again it was very strong here said 
state office of emergency services spokesman michael guerin in 
ontario 
the aftershocks came as southern californians bounced by the 
largest quake to hit the region in more than two years were 
sweeping up after millions of dollars in damage 
city council members in pomona hardest hit of several areas 
struck by wednesdays earthquake said they would meet today to 
request that gov george deukmejian assist them in obtaining 
federal or state funds to repair an estimated 10 million in damage 
in their city 
the state office of emergency services said thursday the quake 
measuring 55 on the richter scale caused at least 127 million 
damage in the cities of claremont pomona la verne chino 
ontario rancho cucamonga montclair and upland and the counties of 
los angeles riverside and san bernardino 
the figure is very preliminary based on information provided 
by cities and counties said guerin 
the quake felt along the coast from san diego to santa barbara 
and as far east as las vegas was centered on an unnamed fault 
three miles northwest of this city 40 miles east of los angeles it 
toppled scores of chimneys shattered hundreds of windows and 
collapsed one buildings wall but remarkably caused no major 
injuries or deaths 
dozens of smaller aftershocks have rattled the area since 
there was no official estimate of the number of injured other 
than several dozen from the oes the most serious injuries 
officials said were a few broken bones 
only one person a pomona man was known to have been left 
homeless by the quake 
but the temblor spurred renewed calls for southern californians 
to prepare for the socalled big one a catastrophic earthquake 
measuring between 75 and 8 on the richter scale of ground motion 
a 1988 us geological survey report said that a quake that size is 
at least 60 percent likely by the year 2018 on the southern san 
andreas fault 
this is the handwriting on the wall and we better start 
looking at the design of some of our buildings pomona vice mayor 
clay bryant said thursday weve already been put on notice by a 
55 
pomona mayor donna smith said city inspectors were compiling a 
list of how many unreinforced masonry buildings remain in the city 
which has several landmark structures more than 100 years old 
she said 301 buildings in pomona were damaged and 17 were 
declared uninhabitable 
pomona claremont and la verne all declared local states of 
emergency wednesday but the la verne city council withdrew its 
declaration thursday after determining damage was not as bad as 
first believed 
the destruction was widely scattered throughout the region 
in pomona for example part of the south face of the 
58yearold brickandconcrete trinity united methodist church 
collapsed while the brick pilgram congregational church a block 
away withstood the quake 
at the citys historic phillips mansion built in 1875 a 
chimney toppled onto a roof causing an estimated 500000 damage 
but surrounding buildings were unscathed 
despite the damage the quake was far less serious than the one 
that struck the whittier area on oct 1 1987 that one measured 
59 and together with a 53magnitude aftershock on oct 4 killed 
eight people injured more than 200 and caused 358 million in 
damage 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs an earthquake of 5 can cause considerable damage and 
6 severe damage

hundreds of moslem separatists dressed in 
death shrouds tried to march to srinagar on friday a day after 
government troops shot to death 49 moslems but soldiers blocked 
the rally police said 
the march was to have begun in sumbal 15 miles north of 
srinagar said a senior police official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity he said at least 1000 moslems gathered in the town but 
were stopped by soldiers before they could leave for srinagar 
witnesses contacted by telephone said the demonstrators had 
draped themselves in white burial shrouds to show they were willing 
to die in the fight for secession 
a police officer speaking on condition of anonymity said at 
least 49 people died and between 45 and 100 were injured thursday 
in two incidents related to the moslems campaign the government 
said the officers fired in selfdefense 
the militants want independence for the moslemdominated kashmir 
region a part of indias jammukashmir state it is the only 
moslemdominated state in india where the majority of the 
population is hindu 
the latest shootings prompted authorities to impose an 
indefinite curfew at 4 am friday on sringar which is the 
capital and six other towns 
it prevented moslems from attending the weekly friday prayers 
which in the past have been flashpoints for trouble 
police said one group of separatists defied the curfew and 
gathered along dal lake but they were chased away by paramilitary 
troops 
an officer who spoke on condition of anonymity said one of the 
protesters fell to his death in the cold lake the victim was not 
identified 
the death brought to 162 the number of people killed in kashmir 
since the current round of secessionrelated violence flared jan 
20 following a government crackdown on moslem militants 
the violence brought criticism from neighboring pakistan a 
moslem nation that disputes indias right to govern kashmir prime 
minister benazir bhuttos government said it condemned the brutal 
indian response to the people of kashmir who were asking only 
for their right of selfdetermination 
the kashmir issue has been a point of contention between 
pakistan and india since 1947 following the partition of the old 
british colonial asian subcontinent into two independent nations 
mostly hindu india and overwhelmingly moslem pakistan 
kashmir became a subject of dispute because its population was 
mostly moslem but its ruler was a hindu who wanted to join india 
a brief war between the two countries left a slice of the valley 
under pakistani control and the rest of kashmir as part of the 
indian state of jammukashmir a second war in 1965 did not change 
the situation

the state department said friday that 
immediate steps should be taken to encourage the demobilization of 
the nicaraguan contras but that the rebels must have full 
assurances beforehand for their personal and economic security 
it is important that their legitimate needs be met said 
department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler noting that central 
american presidents have signed agreements stating that the contra 
concerns must not be ignored the bulk of the contra forces have 
spent most of the last two years at camps in honduras 
ms tutwiler said the admnistration has dispatched veteran envoy 
harry shlaudeman to honduras to confer with the contras about their 
concerns shlaudeman served as ambassador to four south american 
countries and was called out of retirement last year to deal with 
the nicaraguan issue 
ms tutwiler said that equally important to the contra 
demobilization is the full and unequivocal transfer of civil 
and military power to the new nicaraguan government 
both president daniel ortega and the victorious opposition 
candidate in sundays election violeta chamorro have said the 
contras should be disbanded ortega has indicated that 
demobilization is necessary if a peaceful transition is to be 
carried out on april 25 inauguration day 
but state department officials said that a former contra 
regional commander who went back to nicaragua to join the election 
process several weeks ago accused the sandinistas of mistreating 
returning contras 
the contra officer known as comandante johnson said that of 41 
rebels who had returned in peace 27 were in prison 12 were dead 
and only two were free state department officials insisting on 
anonymity said they believe johnsons figures are essentially 
correct 
about 10000 rebels are at camps in southern honduras surviving 
on food and other necessities provided by the united states the 
total number being cared for in the camps including family 
members is 60000 
the demobilization of the contras and civilian control over the 
military now under sandinista party control have dominated the 
political debate in nicaragua since mrs chamorros election 
victory

disabled iranian war veterans staged a 
progovernment rally in tehran on friday in an apparent attempt to 
counter protests of the administration reported in the capital and 
other cities 
tehran radio said a large group of disabled veterans marched 
about 1 miles through the capital from the former us embassy to 
the tehran university campus 
residents of the capital have reported a number of angry or 
violent protests last week sparked by popular resentment over 
continued economic hardships faced by most iranians 
fridays marchers chanting progovernment slogans joined the 
weekly prayers at the university campus they called on judicial 
officials to crack down on opposition group members profiteering 
shopkeepers and drug smugglers the radio said 
although iranian officials have kept reports of any unrest under 
wraps a senior iranian cleric friday hinted at the trouble 
hojatoleslam emami kashani addressing the weekly university 
prayer session admitted that of course we have many economic 
problems which the government is trying to solve 
but he added some people say things out of ignorance such 
as this government program cannot be pursued or this program 
cannot solve the economic hardships 
the staterun radio television and the islamic republic news 
agency all monitored in nicosia have not reported any unrest in 
iranian cities apart from an irna report that 30 people were 
arrested feb 16 when soccer fans protested the cancellation of two 
matches 
an iranian newspaper the farsilanguage resalat reported that 
some of the sports fans had taken advantage of the 
cancellations to voice other concerns 
the country is plagued by soaring inflation shortages of most 
commodities and high unemployment despite president hashemi 
rafsanjanis attempts to revitalize the economy 
an iranian opposition group the iraqbased mujahedeen khalq 
has reported that security forces killed several hundred people 
while putting down recent antigovernment protests in tehran and 
the provincial centers of isfahan shiraz tabriz and mashad the 
reports could not be independently confirmed 
iranian travelers to cyprus have reported demonstrations in 
tehran calling for stricter control of the islamic dress code and 
expressing dissatisfaction with rafsanjanis attempts to liberalize 
the tightly controlled society 
a leading iranian cleric ayatollah ahmad azari qomi said in a 
sermon last friday that some agitators were stirring up relatives 
of those killed in the islamic revolution to convince them the 
staterun radio and television were airing unislamic programming 
such rhetoric about antiislamic moves has been voiced by 
radicals in the tehran hierarchy who are locked in an intensifying 
power struggle with rafsanjanis socalled pragmatic camp 
the radicals led by former interior minister ali akbar 
mohtashemi believe rafsanjanis economic policies calling for 
foreign investment and ties with the west plus his attempts to 
ease the government controls on the society will dilute the fervor 
of the islamic revolution

atlantis astronauts silent to the 
world because of their military mission put in a final day of work 
in orbit friday on their hushhush assignments before preparing for 
a sunday landing 
nasa said atlantis is scheduled to land sunday at edwards air 
force base and a spokesman said this means the fivemember 
allmilitary crew probably will spend most of saturday packing up 
for the return to earth 
no information was released about the crews activites in orbit 
but jeff carr a spokesman at the johnson space center said that 
if the atlantis crew follows shuttle mission routine then friday 
was the final full day to complete the secret objectives 
typically the day before landing is a day to clean up and 
start cabin stowage carr said he said astronauts usually must 
spend their prereturn day in orbit dismantling and putting away 
equipment used during the mission 
carr said the astronauts on saturday also must test fire the 
reaction control jets and check other critical systems that 
atlantis will need during its fiery plunge through earths 
atmosphere 
workers meanwhile started inspections of the solid rocket 
boosters that were used to put atlantis in orbit the spent 
boosters were recovered from the sea where they fell after the 
launch and towed to the cape canaveral air force station the 
boosters will be disassembled and refurbished for later use 
nasa spokesperson lisa malone said a general inspection of the 
rockets didnt reveal any abnormalities but noted we really 
wont know until theyre taken apart 
it was a failed solid rocket booster that caused the 1986 
challenger accident that killed seven astronauts 
the silence from atlantis on friday was good news said nasa 
spokesman bruce buckingham 
as long as there is no announcement from mission control said 
buckingham we can safely assume there are no problems 
a pentagonimposed blackout on mission details is to be broken 
sometime saturday for an official nasa announcement of the precise 
landing time this announcement usually comes 24 hours before 
landing 
sources at the national aeronautics and space administration 
said the astronauts accomplished the major objective of their 
mission thursday 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
astronauts successfully cast into orbit a 500 million spy 
satellite that will take detailed pictures of the soviet union 
including areas not seen by previous shuttlelaunch satellites the 
spy craft also is able to tune into electronic communications all 
over the world the sources said 
atlantis mission began early wednesday with a spectacular 
launch in darkness from the kennedy space center the liftoff came 
on the sixth attempt five earlier countdowns were halted due to 
weather the illness of an astronaut and a failed computer 
the mission is commanded by navy capt john o creighton others 
in the crew are air force col john h casper the pilot and 
mission specialists marine lt col david c hilmers air force 
col richard m mullane and navy cmdr pierre j thuot 
atlantis flight is 34th shuttle mission and the sixth dedicated

israel on friday ordered journalists to submit 
all stories containing monthly soviet immigration figures to the 
military censor apparently because of fears the numbers will 
increase arab opposition to the influx 
in its announcement the military censor said all material 
pertaining to immigration of soviet jews must be submitted to the 
censor prior to publication 
the censor is not expected to release the data so the screening 
process could amount to a ban previously the media reported the 
figures without checking with the censor 
the new restrictions were imposed after it was estimated this 
week that up to 230000 soviet jews may immigrate this year as 
opposed to earlier estimates of 80000 to 100000 the maariv 
newspaper reported 
maariv said the higher figure was predicted by yasha kazakov 
deputy head of the liaison bureau a government unit that deals 
with soviet immigration 
the estimate created panic in the arab countries and the 
protests coming from these countries endanger immigration the 
daily said 
yossi benaharon prime minister yizhak shamirs top aide 
agreed saying that there is so much talk of numbers and 
forecasts that it caused damage why say 230000 or whatever 
robert slater the head of the foreign press association in 
israel said the restrictions are pointless because there already 
have been many detailed reports on soviet immigration 
we are extremely disappointed at the use of military 
censorship for political purposes slater added 
yossi olmert head of the government press office called the 
restrictions very limited and denied they were imposed for 
political reasons such as to silence debate on whether soviet jews 
can settle in the occupied territories 
israel denies it directs the flow of immigrants to the occupied 
west bank and gaza strip where palestinians are fighting for their 
own state 
the united states and soviet union oppose new settlements in the 
occupied lands saying they are an obstacle to making peace with 
the palestinians arab leaders view even mass immigration to israel 
proper as a grave threat 
the latest immigration surge began last year when 12000 soviet 
jews came to israel in part because of relaxed emigration rules in 
the soviet union in january 1990 4700 soviet jews immigrated 
israeli leaders have said they expect up to 750000 this decade 
israel is hoping for 400 million in loan guarantees from the 
united states to help house the immigrants and secretary of state 
james a baker iii said thursday the bush administration may link 
that aid to assurances that no new jewish settlements would be put 
in the occupied territories 
the proposal brought angry responses from israeli leaders friday 
and concerns the disagreement could further delay middle east peace 
talks 
shamir of the rightwing likud bloc called the baker proposal 
completely unneccesary and urged washington to reconsider what 
he called the maddening idea 
shamir also criticized the timing of the remarks noting that 
baker is trying to persuade him to accept compromises to get 
usmediated peace talks started 
no pressure whether internal or external will be able to 
influence me when it comes to vital national issues shamir told 
israel television 
in a rare show of unity his rival labor party leader shimon 
peres joined in the criticism of bakers proposal 
diplomatic sources in washington said friday the dispute over 
the us aid combined with other comments baker made thursday 
about the plo could set back the peace process even more 
the sources who refused to be identified said shamir had been 
prepared to recommend the israeli government approve in principle a 
threeway meeting of baker and the egyptian and israeli foreign 
ministers but now the sources said that would be almost 
impossible 
in addition to the aid proposal baker said thursday in 
washington he was satisfied that plo chairman yasser arafat was 
adhering to his december 1988 renunciation of terrorism against 
israel baker said there was no evidence of arafats complicity in 
terrorism since then 
shamir is under pressure from washington and from legislators at 
home to accept compromises so that preliminary peace talks with a 
palestinian delegation can be held 
labor politicians want him to compromise but hardliners in

former prime minister rajiv gandhis 
battered congress party was voted out of power in five of eight 
state legislatures this week election results showed friday 
but it retained control in the western state of maharashtra and 
awaited election results from the crucial state of bihar where it 
faced stiff competition from the janata dal party of prime minister 
vp singh gandhis arch political foe and successor

fraud were conducted tuesday for 1610 seats in the eight states 
and the federally administered pondicherry region in the south 
the congress party had controlled all nine legislatures

in bomb blasts police shootings and clashes since voting began 
this week nationwide 98 people died in electionrelated violence 
results of tuesdays elections showed the congress party had

rajasthan to the janata dal and the rightwing bharatiya janata 
party or the indian peoples party few results from the eighth 
state arunachal pradesh had come in 
the congress also lost the pondicherry assembly 
it would clearly take a superhuman effort by the party to 
recover the lost ground in the coming days said the statesman a 
calcuttabased independent daily 
the results from maharashtra came as a morale booster to the 
congress which had been stunned by its second debacle in three 
months said another newspaper patriot 
the congress party won 142 seats in the 288member maharashtra 
assembly the bharatiya janata party won 39 janata dal took 25 and

centers in bihar after complaints of ballot stuffing voter 
intimidation and widespread violence 
on friday soldiers patrolled the streets of meham town in 
haryana state where at least 13 people were killed during a 
byelection for the state legislature 
the violence was blamed on supporters of om prakash chauthala 
the janata dal candidate in meham and the chief minister of haryana

tried to stuff ballot boxes and scare voters in areas where he was 
not expected to get many votes 
chauthala who was appointed to the chief ministers elected 
post was required under indian laws to seek voters mandate to 
ratify his position 
janata dal spokesman jaipal reddy said the party will take 
disciplinary action against chauthala if he was found guilty of 
violence 
nobody will be above this process he said

senators told energy secretary james d 
watkins on friday to speed up opening the yucca mountain 
underground storage site for nuclear power plant waste but said his 
new timetable may be too optimistic 
we cant continue simply to speculate on what we might or 
might not find there sen j bennett johnston dla told 
watkins in urging that underground exploration begin it is time 
to start making some of those controversial decisions 
johnston presided over a hearing of the senate energy and 
natural resources committee in its first review of watkins plan 
which was released in november 1989 
the timetable calls for aboveground studies to begin next 
january at the nevada site which was selected by congress to hold 
the spent fuel from the nations 100 nuclear power plants 
the spent rdioactive fuel is currently being stored on site but 
that capacity is limited and 27 sites will run out of storage 
according to the energy department congress enacted the nuclear 
waste policy act in 1982 and amended it in 1987 to deal with that 
problem 
in the meantime according to testimony utility customers are 
paying extra for onsite storage and the federally mandated plan 
johnston also noted that the longer the delays the less money the 
plan will receive from congress and the more difficult it will be 
to scale up spending later 
the original date for the first testing had been in may 1989 
but that schedule has been delayed because of objections in nevada 
to the states being the repository for radioactive waste from 
power plants nationwide 
watkins timetable called for the underground repository to 
begin accepting spent fuel in 2010 at least seven years behind 
schedule the first step in that process is the aboveground tests 
that would begin in early 1991 
the aboveground tests are needed to make a preliminary 
determination of whether underground storage is even feasible 
but the big if in the schedule is the outcome of two 
lawsuits filed this january one by the state of nevada against the 
energy department and one by the department against nevada 
both cases deal with the refusal of nevada to grant the 
necessary permits to begin exploration of the site which was 
chosen by congress as a solution to the spent fuel storage problem 
sen james a mcclure ridaho said now that the issue is in 
the legal system there is little control over it 
i do know enough about that profession to be pessimistic 
said mcclure a lawyer

by her former husband an appeals court panel ruled friday 
a threejudge district of columbia court of appeals panel freed

farmers who signed up in a new 025 
program for 1990crop soybeans will be allowed to plant all of 
their requested acreage the agriculture department said friday 
keith bjerke executive vice president of the departments 
commodity credit corp said that under 025 provisions producers 
could request permission to plant soybeans on as much as 25 percent 
of their 1990 permitted acreages of wheat feed grains cotton and 
rice 
the signup was held jan 16 through feb 16 sunflowers and 
safflowers also were permitted but did not require a formal signup 
farmers participating in the program will not have the oilseed 
acreage charged against farm acreage bases or individual crop 
bases instead the land planted to soybeans sunflowers and 
safflowers will be considered as planted to the program crop for 
crop history purposes 
however bjerke said no program benefits other than soybean 
price support loans and purchases will be available on the 
production from the acreage planted under the 025 option 
when the program was announced on dec 29 it was specified that 
usda would estimate how 1990 soybean prices may respond if prices 
were indicated at less than 498 per bushel 110 percent of the 
price support loan rate of 453 the department would reduce or 
eliminate the acreage to be allowed for soybeans 
bjerke said a review of anticipated additional soybean plantings 
showed the 025 program will not result in 1990 prices dropping 
below the specified level 
in all about 192 million acres of additional soybeans were 
enrolled in the program along with 10161 acres of sunflowers and 
871 acres of safflowers 
some of the biggest soybean enrollments included illinois 
293155 acres indiana 121722 iowa 261617 kansas 229028

the chairman of the house armed services 
committee called on the bush administration friday to consider 
reducing the number of troops in europe and not wait until a 
ussoviet conventional arms treaty 
rep les aspin dwis cited the testimony of cia director 
william webster who told the panel thursday that reversing the 
radical changes in eastern europe and the soviet threat to the west 
is highly unlikely 
what judge webster was saying is weve seen a lot and 
regardless of whether we get a conventional forces agreement or not 
there has been a fundamental shift in the threat to europe the 
chairman said friday at an armed services hearing 
but gen john r galvin the commander of us forces in europe 
said he opposed any cuts in american troop levels until a 
ussoviet pact is reached to reduce conventional forces 
lets keep our chips on the table here until we get the 
agreement said galvin 
he said the administrations plan to reduce forces in the 
central front of europe to 195000 will take about three years 
aspin questioned why cuts couldnt be part of the presidents 
budget for fiscal 1991 which begins oct 1 
if you believe clearly what judge webster was saying we 
shouldnt have to wait and put the whole 1991 budget on hold in 
europe we ought to be making some changes starting next fall he 
said i see this 1991 budget as essentially a hold budget in 
europe 
although webster said a resurgence in the soviet threat is 
unlikely defense secretary dick cheney warns that a hardline 
government could present problems to the united states 
in testimony thursday cheney stood by the administrations plan 
to cut troop levels in europe allowing 195000 in the central zone 
and 30000 troops elsewhere in europe

west german chancellor helmut kohl in a 
letter to the dean of the simon wiesenthal center for holocaust 
studies said antisemitism will not be tolerated in a reunited 
germany 
rabbi marvin hier said friday that hes not applauding the 
rush toward german reunification despite kohls assurances which 
came in a reply to a letter hier wrote feb 9 in it the rabbi 
urged that a united germany ban antisemitic organizations and take 
pains to remember its nazi past 
kohl in a response dated feb 28 said hate crimes are not 
tolerated in west germany and do not go unpunished 
he acknowledged the untold suffering inflicted on those people 
in the name of germany and by germans and added i understand 
the anxiety expressed by some victims in view of the prospect 
of german unity 
however he told hier it needs to be asked whether such 
anxiety is essentially justified whether its roots lie not only in 
the past but also in the present in this respect our views 
evidently differ 
on thursday the east german foreign ministry proposed that 
experts from both germanys meet soon to work out a common position 
on german unification for presentation to the world war ii allies 
the united states the soviet union britain and france 
in his letter hier outlined a 10point plan that he said would 
reassure those who bear the scars of nazism that a united germany 
will never again heed the call of a dictator 
the rabbi said a unified germany should establish a federal 
agency to monitor hate groups and prosecute violators and a 
national education task force that would emphasize teaching of the 
holocaust 
concentration campsites should be turned into museums that 
would depict the horrors of nazism hier said he called for a 
ban of antisemitic organizations and pushed for restitution 
payments and a government commitment to rebuild synagogues and 
jewish learning centers in east germany 
kohl has said west germans are taught about nazi oppression 
through schools church groups and the media 
to my mind there is no doubt that these provisions will also 
apply in a united germany kohl wrote this certainly does not 
require any special demand 
hier said friday that the victims of nazi germany should have a 
say in planning of a new germany 
those who suffered have paid dearly for the right to voice 
their concerns he said in a telephone interview they deserve 
as much attention as issues being raised by world leaders 
its kind of naive for kohl to suggest trust me on this 
hier said theres no reason to accept that trust

contra commanders on friday again spurned a plea by 
nicaraguas presidentelect violeta chamorro to lay down their arms 
immediately and instead proposed negotiations with the new 
government 
the sandinistas defeated in sundays elections in nicaragua 
have threatened to keep control of the countrys military and 
secret police as long as an estimated 10000 contras remain armed 
and mobilized 
mrs chamorro and more recently president bush have called on 
the rebels to surrender their arms to achieve a national 
reconciliation and end a decade of civil war but at a news 
conference here they again refused 
we demand the total demilitarization of the sandinista front 
and the disappearance of the statepartyarmy that support it 
said spokesman juan fernando ramirez there can be no disarming 
of the resistance without a transfer of command to the new 
government 
he also said contra leaders want an explanation of comments by 
sandinista party officials that they will govern from below 
even after the usbacked government assumes power on april 25 
that could mean terrorism extortion and assassination he 
said 
fernando released a letter written to mrs chamorro by top 
contra leader and commander israel galeano proposing negotiations 
with the new government he said she has not formally replied but 
has indicated willingness to take part in talks with the contras 
commander jose rivas representing the contras largest force 
the northern front operating from honduras said his troops wanted 
peace but not at the price of immediate surrender of their arms 
our position is that when the sandinista front surrenders its 
arms we will surrender ours rivas said 
maritza herrera said many of her 2500 costa ricabased rebels 
on nicaraguas southern front felt they were betrayed by the 
leftist government during the amnesty 
she said 50 of the rebels who turned themselves in were arrested 
and 28 were killed 
there is no international organization there is no 
government that can guarantee our safety she said this 
process will take time 
asked if the contras were providing a pretext to the sandinistas 
to stay in power rivas said the rebels had learned through blood 
and tears not to trust their enemys promises 
following the election nicaraguan president daniel ortega 
ordered his troops to cease attacks on the contras and there have 
been no major reported military confrontations since then

the nations largest banking trade group on 
friday endorsed a plan to reform deposit insurance and force 
uninsured depositors to accept some losses in bank failures 
the american bankers associations plan would continue 100000 
per account coverage but it would eliminate the current de facto 
practice of treating some banks as too big to fail 
accounts over the 100000 limit would be subject to an 
immediate haircut based on the federal deposit insurance 
corps experience with past bank failures 
the haircut would change probably once a year but if the plan 
were in effect now uninsured depositors would probably lose 12 
cents on every dollar the trade group estimates 
currently depositors are guaranteed nothing beyond 100000 
but in practice regulators have guaranteed all deposits at large 
institutions because theyre afraid a collapse of a major bank 
would ripple through the financial system causing runs on banks 
generally 
as a matter of fairness regulators also usually protect all 
deposits when a small institution fails 
the american bankers proposal is similar to one advanced last 
summer by former federal deposit insurance corp chairman william 
issac now a private banking consultant 
the idea is to encourage safe banking by giving large depositors 
an incentive to put their money only into sound institutions 
reform proponents attribute at least part of the savings and loan 
crisis to the fact that depositors had little reason to care 
whether theyre institution was well or poorly run 
robert dugger chief economist of the banking group argued that 
the reform proposal would prevent banks and sampls from embarking on 
fastgrowth risky investment strategies the deposits wouldnt be 
available to do that 
also regulators because of the threat of deposit withdrawals 
would be forced to step in immediately when a bank fails 
minimizing the losses he said 
however others warn that tinkering with deposit insurance 
coverage could destabilize the financial system leaving it 
vulnerable to lightningquick runs 
the signal would pass that funds over 100000 are at risk i 
think that signal is potentially dangerous not only for little 
banks but for big banks said kenneth guenther executive vice 
president of a rival trade group representing smaller banks the 
independent bankers association of america 
the american bankers proposal approved by the groups board of 
directors and a 400member leadership conference is being 
forwarded to the treasury department which is studying deposit 
insurance 
treasurys recommendations due next february are expected to 
form the basis of major banking legislation in 1991 
deposit insurance was enacted in 1934 as part of the financial 
reforms put in place after the 1929 stock market crash and the wave 
of bank failures in the early 1930s

highways engineers and the legislature is considering a plan to 
give state troopers raises up to 7000 a year

holobaughs attorney said thursday it was not unusual for 
homosexual cadets to be removed from the rotc but he said this was 
the first case the aclu knew of where the army had asked for its 
scholarship money back 
at an informal hearing in december the army questioned whether 
holobaugh was masquerading as a homosexual to evade his service 
obligation rubenstein said after completing the rotc program 
students commissioned as officers must serve in the military for 
four years of active duty or eight years in reserves 
in january the army ruled that no evidence existed that 
holobaugh was trying to evade service rubenstein said 
nonetheless the army recommended against commissioning holobaugh 
and in favor of forcing him to reimburse the military for his 
scholarship 
the case is being reviewed by the commander of the us army 
second region at fort knox ky 
holobaugh was rated one of the top performers in his rotc class 
at washington university and was selected by the army to be in a 
nationwide advertising campaign to attract students 
it wasnt until late 1988 or early 1989 that he realized he was 
homosexual holobaugh said last april he sought the advice of a 
rotc captain who told him to tell the army he was homosexual then 
rather than wait until after his commission 
holobaugh said he was appalled at the prejudice in the 
military against homosexuals its kind of blowing my mind he 
said 
he said he wanted to be an army officer if he cannot be 
commissioned in the army he said i will without a doubt fight 
to not have to pay back my scholarship

a retired federal judge was appointed 
independent counsel to investigate allegations that former housing 
secretary samuel r pierce jr illegally showed political 
favoritism to developers a special court said friday 
arlin m adams 68 a philadelphia lawyer who served for 17 
years on the 3rd us circuit court of appeals was sworn in 
thursday as independent counsel to investigate the allegations 
against pierce and former aides at the department of housing and 
urban development 
the appointment made by the special threejudge panel was 
announced friday attorney general dick thornburgh had requested 
the appointment last month 
adams was given jurisdiction to investigate whether pierce or 
other hud employees had committed the crime of conspiracy to 
defraud the united states or any other federal crimes in the 
administration of the departments moderate rehabilitation program 
from 1984 through 1988 
the program qualified developers for lucrative rent subsidies 
and tax breaks for performing a moderate amount of repairs on 
lowincome housing units 
as a result of the hud scandals congress voted not to 
appropriate money for the program this year in 1989 congress had 
appropriated 225 million but hud secretary jack kemp suspended 
the disbursement of 167 million pending a review of the grant 
awards 
thornburghs request to the special court said that the justice 
departments preliminary inquiry had found reports of a 
widespread perception by developers and local officials that 
money was awarded in disproportionate amounts to projects backed 
by prominent republicans acting as consultants or by former hud 
officials 
adams said in an interview friday that he was already at work on 
the case in these assignments you start promptly and work very 
hard he said 
ive called on the fbi for assistance and i have begun to make 
arrangements for facilities in washington which will be my base 
and for staff adams said 
he declined to estimate how long the investigation will take 
saying there is no deadline 
robert plotkin one of pierces defense lawyers lauded the 
appointment saying we have every reason to expect that judge 
adams will conduct the investigation in a fair and impartial 
manner 
were glad that an independent counsel has been finally 
appointed and the investigation can proceed plotkin said 
pierce was hud secretary throughout the eight years of the 
reagan administration the only member of reagans cabinet to stay 
in office through both terms 
the attorney generals request for an independent counsel 
followed a preliminary inquiry by the justice departments public 
integrity section into allegations of favoritism that were 
presented by democratic members of the house judiciary committee 
the allegations were based on hearings conducted by the house 
government operations education and housing subcommittee into 
mismanagement at hud during pierces tenure 
thornburgh rejected the lawmakers request for an independent 
counsel to investigate allegations that pierce had lied under oath 
when he denied having hands on involvement in running the 
moderate rehabilitation program 
pierce was called back to testify on two other occasions but 
refused to answer questions invoking his fifth amendment privilege 
against selfincrimination 
rep tom lantos dcalif who chaired last years congressional 
hearings on hud welcomed the appointment saying he will meet with 
adams next wednesday in washington to discuss the probe 
as pennsylvania secretary of public welfare from 1963 to 1966 
adams said he examined alleged misuse of government programs 
in a statement the special division of the us circuit court 
of appeals here said that adams brings to this investigation the 
judgment experience and ability acquired by many years of service 
as a federal circuit judge as a private practitioner and as a 
recognized leader of the courts and the bar of the nation 
frank keating general counsel at hud also praised the 
appointment and pledged that the department would cooperate with 
the investigation 
a republican adams chaired richard nixons pennsylvania 
presidential campaign in 1968 a year later as president nixon 
apponted adams to the 3rd circuit where he sat until 1986 
adams was also considered for supreme court appointments by both 
nixon and president ford 
in 1988 adams rejected overtures to be deputy attorney general 
in the last days of the tenure of thenattorney general edwin meese

irancontra prosecutors moved friday to stop a 
court appeal by richard secord until a lower court judge decides 
whether to reinstate 11 other criminal charges against him 
secord a retired air force major general pleaded guilty nov 8 
to making a false statement when he told congressional 
investigators he was unaware of any money that went to benefit 
oliver north 
but secord announced his intention to appeal after his 
sentencing jan 24 and the government says he is trying to 
circumvent his plea agreement with the government under that plea 
agreement the government agreed not to pursue 11 other criminal 
charges against secord 
the appeal is based on a contention by secords lawyers that 
independent counsel lawrence walsh lacks jurisdiction to prosecute 
for an offense arising out of secords testimony to congress 
irancontra prosecutors feb 5 asked us district court judge 
aubrey robinson to reconsider his decision dismissing the 11 other 
charges 
while the district court has before it important questions 
relating to the effectiveness of the plea agreement in this case 
the appeals court proceedings should be stopped prosecutors said 
in a court filing 
secord agrees the appeal should be suspended until the lower 
court rules said the court filing 
the government has said it is an act of bad faith to plead 
guilty with the undisclosed intent of challenging the validity of 
the plea 
secord who was placed on two years probation paid for a 
13800 security system at norths home out of proceeds from the 
enterprise 
the enterprise was the network of offshore companies and secret 
accounts which secord and business partner albert hakim used to 
move money in the irancontra affair 
the 11 other charges against secord included obstruction and 
perjury counts based on his testimony to congress

federal task forces to crack down on people 
who violate federal gun laws calling for mandatory prison sentences 
will be launched in eight cities later this month officials said 
friday 
the project achilles task forces will be in place by march 26 in 
new york philadelphia los angeles chicago miami detroit 
washington and phoenix said bureau of alcohol tobacco and 
firearms spokeswoman dot koester 
the atf conducted a similar fourmonth armed career criminal 
operation in washington last year as a prelude to the upcoming 
project and made quite an impact she said 
in addition to making numerous arrests because they kept 
hitting certain areas again and again the neighborhood people 
started coming out and cheering the agents on koester said 
out of that developed a hotline which the neighbors then used 
to call us when something was going on she said it created a 
whole new interest in the neighborhoods where we went 
the neighbors she said would invite the agents in for 
coffee after they made their raids 
congress last year included 45 million in the atfs budget for 
1990 specifically as salaries for 75 fulltime workers in the 
achilles task forces in five cities but the atf expanded that 
number to eight said a spokesman for sen dennis deconcini 
dariz who chairs the senate appropriations subcommittee on 
treasury postal service and general government 
the agents will work with state and local law enforcement 
officials 
the task forces working for the armed career criminal program 
will be targeting people under two sections of federal law that 
call for mandatory sentencing 
one says anyone convicted of a felony crime of violence or drug 
charge who is carrying a gun automatically is sentenced for at 
least five years on the weaponpossession charge 
the other section says that a person who has three previous 
felony convictions for a violent crime or drug offense will be 
sentenced to at least 15 years on the firearm charge 
the task forces are being launched at the same time that atf 
faces cutbacks under the bush administrations proposed 1991 budget 
of 185 positions created by the 1990 anticrime initiative 
the cutbacks will be required because of the need to offset 
administratively uncontrolled overtime pay and inflation according 
to deconcinis spokesman who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
to cope with the additional expenses the atf is proposing to 
reduce firearmslaw enforcement personnel not specifically 
connected to drug cases by 122 people next year according to 
congressional documents

chancellor helmut kohls government on 
friday offered an eventual treaty guaranteeing polands western 
border after german reunification but said poland must abandon any 
claims to war reparations 
such a pact also would be linked to polands pledge to protect 
the rights of its german minority according to west german 
government spokesman dieter vogel 
polish premier tadeusz mazowiecki said he was especially 
astonished that the question of the german minority has been 
brought up we have settled this matter and we keep our word 
in his his remarks on west german television the premier added 
there are mutual obligations here which also concern the polish 
minority in germany 
earlier polish government spokeswoman malgorzata niezabitowska 
told polish television news poland did not wish to link the 
problem of treaty regulation of the border on the oder and the 
neisse with any other problems 
but if the west german side wishes to broaden these subjects 
we will raise the problem of compensations for over a million 
polish citizens who were forced to work in the third reich during 
world war ii she said 
kohl has come under intense criticism abroad and at home for his 
stance on lands east of the oder and neisse rivers ceded to poland 
after nazi germanys 1945 defeat 
poland wants reassurance that a reunited germany will not seek 
to reclaim those lands which make up onethird of presentday 
poland 
kohl repeatedly has said germans have no designs on that 
property but has insisted that legally speaking final say can 
only come from a future united german government 
kohl has been reluctant to run the risk of angering 
archconservative voters needed to help his christian democrats win 
reelection in federal elections this december 
but at the same time his statements have drawn negative 
responses in poland and a number of other countries including the 
united states the soviet union france and britain 
kohl for the first time on friday openly said a treaty would be 
possible recognizing polands western border after a united germany 
government comes into being 
but at the same time he demanded that polands 1953 decision on 
war reparations be an element of such agreement as well as 
polands assurance last year that the ethnic rights of its german 
minority would be guaranteed 
in the statement delivered by vogel kohl again carefully 
avoided stating outright that a united germany would never lay 
claim to land ceded to poland 
according to vogel kohl reiterated his support for both german 
parliaments passing an identical declaration pledging to respect 
the current borders after east germany elects its first freely 
chosen parliament on march 18 
vogel said such a declaration must at the same time make clear 
that the aug 23 1953 declaration of the polish government in 
which reparations against germany are renounced continues 
unchanged 
the western powers ended reparation collections from west 
germany in 1952 the soviet union did the same for fellow communist 
state east germany a year later while poland said it too would 
not seek reparations 
vogel said that on the basis of such a border resolution by the 
german parliaments a treaty between an overall german government 
with the polish government should be concluded and be ratified by a 
united german parliament 
in poland meanwhile hundreds of people demonstrated in several 
cities thursday and friday to support mazowieckis demand that 
poland be allowed to take part in international talks on a reunited 
germany 
poland says in order to win an ironclad guarantee of its western 
border it needs access to the socalled twoplusfour talks 
involving west germany and east germany as well as the united 
states soviet union britain and france 
in madrid west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher 
reiterated that the borders of a reunified germany would be those 
fixed at the end of world war ii 
we have no claims as far as poland is concerned not now or in 
the future genscher said 
genscher in madrid to allay spanish concerns about plans for 
german unification also said he and kohl were in total accord 
on the issue 
in washington state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
said secretary of state james a baker iii sent a letter to all 
nato foreign ministers inviting their views on german reunification 
as you know all of us have agreed that germanys continued 
membership in nato including participation in natos integrated 
military structure and the continued commitment of nato forces to 
the security of germany is of enduring importance to stability and 
security throughout europe she said

the publisher of a las vegas newspaper seeking 
to form a joint operating agreeement with its competitor sought 
friday to prevent the disclosure of its advertising and circulation 
revenues by the justice department 
donrey of nevada inc publisher of the las vegas 
reviewjournal asked attorney general dick thornburgh to 
reconsider his feb 16 order requiring the newspaper to publicly 
disclose its advertising and circulation revenues 
donrey owned by the closely held donrey media group submitted 
the figures ordered by thornburgh but they were placed under seal 
pending a ruling on the companys request they be kept private 
thornburgh who rules on requests for joint operating 
agreements had given the company until friday to submit the data 
donrey is seeking a partial merger of the reviewjournal with 
the las vegas sun under the antitrust exemptions provided in the 
newspaper preservation act 
both newspapers say that the sun owned by the sun co is in 
probable danger of financial failure and therefore should be 
allowed to merge its production and commercial departments with the 
reviewjournal 
donrey argued there is much financial information already on the 
public record to document the suns claim of impending financial 
trouble without disclosing statistical detail about the inner 
workings of the reviewjournal 
access to the aggregate revenue data coupled with the data in 
the record and the information available generally about the 
economics of the newspaper business would enable a competitor or 
potential competitor to make a close approximation of the single 
most sensitive piece of intelligence about a closely held company 
its profits the companys lawyers said in a legal brief 
an affidavit signed by fred w smith president of donrey media 
group said public disclosure of such information would be 
detrimental and damaging to donrey in its relationships with 
customers suppliers and labor unions and would provide an unfair 
advantage to its competitors not only in the las vegas market but 
in the other 73 markets in 21 states in which donrey operates

put the heads into bags and sent them to the provincial army 
commander in concepcion 12 miles northwest of huancayo they also 
sent weapons and propaganda confiscated from the rebels 
military officials in concepcion would not comment 
the civil defense groups called rondas are organized by 
the army to defend remote villages from guerrilla incursions often 
the peasants are armed only with crude weapons and are no match for 
the guerrillas many of whom carry automatic weapons and explosives 
many of the peasant groups complain they receive little support 
from the army confrontations between the rondas and rebels have 
become more frequent in recent months and dozens have been killed 
on both sides 
the shining path says it wants to create a workerpeasant state 
patterned on the ideas of mao tsetung but in its 10 years of 
armed struggle it has not gained wide support among perus peasants 
police said the villagers in comas and cochas complained the 
rebels had been harassing them stealing their food and ordering 
them to stop shipping farm produce to the cities 
part of the rebels announced strategy is to choke off food 
shipments from the huancayo region perus breadbasket to the 
population centers on the coast mainly the capital city of lima 
and its port callao 
the shining path guerrillas began fighting to overthrow perus 
elected governments in 1980 launching its first attack in the 
southern andes highlands 
the rebels now operate through most of the andes and the 
cocaproducing jungles of the northeast where drug traffickers pay 
them for permission to operate 
the guerrillas also occasionally launch attacks in lima and 
other cities along the coast where the majority of peruvians live

a oneday nationwide strike called by two 
banned political parties to press demands for multiparty democracy 
ended friday with little of the violence that marked earlier 
protests 
the strike was the second called by the nepali congress party 
and the communist party of nepal since they began their campaign 
feb 18 for restoration of a multiparty system in the national 
assembly 
staterun radio reported that life was almost normal in the 
himalayan kingdom but did not elaborate 
in katmandu riot police patrolled the nearly deserted streets 
of the capital shops were closed and students stayed away from 
school 
buses leaving katmandu were escorted by armed police in jeeps 
but few passengers traveled buses coming into the capital were 
halfempty 
witnesses said demonstrators set a car on fire downtown and 
smashed the windshields of some stateowned buses during the 
protest but there were no other reports of violence 
a oneday strike called by the banned parties on feb 19 led to 
violence throughout the country and several people were killed 
the government says at least 12 people have died in clashes 
between police and demonstrators since the protest campaign began 
last month opposition activists say the death toll is nearly 
double the government figure 
the government is bent upon unleashing widespread violence to 
provoke the peaceful demonstrators like they did on feb 19 
ganesh man singh a top nepali congress party leader who is under 
house arrest said in a telephone interview 
a home ministry statement said the government would never lag 
behind legal action against those who attempt to disrupt public 
life 
it said communist extremists have been active in the protest 
campaign 
the banned parties are demanding the lifting of a 29yearold 
royal decree that prohibits all of the political parties in the 
kingdom one of the worlds oldest monarchies 
membershiop in the national assembly known as the rashtriya 
panchayat is nonpartisan 
nepals twoyear experiment with westernstyle democracy ended 
in 1961 when king mahendra father of the present monarch king 
birendra dissolved the government of the nepali congress party 
accusing it of corruption and poor administration 
the government of king birendra says the campaign to lift the 
ban on political parties runs counter to a 1980 referendum that 
narrowly retained the rashtriya panchayats system of nonpartisan 
membership 
it also says the country already has its own form of democracy 
and does not need a multiparty system 
power in nepal is shared between the king and the assembly 
onefifth of the panchayats 140 members are nominated by the king 
and the rest are elected

joseph hazelwoods flu forced 
postponement of his trial friday while prosecutors petitioned the 
judge to reject the exxon valdez skippers claim that evidence 
about his ships potential sinking is irrelevant 
lawyers defending hazelwood on criminal charges stemming from 
the nations worst oil spill have contended it was impossible for 
the skipper to move his giant tanker off a reef once it was impaled 
thus they say it makes no difference whether he tried to move 
it they seek to bar evidence on what might have happened if the 
ship moved 
expert witnesses have speculated that the ship could have sunk 
but the state has not yet offered specifics the prosecution wants 
to present the results of accident simulations it conducted to show 
scientifically why the tanker was in danger of capsizing or sinking 
friday morning the judge summoned jurors told them of 
hazelwoods illness and ordered them to be especially careful to 
avoid news reports on the case during the weekend recess lawyers 
said hazelwood should be ready to resume monday 
it seems were missing the star player captain hazelwood has 
the flu attorney dick madson told superior court judge karl 
johnstone he reported that hazelwood got dressed to go to court 
but felt too sick to leave his hotel room 
the 43yearold hazelwood from huntington ny is charged with 
criminal mischief reckless endangerment operating a vessel while 
intoxicated and negligent discharge of oil he could receive 7 
years in prison and fines of 61000 
the exxon valdez ran aground on bligh reef on march 24 spilling 
11 million gallons of crude oil into prince william sound killing 
countless birds fish and other marine animals and blackening 
hundreds of miles of rocky shoreline 
on friday johnstone told lawyers to begin thinking about jury 
instructions in the case although he said the trials end might be 
two to three weeks away 
assistant district attorney brent cole then said he was filing a 
legal memorandum asking johnstone to admit testimony that the exxon 
valdez might have sunk if hazelwood had succeeded in moving the 
grounded tanker 
captain hazelwood is arguing that because it was impossible 
for the exxon valdez to come free there was no risk involved 
said the memorandum but it argued that the defense reliance on 
the impossibility doctrine was misplaced 
the issue is not whether it was possible for the vessel to 
come free but whether captain hazelwoods mistakes in not 
realizing the vessel was firmly aground and not recognizing the 
danger in refloating were reasonable the document said 
it argued that hazelwood made a mistake in thinking he could 
remove the impaled tanker from bligh reef 
in fact the vessel would have sunk had captain hazelwood been 
successful cole argued 
a parade of prosecution experts testified this week that 
hazelwoods orders in the hour after the disaster indicated he was 
trying to drive the tanker back into the sea the skippers lawyers 
maintain he was trying to stabilize the vessel on the reef 
the spill of crude oil killed countless birds fish and other 
marine animals and blackened hundreds of miles of rocky shoreline 
the prosecution memo suggested that hazelwoods intent would be 
a key issue in the jurys deliberations 
the state agrees that it was not captain hazelwoods intent to 
damage property of another when he tried to remove the vessel 
said the document however at the time he was attempting to 
remove the vessel he had sufficient information to know that such 
action would risk damaging property of another 
to be found guilty of second degree criminal mischief the 
felony the jury must determine that hazelwood recklessly risked 
the property of another in an amount exceeding 100000

relatives of some of the 15000 captive 
polish officers killed at katyn and elsewhere in the soviet union 
in world war ii demonstrated at the soviet embassy friday demanding 
the truth about the deaths 
soviet ambassador vladimir brovikov met with a threemember 
delegation from about 40 relatives of the katyn victims who 
gathered outside the embassy gates they gave him a letter 
demanding to know how the soldiers died 
we were received very kindly the ambassador expressed 
understanding for the families and said the katyn crime had to 
be explained thoroughly said zdzislaw dyduch one of the three 
delegates his father died at katyn 
the killing is believed to have taken place at the end of april 
or early may 1940 the demonstration friday was in preparation for 
the 50th anniversary 
the katyn massacre was long blamed officially on nazi germany 
although most poles believed it was carried out by the soviet 
secret police 
the officers had been interned at three camps in the soviet 
union after poland was partioned between nazi germany and the 
soviet union early in the war 
an official panel of polish historians agreed last year with the 
popular conclusion of soviet guilt a parallel group of soviet 
historians has made no public assessment saying it lacks proof 
the invading german army found the remains of about 4300 polish 
officers at katyn near smolensk in 1943 nazi germany immediately 
made the crime public for propaganda purposes 
the final resting place of the remaining officers who had been 
held at two other camps is unknown to this day 
we would like to discover the truth and for them to admit what 
they have done and apologize said demonstrator krystyna 
kryszkowiak whose father was interned at ostaszkow 
relatives of the murdered officers have formed an organization 
called the katyn family which has about 1000 members in warsaw 
alone 
we feel moral satisfaction that at least we can talk about it 
openly now said maria osieja whose father was killed at katyn 
it is only a pity that my mother did not live to witness this

southern california earthquake triggered rock slides onto a 
mountain road forced evacuation of a college dormitory and jarred 
already tense nerves 
the morning tremor which measured 47 on the richter scale was 
widely felt in los angeles riverside san bernardino and san diego 
counties it also shook orange county three hours before president 
bush delivered an antidrug address there 
it was scary and im shaking but nothing fell or flew this 
time said melina manning of ontario two miles south of the 
epicenter near upland which is 35 miles east of los angeles 
it was mild compared to the other day but very scary 
especially because your nerves are shot from the other day ms 
manning said 
in addition to the big aftershock which struck at 926 am at 
least two other noticeable temblors were recorded friday according 
to scientists at the california institute of technology in pasadena 
they measured 25 and 24 on the richter scale and were among 
dozens of aftershocks to rattle southern california since 
wednesday when the region was hit by a 55magnitude quake 
centered three miles northwest of upland 
wednesdays quake the biggest to hit the region in more than 
two years toppled scores of chimneys shattered hundreds of 
windows and collapsed one buildings wall nobody was killed but 
the big quake did at least 127 million in damage in the largely 
residential region that straddles the los angeles and san 
bernardino county lines east of the city 
fridays tremor caused rock slides that closed two sections of 
littletraveled mount baldy road in the mountains about 35 miles

primary exports surged friday in london and new york exchanges as 
traders worried about the unrest and fears of a general strike

faced since he took control of this nation of 11 million when it 
gained independence from france in 1960

a few armed soldiers and police stood about but no violence was 
seen 
the government accused an unidentified group of individuals 
of spreading trouble and said students responsible for

that has grown over the past 10 years 
the recession came with slumping prices of cocoa ivory coasts 
main export the ivory coast is the worlds largest producer of 
cocoa and fifthlargest producer of coffee

officials and corruption they are demanding the repatriation of 
millions of dollars they charge have been skimmed from state 
coffers and banked abroad 
a similar call was made this week by the general union of 
workers the usually docile federation is affiliated with the 
ruling democratic party but is posing unprecedented opposition to 
the proposals to cut civil servants salaries by 15 percent to 40 
percent and increase a tax on all wage earners from 1 percent to 11 
percent 
the civil servant strike has put even more pressure on 
houphouetboigny who already had postponed from friday to monday a 
national council meeting to discuss the austerity measures 
world bank officials say the government has little choice but to 
carry them out in addition to a foreign debt of 12 billion 
unserviced since 1987 the government has run up an internal debt 
of more than 14 million

american business leaders said friday they 
expected no major breakthrough on contentious trade issues in the 
weekend talks between president bush and japanese prime minister 
toshiki kaifu 
however they held out hope that the discussions could set the 
stage for a fullfledged trade summit between the two leaders later 
in the year 
the hastily arranged two days of talks between bush and kaifu in 
palm springs calif were being viewed by many industry officials 
as a promising development for separate trade talks which had 
bogged down in recent weeks 
the talks known as the structural impediments initiative aimed 
to attack the underlying causes of the huge 49 billion trade 
imbalance between america and japan by dealing with such areas as 
japans exclusionary business practices and americas low savings 
rate 
however the discussions so far have produced no movement and 
american negotiators were openly pessimistic about the chances of 
success following the conclusion of the third round of talks last 
week in tokyo 
economists of all persuasions and the bush administation agree 
that even if japan eliminated all restrictive practices about which 
the united states has complained most of the 49 billion imbalance 
would remain because of the american appetite for japanese cars 
electronic equipment and other goods 
jerry jasinowski president of the national association of 
manufacturers the largest trade group for us manufacturing 
companies said bush deserved a lot of credit for trying to get the 
stalled discussions back on track 
bush has put his prestige on the line to emphasize the 
importance of these talks jasinowski said we were dead in the 
water and this is an opportunity to breathe some life back into the 
effort 
jasinowski said that while the meeting between bush and kaifu 
was not expected to resolve any of the major issues between the two 
countries it would serve to highlight the importance both leaders 
saw in making progress 
he said kaifu may offer at the session to appoint a highlevel 
official of his government to oversee the discussions in japan and 
to coordinate responses in the massive japanese bureaucracy 
he said another possible outcome was agreement by both bush and 
kaifu to meet again in the fall for a longer session examining the 
whole range of trade disputes between the two countries 
separately from the summit in addition to the review of 
underlying trade barriers there are talks about specific products 
which the bush administration has charged are being unfairly 
restricted these talks cover american lumber products 
supercomputers and satellites 
john swenson a spokesman for cray research inc the leading 
manufacturer of supercomputers said his company had heard of no 
breakthrough in the discussion on supercomputers 
a congressional source who spoke on condition that his name not 
be used said that kaifu was expected to announce on saturday lower 
tariffs on a portion of us finished wood products although the 
reduction would cover only a small portion of us lumber sales to 
japan 
william archey top trade expert at the us chamber of 
commerce said that kaifu would be following the pattern of past 
japanese leaders if he offered small concessions in trade 
the historical approach of other japanese heads of government 
has been to offer these limited morsels we then get excited 
because they threw us a nibble he said 
pressure is growing in congress to see results in the japanese 
discussions 
senate finance committee chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas in a 
letter to bush last week urged the president to press kaifu 
with all the formidable persuasion at your command to open the 
japanese market 
sen max baucus dmont and the chairman of a senate trade 
subcommittee prepared legislation that would force the 
administration to retaliate if there has been no progress by the 
june 16 deadline in the talks covering wood supercomputers and 
satellites 
baucus scheduled a hearing of his subcommittee for monday at 
which time various administration witnesses were scheduled to 
appear to report on the developments in the discussion to date

four days of talks ended in failure friday 
between representatives of breakaway turkish cypriots and the greek 
cypriot government and the turks claimed the other side was not 
serious about a settlement 
turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash told reporters that 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar found out after four days 
of unsponsored direct talks that both sides are not ready to 
proceed on these talks because of several difficulties 
denktash said his demand for selfdetermination for the turkish 
cypriots on the northern part of the mediterranean island was not 
why the talks collapsed 
he called that an excuse created by the greek cypriot side 
led by cypriot president george vassiliou 
the same game which has been played over the years having 
talks continuing talks and then destroying it and saying the 
turks are guilty denktash said 
earlier vassiliou reported no progress in the talks when asked 
if the talks were near collapse he responded by saying did the 
talks start 
the two sides have met four times since the first round of talks 
under un auspices in august 1988 
cyprus has been divided since the turkish army invaded in 1974 
following a shortlived athensbacked coup by supporters of union 
with greece the turks seized the northern third of the island 
the general assembly has recognized the greek cypriot side as 
cyprus legitimate government only turkey recognizes the breakaway 
turkish cypriot region

a lawyer representing 7yearold 
hilary foretich the american girl caught up in an international 
custody battle obtained an injunction friday to prevent broadcast 
of a tv documentary on her 
in washington a threejudge appeals court panel ruled friday 
that hilarys mother plastic surgeon elizabeth morgan can have 
her passport back so she can come here to fight a lawsuit filed by 
her former husband 
morgan went to prison for 25 months for refusing to reveal 
hilarys whereabouts and refusing to comply with a court order 
allowing the father dentist eric foretich unsupervised visits 
with his daughter 
morgan contended that the girl was sexually abused by foretich 
during their marriage he denied it and claimed morgan was mentally 
ill morgan and foretich separated before hilary was born 
christchurch lawyer peter woolley said he asked the high court 
to bar the tv program from being broadcast on instructions from 
isobel mitchell the lawyer appointed to represent hilarys 
interests 
television new zealand tvnz has not decided whether it will 
appeal the decision that kept it from presenting hilarys in 
hiding on friday night on its foreign correspondent program 
in granting the temporary injunction the judge ruled that 
showing the tv documentary could amount to a case of invasion of 
privacy 
he noted that the application for an injunction was supported by 
an affidavit from foretich who is now in new zealand 
i look with some degree of suspicion as to what is said by 
either parent at this present stage in relation to this dispute 
where it appears that both parents have for some years participated 
in a public exposure to the news media of allegations and 
counterallegations in their disputed claims for custody of the 
plaintiff hilary the judge said 
foretich traced his daughter to christchurch last week the girl 
has been living there with her maternal grandparents for nearly two 
years and attending school under the assumed name of ellen morgan 
the district of columbia court of appeals panel released 
morgans pasport on friday freeing her to travel to new zealand to 
visit hilary 
superior court judge herbert dixon had seized the passport in 
august 1987 when he jailed morgan for failing to reveal hilarys 
whereabouts 
on thursday dixon said he was satisfied the return of the 
passport was in the best interests of the little girl he 
noted however that morgan remained in contempt of court

heavy coffee drinking especially by men 
increases the risk of dying from heart disease according to a 
norwegian study published friday in the british medical journal 
the study of 38564 men and women by the national health 
screening service in norway found that coffee drinking by men was 
significantly related to death from coronary heart disease 
even after allowing for other important risk factors such as heavy 
smoking and high blood pressure 
women were at risk but to a lesser extent the researchers said 
heavy coffee drinkers had higher levels of cholesterol than 
those who drank moderately but the researchers concluded that 
coffee may affect mortality from coronary heart disease over and 
above its effects in raising cholesterol concentrations 
the norwegian researchers studied 19398 men and 19166 women 
ages 35 to 54 from 1977 to 1982 they reported no symptoms of 
cardiovascular disease or diabetes and later were followed until 
the end of 1986 
during the followup period 168 men and 16 women died of 
coronary heart disease the researchers said 
of the men 130 drank between five and nine cups of coffee a 
day there were six deaths among men who drank one or two cups a 
day and three deaths among men who drank less than one cup the 
study found 
among women the researchers said an excess risk was found only 
for those who drank seven or more cups of coffee every day 
the researchers said the major uncertainty in previous studies 
has been whether the apparent relation between coffee and death 
from coronary heart disease might be caused by lifestyle 
a related study showed that dietary habits and lifestyle could 
not explain the association of coffee and cholesterol the 
researchers said a followup study relating dietary habits and 
lifestyle to death from coronary heart disease has not yet been 
done 
we conclude that coffee consumption is fairly strongly related 
to death from coronary heart disease but a potential causal role 
is weakened by the varying strength of the relation in different 
groups the researchers said 
to verify the observed effect of coffee on deaths from 
coronary heart disease over and above the effect on cholesterol 
concentration cholesterol concentration must be determined more 
accurately than by a single measurement they said 
the researchers from the national health screening service were

the savannah river nuclear weapons plant in 
south carolina is inadequately protected against severe earthquakes 
and wont be fully protected for several years federal auditors 
said friday 
the report by the general accounting office the investigative 
arm of congress said the vulnerability to earthquake damage at 
savannah river has been known for many years but it said the 
government only recently made serious corrective efforts 
the plant situated along the savannah river near aiken has 
nuclear reactors to produce tritium a radioactive gas needed to 
make nuclear warheads the installation also contains other 
nuclearrelated buildings including a fuel processing center for 
the navy and a radioactive waste treatment building 
the three reactors have been closed for nearly two years because 
of safety problems one of the three is expected to resume 
production by the end of this year 
the auditors in a report requested by rep mike synar dokla 
chairman of the house government operations subcommittee on the 
environment and energy said seismic improvements at savannah river 
would not be completed for several years 
planning of improvements is under way but it will take 
several years to accomplish adequate seismic protection at savannah 
river the report said 
numerous systems and structures in the reactors and other 
nuclear facilities may not withstand the worst earthquake 
reasonably expected at the site and in the event of such an 
earthquake could threaten employees and the public with releases 
of radiation the report said 
catherine kaliniak an energy department spokeswoman said the 
department had not seen the report and would not comment until it 
had reviewed the conclusions 
the earthquake potential at savannah river is based mainly on 
the fact that a large earthquake estimated to have been the 
equivalent of about 7 on the richter scale occurred in south 
carolina in 1886 it was centered about 80 miles from where the 
weapons plant now stands and it caused extensive damage and loss 
of life 
the san francisco earthquake last october was measured at about 
71 on the richter scale 
each whole number increase on the richter scale means an ground 
motion increase by a factor of 10

people gathered friday at fowles soda 
and cigar could say this much about their two decades of opposition 
to the seabrook nuclear power plant popular sentiment doesnt 
always win but it dies hard 
its frustrating to fight the odds but we think of the 
children and then keep on said david macwhinnie a longtime 
resident who stopped off at the store friday to reminisce about 
past battles over the plant 6 miles up the coast and wonder what 
the future holds 
over the years a vocal core of citizens in about a halfdozen 
cities clustered around the new hampshire border have signed 
petitions held bake sales and marched against the plant 
but despite their protests the nuclear regulatory commission 
approved licensing for the reactor 
the federal panels longawaited decision thursday came as no 
surprise to residents here some have supported the facility whose 
startup is 11 years behind schedule and the promise of clean and 
efficient energy for 1 million homes 
the government wants to do it so we have to put up with it 
said everett bridges 87 
for others the fight continues opponents including officials 
of the state of massachusetts have pledged to appeal the decision 
in the courts 
we never got a vote or any influence said jane wickers one 
of a few dozen regulars gathered for morning coffee at fowles a 
fixture here since 1940 you start to feel like you cant make 
any difference but youve got to try 
people around here say they dont regard themselves as the 
protesting kind they live quietly in old coastal towns where 
boarded up ice cream stands are part of the offseason charm 
no one much wants to get arrested or stand with picket signs in 
the shadow of seabrook which is perched on a bluff over one of 
several popular summertime beaches 
but many citizens have joined the clamshell alliance and have 
been united since the early 1970s behind an antinuclear banner 
they say the government hasnt established an effective evacuation 
plan and fear there would be chaos on the narrow streets out of 
town if a nuclear emergency occurred 
seabrook has been the acid test for the national agenda for 
nuclear power said james dougherty a vocal newburyport realtor 
and father of two we are the caretakers of our own safety 
we have to keep driving the issue 
seabrook was proposed in 1972 as a twinreactor plant costing 
less than 1 billion construction delays and cost increases forced 
the cancellation of one reactor in the mid1980s and plunged lead 
owner public service co of new hampshire into bankruptcy 
reorganization in 1988 
the plant became a symbol of the antinuclear movement and its 
foes claimed a broader victory contending that no utility would 
now risk the costs of trying to build and open another nuclear 
plant 
in the early going a lot of area residents saw a silver lining 
in the seabrook plan there was talk of new jobs lower taxes and 
cheaper energy 
and some people still stand by those things 
i live right here on the beach said diane burke of 
seabrook nh i prospered when the nuke was being built and i 
think a lot of locals felt that was good i still dont really see 
the problem 
burke and other proponents said they might feel differently if 
an accident occurred but for now theyre willing to wait and see 
diehard opponents said however they would not willing to 
concede defeat despite the nrcs decision massachusetts attorney 
general james shannon has promised to take the activists case to 
the courts 
its begun to wear people down life has to go on you cant 
just keep picketing said marie capello a seabrook resident 
but she said she would probably end up doing just that 
weve been trying to buck something so big and so powerful 
not only the plant itself but all the mucketymucks who run it 
she said but i dont see how i can stop doing any little thing 
until the bitter end

former republican sen lowell p weicker 
jr the maverick lawmaker who made a career of bucking his party 
and championing liberal causes said friday he would run for 
governor of connecticut as an independent 
youre going to get one hell of a race declared the former 
threeterm senator i think im going to win it i dont think 
its any gamble at all 
weicker 58 told reporters supporters and onlookers in a 
packed capitol conference room that his unsuccessful bid for a 
fourth senate term in 1988 took me down a peg or two and probably 
deservedly so ive taken my licks 
its now 1990 and i believe that as never before we need 
each other he said 
the announcement capped weeks of intense speculation about 
weicker who in 28 years of political activity cultivated a 
reputation for aggressive independent republicanism 
he became a national figure in the mid70s as one of the first 
republicans to take on president richard m nixon during the 
watergate scandal 
weicker would say nothing negative about democratic gov william 
a oneill or rep bruce a anderson a fourterm congressman 
challenging oneill for the democratic gubernatorial nomination 
nor would he criticize any of the four republicans now in the 
running 
weicker was elected to the senate in 1970 in a threeway race in 
which the democrats were badly split of his bid to make it a 
threeway race in the november election he said the ironies are 
not lost on me i can assure you 
weicker said he expects hell need campaign funds of 1 million 
or 2 million less than half of what the other major party 
candidates are talking about spending the greenwich millionaire 
said he wouldnt spend any of his own money on the race 
democrats hailed his decision to run saying it would divide the 
gop and throw the party into chaos state gop chairman richard 
foley said that with weickers announcement the race is over we 
just won but his voice didnt carry conviction

here is a look at greyhound lines inc the dallasbased company 
that operates the only nationwide bus system the companys 6300 
drivers are on strike principally over wage issues 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
greyhound lines inc is the descendant of a bus operation that 
began in 1914 when swedish immigrant carl eric wickman established 
the jitney line in hibbing minn charging 25 cents for a round 
trip on the companys lone hubmobile between hibbing and the alice 
saloon 
the current company was formed in 1987 through a leveraged 
buyout of the bus operations of phoenixbased greyhound corp fred 
g currey a career bus executive led an investment group that 
paid 270 million for greyhound four months later curreys gli 
holding inc bought trailways lines inc of dallas for 80 million 
and merged the two bus lines 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
most of the companys 11825 employees are represented by the 
striking amalgamated council of greyhound local unions the union 
has all 6300 drivers plus 1660 office workers and 1475 
maintenance workers there are another 690 maintenance employees 
represented by the international association of machinists who 
agreed to a fouryear contract last fall the united auto workers 
also represents employees at the companys eagle bus manufacturing 
inc in brownsville texas there are 1700 employees not subject 
to collective bargaining 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the main issue revolves around pay before curreys group bought 
the company in 1987 the union agreed to a 22 percent wage cut 
although the company says its drivers are the highest paid in the 
industry except for some small regional companies in the northeast 
the company says drivers averaged 24743 in 1989 a 1080 
increase over 1987 the 1500 highest paid averaged 33218 and its 
highest paid driver made 48800 
greyhound says its offer would give drivers a 141 million or 
69 percent raise in the first year and 135 percent over the life 
of the 3year contract 
the union says those figures are misleading because of the 
inclusion of incentive bonuses the union claims its offer would 
cost 17 million in the first year and 15 million each of the next 
two years the company however says the unions offer would cost 
more than 200 million 
other issues involve pension plan contributions and regional 
pay rates for mechanics

spend 103 million over the next three years to upgrade equipment 
and terminal operations capital expenditures have totaled 183

the justice department filed a 
sexdiscrimination lawsuit thursday to try to force the allmale 
virginia military institute to admit women 
federal authorities filed the lawsuit on behalf of an 
unidentified female high school student from northern virginia who 
complained last spring that she had been prohibited from attending 
the 150yearold statesupported school in nearby lexington 
the lawsuit argues that the schools maleonly admission policy 
violates the civil rights act and the 14th amendment it urges the 
us district court in roanoke to order the state of virginia and 
the school to remedy fully their discriminatory policies and 
practices 
the justice department also is reviewing complaints from two 
women who want to attend the citadel in charleston sc the 
nations only other public military college that admits males only 
among those named in the lawsuit were virginia gov l douglas 
wilder and the state council of higher education along with the 
institutes superintendent john w knapp and board of visitors 
president joseph m spivey 
the justice department wrote wilder and knapp last march warning 
them they would face a lawsuit if they did not agree by feb 20 to 
begin admitting women 
but state attorney general mary sue terry and the schools 
private fundraising organization came back with two lawsuits 
asking the federal court in roanoke to declare the colleges 
admission policy constitutional 
the justice department also filed motions thursday asking the 
court to dismiss the lawsuits filed by the state and the foundation 
spokesman tom joynes said school officials would have no comment 
on the federal governments action the governors and state 
attorney generals offices both declined to comment 
the lawsuit said the institute is a public body and the 
defendants have engaged in discrimination on the basis of sex by 
refusing to consider qualified females for admission to the 
fouryear undergraduate degree program 
the institute received 11 million in state aid this year 
almost half of its 25 million budget 
congress decided in 1976 to begin admitting women to the federal 
service academies 
all of the schools 1200 cadets live in a threestory dormitory 
in spartan rooms with standardized cots shelves and desks they 
wake to reveille and shower in common stalls freshmen referred to 
as rats by other students go through a years initiation of 
psychological and physical pressure 
the vmi foundation lawsuit argued that the forced admission of 
women will eliminate the option of a unique undergraduate 
experience for men while providing no increased educational 
opportunities for women

crack cocaine dealers have put out 
a 10000 contract to kill antidrug crusader cw roddy a 
60yearold woman shot in an attack at her home new years day the 
fbi said friday 
roddy who has been speaking out against drugs at schools and 
urging police to rid her neighborhood of crack dealers said she 
asked the fbi to make the latest threat public 
the small woman defiantly refused to move from her home and 
promised to continue fighting drug dealers 
i have no fear i am concerned but i am not fearful roddy 
said at the fbi news conference in front of city hall it wont 
do them any good to kill me 
there are people in the community and the surrounding 
communities who have decided they are going to speak out against 
drugs and if they kill me that will just put more pressure on 
the people who are picking up the baton so to speak she said 
william e smith who heads the fbis palo alto office said the 
agency and the nearby menlo park police department received 
information there was a 10000 contract on roddys life because of 
her antidrug efforts 
the contract was put out by those involved in drug activity in 
and around this particular city smith said theyre street 
dealers were talking about local talent 
the fbi which got the tip more than a week ago is working 
with local authorities because of the violation of roddys civil 
rights 
in the new years eve attack gunmen sprayed her small stucco 
home with at least 35 rounds of semiautomatic weapons fire but the 
retired telephone company worker suffered only a minor wound to her 
abdomen 
for two years roddy has complained about drug dealers in the 
neighborhood where shes lived for 22 years she appealed to the 
city council repeatedly and even ordered dealers to move their cars 
away from her home 
news of the shooting brought promises of manpower and money to 
help local police cope with pushers in the drugplagued and 
financially strapped community members of the guardian angels 
crimefighting group have been standing watch outside her home 
east palo alto police chief dan nelson said investigators have 
pursued a number of leads in the attack his department put up a 
5000 reward and san mateo county added 5000 to the pool 
so far weve had zilch information nelson said 
weve had fairly decent leads smith said the difficulty 
weve had is this community has been paralyzed by the drug activity 
and the fear of coming forward 
the fbis smith appealed for help from the public adding he was 
appalled that someone would have the audacity to say theyre 
going to take the life of a 60yearold woman who says this 
is my right dont sell drugs in front of my home my kids my 
nieces they have a right to feel free from drug activity i think 
its time that we get involved 
nelson said his department and the menlo park police are 
patrolling roddys block as much as possible and he has given her 
a police radio for her home

nelson mandela on friday took over the 
second most senior post in the guerrillabacked african national 
congress after a twoday meeting of the organizations top 
policymaking body 
the 35member national executive committee said it elected 
mandela as deputy to president oliver tambo who is recuperating 
from a stroke in a swedish clinic 
the statement said the committee resolved to make contact with 
the south african government to settle dates and details for a 
preliminary meeting to clear obstacles in the path of fullscale 
constitutional negotiations 
the anc also indicated it was concerned about mandelas health 
and would be selective about accepting foreign trips and future 
engagements for the 71yearold black nationalist leader 
mandela along with fellow longtime political detainees walter 
sisulu and govan mbeki resumed seats on the national executive 
they held when they were arrested more than two decades ago said 
the statement read at a news conference by acting president alfred 
nzo 
nzo said the anc leaders meeting with mandela for the first 
time since president fw de klerk lifted a 30year ban on the anc 
on feb 2 also decided to open headquarters offices in 
johannesburg south africa immediately 
while the anc was outlawed in south africa its political and 
guerrilla leaders have operated their headquarters from zambia 
asked to elaborate on his new role in the anc mandela was 
noncommital 
i am prepared to serve in any role the national executive 
instructs me to fill said mandela who was freed feb 11 after 
27 years in prison 
he said he was optimistic about a political settlement but said 
he was unwilling to predict any time frame for negotiations or the 
return of exiles 
we are already making progress there is no reason why we 
should not be able to make further progress he said i am 
optimistic that the process of removing all obstacles to 
negotiations is on i will be surprised if we dont succeed in 
removing the obostacles 
the anc is demanding the lifting of the state of emergency and 
the release of all political prisoners as preconditions to talks 
aimed at ending the apartheid system that denies south africas 28 
million blacks a vote in national life 
on feb 16 the anc said it was prepared to send a delegation to 
south africa for talks with de klerk on how to proceed 
mandela said the anc welcomed wideranging reforms so far by de 
klerk but the anc sought only to negotiate on an equal footing with 
the ruling national party 
as long as political prisoners are not released and the state 
is emergency is not lifted in its entirety we are not on equal 
terms he said 
of his own release mandela said the release of one prisoner 
when there are 3000 others cant be such an important 
development 
the veteran black leader said the national executive would in 
due course announce the names of delegates it wants to travel to 
cape town for the preliminary talks with de klerk 
south africa says it wants the anc to abandon its commitment to 
guerrilla hostilities and there have been calls from south african 
church leaders and president kenneth kaunda of zambia for 
guerrillas to suspend their operations inside south africa 
if the government gives us the opportunity we will move away 
from confrontation but it is up to the government to decide 
mandela said 
the anc has waged a bombing and sabotage campaign since 1961 but 
there have been few attacks recently and the guerrillas have had 
little military impact 
by his election as the ancs no 2 mandela effectively becomes 
the organizations top leader 
tambo suffered a stroke in august and is widely believed unable 
to resume an active political life as the anc sets about 
establishing a political framework in south africa for the first 
time 
amid concerns for the health of mandela anc officials said he 
had a full schedule and been followed everywhere by hundreds of 
journalists since his release from prison mandela has received 
many foreign invitations 
a senior anc official said mandela treated in prison for 
tuberculosis two years ago receives a daily checkup from a 
physician 
we have just got him back from prison the official said 
the last thing he should see now is hospital walls

a third of the senate appealed to the leaders 
of east and west germany on friday to merge their countries 
existing border treaties with poland in order to allay polish fears 
the bipartisan group of 34 senators called on west german 
chancellor helmut kohl and east german prime minister hans modrow 
to come up with a single treaty that would bind a unified germany 
to honor the present border with poland along the oder and western 
neisse rivers 
the joint treaty would be initialed by the two leaders now but 
would only be ratified by a united german parliament once 
unification is achieved the senators proposed 
we believe as you do that inviolability of the postwar 
european borders is a cornerstone for world peace and 
stability the senators wrote the move was initiated by 
senator paul simon dill a member of the foreign relations 
committee 
any remaining ambiguity about german intentions concerning the 
present german borders with poland should be eliminated as soon as 
possible the senators said 
as steps toward uniting east and west gather momentum poland 
has become increasingly nervous that the territory it was given 
after world war ii comprising onethird of presentday poland 
might be claimed by a united germany 
kohl has dismissed such fears as groundless and said this week 
that he would favor the two german parliaments making formal 
statements that recognize polands western border 
but despite repeated pressure from opposition parties at home 
and from foreign leaders he has refused to commit himself to a 
binding position on the subject saying only a unified german 
government and parliament could make such a pledge some analysts 
have seen his reluctance as motivated by a desire to avoid giving 
an issue to the very small extreme nationalist groups in west 
germany 
each germany has a separate treaty with poland defining their 
borders 
in their cable to the two leaders the senators said a unified 
treaty would put to rest legitimate concerns of poland and would 
facilitate the process leading to german unification 
it also would respond to chancellors kohls concern that the 
present treaty between poland and the federal republic of germany 
could not be legally binding on a united germany the cable said 
president bush has also urged kohl to commit a unified germany 
of which he might be the first leader to an agreement about 
polands existing borders the two leaders discussed the problem at 
a summit meeting last weekend in the presidential retreat at camp 
david 
the potsdam conference of july 1945 of the principal victors 
over hitlers germany the united states france britain and the 
soviet union put german territory under polish administration 
pending a final peace treaty as compensation for polish territory 
further east claimed by russia 
the german provinces of pomerania and silesia and half of east 
prussia were given to poland and millions of germans fled to 
germany 
much of the area in question had been seized from poland in the 
18th century extinction of poland by prussia austria and russia

sparks from a clay bread oven in a tourist restaurant tent next to 
the hotel 
a 67yearold retired accountant from houston was among the dead 
and a third american was reported killed two others and three 
britons remained missing 
the fire raged for nine hours through the lobby and many of its 
630 rooms about 70 people were injured 
authorities blamed strong winds common this time of year in 
egypt and the lack of an alarm system or sprinklers for the fires 
rapid spread 
sheraton said in its statement that there were fire alarms in 
the building the alarm was sounded and fire fighting 
authorities were promptly contacted it said 
frantic guests at the sixstory hotel jumped out windows and 
slid down bedsheets that were tied together 
maj gen adel negm chief of the cairo fire brigade charged 
that sheraton officials broke the law by erecting the tent they 
are illegal because they are fire hazards he said 
sheratons statement said the hotel had received all required 
permits to operate the hotel and restaurants the heliopolis 
sheraton was in compliance with all local codes and regulations 
the hotel chains director of middle east operations sami 
zogbi said in cairo that the hotel was never warned about using 
tents 
if thats true how come the authorities didnt pull it 
down he said we had firefighting equipment at least 20 large 
extinguishers in the tent but the winds were very strong 
canvas tents and marquees are used widely in egypt for weddings 
funeral gatherings and entertainment 
sheratons statement said unconfirmed reports put the number of 
deaths at 18 but the director of cairos central morgue dr kamal 
elsaadani said he had received 17 bodies including five women 
who had not been identified he said the others included a greek a 
briton a chilean and three each from france finland and the 
united states 
a us embassy spokeswoman said only two americans were 
confirmed dead and that two remained unaccounted for 
she said she could neither confirm nor rule out the death of a 
third american as claimed by police col harb at the morgue the 
third american victim was said to be an elderly man 
the embassy spokeswoman said on condition of anonymity that 
american authorities were pretty certain the body found friday 
was that of stephen mohnike 31 of california his hometown was 
not immediately available 
elsaadani said the remains of another american robert d 
cresap 67 of houston had been identified at the morgue 
the embassy spokeswoman said it was possible that the two 
missing americans also had died but documented proof was lacking 
and some bodies were too badly burned for prompt identification

and documents including a 1611 copy of shakespeares hamlet 
worth 1 million authorities said thursday 
the works valued at more than 145 million were recovered 
officials said 
city police wednesday night charged kathleen wilkerson a 
parttime worker in the van pelt librarys rare books department 
with one count each of theft and receiving stolen property said 
wayne r gilbert the fbis top agent in philadelphia 
if convicted wilkerson 33 would face three to five years in 
prison on each count 
no other arrests were imminent but the investigation was 
continuing said james clark first deputy commissioner of the 
police department 
the books were spotted saturday at the bauman rare books store 
in philadelphia by book dealer steven lowentheil of baltimore 
suspecting they were from the library he notified university 
officials and the fbi 
nineteen of the books and documents including the slim 
hamlet volume were recovered tuesday and wednesday at the book 
store officials said more than 100 others were found wednesday at 
ms wilkersons home and her parents home authorities said 
the store cooperated in the investigation gilbert said 
ms wilkerson had worked in the rare books department for 
several years gilbert said he did not know whether she had any 
association with the bookstore 
there was no answer at her home telephone thursday the 
bookstores owner natalie bauman was believed to be at a book 
show in texas police said 
it was not clear whether ms wilkerson had acted alone how long 
the books had been missing and whether other books had passed into 
private hands 
there may be other books missing but thats part of the 
continuing investigation gilbert said 
apparently this has been going on for a while said paul 
mosher the ivy league universitys vice provost and director of 
libraries 
at a news conference the fbi displayed the 19 books found at 
the bookstore besides hamlet one of eight such copies known 
to exist other shakespearean works were a 1600 edition of

bible 25000 
the remainder were books and letters by the english romantic 
poet lord byron the most valuable of which was an 1807 copy of 
hours of idleness valued at 15000 
the fbi originally believed the case involved interstate 
transportation of stolen books but investigators later determined 
the case was limited to philadelphia gilbert said 
mosher said the investigation was hampered by the theft of index 
cards used to keep track of many books and documents along with the 
works about 60 percent of the librarys 20 million volumes and 
documents are cataloged by computer but the rest are on cards 
dating back to the 19th century 
mosher said the library has been reviewing security procedures 
and has removed its most valuable items from shelves and put them 
in a vault the procedures for hiring parttime employees in the 
library also have been strengthened

foreign minister pik botha of south africa 
held talks with angolan officials thursday officially ending 15 
years of rancor between their countries 
bothas oneday swing was the first official visit to luanda by 
a south african minister since angola gained independence from 
portugal in 1975 and south africa sent troops to back guerrillas 
fighting its new marxist government 
the visit is the latest move in a diplomatic offensive by the 
whitedominated government of south africa to improve relations 
with its black neighbors 
diplomatic sources in luanda said president jose eduardo dos 
santos pressed botha during a onehour meeting to use south 
africas influence with angolan guerrillas to bring them to the 
negotiating table 
south africa agreed to withdraw its troops after 13 years of 
combat against government forces and to halt aid to the rebel 
national union for the total independence of angola unita in a 
1988 peace accord signed in new york 
botha called on thursday for cooperation and improved commerical 
links between angola and south africa and said unless we can put 
aside the ideological differences and do so quickly africa is in 
for a terrible economic situation 
bothas talks here also covered recent political reforms in 
south africa including legalization of antiapartheid 
organizations and last months release of african national congress 
leader nelson mandela after 27 years in jail 
foreign minister pedro de castro van dunem met botha for 90 
minutes he praised south africa for mandelas release and for 
reforms of the apartheid system of racial segregation that were 
initiated by president fw de klerk 
since assuming power in august de klerk has traveled to zambia 
zaire mozambique and ivory coast to explain planned reforms of 
apartheid 
south africanangolan relations have improved since the new york 
accords in which south africa also pledged to accept a un plan 
to grant independence to angolas southern neighbor namibia 
under the accords about 50000 cuban troops supporting the 
luanda government are leaving angola with a complete pullout set 
for mid1991 
in johannesburg de klerk pressed ahead with reform thursday 
saying he will not tolerate coverups and promising a thorough 
investigation into charges that security forces have killed 
antiapartheid activists 
the truth about crimes and malpractices has to be established 
and made public de klerk told parliament in cape town i am 
not asking anybody to cover up anything let alone condone any 
crime 
more than 60 unsolved killings of antiapartheid figures have 
occurred in the past decade activists have long accused security 
forces of involvement in the deaths 
a judicial commission appointed by de klerk is to begin 
investigating next week the alleged police and military involvement 
in assassination squads 
twenty people were arrested thursday in cape town while 
demonstrating in support of about 350 inmates on a 4dayold hunger 
strike activists said 
inmates at robben island prison near cape town stopped eating 
monday saying they consider themselves political prisoners and 
should be released under the reforms 
many of the hunger strikers are supporters of the african 
national congress or the pan africanist congress the two groups 
that wage guerrilla campaigns against the government

nato nations 
it said the purpose of kohls visit was to inform and consult 
about the position of the federal government west germany on 
germany and security matters it did not elaborate

the western alliance but that soviet troops could be temporarily 
stationed on the current territory of east germany more than 
380000 red army troops are assigned there now 
the soviet union has said the new state should be neutral 
belonging to neither military alliance east germany now is a 
member of the sovietled warsaw pact 
west germanys foreign minister hansdietrich genscher has 
proposed that a united germany continue in nato but only the 
territory of west germany would be tied to its military structure 
nato would not extend its forces into east germany 
nato ambassadors on thursday discussed the 35nation summit 
expected to be held late in the year on the future of a new europe 
including unification of the two germanys 
raymond seitz assistant us secretary of state presented the 
american views of the meeting of the 35nation conference on 
security and cooperation in europe the discussion centered on the 
preparation and mechanics of the conference and not on the 
substance of the proposed meeting according to a nato official 
demanding anonymity 
the alliance said in a statement that the talks provided 
momentum to consultations among the allies in preparation for the 
summit allies are working intensively to develop basic elements of 
a common approach 
no date or place has yet been set for the summit which will 
draw together leaders from the united states canada and eastern 
and western europe

reward for information leading to a conviction in the death last 
month of kenyas foreign minister 
police commissioner philip kilonzo said wednesday any 
information on robert oukos mysterious disappearance and death 
would be treated confidentially 
robert oukos partly burned body was discovered four miles from 
his family farm in western kenya on feb 8 three days after he was 
reported missing he had been shot in the head 
oukos death led to violent demonstrations by university 
students and mourners demanding an impartial investigation 
president daniel arap moi has invited three british detectives to 
join kenyan police in the investigation apparently to allay fears 
of a coverup 
the minister was the fourth politically prominent figure to die 
violently since kenya gained independence from britain in 1963 in 
each of the previous three deaths the government of the late 
president jomo kenyatta was accused of a coverup 
ouko was the highestranking politician from the luo tribe one 
of four major ethnic groups that vie for power in kenyas 
singleparty government and engage in ancient rivalries some 
students protesters have suggested moi should resign to take 
responsibility for oukos death

three youths convicted of riot in the 1986 
howard beach racial attack were arraigned on the same charge 
thursday two months after an appeals court overturned their prior 
convictions because of trial judge error 
a grand jury in the borough of queens also indicted the trio on 
a civil rights violation charge said matthew greenberg spokesman 
for state special prosecutor helman r brooks both are misdemeanor 
counts carrying a possible oneyear jail term 
the three suspects were arraigned thursday before state supreme 
court justice charles j thomas and released on their own 
recognizance 
the charges stem from the second of two trials after the dec 
20 1986 attack in a predominantly white queens neighborhood a 
gang of batwielding local teens chased a 23yearold black man to 
his death on the belt parkway and badly beat another black 
three teens were convicted of manslaughter in the first trial 
after the incident and those verdicts were not overturned 
three defendants in the second trial william bollander thomas 
farino and james povinelli all 18 and from queens were convicted 
in 1988 of the misdemeanor riot count and acquitted of a more 
serious felony riot count 
state supreme court justice thomas a demakos sentenced the 
three on sept 19 1988 to 34 days in jail to be served on 
weekends over a fourmonth period but they were granted a stay 
pending appeal and spent no time in jail after their conviction 
the appellate division of state supreme court ruled dec 27 
1989 that demakos had made two errors in charging the jury 
demakos over strenuous defense objections furnished the 
jury with verdict sheets that improperly described some of the 
alleged crimes the panel said the judge also erred by refusing a 
defense request to instruct the jury on disorderly conduct as a 
lesser offense of seconddegree riot they said 
on feb 1 chief judge of the court of appeals sol wachtler 
rejected a prosecution motion for the states highest court to rule 
on the lower court reversal

massachusetts attorney general who advocates a 
tough approach toward casual drug users and is up for reelection 
said thursday that his confession to using marijuana in college had 
caused no political fallout 
its a generational thing said attorney general james m 
shannon 37 the states top law enforcement officer 
on wednesday shannon said in an interview with television 
station whll in worcester and a subsequent news conference in 
boston that he had used marijuana while in college but didnt use 
it in law school shannon graduated from johns hopkins university 
in baltimore in 1973 and from george washington university in 
washington in 1975 
shannon a democrat who has called for stronger penalties for 
casual drug users said he believes voters this year will respect 
his candor 
i think people will see it for what it was an honest answer 
to a legitimate question he said 
shannon said college friends had called him their main 
concern was that im not naming names he said 
following shannons disclosure two leading republican 
candidates for lieutenant governor state rep sen paul cellucci 
and state rep peter torkildsen said in interviews that they too 
had smoked marijuana in college 
state rep marjorie clapprood a democratic candidate for 
lieutenant governor said in an interview thursday night that she 
had not smoked it 
she said she was distressed that the issue was being raised 
about candidates so long after the fact it seems to be me to be 
out of context the lawmaker said 
political analysts said they doubted the disclosures would hurt 
candidates they said voters probably accept the fact that a 
generation of young politicians who grew up when drug use was 
common on college campuses experimented with drugs 
clearly youve got several issues here one is a question of 
morality which if it was done 15 or 20 years ago i find to be 
ridiculous said norman ornstein of the american enterprise 
institute a public policy research organization in washington dc 
in 1987 douglas ginsberg withdrew as president reagans nominee 
for a supreme court seat when former colleagues said he smoked 
marijuana 
but subsequent admissions of student drug use by sen albert 
gore dtenn and former arizona gov bruce babbitt had little 
impact on their 1988 presidential campaigns political analysts 
said 
i didnt see it making much of a difference ornstein said 
todd domke a republican political consultant agreed based 
on poll results following the doug ginsberg revelations it would 
seem that most poeple just arent interested domke said 
i think people are willing to forgive the indiscretions of 
youth domke said

the latest edition of crisis is a firstclass 
comic book readable graphic and vibrant but it deals in human 
rights not jokes or superheroes 
the twicemonthly publication with a print run of up to 40000 
was launched a year ago and has become one of britains most 
popular comic books telling stories of animal rights the 
environment and racism 
for its latest issue crisis joined forces with amnesty 
international the human rights organization based in london to 
bring youngsters the grim reality of such as the upington 14 in 
south africa 
we are going after a new younger audience said dan jones 
head of campaigns at amnesty part of our problem is that amnesty 
international produces the most extraordinary stories and then 
they are put into an inaccessible form 
most previous stories in crisis were fictional but the amnesty 
international edition is presented as straight fact 
the comic book tells the story clearly and dramatically 
without lowering amnesty internationals high standards for facts 
and details jones said our name is on the paper and our 
reputation goes with it 
lifelike color drawings tell the story of the upington 14 
and their confinement on death row in pretoria prison 
fourteen blacks were sentenced to death for the mob killing of a 
black policeman in upington northwestern south africa in november 
1985 they were not proved guilty as individuals but were 
sentenced under a doctrine called common purpose which held 
them responsible as part of the mob 
on the last page of the story are statistics of executions in 
south africa and a statement that says 
amnesty international is opposed to the death penalty in 
the case of south africa it asks that a judicial enquiry be 
appointed to look into the use of the common purpose doctrine 
jones said a paragraph was added at the last minute to inform 
readers that president fw de klerk of south africa suspended the 
death penalty feb 2 
pat mills a senior crisis scriptwriter and artist sean 
phillips prepared the edition using amnesty files 
when amnesty international came along with specific cases i 
realized i didnt have to hide behind fiction mills said i 
could come straight out with it because it is based on real life 
not made up in any way and it blows away any movie 
the second story in the amnesty issue is about the humiliation 
and suffering of young palestinians engaged in the uprising against 
israeli rule in the west bank and gaza strip 
amnesty international has recorded a wide range of severe 
violations of human rights by the israeli security forces says 
the message at the end over 540 palestinians have been shot dead 
by the military including many children 
in the last story a young woman is shown trying to stir an 
apathetic comicstrip addict into caring about human rights 
i didnt know you were into lefty political groups he says 
with a sneer on his face 
she retorts the whole basis of amnesty international is that 
its a nonpolitical organization and we get results what do you 
ever do except complain about how screwed up the world is 
the comic book tells readers how to write de klerk and what 
points to make about the death penalty although you might feel 
angry it suggests it is more effective if letters are 
courteous 
on the back cover is an advertisement for amnesty international 
socks tshirts and posters sold by mail 
britain is the primary market for crisis but it also goes to 
north america and australia publishing director jon davidge said 
it costs 170 
jones said future editions will contain other human rights cases 
issue no 44 will illustrate amnesty internationals cases of 
asylum seekers from sri lanka and a later issue will include the 
case of a tortured iraqi he said

the whistling winds off the atlantic 
once carried sailing ships to this tiny island and the welcoming 
sight of the sankaty lighthouse 
now those winds are ripping away the sand and soil that anchor 
the beacon and soon its light like the whalers will be gone 
but sankaty may have a savior in a 75yearold painter named 
robert perrin the pinkcheeked silverhaired maverick who has 
made the island his home has painted the lighthouse and is 
donating 20 percent of the proceeds from the sale of each 150 
print to an effort to save the lighthouse 
his fund raising may amount to little more than a drop in an 
ocean but to perrin it doesnt matter his time as a painter is 
running short glaucoma has claimed most of the sight in his right 
eye and weakened blood vessels in his left may steal what sight 
remains 
with his fading vision he has seen many nantucket landmarks 
torn down to make way for developers wanting to open up the island 
for more summer visitors and tourists sankatys light he said 
wont be extinguished 
everyone says it cant be done perrin said of his efforts 
to save the lighthouse but im a stubborn cuss 
the odds against him are daunting the 140yearold lighthouse 
must be moved back from its eroding 110foot bluff or be swept out 
to sea in the next decade a us army corps of engineers study 
estimated it will cost 840000 to move sankaty 
so two years ago perrin painted a majestic seascape of the 
beacon rising over the stormy atlantic 
the undertaking was no piece of cake perrin wanted the work to 
be a view from the sea but after clambering down the bluff to the 
beach easel and brushes in hand he realized the lighthouse wasnt 
visible from that vantage point visiting seabirds didnt make the 
task any easier 
i got divebombed by terns when i was walking along the 
beach perrin recalled then i couldnt see anything when i got 
there boy was i mad 
the painting in the end had to be created from the artists 
imagination so far sales have been slow but perrin also plans to 
lobby sen edward kennedy dmass who secured 12 million in 
federal money to reconstruct nantuckets great point lighthouse 
which washed into the sea in a storm in 1984 
sankaty is one of a handful of the 139 new england lighthouses 
run by the us coast guard that will fall into the sea in the next 
decade if steps arent taken to save them according to coast guard 
lt paul reid in boston 
reid said despite modern navigation systems lighthouses still 
help ships at sea find their way to shore 
lighthouses are major aids to navigation theyre on all 
navigational charts reid said and even in the biggest ships 
electronics can always go on the fritz sailors like to have the 
lighthouses there something thats always dependable 
pottering around his gallery scattered with easels canvasses 
yellowing photographs and artifacts from the island perrin jokes 
about his fading sight and his work 
i could be a great abstractionist with my right eye or i 
could turn to sculpture of course id have to do it by feel and 
it would have to be with female models said perrin still a 
bachelor 
his nantucket paintings many filled with halfvisible 
ghostlike images of people and landmarks long gone provide a sort 
of visual history of the old nantucket 
you can go anywhere and see brandnew buildings brandnew 
this brandnew that perrin said but old places and things 
have their own character

the chief of nicolae ceausescus 
secret police changed sides at the height of the rebellion against 
the communist dictator but was arrested after failing loyalty 
tests a leader of the uprising says 
silviu brucan a member of the army war council that fought 
ceausescu said his greatest contribution to the december 
revolution was exposing the treachery of gen iulian vlad who had 
been brucans own most cunning interrogator when he was under 
arrest in 1989 for criticizing the dictator 
brucan a stalinist who became a dissident spoke of events in 
the days when the revolutions outcome remained in doubt 
he said he went to the defense ministry on christmas eve as 
securitate secret police and snipers attacked strategic targets in 
bucharest and found vlad to be one of two men directing military 
operations for the rebellion 
what a shock he said in an interview 
two days earlier vlad had offered to cooperate with the army 
which was supporting the popular uprising against ceausescu brucan 
said the dictator was overthrown dec 22 and executed dec 25 
i was afraid he might use his attributes to deceive to take 
in the generals said brucan 74 
so we decided to test him asking him to make a public 
statement on the radio and tv and the key sentence of the 
statement was and i wrote it with my hands an explicit order to 
his troops and snipers to cease fire and surrender themselves 
vlad did not include that sentence in the statement he read and 
at a meeting of the war council that night brucan demanded to know 
why 
gen vlad showed once more his slippery manner brucan said 
he insisted that his statement was a categorical commitment to 
the revolution and that this was much more important because it 
gave a new political orientation to his troops 
when brucan persisted vlad got very irritated angry and 
said it was the first time that someone questioned his loyalty to 
the revolution 
after brucan reminded vlad of his brutal methods in forcing 
brucan to repudiate his letter challenging ceausescu he asked why 
vlad had not told the army immediately about securitate ammunition 
dumps communications centers and underground tunnels 
everyone around the table could then see how gen vlad grew 
red he said he asked for a glass of water and took some 
pills and finally he denied the existence of such a plan 
but since i put the screws on him he eventually retorted that 
if there ever was such a plan he didnt know about it i then said 
that it is inconceivable that in a military organization the 
commanding officer should know nothing about the plan involving the 
troops under his command 
i asked the other generals to say whether this was 
conceivable and all of them answered negatively 
at last gen vlad asked for a final test a final trying to 
prove his loyalty to the revolution he promised to organize an 
action the next day that will end with the capture of a great 
number of terrorists under his command 
the generals decided to give him that last chance but in 
fact the important result of that meeting was that the generals 
lost confidence in that man the next day since the actions 
promised by vlad did not materialize the commanders of the army 
decided to arrest him 
no date has been set for vlads trial 
gen stefan guse who had shared command responsibility with 
vlad was sent to a provincial city because his support for vlad 
had made him suspect brucan said and thus the most dangerous 
chapter in the war against terrorism was closed 
antigovernment protesters have claimed the securitate still 
operates in another guise supported by a government either unable 
or unwilling to clean out ceausescus vast security apparatus 
brucan said an unknown number of securitate agents remain at 
large he also said he did not consider the 700000 people who 
acted as securitate informers to be dangerous 
the national salvation front which took power during the 
revolution decided the army should merely weed out the worse of 
the group because it didnt make sense to consider all these 
700000 as lawbreakers he said 
most of the 15000 securitate operatives served throughout 
ceausescus 24 years in power and were retired after the 
revolution brucan said and the most dangerous ones are the 
snipers who are still at large 
they usually have keys to two apartments brucan said 
they have two identities they have in their apartments civilian 
and military clothes plenty of food in their freezers and 
refrigerators and they can endure 
snipers wait for the occasion and they are not going to waste 
their ammunition on secondclass people

irish editions of cosmopolitan the 
glossy womens magazine appear with blank spaces that should 
contain classified ads for british abortion clinics 
more than six years after a 21 referendum vote to enshrine a 
ban on abortion in the constitution of ireland which is 93 percent 
roman catholic it has become a censorship issue 
in december the national student union had to stop circulating 
its official handbook because it contained information on abortion 
services 
student leaders talk of defying a dec 19 court injunction and 
smuggling copies in from northern ireland abortion is banned in 
the british province too but not information on abortion 
ruth riddick a feminist who ran a pregnancy counseling service 
still gets anxious calls at home most of them from men with 
pregnant girlfriends 
the debate has become both more onesided and more trivial 
said ms riddick a 35yearold arts administrator 
it has shifted from deep moral issues about whether women have 
a right to choose a womans abortion experience is being 
reduced into a simple question of where the hell do i get a phone 
number 
marie vernon a campaigner against abortion countered you 
dont have an absolute right to information a primary right is the 
right to life and all other rights are secondary 
abortion always has been illegal in ireland the ban was 
reinforced by the 1983 decision to write it into the constitution 
in march 1988 and again last december the supreme court ruled 
that giving information on how to get an abortion in a foreign 
country violates the constitution 
that does not make it a criminal offense but it enables 
antiabortionists to win injunctions violators of the injunctions 
can be jailed for contempt of court 
now the battle has moved to european courts which must rule 
whether the ban violates the rights of the 35 million people in 
ireland to get the same information as other west europeans 
the irish rulings climaxed lengthy civil actions brought by the 
society for the protection of the unborn child the main 
antiabortion lobby outside the catholic church against two 
pregnancy counseling services and the student union 
ms riddick closed her counseling service but still provides 
information from home risking contempt proceedings the dublin 
well woman center a general health clinic that ran the other 
counseling service no longer gives information 
ireland is the only european country with a total ban on 
abortion 
divorce and homosexuality also are illegal contraception was 
banned until a decade ago and the church runs most schools and 
hospitals 
in ireland the abortion issue seems at once starker and more 
complicated than the customary arguments about womens rights and 
respect for human life 
even liberals dont expect to see abortion legalized within a 
generation and acknowledge the opposition is deeprooted and 
widespread 
they say the controversy about informaton has increased womens 
fear and guilt prevented proper counseling and made late abortions 
more likely 
in 1983 we packed halls with people fighting publicly for 
legal abortion now many are afraid to call for a right to 
information said pauline ryder head of the well woman clinic 
which is privately financed 
each year at least 4000 irish women go to britain for 
abortions most pay about 340 at private clinics 
the annual figure based on abortions performed in britain on 
women who gave addresses in ireland has changed little in five 
years 
moving the dispute into the realm of free speech has increased 
support for the prochoice lobby 
an attempt last year by the society for the protection of the 
unborn child to jail four student leaders over the handbook 
provoked large demonstrations outside the court 
in january students voted 31 to support the union of students 
in ireland which has 60000 members in its refusal to stop giving 
information on abortion clinics in the handbook or by telephone 
i wouldnt say the population supports abortion but there is 
sympathy for our fight against censorship said karen quinlivan 
a 23yearold law graduate who is the womens rights officer at the 
student headquarters 
in the ballots the students voted contrary to what weve been 
taught all our lives she said theres a feeling that spuc is 
carrying things too far these people are extreme and 
dangerous 
mrs vernon spokeswoman for the society for the protection of 
the unborn child is a cheerful housewife in her mid40s with five 
children 
her youngest child 8monthold sean is adopted his natural 
mother an unmarried teenager lived with the vernon family during 
pregnancy 
hes just the sort of baby who might have been terminated as 
they like to call it mrs vernon said then laughed and added 
but i feel a bit guilty using him as a sales point 
on the walls of the societys oneroom headquarters in a 
welltodo dublin suburb are a disturbing picture of a lateterm 
abortion and one of pope john paul ii cuddling a baby 
the society founded in 1980 says it is nonsectarian and ha itself 
a policeman of 
the constitution and sends agents posing as abortionseekers to 
check on the well woman clinic and other suspect organizations 
cosmopolitan was censored after a citizen complained to the 
censorship and publications board a government agency the board 
which can ban any publication it feels advocates the procurement 
of abortion told cosmopolitan last year to drop the ads 
we agonized over it said simon kippon the american 
magazines publisher in britain in the end we decided wed 
make the point with the blank space 
the magazine owned by the hearst corp sells 13000 copies a 
month in ireland 
another hearst womens magazine company pulled an eightpage 
supplement on abortion from the march issue of its irish edition 
because it included clinic addresses 
the cosmopolitan initiative was serious and companys 
selfcensorship was even more so ms riddick said once you 
put those kind of precedents in place they can be applied across 
the board

residents of the nations snowiest town 
are proud of how theyve shoveled burrowed and bulldozed through 
this winters record snowfall of more than 40 feet 
but after more than three months of steady snow even the most 
devoted fans of winter start pining for that distant rumor called 
spring 
i dont think its ever going to melt airplane scheduler 
nettie pike said recently while waiting out yet another storm at 
the valdez airport this is the new ice age 
streets have become trenches walled in by 10foot snowbanks so 
enduring that kids paint graffiti on them drifts reach halfway up 
secondfloor windows and six snowheavy boats have capsized in the 
harbor 
valdez crowded onto a narrow plain by prince william sound 
forms an ideal catch basin for the oceanspawned snow storms that 
stall against the steepwalled chugach mountains behind town 
at last official count snow on the ground measured 105 inches 
though depths vary throughout town in the lee of hills the 
branches of buried trees claw up through snowdrifts downtown 
bulldozers push icy boulders a ton at a time into mountains 45 feet 
high 
residents dont let it keep them from their business interrupt 
their shoveling for a moment and most will say a bit defensively 
that they dont mind the snow 
at least its not cold gene mcdaniel said as he tried to 
start his snowblower at 20 degrees over the mountains in the 
interior it really gets cold id much rather have this snow than 
45 below 
thats not to say there arent inconveniences 
mcdaniel figured it was time to shovel his roof one night when a 
mass of snow sloughed off blocking his front door and trapping him 
and his guests his snowclearing bill this season stands at 700 
workers at the state department of environmental conservation 
office ran out of room while plowing the parking lot so they 
started pushing snow up onto a nearby pile an angry neighbor soon 
arrived shouting youre putting your snow on my pile take it 
off 
ed nielsen maintenance man at the village inn motel said hes 
been shoveling steadily for a month tunneling down to fire exits 
and fighting a losing battle to keep drifts from walling up the 
windows 
it feels like youre in a dungeon neilsen said people 
start getting itchy feet and getting cranky at each other 
people are kind of schizophrenic said bob donald director 
of the valdez national health center in the summer everyones 
busy as a bee in the winter a lot of people sleep longer they 
come home from work eat watch some tv and are in bed by 9 
oclock and they still feel like theyre not getting enough rest 
its kind of a selfimposed hibernation 
attendance is up at the public library where travel books about 
hawaii are popular 
last fall many valdez residents were looking forward to the 
slower pace winter brings the towns population of 3000 more than 
doubled last summer after the exxon valdez oil spill the largest 
in us history but when exxon suspended its cleanup sept 15 the 
crowds thinned and valdez was left to face its snow alone 
the first measureable snow fell oct 23 by the end of december 
it was halfway up firstfloor windows januarys snowfall of 158 
inches broke the local onemonth record and on feb 13 when 
snowfall topped 3847 inches it erased the modernday seasonal 
record set in 1987 the national weather service didnt start 
recording the towns snowfalls until 1972 
last week another storm pushed the snowfall toward the 500inch 
mark said weather service spokesman lynn chrystal 
chrystal who doubles as valdez mayor concedes the towns 
snows dont match nearby thompson pass considered alaskas 
snowiest spot nor does valdez compare to paradise ranger station 
at mount rainier wash which set the nations seasonal snowfall 
record with 935 feet in the winter of 197172 
but those are isolated outposts chrystal said valdez with an 
annual average snowfall of about 25 feet qualifies as the nations 
snowiest town he said 
for now many residents hide in taverns like the pipeline club 
where they can play a round of darts a wintertime obsession here 
or hear louie the bartender brag for the hundredth time about the 
halibut he caught last spring 
ah yes spring when cars lost for the winter rise out of 
melting snowbanks and the mountains turn from white to brown to 
green 
chrystals forecast both as weatherman and mayor theres 
optimism in the air we know that winter is not too much longer 
it stops snowing by may and most on the ground melts by june 
though patches persist well into july chrystal said while that 
may seem a chilly springtime its the sweetest time of year to the 
snowweary people of valdez 
theres something about april chrystal said dreamily the 
sky is the bluest of any time of year its just breathtaking i 
cant wait until the ice melts off my boat

there are times you wish cbs would put on a 
monday series with nothing but saxophone and violin concertos then 
critics could again gripe about all the sax and violins on tv 
but no it keeps putting on lame situation comedies such as 
his amp hers which premieres tonight the show stars martin 
mull whose last cbs sitcom domestic life expired after a 
short run in 1984 
here he plays a marriage counselor beginning his second 
marriage after one exwife and two kids his bride played by 
stephanie faracy also is a marriage counselor they work together 
trying to save marriages 
mull is a funny guy whose dossier of far better work includes 
the history of white people in america the movie serial 
and fernwood 2night hes also a fine guitarist with a good 
ear for jazz 
were cbs wise it would give him a halfhour variety series 
tell him to do whatever the spirit moves him to do each week in 
music comedy art or just putting on airs and then stand by 
but no it gives him another routine sitcom 
the only really good thing about this one is that at dawn and at 
bedtime he usually throws fluffy the cat out the bedroom window 
the bad part is that the bedroom is on only the second floor 
its easy to tell the show is set in los angeles the premiere 
concerns the ceaseless craving of mulls much younger second wife 
for a baby this is not unusual hollywood is babycrazed these 
days 
makemepregnant plots keep popping up on tv in shows like 
nbcs new grand and earlier in la law the desire for 
tykes almost has replaced the plight of the brazilian rain forest 
as hollywoods no 1 concern 
here baby lust leads to a trip to a fertility clinic 
predictable jokes about a low sperm count and wifely lines like 
your little guys arent swimming theyre just kind of 
dogpaddling in place 
tonights epic starts with our couple awakened at dawn by a 
phone call from a anguished patient seems he caught his wife 
messing around with manuel the pool man 
they offer advice hang up and the show gets to the plot point 
mull is pressed by his wife to render her pregnant he says theyve 
been trying for six months and you cant say it hasnt been fun 
says she thats the trouble youre not supposed to have fun 
you need to concentrate when youre trying to have a baby 
right we also learn that his teenaged son blake soper lives 
with them that his teenaged daughter lisa picotte lives with 
his exwife randee heller and that the exwife comes by for 
dinner and oneliners 
also loose here is mulls best friend richard kline a divorce 
lawyer who has five kids and cheats on his spouse although not 
with the wife of manuel the pool man 
in all fairness the debut show written by the series 
executive producers patricia jones and donald reiker does give 
mull one good line 
his predictably flaky secretary blair tefkin says one of his 
patients just called to report that her husband is a pervert he 
likes to wear womens garter belts and stockings under his national 
guard uniform 
mull shrugs well he says i suppose thats ok during 
peacetime

silviu brucan put it in writing more 
than two years ago by 1990 a new generation would be leading 
eastern europe 
as he watched the dominoes tumble last year however the 
stalinistturneddissident feared he had been wrong about his own 
country 
when december came i got frightened that i have only one 
month and when dec 22 came i was relieved he said with a broad 
smile we did it 
brucan 74 is the eminence grise of the national salvation 
front which took over when communist dictator nicolae ceausescu 
was overthrown dec 22 and executed dec 25 
he has resigned from its leadership but remains in his large 
office giving advice and planning the fronts campaign for the may 
20 election 
two months after a popular uprising ended ceausescus 24year 
reign the revolution in little romania is having an impact on the 
two communist giants the soviet union and china brucan said 
millions of chinese whose prodemocracy uprising was crushed by 
the army in june are fixated on the success of romanian uprising 
which the army supported he said in an interview 
its a romanian obsession in china and that will topple the 
communists he said and not only in china i think it affected 
perhaps even more so the soviet union 
before decembers events in romania he said the decisions of 
the soviet communist partys central committee including 
relinquishing its monopoly on power were inconceivable 
brucan has been a journalist academic and ambassador to the 
united states in 19561959 and the united nations in 19591962 
once a stalinist and ranking communist party member he broke with 
ceausescu in 1965 
ceausescu put him under house arrest in march 1989 along with 
five others who signed an open letter criticizing the dictator 
his reemergence in revolutionary romania has been 
controversial brucan has been denounced both as a stalinist and as 
an advocate of the economic policies of mikhail gorbachev 
by his own definition brucan rejected stalinism long ago and is 
committed to multiparty democracy 
communist parties in eastern europe are doomed to extinction 
by a scientific and technological revolution that created distinct 
social groups and virtually destroyed the working class that was 
their base of support he said 
in an article published in september 1987 by the boston monthly 
worldpaper and reprinted in the international herald tribune he 
foresaw the collapse of the soviet bloc dictatorships 
conservative leaders clinging to economic orthodoxy face a 
formidable challenge that is bound to accelerate the changing of 
the guard he wrote by 1990 a new political generation will be 
in command all over eastern europe 
brucan said the power of romanias revolution was a surprise 
i didnt expect a popular explosion of such magnitude he 
said in the interview especially i didnt expect the youth in 
romania to have such a high political and civic conscience 
as he watched the rise of solidarity in poland and signs of 
democratization in other soviet bloc countries brucan said his 
main concern was to keep from being killed by ceausescu 
brucan was first put under house arrest after criticizing the 
dictators handling of riots in brasov in 1987 
in october 1988 unexpectedly he was offered a passport to go 
to the united states fearing a trap brucan said he decided to 
stop in london and moscow and make my name known so much 
internationally that the price of killing me was so high that 
ceausescu could not pay 
pressure from the united states britain and the soviet union 
saved him from arrest on his return in late november 1988 he said 
the soviets made a very reluctant promise of support if 
ceausescu fell brucan said but he described western press reports 
of a conspiracy to oust the dictator as trash 
if there was a plot and we succeeded dont you think we 
should have boasted about it and made political capital about 
it he asked it would have strengthened considerably our 
legitimacy and political modesty has no place particularly at a 
time of revolution 
the national salvation front a group of 150 intellectuals 
dissidents and workers initially pledged to stay out of the coming 
election but reneged last month 
daily protests culminated in its agreement three weeks ago to 
share power with 37 political groups in a council of national unity 
that will govern until the election 
brucan said the most difficult thing was to convince people to 
share power with the other political parties and to get across the 
point that a strong opposition is essential in a democracy

robert e lee is plotting an offensive this 
spring in tennessee but instead of leading a fight between 
confederate and union troops lees battle involves spirits 
bob lee iv greatgrandson of the civil war general is in the 
liquor business 
as chairman of the tiny privately owned a smith bowman inc 
distillery lee is taking on a much bigger foe on the oppositions 
home turf tennesseebased jack daniel in a bid to double sales 
of bowmans virginia gentleman bourbon in that state 
lee 65 says his company isnt setting out to become an 
industry giant but in virginia its as big as his familys name 
we are the no 1 alcoholic beverage label in the state he 
said 
that ranking was achieved largely because of bowmans virginia 
vodka which sells about 150000 cases a year in the state bowman 
also has just gone international with an order from poland for 
50000 cases of vodka the largest single order for one product in 
the companys history 
bowmans mainstay virginia gentleman bourbon is no 2 in the 
state behind national leader jim beam virginia gentleman also is 
sold in seven other states from pennsylvania to north carolina and 
a pocket in atlanta 
two years ago bowman introduced its own gin which accounts for 
about 12000 cases a year 
lee is a born salesman whose accent reflects his new york roots 
his father was a columbia universityeducated doctor who practiced 
in the city 
but lee was sent to private school in virginia and in 1949 
graduated from washington amp lee university in lexington where his 
greatgrandfather served as president after the civil war 
after college he moved to the west coast and became an 
advertising executive for the san francisco chronicle twenty years 
ago he joined bowman when his brotherinlaw a smith bowman jr 
asked him to take over sales and marketing duties at the company 
founded in 1935 by bowmans father a smith bowman sr 
i basically like sales said lee whose first decision at 
bowman was to hire a public relations executive and begin traveling 
the state to give civic club speeches and newspaper and television 
interviews to promote virginia gentleman 
i went down to lynchburg one time and was on a cooking show 
he said id never cooked in my life but we did it for half an 
hour and gave away recipes it was fun 
lee who eventually succeeded the bowmans as chairman of the 
nations oldest familyowned independent bourbon distillery also 
played a role in the decision to diversify the firms products 
here we had one product bourbon he said nationally 
bourbon was not going anywhere 
bourbons share of the liquor market dwindled from 14 percent in 
1978 to 108 percent in 1988 but the trend was evident early on 
and bowman got into the vodka business in 1982 lee said 
when the companys vodka went on the market it got a boost from 
thengov charles s robb who launched his we have it made in 
virginia campaign at the same time that was pure luck lee 
said 
the companys gin came out two years ago while lee has been 
searching for new directions to take the company bowman is not 
ready to become a major national player in the liquor field he 
said 
although sales of bourbon are slumping nationally lee said 
there still are plenty of bourbon drinkers to woo away from 
competitors 
a dozen years ago bowman entered into a partnership with a 
wholesaler in florida and texas and attempted for 18 months to sell 
virginia gentleman in those two states it just didnt work 
lee said 
so having done that we realize we cant go big league like 
jim beam he said we never would have known if we hadnt 
tried 
lee keeps a small bust of gen lee in his office but most of 
the family decorations are related to his children 
he said people always want to hear stories about his 
greatgrandfather 
but we dont have any special anecdotes in the family about 
general lee he said one of the major reasons is that 
everybody got married late in life my father never knew his 
grandfather and my father was in his 50s when i was born 
we had a sense of history but we didnt have anybody sitting 
in someones lap telling about something that wasnt in dr 
freemans or bruce cattons books lee said of the pulitzer 
prizewinning biography of his greatgrandfather by douglas 
southall freeman and works by civil war historian catton thats 
just the way it was 
what lee has in mind for the tennessee offensive is a taste 
test a battle of the bourbons 
its going to be kentucky vs tennessee vs virginia he 
said 
how far is he willing to go to win 
a southern gentleman will go to any lengths to maintain the 
family honor according to a bowman brochure a virginia 
gentleman will go only to honorable lengths

dan webb the irancontra prosecutor handling 
the case against john poindexter is described by colleagues as one 
of the finest trial attorneys in the country 
when he was us attorney in chicago he won convictions against 
crooked cops and corrupt judges 
webbs trademark as former president reagan found out two weeks 
ago is his skillful crossexamination of witnesses 
in videotaped testimony for poindexters trial reagan suggested 
it might have been all right to destroy documents in the 
irancontra affair webb countered by pulling out a written answer 
reagan had given two years ago to a federal grand jury saying that 
no destruction of documents had been authorized by the president 
when one of reagans answers strayed far afield from the 
prosecutors question webb angered the former chief executive by 
interrupting him to announce he had been unresponsive 
if they wanted to find one of the best trial lawyers in 
america they did republican gov james thompson of illinois 
who has known webb for 19 years said of last summers decision by 
irancontra prosecutors to hire webb for the poindexter case 
webb 44 is a partner at the chicago law firm of winston amp 
strawn 
he grew up in bushnell ill and applied to become an assistant 
us attorney in chicago in 1971 an interviewer wrote the letters 
nbbr on his application which stood for nice boy but rural 
recalls thenus attorney william bauer who hired him immediately 
webb was highly motivated sincere and he desperately wanted 
to be an assistant us attorney the combination made it so you 
couldnt turn him down recalls bauer now chief judge of the 7th 
us circuit court of appeals in chicago 
while running the us attorneys office in chicago webb 
personally tried the marquette 10 case ten chicago police 
officers were accused of taking bribes from drug dealers to protect 
drug activity and all 10 were convicted 
i think that had not dan webb gotten involved we would have 
had a better chance of convincing a jury that the police officers 
should be acquitted said chicago defense attorney daniel j pierce 
as a defense attorney webb developed a novel strategy in the 
fraud case of two sports agents who were representing college 
athletes through skillful crossexamination webb drew the jurys 
attention away from his client and focused it on the gross 
disregard some of the nations major universities have had for ncaa 
rules and academic standards 
webb has a baby face which has every mother on the jury 
nodding when he talks says thompson 
the governor of illinois calls the prosecutor in the poindexter 
case smart tough he very strongly believes in the 
integrity of law and the integrity of law enforcement

richard beckler who is defending john 
poindexter in the irancontra affair has handled some of the most 
highprofile cases washington has had to offer 
at the justice department in the 1970s beckler supervised 
criminal investigations of major us corporations making overseas 
payoffs to get business with foreign governments a number of 
companies entered guilty pleas in connection with the bribes 
as a defense attorney beckler represented reagan campaign 
official and subsequent cia director william casey in the 
controversy known as debategate in which aides to ronald reagan 
gained possession of documents from the camp of thenpresident 
carter in 1980 
during the congressional hearings into the irancontra affair 
beckler was seen on national television forcefully defending 
poindexter 
beckler has obtained videotaped testimony from reagan for 
poindexters trial he also won a court ruling that limits the 
scope of potentially damaging testimony by oliver north 
poindexters former subordinate who ran the secret contra resupply 
network and was at the heart of the iran armssale initiative 
becklers handling of poindexters case is typical of the 
lawyers style a thoughtful carefully planned defense in which 
he is paying a lot of attention to detail says washington 
attorney john j cassidy 
beckler who grew up in brooklyn is characterized by colleagues 
in the defense bar as a scrapper and a streetfighter 
detractors say he is unnecessarily bombastic 
but if i were in a tough situation and i had an opportunity to 
put together my team hed be on it and i wouldnt want him to be 
on the other side said hank schuelke a partner in a washington 
law firm 
assuming hes got the skills and the intellect which he does 
dick beckler is my notion of what a trial lawyer ought to be 
said schuelke 
beckler has operated effectively in defending corporate clients 
in grand jury investigations he is cast with some frequency in the 
role of trying to persuade the government not to bring criminal 
charges 
if one word describes dick beckler its relentless said 
washington attorney a raymond randolph he turns over every 
stone and never gives up 
he is a man of very high integrity and he has a reputation for 
that said randolph if he deals with government officials 
they know they are dealing with a straight shooter 
a product of williams college and fordham law school beckler 
spent four years as a prosecutor in the office of thenmanhattan 
district attorney frank hogan and worked for six years in the 
justice departments fraud section eventually becoming its chief 
in 1979 he joined the washington office of fulbright amp 
jaworski specializing in whitecollar criminal defense work

respectable sales growth last month at some of the countrys 
leading chain stores partly reflected unusually warm weather and a 
good response to new spring merchandise 
but industry analysts foresee another tough time for retailers 
in 1990 as competition continues to eat into profitability 
fewer general merchandise chains discounters and department 
stores issued their results thursday than usually do on the first 
thursday of the month because of differences in salesreporting 
calendars 
monroe greenstein an analyst at bear stearns amp co inc said 
retailers probably will have a mediocre year in 1990 similar to 
1989 february marks the start of the fiscal year for many 
retailers 
jeffrey feiner of merrill lynch amp co inc said we remain 
somewhat cautious given continuing high consumer debt levels and 
sluggish trends in the financial and real estate markets 
some analysts believe rolling recessions have been rippling 
through parts of the manufacturing sector such as the automobile 
industry 
a widely watched barometer of manufacturing health showed a 10th 
straight monthly decline in the sector during february the 
national association of purchasing managements index stood at 483 
percent in february up from 452 percent in january a reading 
below 50 indicates that the us manufacturing economy is generally 
declining 
analysts were reluctant to attach too much significance to the 
retail results because february is typically a slow time for 
business january and february are transition months as winter 
merchandise is cleared out to make room for fresh spring lines 
in contrast to the chains that did well last month sears 
roebuck and co the countrys biggest retailer continued to 
struggle 
the giant chicagobased general merchant which began a new 
merchandising strategy a year ago hoping to reverse years of 
marketshare losses had a hohum february sales were virtually 
flat at 2127 billion in the four weeks ended feb 24 vs 2126 
billion a year earlier 
sales at sears stores open a year or longer edged up only 15 
percent 
retailers and industry analysts prefer to focus on sales 
comparisons for stores operating at least a year called samestore 
or comparablestore results newly opened stores typically enjoy a 
period of unusually brisk business that isnt sustained over time 
one standout among the retailers reporting thursday was walmart 
stores inc the big bentonville arkbased discount chain said its 
february sales surged 33 percent to 195 billion from 147 
billion a year earlier sales at walmarts open a year or longer 
posted a healthy 17 percent gain 
by either measure walmart consistently has been a star 
performer as it expands across the country 
currently ranked no 3 there is widespread speculation in the 
industry that walmart this year could overtake sears and k mart 
corp in merchandise sales volume in the united states 
k mart based in troy mich recently stepped up efforts to 
respond to the challengein a bid to boost sales and profit k mart 
will accelerate its store opening and renovation program taking a 
422 million aftertax charge to carry out the plan 
k marts report on last months sales will be released march 8 
many of the retailers who in recent years have reported their 
monthly results on the first thursday of every month will be 
reporting later in march there is an effort being made within the 
industry to reach a compromise on a single monthly reporting date 
for the rest of 1990 
here are some reports released thursday 
dallasbased department store operator jc penney co inc said 
sales at its stores and through its catalogs rose 81 percent in 
february to 880 million from 814 million a year earlier sales at 
stores open for at least a year were up 72 percent 
melville corp the harrison nybased owner of offprice and 
other retailers said february sales rose 117 percent to 5032 
million from a year earliers 4506 million 
montgomery ward amp co based in chicago reported a 25 percent 
february sales gain to 299 million from 2918 million last 
years figures were restated to exclude discontinued lines 
woolworth corp the new yorkbased parent of numerous specialty 
stores including the foot locker sports shoe chain said its 
domestic february sales jumped 137 percent to 330 million from 
291 million samestore sales rose 117 percent

for mary rodas playing with toys is 
just another day at the office 
but as vice president of a company that expects more than 20 
million in sales this year the 14yearold ms rodas is not just 
playing around 
the eighthgrader is an executive for catco inc a 
manhattanbased company that develops and licenses toys 
other companies use kids to test their products but catco says 
none of them have reached the executive ranks like ms rodas 
she takes taxis or limousines from union city to her office in 
nearby manhattan three times a week her high school and college 
education is already paid for and she has a stock portfolio that 
includes investments in ibm walt disney co general electric co 
and the hershey co 
if an ideas good enough i say so ms rodas said 
explaining her job if theres something to improve i say what 
needs to be done to fix things up 
kidstuff 
its more than that said catco president barbara carver 
most kids cant say specifically what their problem with the toy 
is theyll just say i dont like that or this isnt fun with 
mary shell say it needs more colors or more of this or that 
shes just very bright ms carver said shes very 
perceptive and willing to speak her mind 
ms rodas said her consulting career began at age 4 when her 
father a salvadoran immigrant working as a custodian brought her 
along as he made repairs to a neighbors apartment there she 
noticed a man laying tile 
since i was a little kid my father used to take me from 
apartment to apartment so i used to see how it was done ms 
rodas said i knew my father never put tiles in that way i 
criticized him and told him he wasnt doing the job right 
the man was donald spector who lived in the same building as 
the rodas family 
spector struck up an acquaintance with the girl and became so 
impressed with her ideas he decided to make her vice president 
when he founded catco a subsidiary of catalyst applied 
technologies which he cofounded 
ms rodas wont say how much her stock is worth but its more 
than she would make setting up a lemonade stand she doesnt draw a 
salary and she cant touch the stock catco has put in trust for 
her until she turns 18 
for catco paying for the stocks and limousines and the office 
is worth it 
shes able to tell us which way to develop things early on 
ms carver said that way we dont get all the way to the end of 
the road and find we should have done something different 
her latest project is balzac a balloon in a patented cloth sack 
it can be hit with a racket bat or stick and can even be sat 
on without busting 
when ms rodas first bounced it around the sack was made of 
white muslin 
i told them it was too plain she said they needed 
something to liven it up i told them to put on some neon colors 
the sack now is a patchwork of brilliant colors 
the job aside ms rodas said shes like any other 14yearold 
girl 
i still have an ordinary life she said im an ordinary 
kid the only thing different is i have a job

texas air corp has agreed to pay eastern 
airlines more than 280 million to settle a bankruptcy examiners 
findings that it bought the subsidiarys assets at unfairly low 
prices 
the findings released thursday by examiner david i shapiro 
supported a key contention by striking eastern workers who claimed 
texas air stripped their company of its most valuable assets to 
bolster the parents nonunion carrier continental airlines 
however shapiro did not agree with the unions request that 
eastern be run by an outside trustee the unions had sought the 
move as protection against further predations by texas air during 
easterns bankruptcy reorganization 
texas air rejected shapiros findings about the sale of assets 
but said it would make the settlement payment in order to help 
bolster eastern 
texas air and eastern categorically reject any conclusions in 
the shapiro report that intercompany transactions between eastern 
and its affiliates formed the basis for any material liability 
the two companies said in a statement issued after a court hearing 
on the report 
the statement said shapiros report is full of faulty 
analyses hearsay evidence statements taken out of context and 
misstatements of fact 
union attorneys said the report vindicated the workers 
position but they insisted that a trustee still needs to be named 
to run the company 
the wrongdoers are simply to be slapped on the wrist bruce 
simon an attorney for the air line pilots association told the 
hearing 
approval of the settlement by us bankruptcy judge burton r 
lifland could remove a main obstacle in the airlines effort to 
emerge from bankruptcy because some of the compensation would help 
satisfy creditor claims against eastern 
lifland said the proposed settlement can be viewed in some 
ways as texas air buying eastern again 
the proposed settlement includes 150 million to 250 million 
that eastern would recover from texas air for the transfer of the 
system one computer reservation system and 61 million for texas 
airs acquisition of eastern in november 1986 
in addition eastern would receive a 25 percent share in system 
one and the right to buy 40 boeing 737300 jets at cost from sister 
carrier continental the settlements total value is estimated at 
more than 280 million and includes 133 million in cash 
separately lifland approved easterns request that 60 million 
be taken from escrow funds to help finance its operations this 
month the funds contain about 550 million raised by the sale of 
eastern assets since it sought bankruptcy court protection last 
march 9 
shapiro issued his findings following a lengthy investigation 
into the dealings between texas air eastern and continental as 
part of easterns chapter 11 bankruptcy case 
the company sought protection from creditors five days after the 
beginning of a strike by machinists flight attendants and pilots 
that virtually grounded it eastern has been reorganizing as a 
smaller carrier and has hired replacements for many of the strikers 
the pilots and flight attendants unions abandoned the strike in 
november but machinists remain on strike 
in the 300page report shapiro said that in 12 cases out of 15 
there was substantial evidence texas air transferred ssets worth 
between 285 million and 403 million from eastern without 
adequately compensating the airline 
in miami where eastern has its headquarters president phil 
bakes said the settlement would help expedite the airlines 
emergence from bankruptcy court protection which he expected by 
the end of june 
the unions had long demanded the bankruptcy court appoint a 
trustee to run eastern instead of texas air chairman frank lorenzo 
but shapiro said in his investigation that the request might 
cripple the airline 
nonetheless shapiro recommended the appointment of a special 
monitoring committee with much less authority than a trustee to 
scrutinize how texas air deploys assets among its businesses 
the examiner had been investigating eastern its finances and 
relationships with continental and texas air since early september 
because of conflict of interest questions raised by the unions and 
eastern creditors 
this issue became particularly significant after eastern 
proposed a reorganization plan that did not include full repayment 
for its creditors 
if texas air had taken eastern planes routes and other assets 
from the airline and given them to continental they theoretically 
would be out of reach of easterns creditors 
eastern sold the system one computerized reservation system to 
texas air in april 1987 for about 100 million last week texas 
air said it would sell half of system one to a general motors 
subsidiary for 250 million suggesting it was worth far more than 
what texas air had paid to eastern 
as part of the settlement worked out by shapiro eastern would 
get a 25 percent share in system one with 50 percent to be owned 
by the gm subsidiary electronic data systems corp and the 
remaining 25 percent by continental

bank of new england corp is now working under the 
official guidance of the federal government with orders to tighten 
lending practices withhold stock dividends and review the 
competence of senior managers 
federal regulators had been scrutinizing the bank for months 
because of its mountain of bad real estate loans which forced the 
company to post massive losses last year 
on thursday bank of new england announced it had signed federal 
consent orders outlining steps the bank must take to restore its 
financial health 
we regard these orders as cooperative plans we undertake in 
partnership with federal regulators said h ridgely bullock the 
banks interim chairman they all speak to running a better 
bank 
the consent orders do not include plans to cut the companys 
work force but bullock confirmed the bank expects to lay off 
thousands of workers saying we have to downsize our operation 
considerably 
under the orders bank of new england will need federal approval 
to declare stock dividends conduct financial transactions with its 
subsidiaries and pay benefits to former employees 
the bank also is required to tighten its lending practices and 
not make any commercial real estate loans without following 
prescribed guidelines 
furthermore the bank must review the performance of its senior 
managers and report any proposed changes to the government 
the banks board already has dismissed several top executives 
including former chairman walter connolly who presided over the 
banks rapid growth before its problems surfaced last year 
bullock said the bank hoped to name a permanent chairman within 
a week 
lawrence fish a former bank of boston corp executive was 
expected to be named the new chairman but bullock declined to 
confirm that 
the consent orders cover the bank holding company and its 
bostonbased subsidiary bank of new england na bullock said the 
companys four other affiliate banks which are based elsewhere in 
new england were expected to sign consent orders soon 
the boston branch also was ordered to raise its equity capital 
to 3 percent of total assets by may 31 and develop a plan to reach 
5 percent 
the bank however has told the federal comptroller of the 
currency that it does not expect to meet the may 31 deadline and 
bullock said the bank hopes to get an extension bullock said he 
expects the bank to operate under the consent order for a year or 
more 
until late last year bank of new england was the regions 
secondlargest bank behind bank of boston but the company took a 
dramatic fall as a real estate slump forced the bank to boost its 
reserves against bad loans 
bank of new england reported 1989 losses exceeding 1 billion 
and the company says it is studying whether it should have made 
larger provisions against bad loans earlier in the year 
in the meantime bank of new england has lost an estimated 5 
billion worth of deposits forcing the company to borrow money from 
the federal reserve bank of boston while it tries to sell assets to 
raise cash 
the banks borrowing is estimated above 1 billion but bullock 
said he hopes bank of new england will be out of the fed by 
april 
people look at borrowing from the fed as a trend line to 
obscurity i disagree he said instead bullock described the 
borrowing as bridge financing as the bank sells about 6 
billion worth of assets 
because of the cash crunch the bank cannot afford to pay stock 
dividends bullock said adding that he would have expected the 
bank to withhold payments regardless of the federal consent order 
i dont expect to be able to pay dividends on common stock or 
preferred stock for some time he said 
bullock said the bank still hopes to find buyers for its 
troubled loan portfolio but he added they have been harder to 
find than buyers of other assets

advertising account 
the agency was created only five years ago and the new job

plans to introduce in midapril the appointment is effective april 
2 
saabscania based in orange conn said it picked angotti 
thomas over two other new yorkbased agencies kirshenbaum amp bond 
and slaterhanft amp martin 
the account had been handled for the past 2 years by the agency 
lord einstein oneill amp partners an even younger agency that got 
the account shortly after it was created 
lord einstein is headed by several executives who abruptly quit 
their old agency lord geller federico einstein in march 1988 
after it was acquired by the british advertising conglomerate wpp 
group plc 
it was time for a change said roy steinwolf ad manager at 
saabscania said thursday in explaining why saabscania launched a 
search for a new agency in january 
he said saab sales in the united states have slipped over the 
past three years including a 12 percent decline in 1989 after 
showing steady gains for the previous six years sales of european 
imports generally have been weak 
saabscania has been using the ad slogan the most intelligent 
cars ever built for several years and steinwolf said whether to 
continue that slogan is under discussion 
the wall street journal meanwhile said thursday it had 
selected an agency that celebrated its 125th birthday last year j 
walter thompson to handle its advertising sales and circulation 
advertising account 
the daily newspaper declined to disclose how much it planned to 
spend on advertising this year although one trade publication 
estimated it was 75 million 
thompson also owned by wpp group was ranked the eighthbiggest 
us ad agency in 1988 handling worldwide advertising billings of 
more than 38 billion and creating advertising for products such 
as kodak film and kellogg cereals 
the journals former ad agency was gsdampm of austin texas which

journal as faster tougher smarter 
gsdampm had been hired to handle advertising during the journals 
centennial celebration in 1989 and to promote and posiution the 
newspapers reorganized threesection format in 1988 
as business becomes ever more global we foresee enormous 
opportunities for the journal in the 90s and beyond said 
publisher peter kann 
he said thompson has demonstrated that it can help us to 
capitalize on these opportunities in the years ahead 
thompson was believed to have been one of two finalists 
considered for the job insiders who spoke on condition that they 
not be identified said the other agency was lord einstein oneill amp 
partners the agency that broke away from wpp group

trading cards that brokers and traders use to record commodity 
futures and options transactions 
the tougher rules will make it difficult to fabricate or alter 
trading records one of the allegations made in the fraud scandals 
that rocked the two largest chicago futures exchanges last summer 
more than 40 traders at the chicago mercantile exchange and the 
chicago board of trade were indicted on charges ranging from 
racketeering to fraud for numerous alleged schemes to defraud 
customers 
during hearings for a cftc reauthorization bill last fall 
members of congress were very critical of the cftc for allowing the 
exchanges to police themselves on recording trades and other 
recordkeeping functions 
a general accounting office study of four futures exchanges last 
september found that at three of them much of the recordkeeping 
is left to the traders and brokers themselves 
the rules changes will require 
the collection of trading records within a specified schedule 
timestamping the cards 
using preprinted sequentially numbered cards that will be 
unique to each exchange member 
recording trades on both trading cards and order tickets in 
nonerasable ink 
one of the allegations in the chicago probe was that traders 
would illegally alter records to correct costly errors or change 
the time of a transaction to take advantage of a later more 
favorable price 
the new rules also would require each exchange to submit a 
written report to the commission no later than nine months after 
the effective date of the regulation detailing the systems they 
have put in place to meet the new requirements 
exchanges could seek exemption from the new rules if they can 
demonstrate members are using handheld computer terminals or other 
automated means to recrod trades and eliminate fraud 
both the bot and cme are developing handheld computer terminals 
that will replace paper trading cards but they are not expected to 
be operative in the near future

the departing president of exxon shipping co 
called the wreck of the exxon valdez a tragedy that never should 
have happened but said the huge alaskan oil spill did not prompt 
him to leave exxon 
frank j iarossi said thursday that although environmental 
concerns for prince william sound were justified criticism of 
exxons cleanup efforts were sometimes unwarranted 
one regret i had in that first week or so is that we didnt 
have the opportunity to really show the human side of what people 
were doing to try to bring that situation under control iarossi 
said there were people out there working for 22 hours 
in a telephone interview from his home in houston iarossi said 
he was leaving exxon to become president of the american bureau of 
shipping an international ship classification society he had been 
in charge of the shipping division since 1982 
in the first few days after the spill iarossi said press 
coverage was reasoned and really trying to understand what had 
happened but somewhere after day five or six when it hit the 
beaches there was no way to balance or bring rationale to the 
story 
news reports didnt emphasize that exxon offloaded 1 million 
barrels of oil from the exxon valdez without spilling a drop 
he said we were told by the state that the priority was to save 
five hatcheries which in fact was done 
exxon was unable to do much about the oil that had already 
spilled out of the ship and fouled shorelines though 
it was clear that we won a lot of the battle but as far as 
the public was concerned we lost the war said iarossi who was 
the first highlevel exxon official to arrive on the scene to 
coordinate cleanup after the spill 
the announcement of iarossis departure comes two days after a 
federal grand jury in anchorage indicted exxon shipping and its 
parent exxon corp on criminal felony and misdemeanor charges 
stemming from the march 24 1989 spill 
if convicted on all five counts the company could face fines 
exceeding 600 million exxon says it already has spent more than 
2 billion to clean up the effects of the nations worst oil 
disaster which spilled nearly 11 million gallons of crude into 
prince william sound 
the skipper of the valdez joseph hazelwood is on trial in 
anchorage on felony criminal mischief and misdemeanor charges that 
include operating the vessel while intoxicated if convicted he 
faces up to 7 years in prison and 61000 in fines 
les rogers a spokesman for exxon in houston said iarossis 
departure from the company was unrelated to the spill 
in answer to the question did exxon fire him no we did 
not rogers said 
iarossi said he received a whole bunch of nasty letters 
about the spill condemning him as antienvironmentalist 
i think there was a very emotional side to some of the 
reaction that didnt benefit anybody except for a venting of 
anger he said 
it certainly was a tragic incident and it never should have 
happened but i think exxon valdez became the lightning rod for a 
lot of emotion that was already there a lot of energy that was 
already there he said 
because of the spill several members of congress are proposing 
that some tankers be required to have double hulls to protect 
against oil spills 
but iarossi said doublehulls diminish tankers capacity which 
would require the building of more tankers and possibly increase 
environmental risks 
iarossi had been negotiating with the shipping bureau for 
several months and was elected by the new jerseybased group on 
feb 26 to the posts of chairman of the board and president rogers 
said iarossis last day at exxon will be march 30 
after serving in the us coast guard iarossi joined exxons 
tanker division in 1968 from 1972 to 1976 he managed a tanker 
construction program for exxon in japan he later was a marine 
advisor to exxon and became assistant manager of exxons corporate 
planning department in 1981

the state of california today accused charles 
h keating jr the central figure in the lincoln savings amp loan 
scandal of casting a web of fraud to snare investors who paid 200 
million for nowworthless junk bonds 
the civil investmentfraud lawsuit which also names two keating 
associates is the toughest action yet against keating whose 
highflying lifestyle and soured investments came to symbolize the 
excesses of the sampl industry in the 1980s 
the lawsuit seeks repayment for the investors many of them 
elderly people who lost their life savings in the highyield 
highrisk bonds it could lead to millions of dollars in civil and 
criminal judgments and years of prison time officials said in 
remarks prepared for a news conference today 
they said files supporting the lawsuit had been turned over to 
the district attorneys of los angeles and orange counties for 
possible criminal prosecution 
keatings los angeles attorney james ham did not immediately 
return a phone call seeking comment on the lawsuit 
this is a shocking story of predatory sales practices 
engineered from the top and carried out in lincoln savings branches 
where every promotion and every bonus earned by employees created 
an atmosphere of sell sell sell said christine bender 
commissioner of the state corporations department 
keating headed lincolns parent company phoenixbased american 
continental corp the lawsuit was filed late thursday in los 
angeles superior court 
it is the first such charges filed against keating by any 
federal or state agency said ms bender 
lincolns collapse is expected to be the most costly sampl failure 
ever with taxpayers footing a 2 billion bailout bill keating 
already was targeted in a classaction lawsuit on behalf of 22000 
lincoln investors that action like the states lawsuit contends 
they were led to believe their investments in acc bonds were 
federally insured like regular deposits at sampls 
ms bender said interviews with more than 100 american 
continental bondholders and lincoln employees and analysis of 
thousands of documents showed 
that prospectuses describing the bonds were routinely withheld 
from customers 
that investors many of them elderly disabled and on fixed 
incomes were never told the bonds were uninsured 
that many investors were told the junk bonds were insured and 
risk free 
ms bender said it may be hard to collect restitution because 
american continental is mired in bankruptcy proceedings in phoenix 
but she said her department would pursue every avenue in seeking 
restitution 
also named as defendants are judy j wischer and andrew ligget 
both of phoenix who held a variety of titles at american 
continental the lawsuit also listed 200 john doe defendants 
to be named later if additional evidence surfaces 
the defendants are accused of fraud and misrepresentation in 
connection with the offer and sale of securities making false 
filings with the corporations department using unapproved 
advertising in connection with the securities and selling the 
bonds in clear violation of the qualification requirements of state 
law

workers at campbell soup cos oldest 
manufacturing plant pick up their final paychecks today as 
production halts at the 121yearold birthplace of condensed soup 
the last can of pork and beans was scheduled to roll off the 
production line at midnight 
by 3 oclock it will be a ghost town after 121 years said 
company spokesman james moran 
a skeleton crew will remain to dismantle equipment and ship 
inventory from the warehouse moran said its likely that the 
plant too will be razed along with the four huge soup cans that 
have long dominated the skyline on the delaware river across from 
philadelphia 
the closing is part of a worldwide restructuring campbell 
announced last august that will eliminate 2800 jobs in camden and 
at plants in maryland and tennesee the move is expected to save 
the company 15 million during fiscal 1990 and 150 million during 
the next four years 
the closure comes at a crucial time for this city of 85000 
residents which is struggling to revitalize its business sector 
many of the bluecollar employees at the plant have worked for 
campbell most of their lives and their future is uncertain 
employees some garbed in drab green campbell uniforms gathered 
in front of the eightstory building thursday shaking hands and 
bidding farewells 
today is the funeral tomorrow is the burial said alvin 
apple still president of local 80 of the united food and 
commercial workers which represents about 640 of the hourly 
employees in the plant weve been let down 
still who worked at the plant for more than 40 years is among 
about 230 employees who qualify for a pension plan the others 
arent as fortunate he said 
the rest of them will have to root for what they can find 
still said theres no job market in the city 
the union and campbell have agreed on severance payments but an 
arbitration hearing still has to be held on the pact production 
from the plant will be moved to facilities in napoleon ohio 
paris texas and maxton nc 
im glad i worked here campbell soup has given us a lot 
said 57yearold merliane parker who worked at the plant for 25 
years but im glad im leaving 
mrs parker and a handful of other workers who lingered outside 
the building thursday said they plan to take advantage of early 
retirements although they said theyll have to curb their spending 
they have to go they have to go lucy dematao said 
shrugging her shoulders they were good to everybody 
campbell said it would have cost millions to renovate the plant 
the company is trying to improve its performance and pacify some 
members of its founding family who are pushing for a sale of the 
entire foodproducts giant 
during its heyday in the 1930s the camden plant produced 10 
million cans of red and white labeled soup varieties daily in 
recent times output has averaged about one million cans a day of 
prego spaghetti sauce francoamerican pasta and beans 
for years john t dorrance jr son of the 
chemistturnedentrepreneur who invented condensed soups was 
reluctant to close plants or lay off workers 
but dorrance jr died last april and since then the company has 
undergone major changes including a split in the founding family 
that has sparked speculation about the company being sold 
earlier this year david johnson became the first outsider 
brought in to head the company 
despite the internal upheaval campbell has said it will 
maintain its economic commitment to camden the plant had an annual 
payroll of 48 million and pumped about 13 million worth of goods 
services and supplies into the regional economy yearly 
campbell has said it will build a 35 million headquarters on 
the citys waterfront but some state and local officials are 
skeptical 
johnson said this week that between 100 and 500 employees would 
be cut from the headquarters staff within the next several months 
moran said the spokesman also said the plans for the 200000foot 
international headquarters remain under review

the first shipments of a caffeinefree version of 
cocacola classic the drink that appeared following the new 
coke uproar five years ago will begin hitting stores this week 
the nationwide rollout follows a successful market tryout in 10 
cities cocacola usa officials said thursday spokesman bob 
bertini said the new product should be available across the nation 
by the end of the month 
an advertising campaign with the slogan its the real thing 
only caffeine free also is under way bertini said 
caffeinefree coke classic is the atlantabased soft drink 
companys fourth caffeinefree version of an existing product 
there are already caffeinefree versions of cocacola diet coke 
and tab 
the caffeinefree cola segment is one of the fastest growing 
in the soft drink industry bertini said cokes bestselling 
caffeinefree product is caffeinefree diet coke which currently 
has a 78 percent market share 
bertini said the appearance of caffeinefree coke classic did 
not mean the company was giving up on caffeinefree cocacola 
which is a companion to the new coke that was introduced in 
1985 to a wave of consumer complaints over the disappearance of the 
original formula coke 
the company subsequently brought back the original formula under 
the coke classic label which became the nations no 1 soft drink 
and overwhelmingly outsold new coke 
caffeinefree coke similarly has been a relatively weak 
performer bertini said it has a very small share of the market

british broadcasting corp announced plans on 
friday to expand its programs in eastern europe especially 
romania and in the united states 
one of the main principles behind the success of our 
international broadcasting is that we broadcast to our friends as 
well as those who until recently were enemies said john tusa 
managing director of the bbc world service 
tusa who was born in czechoslovakia said eastern european 
countries still need to hear controversy comment and news from a 
broad international viewpoint he said noncommunist leaders in 
eastern europe including polish prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki 
have asked the bbc to continue and are giving it facilities for 
local rebroadcast of its programs 
mazowiecki is a former contributor to bbc programs 
broadcasts to romania were increased by two hours during the 
christmas uprising that overthrew the government of president 
nicolae ceausescu tusa said another hour and a quarter will be 
added soon 
we have reallocated funds to eastern europe through the 
internal budgeting process more money for russian bulgarian 
romanian he said 
he explained that special emphasis has been put on broadcasting 
to romania because of the intensity of the crisis there last 
christmas and difficulties now in finding stability and a way 
toward transition to a new political system 
to show the influence british broadcasts have had tusa held up 
a photograph taken last june in tiananmen square before chinese 
tanks put down the prodemocracy movement students were carrying 
the chinese flag and a sign in both english and chinese in english 
it said 
thank you bbc 
tusa added that bbc officials are asking prime minister margaret 
thatchers government for more money but declined to say how much 
he insisted that government funding does not lessen bbc 
independence 
the foreign office does not even attempt to tell us what to 
say tusa told reporters if they did they know from long 
experience what the answer would be 
in the united states americans later this month will be able to 
dial up the latest bbc news program by telephone at any time for 
less than a dollar a minute he said one cable television 
service cspan is devoting an audio channel to a 24hour relay of 
bbc news and tusa expects it to grow from its present 1 million 
subscribers he said 150000 have been added recently in a suburban 
washington area 
he added that he also hopes for growth in an arrangement with 
american public radio that permits any of its stations to relay all 
bbc world service material from midnight to six in the morning

federal regulators have filed a suit against the 
ernst amp young accounting firm seeking 560 million regulators say 
was lost because the auditors failed to detect illegitimate 
activities of dallasbased western savings association 
the suit filed thursday by the federal deposit insurance corp 
means the nations largest accounting firm becomes ineligible for 
most work with the fdic an agency spokesman said 
the fdic can only use ernst amp young if there is a compelling 
argument for doing so said agency spokesman alan whitney 
ernst amp young general counsel carl liggio was out of town this 
morning and unavailable to comment a woman answering the phone in 
his office said 
western savings september 1986 failure is expected to cost the 
government more than 1 billion the government continues to own 
and operate western savings which was combined with seven other 
failed texas thrifts in 1988 to form sunbelt savings of dallas 
between 1982 and 1986 western savings operated under the 
control of developer jarrett e woods jr who bought gatesville 
savings and loan association renamed it western savings and began 
making highrisk loans for construction and development 
federal regulators became interested in the thrift when they 
noted its high rate of growth and in 1984 supervisors for the 
federal home loan bank board forced western to agree to a series of 
restrictions including the hiring of a new outside auditor arthur 
young amp co 
arthur young merged with ernst amp whinney in 1989 
young performed outside audits for western savings in 1984 and 
1985 but failed to plan and conduct its audits in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting standards in numerous 
respects the fdic alleges 
the agency said arthur young failed to assess the risks of 
irregularities assigned personnel with inadequate training and 
relied unreasonably on the representations of western savings 
management 
specifically the fdic said arthur young should have reported 
bogus profits from property sales including property foreclosed by 
the thrift with many of the sales going to parties who received 
their entire financing from western savings 
it also alleged the accounting firm should have reported 
inadequate provisions for losses from loans and investments 
the suit names arthur young amp co and ernst amp young

the jury fully evaluated the case on the merits and ruled in

the lawsuit was brought in 1984 by liggett which had introduced 
generic cigarettes in 1980 liggett charged that bampw tried to bring 
about the demise of liggetts lowprice cigarettes by illegally 
copying liggetts trademark and trying to prevent expansion of 
generic sales 
bampw said the case was one that should be tried by the

greyhound local unions failed to reach an agreement by the 1201 
am mst strike deadline 
no new negotiations were scheduled 
stranded passengers complained that they were unaware that a 
strike was looming and criticized greyhound for selling them 
tickets when it was likely they wouldnt be able to complete their 
trips 
they havent even apologized said lisa olkon who was stuck 
in atlanta while trying to get home to st paul minn from 
florida i called about an hour before i went to get on the bus 
and was told nothing 
about 200 passengers had been stranded at the atlanta terminal 
early today but by late morning only three dozen or so remained 
the others apparently got out on the few buses that did depart or 
on a southbound amtrak train that left at midmorning or found 
lodging to wait out the strike 
we went on strike because the company has refused to bargain 
in good faith and we have struck because the company insisted on 
imposing its original offer said union spokesman jeffrey nelson 
besides the 6300 drivers the strikers include 3075 of the 
companys office and maintenance workers whose threeyear contract 
expired at midnight 
dallasbased greyhound carried 22 million passengers last year 
an average of about 60000 a day the union told its drivers to 
continue only as far as their next destination as the strike 
deadline passed the company said it didnt know how many 
passengers were stranded but estimated the number in the thousands 
greyhound said it would operate a limited schedule today using 
replacements trained during the past few weeks 
we are starting with our main line schedule first and 
continue to add routes as drivers become available spokeswoman 
liz hale said from the company headquarters 
she said at least 16 of the 60 bus schedules that the company 
normally runs in dallas were operating as of 6 am 
hale also said some drivers had crossed picket lines but didnt 
know how many later she said she had received spotty reports 
of harassment on picket lines but nothing involving 
passengers she said she could not confirm any of the incidents 
amtrak told ticket agents to honor greyhound tickets when buses 
are unavailable said railroad spokeswoman sue martin in 
washington dc 
greyhound serves about 9500 destinations including about 9000 
where it is the only intercity transportation 
it offers a 68 oneway ticket anywhere in the country and 
generally caters to people seeking the cheapest form of mass 
transit 
only nine of the normally scheduled 40 greyhound buses left the 
port authority terminal in new york city between 6 pm and 
midnight so that all passengers would reach their final 
destinations said greyhound spokesman bill kula 
in dallas more than 40 pickets encircled the downtown bus 
terminal and blocked two incoming greyhound buses cheering when 
the drivers abandoned their vehicles 
a handful of pickets blocked a departing bus for about 20 
minutes in minneapolis 
the bus marked charter pulled out of the terminal onto a 
side street just before 8 am when one picket mike vervanac 
pulled open the door and told the driver we cant guarantee your 
safety down the road 
another picket joyce wegener called the driver a scab she 
said later the mans got my job 
a security guard said police would be called and told the driver 
to continue the bus halted again when pickets walked in front of 
it and didnt step aside until they saw police arriving no arrests 
were made 
rob wilkins 22 of london said the strike had disrupted his 
plans to tour america by bus he was trying to get from minneapolis 
to memphis tenn 
im not going to see elvis he lamented i come to bloody 
america and theyre on strike 
several buses also were delayed in cleveland where pickets 
jeered and pounded their fists on departing and arriving vehicles 
police blocked pickets from approaching two buses that left the 
philadelphia station without passengers company officials would 
not say where the buses were going 
in pittsburgh where violence broke out during a bus strike 
seven years ago six workers picketed peacefully while stranded 
passengers snoozed 
sharon kois a senior at west virginia university in morgantown 
wva was trying to get to bozeman mont for a job interview 
saturday 
she said a ticket agent asked her dont you read the 
papers when she arrived to catch her bus she then reserved 
seats on an amtrak train bound for montana 
the company said it was unsure if the picket lines would be 
honored by other unions including drivers at urban mass transit 
systems the company operates in various cities 
greyhound drivers who according to the company earned an 
average of 24743 last year took a 22 percent pay cut three years 
ago in negotiations prior to a leveraged buyout of the company 
the company is offering a firstyear raise of 69 percent but 
the union says this is misleading the company says the union is 
demanding a 33 percent increase in the first year the union says 
that is a distortion 
greyhound chairman fred g currey led an investment group that 
paid phoenixbased greyhound corp 270 million to buy out the 
company in 1987 the group later bought trailways lines inc of 
dallas for 80 million and merged the two companies

waterford wedgwood group plc said friday that a 
new york investment bank and an irish company would acquire a 
minority stake under a plan to raise more than 150 million for the 
ailing angloirish crystal and china maker 
the 5050 partnership formed by the irish industrial company 
fitzwilton and morgan stanley amp co would take a maximum 299 
percent stake in waterford which in turn would raise 102 million 
irish pounds or 158 million in cash 
waterford also announced it an aftertax loss of 29 million 
pounds or 45 million in 1989 compared with a loss of 52 
million pounds or 81 million a year earlier 
the deal ends widespread speculation in recent months that 
waterford was searching for a partner to help it reduce about 186 
million in debt the company said a major portion of he cash raised 
would go toward reducing that debt 
waterford said investco a new company set up by fitzwilton 
holdings plc which is headed by hj heinz co chairman tony 
oreilly and a morgan stanley amp co affiliate called morgan 
stanley leveraged equity fund ii lp would buy 212 million new 
waterford shares for 375 pence or 58 cents each 
the sale is expected to raise about 123 million waterford also 
said it would sell 828 million shares representing about 7 
percent of its enlarged stock capital to existing shareholders 
excluding investco 
waterford said it would offer one share for every five held at 
a price of 275 pence 43 cents each that sale would raise an 
additional 35 million 
this is an excellent opportunity to take a significant 
longterm position in one of the worlds preeminent luxury goods 
companies donald brennan chairman of morgan stanley leveraged 
equity fund ii lp said in a statement 
we believe current management have correctly identified the 
causes behind the production problems in the companys crystal 
business and this investment provides the prudent capital structure 
that will give management time to solve them he said 
waterford has been hurt badly in recent years by a slump in 
sales in britain and the united states and by the climb of the 
irish pound against the dollar 
the company was rocked when a 1988 audit revealed that 
accounting errors were made that overvalued its crystal inventories 
by up to 33 million former waterford chairman paddy hayes 
resigned in the aftermath of these revelations 
waterfords shares rose 2 pence or 3 cents to close at 50 
pence or 78 cents on dublins stock exchange friday 
under the deal fitzwilton and morgan stanley each named two 
members to waterfords board of directors raising the number to 
14 oreilly is one of fitzwiltons two 
detailing its results waterford said that it lost 32 million 
before taxes in 1989 compared with a a 42 million pretax profit 
a year earlier sales rose 16 percent to 541 million from 467 
million in 1988

state officials today accused charles h 
keating jr the central figure in the lincoln savings amp loan 
scandal of casting a web of fraud to snare investors who paid 200 
million for nowworthless junk bonds 
the civil investmentfraud lawsuit which also names two keating 
associates is the toughest action yet against keating whose 
highflying lifestyle and soured investments came to symbolize the 
excesses of the sampl industry in the 1980s 
keating and lincolns parent company american continental corp 
already have been sued by the federal deposit insurance corp in a 
11 billion civil fraud lawsuit the fdic says it is the largest 
depository institution suit in history 
the suit announced today seeks repayment for the investors in 
the highyield highrisk bonds many of them elderly people who 
lost their life savings it holds keating and the others personally 
responsible and could lead to millions of dollars in civil and 
criminal judgments and years of prison time the officials said in 
statements released this morning 
they said files supporting the lawsuit had been turned over to 
the district attorneys of los angeles and orange counties for 
possible criminal prosecution 
i say the suit has been filed by the very people who allowed 
it to happen and its politically motivated to divert attention 
said keatings los angeles attorney james ham 
its also a huge waste of taxpayer dollars because mr keating 
is already being investigated by the securities and exchange 
commission the us attorneys office in grand jury proceedings 
the federal election commission and by both houses of congress 
he said 
he said he had not seen the lawsuit but im sure its just a 
rehash of what everybody else is in line for 
accs spokesman brad boland did not immediately return a 
telephone message seeking comment 
this is a shocking story of predatory sales practices 
engineered from the top and carried out in lincoln savings branches 
where every promotion and every bonus earned by employees created 
an atmosphere of sell sell sell said christine bender 
commissioner of the state corporations department 
keating headed the phoenixbased american continental corp the 
lawsuit was filed late thursday in los angeles superior court 
lincolns collapse is expected to be the most costly sampl failure 
ever with taxpayers footing a 2 billion bailout bill keating 
already was targeted in a classaction lawsuit on behalf of 22000 
lincoln investors that action like the states lawsuit contends 
they were led to believe their investments in acc bonds were 
federally insured like regular deposits at sampls 
ms bender said interviews with more than 100 american 
continental bondholders and lincoln employees and analysis of 
thousands of documents showed 
that prospectuses describing the bonds were routinely withheld 
from customers 
that investors many of them elderly disabled and on fixed 
incomes were never told the bonds were uninsured 
that many investors were told the junk bonds were insured and 
risk free 
ms bender said it may be hard to collect restitution because 
american continental is mired in bankruptcy proceedings in phoenix 
but she said her department would pursue every avenue in seeking 
restitution 
also named as defendants are judy j wischer and andrew ligget 
both of phoenix who held a variety of titles at american 
continental the lawsuit also listed 200 john doe defendants 
to be named later if additional evidence surfaces 
the defendants are accused of fraud and misrepresentation in 
connection with the offer and sale of securities making false 
filings with the corporations department using unapproved 
advertising in connection with the securities and selling the 
bonds in clear violation of the qualification requirements of state 
law

mothers and hookyplaying college 
students are rushing to brokers around bangkok hoping one of the 
worlds fastest growing stock markets will extend its winning 
streak in 1990 
most of the people who come to our trading floor are women 
many are housewives who come in the morning after dropping their 
kids off at school said mark greenwood broker at first pacific 
asia securities 
on a day when theres a lot of movement i can hear great 
bursts of cheer coming out of the trading room he said at 
cocktail parties lunches and during rounds of golf conversations 
these days invariably come around to stock prospects profits and 
losses 
while greenwood says many use the market here like a casino he 
and other analysts predict that more serious longterm investors 
will make big gains on the securities exchange of thailand over the 
next few years 
with economic growth rate expected to reach 8 percent to 10 
percent in 1990 analysts predict thailands stock market will grow 
by more than 25 percent its 137 listings are expected to increase 
by 40 to 50 during the year 
fueled by the economic boom and large amounts of money from 
abroad the stock exchange registered the best performance in asia 
last year at the beginning of 1989 the markets total shares were 
valued at 9 billion vs 256 billion at yearend 
george robinson broker at wi carr far east ltd said a main 
reason was the 12 billion worth of foreign investment pumped in 
the market last year 
at the same time speculation is widely seen as a major force in 
the thai market many investors have been lured by the prospect of 
profits from buying then quickly selling 
sunisa kriyharasan chief researcher at cmic finance and 
securities co said thai investors did not fully understand the 
young market and often bought stocks on short term speculation 
rather than looking for fundamentals behind a company 
speculation is a good thing for a young market such as 
thailands because it spurs activity and gets people into the 
market greenwood said 
but some believe speculation has gotten out of hand finance 
minister pramual sabhavasu recently said the stock exchange was 
becoming a gambling den and a series of measures have been 
taken since dec 1 intended to curb excessive speculation 
in many alleged cases heavy speculation has been riding on the 
coattails of manipulation by large brokerages 
one of these chao thai securities was suspended from trading 
jan 12 for charges of manipulation along with another company 
that was cleared the subsequent day chao thai is still under 
investigation 
manipulation occurs right throughout the asian continent it 
is something that people have to live with said greenwood 
others said the government scrutiny had made a difference 
its getting better said one broker who declined to be 
identified by name the ministry of finance is now tightening 
control eventually well see an independent authority to check 
this 
although the stock exchange is 14 years old it remained obscure 
only until a few years ago from 1979 to 1986 the market struggled 
because of the collapse of one large securities firm raja finance 
interest in the stock market picked up in 1986 with a large 
influx of foreign investment drawn by thailands speedy industrial 
modernization 
since then the stock exchange has blossomed apart from two 
major slumps caused by the black monday stock market crash in 
the united states in 1987 and the resignatiom of thai prime 
minister prem tinsulanonda in 1988 both were followed by rapid 
recoveries 
the market has been experiencing a downturn since jan 10 after 
a dramatic 20 percent increase since oct 13 from an index of 650 
to 925 
analysts have seen the slump as a long overdue correction as 
well as a result of drops in stock markets worldwide 
i can see short term dislocation in the market however i 
think there is nothing that can stop the market when the economy is 
growing at 8 to 10 percent said greenwood

frances civil aviation authority has ruled the 
airbus a320 jetliner fundamentally safe despite an accident last 
month in bangalore india in which 90 people were killed a 
spokeswoman for the authority said friday 
the direction generale de laviation civile dgac sent its 
judgment in a message this week to other countries operating the 
shorttomedium range plane the spokeswoman said 
henri martin president of aerospatiale sa one of four european 
aircraft manufacturers comprising the consortium airbus industrie 
said the fact that the certification of the airbus a320 wasnt 
withdrawn after the bangalore accident makes us think that the 
plane isnt at fault 
aviation industry sources said the note stated information given 
french investigators concerning the accident proved the 
airworthiness of the aircraft as certified by dgac 
the country that certifies a plane airworthy can order aircraft 
belonging to the same series grounded if mechanical failure is 
suspected as the cause of an accident 
some french and indian pilots have criticized the a320s 
sophisiticated computerguidance system as removing too many 
decisions from the pilots control 
the investigation into the causes of the accident is still under 
way india has grounded air indias 14 other a320 aircraft until 
its inquiry is completed but other carriers have continued to fly 
the 53 remaining a320s in operation

the dollar rose aggressively against other major 
currencies in europe friday shrugging off a reported intervention 
by the west german bundesbank the us federal reserve and the 
french and spanish central banks 
gold prices fell more than 5 an ounce 
the dollar did retreat from its session highs against the west 
german mark on a series of bundesbank interventions late in the 
afternoon dealers said but the us currency recovered after the 
market interpreted the intervention as warning rather than a 
serious effort to bring the us currency lower dealers said 
the dollar still was underpinned by jitters over german 
unification they said 
a dealer with a us money center bank said the bundesbanks 
action was clearly a signal to the market that the dollar had 
moved too far too fast 
the fed didnt surface until much later in european dealings 
when it sold dollars between 14990 japanese yen and 15010 yen 
dealers said but the action had little effect on the us 
currency they said 
in london the british pound fell to 16515 from 16655 late 
thursday 
other late dollar rates in europe compared with late thursdays 
prices included 17200 west german marks up from 17145 15130 
swiss francs up from 15060 58065 french francs up from 57935 
19365 dutch guilders up from 19307 126800 italian lire up 
from 126600 and 11939 canadian dollars up from 11899 
in tokyo where trading ends as europes business day begins 
the dollar fell 003 yen to a closing 14975 yen but later in 
london it was quoted at 15028 yen 
bullion dealers attributed the decline in gold prices to a wave 
of technical selling in light trading which brought the prices 
below a key support level 
gold fell in london to a late bid price of 40325 a troy ounce 
from 40775 bid late thursday 
in zurich gold fell to a closing bid of 40250 from 40775 
bid late thursday 
earlier in hong kong gold rose 102 to close at a bid 40661 
silver bullion fell in london to a late bid price of 512 a

ryder system inc executives friday predicted flat 
or only slight growth in 1990 as the transportation services 
company seeks to rebound from a 77 percent earnings decline last 
year 
ryder officials told a meeting of industry analysts they hope 
streamlined operations and growing european operations will improve 
business but said a quick turnaround is not expected in part 
because of the nations slowing economy 
we continue to see a difficult environment for significant 
improvements in earnings said m anthony burns ryders chairman 
and chief executive 
burns said miamibased ryder should post a firstquarter loss 
and will be lucky to show an improvement over last years operating 
income which was affected by a 90 million charge for a 
restructuring an increase of workers compensation reserves and 
vehicle sales 
last year ryders net earnings were 46 million or 50 cents a 
share compared with 197 million or 240 a share in 1988 
revenue rose slightly to 51 billion from 5 billion in 1988 
ryder blamed the earnings decline on reduced demand for 
commercial truck rental no aircraft sales by its aviation 
division increased fuel costs and a slowdown in new car sales that 
hurt its vehicle transportation unit 
ryder which has sold off three slowgrowing divisions since 
last year and reduced its work force by nearly 3000 to 42000 
shares about 80 percent of the truckrental market with 
phoenixbased uhaul international inc 
ryders vehicle leasings amp services division which posted a 
pretax loss of more than 110 million last year has sold off 
about 10000 trucks many in poor condition 
leasing division chief david parker said ryders school bus 
leasing operations and expansion into europe are potential growth 
areas ryder operates several truck facilities in the united 
kingdom and one in west germany 
no aircraft sales and a decline in the market for used aircraft 
parts last year hurt ryders aviations services division which 
leases and sells used aircraft repairs engines and distributes 
parts 
a chapter 11 bankruptcy filing by orlandobased braniff inc in 
september also cost ryder business but ryder officials are 
competing for former customers of united airlines which has left 
the jet engine repair business 
european expansion is also a target of ryders automotive 
carrier division which transports new cars division head terence 
russell said 
russell attributed much of the divisions 226 million pretax 
losses last year to a slump in new cars sales which he said should 
rebound

the close reflected a squaring up of positions before the

agriculture department had approved a sale of 140000 metric tons

us workers lack enthusiasm and dont enjoy 
their jobs and the best way to motivate employees may be to offer 
them more money according to most of the quality control engineers 
responding to a recent survey 
the institute of industrial engineers after examining responses 
to a survey of its members opinions on workplace productivity and 
quality issues said corporations must invest more in motivating 
employees and making the workers feel they can share in the 
companys success 
the alternative could be declining productivity and quality 
said gregory balestrero executive director of the iie based in 
norcross ga 
its affecting corporations very rapidly balestrero said 
friday from miami where he was attending a conference 
balestrero said 27 percent of the iies 40000 members responded 
to the annual survey with 752 percent of the respondents saying

a federal jury on friday ordered brown amp 
williamson tobacco corp to pay 1488 million to liggett group 
inc for attempting to put liggetts generic cigarettes out of 
business through illegal pricing 
the award followed a sevenmonth antitrust trial in us 
district court on allegations that bampw illegally tried to stifle 
expansion of generic cigarette sales by its competitor in the early 
1980s 
bampw was convicted of selling generic cigarettes at below their 
cost of manufacture giving illegal discounts to undercut liggett 
sales and organizing a plan to displace liggett in the generic 
market 
brown amp williamson based in louisville ky was acquitted of 
trademark violation attorneys for durhambased liggett said they 
would seek a new trial on that issue 
the message is clear unfair competitive conduct in the 
marketplace is contrary to american law liggett president kvr 
dey said 
liggett introduced generic cigarettes in 1980 and sued bampw in 
1984 charging it tried to bring about the demise of liggetts 
lowprice brand by illegally copying liggetts trademark and trying 
to prevent expansion of generic sales the trial began last july 
bampw maintained the case should be tried in the marketplace and 
not the courts 
liggett sought 896 million in compensatory damages the amount 
the company said it lost as a result of predatory practices by bampw 
in violation of federal trade and antitrust laws 
liggett contended that it pioneered the plainlabel generic 
cigarette market in 1980 in a successful effort to carve its own 
niche at a time when sales of its regular brands were flagging 
brown amp williamson a larger tobacco company said it engaged in 
customary tactics in the highly competitive cigarette trade in 
seeking a share of the generic market 
josiah murray general counsel for the liggett group inc said 
bampw sought to bring down liggett because liggetts lowprice 
cigarettes were interfering with brown amp williamsons high profits 
on their branded cigarettes 
bampw said in statement it believed the verdict would be 
overturned because of overwhelming evidence that competition was 
not in any way injured by brown amp williamsons sale of lowpriced 
cigarettes 
liggett was owned by grand metropolitan plc when the lawsuit was 
filed it was sold to a group of private investors in 1986 and went 
public a year later 
when grandmet sold liggett an arrangement was made for liggett 
and grandmet to share equally in any proceeds of the brown amp 
williamson litigation after reimbursement of expenses 
under an agreement grandmets share in any recovery will not 
exceed 165 million plus reimbursement of all expenses relating 
to the lawsuit paid or reimbursed by grandmet or by liggett while 
it was owned by grandmet 
the balance of a recovery will be liggetts since last june 
grandmet has reimbursed liggett for 50 percent of liggetts 
expenses in connection with the case

concerted central bank intervention helped 
moderate the dollars rise on friday following the currencys 
recent foreign exchange surge that analysts credit to economic and 
political turmoil in other nations 
some of the sharpest gains have come against the currencies of 
west germany and japan both of which are undergoing times of 
economic uncertainty 
the dollar closed at 17200 west german marks friday in europe 
up sharply from the 16545 marks of feb 7 
against the japanese currency the dollar closed at 15028 
japanese yen friday in london inciting a round of dollar selling 
by the central banks of several countries including the federal 
reserve on feb 19 the dollar was quoted at 14452 yen 
its not so much that the dollar is going up but other 
currencies are going down said kevin logan chief economist with 
swiss bank corp in new york 
david wyss chief financial economist with drimcgraw hill in 
lexington mass said the yen failed to rally as expected after 
japans parliamentary elections last month the mark which soared 
after the border between east germany and west germany was opened 
in november also has run into trouble 
the deutschemark has dominated foreign exchange trading since 
the barriers between the two germanys began falling on nov 9 the 
dollar closed at 18475 marks that day but the west german 
currency shot higher on speculation that the countrys economy 
would boom as a result of the political changes in eastern europe 
but some of the euphoria has begun to wear off and is being 
replaced by the jitters the outcome of this months east german 
elections is unclear and there is concern that the planned 
unification of the east german and west german currencies may lead 
to an oversupply of marks increasing the danger of runaway 
inflation 
all the uncertainty has increased the risk of holding 
deutschemark assets logan said 
investors have begun selling some of their marks to preserve 
their profits and the dollar has advanced as a result 
the dollars close of 17200 marks in europe compared with 
thursdays level of 17145 in new york the dollar fell to 17150 
west german marks from 17194 thursday 
in japan disappointment over the yens failure to rally has 
been compounded by increasing fears that interest rates will rise 
further as the government attempts to contain inflation as more 
and more traders believe a rate hike is likely they are selling 
yen in favor of the dollar 
the yens decline has been swift and startling during a sixday 
winning streak in late february the dollar soared 451 yen and 
reached its highest level since last june 
analysts say the dollar could go higher but the central banks 
of the big industrial countries will try to stop it especially 
against the yen fridays intervention which succeeded in taming 
the dollar somewhat on us markets was a statement by the banks 
that they want to see currency rates stable wyss said 
the dollar fell 003 yen to close at 14975 yen friday in tokyo 
but later in london it was quoted at 15028 yen and it closed in 
new york at 15015 yen up sharply from thursdays 14985 
with traders growing uneasy about the german political and 
economic situation currencies like the british pound and the swiss 
franc whose countries have high interest rates were seen as 
relatively safe havens and also have advanced against the mark 
logan said 
but in recent sessions the european currencies have fallen with 
the mark allowing the dollar to gain sharply he said 
on feb 23 the pound traded at 17145 its highest level since 
april 1989 but sterling has dropped since then in london friday 
it closed at 16515 compared with 16655 late thursday and in 
new york it fell to 16485 from 16640 
other late dollar rates in new york compared with late 
thursdays rates included 15085 swiss francs down from 15095 
57910 french francs down from 58070 126450 italian lire down 
from 126725 and 119225 canadian dollars up from 119095 
other late dollar rates in europe compared with late thursdays 
prices included 15130 swiss francs up from 15060 58065 
french francs up from 57935 19365 dutch guilders up from 
19307 126800 italian lire up from 126600 and 11939 
canadian dollars up from 11899 
gold prices fell sharply friday dealers attributed the decline 
to technical selling in light trading 
in new york gold fell 320 to 403 a troy ounce on the 
commodity exchange and republic national bank later quoted a bid 
of 40325 a troy ounce down 345 from thursday 
gold fell earlier in london to a late bid of 40325 a troy

cigna corp said friday it was dropping 
personal auto insurance coverage because the division generates 
little business and is only marginally profitable 
cignas specialty is commercial insurance coverage and is rated 
one of the nations largest in that area cigna has only 08 
percent of the national business in personal auto insurance 
the insurance giant had annual premiums of 115 billion last 
year of which personal auto insurance accounted for only 215 
million 
the personal auto insurance is only marginally profitable at 
best and therefore we have decided to stop cigna spokesman jim 
beattie said 
beattie said the problem stems from higher repair bills medical 
bills and legal expenses cigna does not generate enough business 
to offset those costs and could not in the near future he said 
cigna has decided to concentrate on its commercial coverage 
lines as well as continue restructuring its agency division the 
company sells to individuals and small businesses through 
independent agents cigna said it would be severing exclusive 
contracts with 220 independents by the end of next year 
two weeks ago the head of the division handling the 
independents david j prentiss resigned 
beattie said the company will generally quit writing new auto 
policies and agents will be asked to renew existing policies with 
other carriers as the policies come due 
because of the change beattie said socalled umbrella 
policies cigna has offered for complete insurance coverage through 
one company would not be renewed 
but he said the company will continue to write homeowner 
insurance even though it is also a very small part of cignas 
business commercial vehicle coverage also will continue to be 
available 
beattie said some personal auto insurance policies will be 
honored and sold by agents who hold exclusive contracts with cigna 
we will meet or exceed all state regulations and honor all 
contractual agreements he said 
cigna said no layoffs are expected because of the personal auto 
coverage decision

reflected fears that the tesnions could escalate into a general

site of three oil spills since jan 1 exxon also has come under 
criticism and faces a federal criminal indictment in connection 
with a large oil spill in alaska last year 
on wednesday a leaking barge owned by a private contractor 
spilled 30000 gallons into the kill van kull waterway while taking 
on a loan of heating oil at exxons bayonne terminal

fuel line broke free while a texaco barge was being filled at the 
bayway refinery thursday resulting in a 4800gallon spill in the 
arthur kill waterway 
a ruptured pipeline at the bayway refinery on jan 12 dumped 
567000 gallons of oil into the arthur kill 
exxon was blamed for the january spill and eklof marine corp of 
staten island ny took responsibility for wednesdays mishap 
coast guard capt robert north said officials havent determined 
who was to blame for thursdays spill he said the spill largely 
was contained by booms and did not appear to have spread into the 
harbor 
rep robert torricelli dnj said he had written exxon 
chairman and chief executive lawrence rawl requesting that the 
company voluntarily impose emergency procedures at the two new 
jersey facilities 
this is either an extraordinary coincidence of accidents or 
exxon is simply not doing a good job of meeting minimum 
standards torricelli said 
he called on exxon to voluntarily place booms around all vessels 
during oil transfers and temporarily halt night operations until 
they the company reviewed its procedures but exxon went further 
attorney general robert abrams of new york called on exxon to 
submit to an independent environmental audit of the companys 
operation in new york and new jersey 
abrams said that in light of the cumulative adverse impact of 
these repeated spills resolute and extraordinary action on exxons 
part is overdue

texas air corp and its eastern airlines 
subsidiary threatened unspecified action friday to clear their 
names after a court report said texas air shortchanged eastern 
when it bought the airline and some of its assets 
texas air agreed earlier this week to pay eastern more than 280 
million to settle the findings by courtappointed bankruptcy 
examiner david i shapiro he concluded that texas air owes eastern 
285 million to 403 million for assets it purchased at unfairly 
low prices 
shapiros findings supported a key contention by striking 
eastern workers who claimed texas air stripped the airline of its 
most valuable assets to bolster the parents nonunion carrier 
continental airlines 
eastern and texas air said thursday they rejected the validity 
of shapiros conclusions in a statement friday they also 
threatened to take serious and considered actions to vindicate 
themselves 
we find ourselves in the intolerable position where our 
commitments to rebuild eastern are being improperly used to imply 
that texas air somehow agrees with this amateurish report and that 
our assistance to eastern somehow constitutes payment to settle any 
such liabilities the statement said 
texas air spokesman art kent declined comment on what form the 
action might take he said discussions on various options are under 
way and a decision would be made soon 
richard seltzer an attorney for the air line pilots 
association said it was difficult to see what the companies might 
do other than file an objection with federal bankruptcy court 
shapiro didnt return a telephone call seeking comment 
shapiro said in the report that he did not agree with the 
unions request that eastern be run by an outside trustee which 
was sought as protection against further asset sales by texas air 
during bankruptcy reorganization 
union attorneys insisted a trustee still should be named to take 
over management of the company 
approval of the settlement by us bankruptcy judge burton r 
lifland could remove a main obstacle in easterns effort to emerge 
from bankruptcy because some of the compensation would help 
satisfy creditor claims against the miamibased airline 
shapiro concluded for example that eastern should recover 150 
million to 250 million from texas air for the transfer of the 
system one computer reservation system and 61 million for texas 
airs acquisition of eastern in november 1986 
under the proposed settlement eastern also would receive a 25 
percent share in system one and the right to buy 40 boeing 737300 
jets at cost from sister carrier continental the settlements 
total value is estimated at more than 280 million and includes 
133 million in cash 
shapiro issued his findings following a lengthy investigation 
into the dealings between texas air eastern and continental 
undertaken as part of easterns chapter 11 bankruptcy case 
the airline sought protection from creditors five days after a 
march 4 1989 strike by machinists flight attendants and pilots 
that virtually grounded it eastern has been reorganizing as a 
smaller carrier and has hired replacements for many of the strikers 
the pilots and flight attendants unions abandoned the strike in 
november but machinists remain on strike

the north american auto industry continues to 
have too much capacity and will need to shut five or six more 
plants in addition to the five closed down in recent years 
according to an independent study 
all the announced plant closings will not be enough to close 
the gap said william r pochiluk president of autofacts an 
independent consultant 
the firms study released thursday also said ford motor co 
made more efficient use of its manufacturing plant capacity last 
year than other major automakers 
in 1989 the study found a total industry capacity of 143 
million cars and light trucks down 1 percent from 1988 
overall the industry used 88 percent of its plant capacity last 
year manufacturers used 82 percent of capacity to make cars and 
101 percent of capacity for light trucks 
for the second year ford led the way with a 90 percent 
capacity utilization for cars and 107 percent for light trucks 
capacity utilization refers to how many vehicles a manufacturer 
actually produced a manufacturer producing at more than 100 
percent of capacity had to operate at overtime pochiluk said 
foreignbased producers manufactured at 94 percent of capacity 
with cars at 93 percent and light trucks at 101 percent 
chrysler corp achieved 86 percent capacity utilization overall 
reflecting below average performance of 76 percent for cars and 97 
percent for light trucks 
general motors corp recorded the lowest overall results in 1989 
an 82 percent overall capacity utilization rate with a low 76 
percent rate in cars offset by a light truck rate of 99 percent 
autofacts counts 79 automotive plants producing cars and light 
trucks in the united states and canada currently with a 
straighttime capacity of 144 million vehicles actual 1990 car 
and light truck production is scheduled to total 118 million 72 
million cars and 46 million light trucks 
five assembly plants are projected to open and five to close 
permanently by 1995 the study said but the industrys rated 
capacity will grow to 157 million units 
while domestic capacity should average 154 million units from 
1992 to 1995 production of light vehicles is projected to average 
134 million pochiluk said 
there are approximately 5 to 6 plants of excess capacity for 
the 199095 planning window the study said 
foreign manufacturers primarily japanese accepted the 
challenge to produce more in america the study said but the 
strategy backfired on domesitic automakers as exchange rates 
resulted in lower manufacturing costs for the transplant 
vehicles 
the study listed several auto plants it considered 
vulnerable for closure in the next five years including some 
where a shutdown is already pending 
they included gm plants in lakewood ga lordstown ohio 
scarborough ontario van nuys calif linden nj lansing 
mich arlington texas wentzville mo and orion mich 
also on the list was fords fox plant in dearborn mich 
chrysler plants in st louis brampton ontario and pillette road 
ontario and a gmtoyota joint venture in fremont calif

a superior court judge friday cleared the 
way for channel one a daily news show with commercials aimed at 
teenagers to begin beaming into north carolina classrooms 
the news show being produced by whittle communications of 
knoxville tenn is set to begin nationally on monday 
after an allday hearing judge donald stephens ruled that the 
state board of education has the authority to ban the 12minute 
news program but did not follow the correct procedures in imposing 
a ban feb 1 
his order dismisses a lawsuit brought by the state board of 
education against the thomasville school system and whittle 
communications it also reverses a decision by the state board that 
contracts signed for channel one before feb 1 are void and that no 
new contracts can be signed 
after a careful review the court concludes that the state 
board of education has the authority to make rules concerning 
supplemental materials that contain advertising stephens said 
but he said the state board must follow procedures for rulemaking 
by state agencies 
the boards ban had been imposed immediately as an emergency 
rule while the board pursued procedures to make it permanent but 
stephens ruled because there was no evidence of an immediate threat 
to the public welfare by allowing channel one to proceed 
the 12minute news program contains two minutes of commercials 
and more than 2700 schools have signed up for the service 
nationwide 
about 30 school boards in north carolina have signed up for the 
service which loans local schools video equipment in exchange for 
a guarantee that the news show will be shown to students every day 
edwin speas representing the state board argued that the 
required viewing of channel one amounted to exploitation of 
students who are required to be in school under the states 
compulsory attendance law 
but stephens ruled that the contracts with whittle do not 
violate public policy or the state constitution because no valid 
rule against the contracts in effect 
we think its a victory for children and teachers in north 
carolina said max walser superintendent of the davidson county 
schools davidson countys school board which had signed a 
contract with whittle prior to the ban had filed a countersuit 
against the state board of education 
we are certainly pleased that the judge ruled as we have 
felt that the state board acted improperly said gene causby of 
the state school boards association those contracts are back in 
force 
speas said after the ruling that it did not amount to a total 
victory for channel one supporters 
the court has confirmed their the state boards authority 
in this area which was very important speas said the judge 
said that a rule can be made it just has to follow the regulations 
of the administrative procedures act 
speas said an official notice that the state board intends to 
impose the ban already has been given and a public hearing required 
by rulemaking regulations has been scheduled for april 2 
the existing contracts are valid and channel one will premiere 
in north carolina schools on march 5 said ed winter president 
of whittle communications those school systems that have not yet 
signed contracts but would like to are now free to do so
