the navy announced it was terminating 
lockheed corps 600 million contract for the p7a patrol plane 
saying the company had defaulted in its attempt to build a new 
antisubmarine plane 
but the companys head said saturday that the cancellation had 
ridded lockheed of a costly headache and may even help in the long 
run 
the navy said in its announcement friday that lockheed had 
defaulted on the contract in january 1989 
under a default the service can demand a full refund of all 
money paid the company or can find an alternative manufacturer for 
the p7a and sue lockheed for any costs in excess of the contract 
lockheed said it would appeal the termination under terms of 
default 
company chairman daniel m tellep said he considered it unlikely 
that the pentagon would look for an alternative producer but the 
navy could still demand a refund of the approximately 200 million 
it paid lockheed before the cancellation 
lockheed has incurred costs of about 300 million on the program 
so far tellep said last year it took a 300 million charge 
against profits to pay for expected cost overruns the company has 
already written off the full cost of the program 
if our appeal is successful as we expect it to be we will 
recover a major portion of the prior 300 million tellep said 
lockheed may be far better off than if it built the aircraft 
under the navys terms even though the company lost the p7a 
program in the dispute with the navy tellep said 
although the contract was valued at 600 million over four 
years lockheed officials said the firm was facing a project 
overrun as high as 1 billion on the fixedprice contract 
tellep said the company expects no further losses 
he said the cancellation signaled to lockheed and other defense 
contractors that the pentagon now is unwilling to bail out 
contractors facing losses on weapons programs 
the problem we are seeing in the industry once more 
underscores the disastrous effects of fixedprice totalpackage 
procurement he said and it is not beneficial either to the 
pentagon or to the contractors 
the termination if it stands is the latest in a series of 
blows against the aerospace firm 
since mid1988 contracts for four military planes including 
the p3 subhunter have wound down and defense cuts are looming 
because of the national budget deficit and the end of the cold war 
lockheed has also recently ended production of the f117a 
stealth fighter the c5b cargo plane and the tr1 spy plane since 
mid1988 about 9000 workers have been laid off 
earlier this year lockheed announced it would move some of its 
production to marietta ga by the mid1990s at a potential cost 
of up to 4500 jobs 
lockheed said the move would save 75 million a year

the bush administration saying it has no 
choice under the law has approved importation of some previously 
banned firearms that were modified to get around the ban according 
to a published report 
relying on documents obtained under the freedom of information 
act by the firearms policy project the washington post said 
permission has been granted to import new versions of the uzi 
ak47 galil hk91 and other assault weapons the importation of 
those weapons was prohibited last year 
the paper in mondays editions quoted officials as saying the 
new versions have been altered to remove flash suppressors grenade 
launchers bayonet attachments and other militarystyle features 
that made them unsuitable for sporting purposes 
once the militarystyle features were removed they no longer 
fit the category of semiautomatic assaulttype rifle and the 
bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms had no grounds for keeping 
them out the paper quoted batf spokeswoman dot koester as saying 
however the guns still can accept magazines of up to 30 rounds 
of ammunition and have pistolgrip type stocks that enable them to 
be reloaded quickly 
josh sugarman director of the group that made the documents 
available to the post was quoted as saying those features make 
them every bit as deadly as the banned weapons and makes a 
mockery of last years action 
attempts to obtain a home telephone listing sunday night for ms 
koester were unsuccessful and sugarmans telephone was answered by 
an answering machine

the entire opposition in parliament 
angry about the alliance of the governing party with two smaller 
groups resigned en masse monday and called for new general 
elections 
the 79 opposition deputies in the 299member national assembly 
turned in their resignations to assembly speaker park chunkyu at 
his office in the parliament building 
it marks the first time that all of the opposition members in 
the national assembly resigned 
the mass resignations came at a time when the government of 
president roh taewoo has announced its willingness to negotiate a 
border opening with communist north korea preparations are being 
made for the first meeting between the prime ministers of the two 
koreas 
the governing democratic liberal party said the resignations 
would not be immediately accepted under korean law the speaker 
can hold the resignations until the next parliament session in 
september when they would be voted upon 
the opposition party for peace and democracy which has 71 
seats and the splinter democratic party with eight seats said 
their legislators and their staffs were resigning and would not 
accept their salaries as of monday 
kim daejung head of the largest opposition party welcomed 
rohs call for opening the border with north korea but he warned 
roh not to make the border opening a partisan issue 
opposition forces have charged roh with using northsouth talks 
as a means of diverting public attention from domestic problems 
including inflation land speculation corruption and the need for 
more democratic reforms 
the oppositions demand for new general elections results from 
the merger in january between rohs party and two former opposition 
groups the opposition contends the merger amounted to a coup 
which vaulted rohs forces in the parliament from a minority to 
more than a twothirds majority 
the opposition lawmakers are also demanding that local elections 
be held for the first time since they were abolished 30 years ago 
local elections are planned for this year but no date has been set 
yet 
merger talks are under way to unify a nationwide dissident group 
and the two opposition parties by september if successful it 
would mark the first time south koreas factionriddled opposition 
have been united under one banner

the security chief at the french 
embassy in beirut is among three police officers formally charged 
with roles in a ring that allegedly smuggled weapons to the french 
underworld a court source says 
the three who allegedly bought weapons from lebanese 
militiamen were charged on saturday and judge patrick ardid 
ordered them taken to a detention house in this port city said the 
source who would not be quoted by name 
the beirut security chief jeanclaude labourdette 47 had been 
posted at the french embassy since 1984 and was identified by the 
other suspects as the ringleader he was flown to france from 
lebanon on thursday 
the other two suspects patrick jacquin 28 and jeanneol 
lebat 30 were brought back from washington where they had been 
serving as security officers in the french embassy both had 
formerly been posted to the embassy in beirut 
marseille prosecutor olivier dropet said last week that 
labourdette was among about 10 policemen implicated so far in the 
arms ring which allegedly sold in marseille about 100 assault 
rifles automatic pistols and other arms 
the arms allegedly were purchased in lebanon a former french 
mandate and shipped back in diplomatic trunks that were exempt 
from exemption 
the foreign ministry ordered an internal investigation of the 
scandal but said last week that no evidence was found that any 
diplomatic personnel had been involved 
the gang then allegedly resold the weapons to criminals 
including a gang that specialized in armored car robberies police 
said rocket launchers discovered at labourdettes home south of 
paris on wednesday were of a type used in attacks on armored cars 
two security guards were killed in a holdup with assault rifles 
in marseille in march

everyone knows bedford is the limestone 
capital of the world right as it turns out no one told weeping 
water neb 
it didnt seem real said janet demaree a bedford resident 
who recently traveled to nebraska only to find weeping water touted 
as none other than the limestone capital of the world the claim 
was right there in the south east nebraska visitors guide that 
demaree picked up at a motel 
i read it and i thought theyre telling a lie everyone 
knows its bedford demaree said 
kay lindsey didnt know the city clerk of weeping water a town 
of 1100 about 30 miles south of omaha said she had never heard of 
bedford let alone its claim to limestone greatness bedford with 
a population of 18000 is situated 90 miles south of indianapolis 
many older buildings in weeping water are built of native 
limestone and residents celebrate the fourth of july with a 
limestoneindependence day celebration complete with tours of 
quarries dancing and fireworks the tour guide said 
it was like reading our own newspaper demaree said 
bill mcdonald executive director of the indiana limestone 
institute was equally surprised apart from bath england 
mcdonald said he can think of no other area in the world with a 
limestone industry as developed as bedfords 
but five companies mine limestone in weeping water and thats 
practically what the whole town is lindsey said 
there are some distinctions the weeping water stone is taken 
from underground mines rather than quarries as in bedford and 
most of it is processed into gravel 
that may be why bill finley of the weeping water valley 
historical society can think of no nationally known building 
constructed from weeping water limestone 
indiana limestone on the other hand was used to build the 
empire state building and the united nations headquarters in new 
york as well as the pentagon and national cathedral in washington

rescue workers said sunday they were 
giving up hope of finding more survivors trapped in the ruins of 
buildings here six days after an earthquake struck killing 862 
people 
rescue workers said they would meet later in the day with 
filipino authorities to discuss calling off the search for more 
survivors in the ruins of nearly 30 buildings in the mountain 
resort of baguio 
willie mcmartin of scotland leader of a british rescue team 
said his group would decide whether to shift from rescue operations 
to recovering the dead 
mcmartin said that tapping sounds beneath the ruins of the hyatt 
hotel in baguio had ceased and it appeared that no one remained 
alive there 
the official death toll from mondays quake rose to 862 as more 
bodies were discovered and more than 3000 people were reported 
injured but officials said the death toll may surpass 1000 
because hundreds are feared dead in an industrial park and a remote 
farming area in nueva vizcaya province 
hundreds of survivors were flown sunday to manila from baguio 
where food and fuel supplies were running low the evacuees 
included an undetermined number of foreigners including jordanians 
and europeans 
on saturday communist rebels declared a unilateral ceasefire 
in manila and the quakeravaged north rightwing military 
dissidents offered to declare a ceasefire if the government 
suspended efforts to capture them 
many leaders of the dissident movement are graduates of the 
philippine military academy in baguio one of the towns hardest hit 
by the quake 
in baguio filipino miners burrowed beneath the ruins of the 
hyatt hotel in a desperate bid to reach any survivors trapped under 
the rubble 
more than 40 people remain unaccounted for at the hyatt one of 
eight hotels in baguio which collapsed or were badly damaged in the 
quake which measured 77 on the richter scale 
officials had already given up hope of finding more people alive 
at the other hotels 
the rescue efforts were temporarily suspended saturday after 
small aftershocks rattled baguio cracking the walls of its 
cathedral the aftershocks were also felt in manila 130 miles to 
the south 
the miners strengthened their tunnel and later resumed their 
efforts 
filipino miners had said earlier that when they tapped against 
debris blocking access to the hotels basement gymnasium they 
could hear distinctive knocks in response 
but mcmartin said the tapping ceased following the aftershocks 
there are no sounds at all mcmartin told reporters it 
means effectively that the person making the sounds has died 
asked if he believed anyone was still alive at the hyatt 
mcmartin replied no 
on sunday roman catholic masses were said outdoors in baguios 
burnham park because bishop ernesto salgado said it was too 
dangerous to worship inside the cathedral 
salgado said priests visited collapsed buildings blessing the 
bodies of those who may be entombed there 
jose de jesus presidential relief coordinator for baguio said 
135 people were believed trapped inside eight factories but all are 
believed dead 
de jesus said information on deaths and damage was still 
trickling in from remote areas including nueva vizcaya province 
where many villages and roads were buried by landslides 
philippine pilots who surveyed the areas saw huge columns of 
survivors walking over the mountains to safety pilots said they 
looked like columns of ants silhouetted against the barren 
mountain slopes 
reports sunday said at least 104 people were killed in nueva 
vizcaya villagers said many of the dead were children entombed 
while playing on hillsides when the quake struck 
presidential spokesman horacio paredes said experts believe 
trapped survivors would not be able to survive past tuesday and 
officials will soon have to decide when to abandon rescue efforts 
radio station dzrh said a group of village chiefs from the 
baguio area complained saturday that food supplies flown to the 
city had not been distributed to them and people were suffering 
from hunger 
its all just in the newspapers its all talk said one 
chief who gave his name only as panlillo 
president corazon aquino friday had defended her government 
against criticism that relief efforts were poorly organized 
in baguio witnesses said they feared an outbreak of disease if 
the government did not increase relief efforts 
theres no sanitation said john pike 44 an australian who 
was evacuated to manila on saturday the situation is horrible 
and not much is being done in a week there might be an outbreak of 
typhoid 
armed gangs were looting and mugging pedestrians at night in 
baguio

president bush seized the opportunity saturday 
to replace the supreme courts leading liberal by launching a 
hurryup search for the successor to retired justice william j 
brennan 
conservatives quickly staked their claim for a continuation of 
the reagan legacy on the high court while liberals expressed 
concern that the next appointment would tip the scales on abortion 
affirmative action and other divisive social issues 
top candidates to succeed brennan include solicitor general 
kenneth w starr federal appellate judges edith h jones and 
patrick e higginbotham of the 5th circuit william w wilkins jr 
of the 4th circuit and david souter of the 1st circuit 
a day after brennan made his surprise announcement bush 
convened an earlymorning meeting with chief of staff john sununu 
white house counsel c boyden gray and attorney general dick 
thornburgh to begin the process of finding a new supreme court 
justice 
following the 75minute meeting bush vowed to make a quick 
nomination 
i am going to try to make this determination as soon as 
possible the process is moving the president told reporters as 
he left washington aboard air force one to christen a new aircraft 
carrier in newport news va 
gray and thornburgh continued the discussions during an 
hourlong meeting at the justice department 
administration officials predicted the review of some 15 
candidates would be concluded with an announcement of a nominee in 
a week to 10 days 
bush is eager to have a candidate nominated and confirmed by the 
senate in time to take the bench for the supreme courts next term 
which begins the first monday in october officials said 
brennans unexpected departure at age 84 gives the president his 
first supreme court appointment as well as an opportunity to 
consolidate gains that conservatives made on the high court during 
the reagan administration 
before brennans retirement conservatives held a slender 54 
majority on the high court but brennans successor would give them 
a 63 majority 
bush declined to discuss the names of the candidates under 
review or characterize their judicial philosophy 
starr 44 who serves as the justice departments chief supreme 
court advocate has been considered a prime candidate for the high 
court since bush took office 
when he gave up a lifetime appointment on the us circuit court 
of appeals here to become solicitor general there was widespread 
speculation starr was positioning himself for the high court 
souter 50 appointed to the new hampshire supreme court in 1983 
by sununu when he was governor of the state was named to the 1st 
circuit earlier this year 
he was promoted by sen warren rudman nh as an alternative 
nominee after the senate killed president reagans nomination of 
robert bork in 1987 
wilkins who chairs the us sentencing commission is a 
perennial candidate of sen strom thurmond rsc the ranking gop 
member of the senate judiciary committee 
the list of possible candidates includes other federal appellate 
judges roger j miner and ralph k winter jr both of the 2nd 
circuit j harvie wilkinson iii of the 4th circuit and pamela a 
rymer a former federal district judge whom bush recently put on 
the 9th circuit 
other possible candidate are clarence thomas a black 
conservative recently named to the dc circuit here and laurence 
silberman a member of the same court on friday silberman joined 
in a ruling that set aside oliver l norths irancontra 
convictions 
he was reportedly passed over for consideration during the 
reagan administration because of concerns he lacked judicial 
temperament 
also mentioned as a possible candidate is us trade 
representative carla hills but conservatives are expected to fight 
her appointment to the supreme court because they suspect she is 
prochoice on the abortion issue 
in addition the washington post reported in sundays editions 
that ferdinand fernandez a federal judge from california and 
ricardo hinojosa a federal judge from texas are among those being 
mentioned either would be the first hispanic on the high court 
the new york times listed alex kozinski a member of the 9th 
circuit in san francisco as one of the federal appellate judges 
under consideration 
prochoice groups issued statements mourning brennans 
retirement from the court which was hailed by organizations 
opposed to abortion 
the antiabortion concerned women for america said it had sent a 
letter to bush urging appointment of edith jones or someone with a 
similar legal philosophy 
kate michelman executive director of the national abortion 
rights action league sought to spur political pressure on bush to 
appoint a prochoice justice 
unless there is a massive and unprecedented political 
mobilization justice brennans departure may be a death knell for 
the right to choose in america she said in a statement 
republicans have vowed that their party can accommodate 
prochoice as well as antichoice proponents this is the time to 
put reality behind that rhetoric she said 
thornburgh has long insisted there are no litmus tests 
applied by the bush administration on such issues as abortion 
during judicial selection an administration official speaking on 
condition of anonymity said that policy holds for this appointment 
sen joseph r biden ddel chairman of the senate judiciary 
committee said he hoped bush will follow the historical practice 
of consulting with senate leaders before making his choice 
ralph neas executive director of the leadership conference on 
civil rights issued a joint statement with conference chairman 
benjamin hooks calling on bush to name someone who consistently 
demonstrated a commitment to equal justice under the law 
sen orrin hatch rutah and thornburgh themselves have been 
mentioned in the past as possible highcourt nominees hatch 
appearing friday night on abctvs nightline program 
disclaimed any interest in the job saying if i had the choice 
id rather be in the senate

voice of america has been so successful in its 
40 years of chipping away at communism in eastern europe that its 
role in the region could be diminished as a result 
the last year has been full of triumphs for voa hundreds of its 
european broadcasters editors and writers have reaped the rewards 
of years of exile from their homelands and the systematic 
harassment of the friends and relatives they left behind 
but changes in eastern europe are a doubleedged sword for voa 
with a budgetconscious congress breathing down its neck the 
bush administration is considering cutting or consolidating some of 
voas overseas radio and television services 
for the time being however all agree there is still much to be 
done 
for starters one east european country albania continues to 
hold out against the tide of reform cracks appeared however in 
the control of that countrys authoritarian communist government 
when 4400 albanians rushed into several foreign embassies in 
tirana earlier this month and were subsequently allowed to leave 
the country 
zamira islami an albanian broadcaster at voa is certain the 
albanianlanguage radio programs played a major role in the exodus 
albanians who have reached refugee camps in italy say they were 
inspired to make a run for the embassies after hearing on voa of 
similar escapes last fall by east germans fleeing their repressive 
communist government 
zamira and her sister isabela escaped albania six years ago 
cleaving the waters of the ionian sea for 12 hours to the island of 
corfu their brother disappeared during the exhausting swim and 
the sisters found refuge in the united states 
their story is not an uncommon one at voa where many employees 
braved cold waters barbed wire fences and attack dogs to escape 
communism 
miro dobrovosky head of the czechoslovak service was followed 
by a russian tank down a prague street late one night in august 
1968 it was soon after the soviets invaded czechoslovakia to crush 
a burgeoning democracy movement and dobrovosky was publishing an 
underground magazine 
i was carrying 50 magazines in one hand and a loaf of bread 
in the other he said suddenly a tank gunned its engine and 
started driving behind him said dobrovosky 
i have never been so scared said the burly redhead 
after a while the tank driver gave up the chase but dobrovosky 
decided it was time to get out taking his family by train to 
vienna 
jiri fisher a czechoslovak playwright and actor defected in 
1979 and came to the voa in 1985 several weeks ago he returned 
home portraying the character of vaclav havel in a stage 
production of an autobiographical play by the famed czechoslovak 
dramatist who now serves as the countrys president 
havel reviled and jailed by the communists visited the voa 
during a trip to washington earlier this year he heaped praise on 
the radio station which he said was the most listenedto in his 
country 
jiri sykora says the czechoslovak service gets hundreds of 
letters asking that voa continue broadcasting sykora an actor and 
writer who spent a year in jail for writing an antigovernment 
manuscript left in 1969 his program in which he translates and 
sings lyrics of american songs in czech and slovak is a popular 
one 
responding to changed needs voa has augmented its news and 
culture programs with scripts about how democratic and free market 
systems work 
voa officials say east europeans still rely on the stations 
news about the world and about events in the former communist 
countries 
they trust us to sort it out events are still very confusing 
for them and journalists are only beginning to learn about the 
role of a free press in society said dobrovosky 
voa which broadcasts in 43 languages around the world is now 
able to have callin shows with listeners in eastern europe who ask 
questions about everything from the heavy pollution in their 
countries to how to start a small business

its showdown time for peanut farmers this 
week as they face a twiceadecade confrontation with congressional 
opponents of the controversial quota system thats largely 
responsible for their livelihood 
both the house and senate are expected to vote on proposals to 
terminate the supply management peanut program opponents contend 
it costs consumers of peanut butter and other peanut products 369 
million a year 
this is the one vote on a single issue that could have the 
most severe economic impact on my district said rep charles 
hatcher dga whose district produces more peanuts than any other 
in the country 
the only thing comparable would be for the department of 
defense to announce they were closing moody air force base and the 
marine base he said referring to the two military installations 
in his district 
under the program the secretary of agriculture each year 
determines the volume of peanuts needed to meet domestic demand and 
then assigns that quota to farms that traditionally have grown 
peanuts a separate law places sharp restrictions on peanut 
imports forcing manufacturers to buy from american farmers 
neither side is predicting victory although lawmakers in both 
camps suggested last week that the senate offers opponents their 
best shot at killing the program 
the senate last voted on the peanut program in 1981 when it 
survived 5147 thirtythree of the 47 senators who opposed the 
program that year are still in the senate but only 31 of the 51 
supporters remain 
sen william roth rdel who is leading the senate effort to 
abolish the quota system said friday that he was within striking 
distance of the 51 votes needed to prevail 
but roth conceded eliminating any program is tough in 
congress no matter what it is 
rep richard armey rtexas whos sponsoring the house 
amendment to abolish the program was less optimistic but he said 
the peanut program may prove to be the most vulnerable of several 
farm programs being targeted by a coalition of liberal democrats 
and conservative republicans 
hatcher agreed 
im not comfortable he said you just never know 
roth and armey are offering identical proposals that would 
replace the quota system with a more traditional price support 
system similar to that used for other crops the secretary of 
agriculture would set a support price each year based on such 
factors as peanut demand and cost of production 
currently farmers with peanut quotas are guaranteed 631 a ton 
for their crop farmers who grow peanuts without a quota mainly 
for the export market are guaranteed only about 150 a ton 
georgia and alabama which produce about twothirds of nations 
peanuts have the most to lose the georgia peanut commission for 
example has estimated that termination of the program would cut 
the income of peanut farmers by 30 percent 
the parochial nature of the program with just seven states 
producing 98 percent of the quota peanuts makes it an attractive 
target 
its sort of like feudalism roth said why should those 
individuals who have been favored in the past be able to keep other 
farmers from participating 
proponents like hatcher argue however that the peanut program 
is the one farm program that costs the taxpayer virtually nothing 
and they contend that it provides economic stability to thousands 
of small farms and communities in peanut producing states 
but armey said he believes that argument is losing its appeal in 
congress because farmers are not seen as an underprivileged 
underclass group of american citizens anymore

a republican sponsor of a bill guaranteeing up 
to three months unpaid leave for workers with new babies or family 
emergencies predicts the house wont be able to override president 
bushs veto this week 
the house scheduled a vote thursday on bushs veto of the bill 
which passed the chamber in may with bipartisan support but 
supporters were 46 votes short of the twothirds majority needed to 
override 
the chief republican sponsor rep marge roukema rnj said 
friday that she did not believe supporters had picked up the needed 
margin 
i just dont see that the votes are there roukema said 
this veto will go through and well come back this fall or 
maybe next year with a new bill 
house speaker thomas foley dwash dismissed the suggestion 
that by scheduling the vote instead of delaying it that house 
leaders had given up on efforts to win an override majority 
no its usual and customary to take up an override within 
a reasonable and short period foley said 
either way house democrats are encouraged by recent polls 
showing public majorities support the family leave idea and hope to 
use it against republican opponents in the fall elections 
if i were a democrat thats what i would do roukema said 
the veto was the 13th of the bush presidency all have been 
sustained 
democrats accused bush of abandoning what appeared to be his 
support for jobprotected leave that he expressed during the 1988 
presidential campaign he since has said he favors employers making 
leave available on a voluntary basis but that he opposes making it 
a federal requirement 
mary tavener lobbyist for one of the business groups opposing 
the bill the national association of wholesalerdistributors said 
her side was confident it would sustain the veto and hoped for an 
even larger vote than on the house passage 
business leaders met with bush at the white house last week 
where the president reaffirmed his opposition to the measure she 
said 
part of our strategy is to pick up some of the republicans who 
voted yes on the bill but want to support the president she 
said what we would like to see is a very very strong vote for 
the president so there will be a clear message this is not the kind 
of legislation that is going to get anywhere in the future 
the bill passed the senate on a voice vote after leaders reached 
a bipartisan agreement to avoid a roll call 
the bill would require business and government employers to 
provide workers with up to 12 weeks of unpaid medical leave or with 
leave for the care of a new child or an ill child parent or spouse 
it would exempt businesses with fewer than 50 workers and 
workers who are among the highestpaid 10 percent within a company 
employers would have to continue health insurance benefits for 
those on leave and restore returning employees to their previous 
jobs or equivalent positions 
bush said the bill would restrict flexibility needed by american 
business to be competitive in world markets it was strongly 
opposed by business groups 
but backers of the bill said the united states was the only 
industrialized nation that does not provide such minimum job 
guarantees to workers 
washington mayor marion barry on friday signed a local parental 
leave law that includes gay partners in the definition of family 
members 
all district of columbia legislation is subject to override by 
congress and there was no immediate indication whether an attempt 
would be made to do so in this case

republican gov mike hayden is in a fight 
for his political life as he catches blame for rising property 
taxes and the scorn of sophisticates who disdain his hayseed image 
and thats just in the gop primary 
if he survives the sixway aug 7 primary haydens next 
obstacle to reelection is likely to be former gov john carlin 
the frontrunner in a threeway democratic primary carlin wants 
his old job back after sitting out a term because the state 
constitution barred him from serving three consecutive terms 
hayden said he knew it would be tough to win reelection when 
large numbers of kansans began protesting sharp property tax 
increases late last year 
as house speaker in 1985 hayden was one among several major 
players when the state revised its property tax system but hes 
catching a big share of the blame for the resulting tax increases 
we knew we would catch the heat because the property tax 
increases happened on my watch as governor hayden said 
the tax issue combined with the governors general unpopularity 
in the states metropolitan areas has raised speculation that 
hayden could be the first republican governor nearly two decades to 
be denied renomination by his party 
a june 2728 poll of 400 likely gop voters gave hayden a narrow 
46 percent to 37 percent lead over his closest gop rival real 
estate executive nestor weigand the survey by tarrance amp 
associates of houston had a margin of error of plus or minus 5 
percentage points 
john pinegar haydens campaign manager said haydens polling 
has never showed the contest to be as narrow as a singledigit 
race hayden expresses confidence hell win the primary possibly 
with a majority of the gop vote 
haydens chief rivals for the gop nomination weigand and lawyer 
richard peckham fault the governor for a lack of leadership this 
year as the legislature failed to make changes to ease the property 
tax crunch 
our entire state government is deadlocked in petty political 
squabbling with major problems going unaddressed weigand said 
leadership must come from the top 
peckham echoes the complaint we continue to hear all over the 
state heavyduty frustration over a lack of leadership on mike 
haydens part he said 
carlin too is hammering on the leadership theme 
mike hayden has failed to provide leadership at a critical 
time in the states history and the people are tremendously 
frustrated carlin said hes guided the state from one crisis 
to another 
carlin is favored to win the democratic primary over two 
challengers treasurer joan finney and topeka baptist minister fred 
phelps 
a march poll on possible generalelection matchups showed hayden 
trailing carlin by 11 percentage points 44 percent to 33 percent 
the survey conducted for the topeka capitaljournal had a 44 
percentage point margin of error 
carlin was governor in 1985 when the property tax system was 
changed so that issue may be a wash if he faces off against 
hayden but carlin also carries the political baggage of being 
twicedivorced and the animosity any governor creates in eight 
years in office 
in the gop primary contest the national and state gop officials 
are rallying to haydens defense hayden has received preprimary 
endorsements from president bush and vice president dan quayle 
with bush labeling him a national leader whose voice is respected 
in washington 
senate minority leader bob dole and his wife labor secretary 
elizabeth dole have made campaign appearances for hayden 
the state gop has unashamedly thrown its support behind hayden 
denying the other republican contenders access to a computer list 
of registered gop voters on grounds hayden raised the money that 
enabled the party to compile it 
haydens problems go beyond the leadership and property tax 
issue the native of smalltown atwood in northwest kansas just is 
not popular in kansas two metropolitan areas wichita and suburban 
kansas city 
some detractors say they are turned off by haydens hick 
image fostered by his twangy voice some gop sophisticates in 
affluent johnson county refer to hayden as governor hayseed 
hayden maintains he has built up his support in metropolitan 
areas since 1986 and expects to score points for a highvisibility 
highway improvement program and his prochoice abortion stand 
the fact that were the only prochoice candidate among 
republicans means the other candidates are dividing the prolife 
vote and there are more prochoice than prolife people out 
there he said

british detectives who investigated the murder of 
a top kenyan minister believe his cabinet colleagues may have been 
responsible for his death a newspaper said sunday 
the sunday correspondent quoting unidentified senior diplomatic 
sources said the motive for foreign minister robert oukos death 
was his insistence on investigating corruption allegations against 
his fellow ministers 
the weekly described ouko as an able and admired politician and 
an adept diplomat with a growing international reputation 
it said his death was presented as a suicide but when he was 
found near his home in kisumu on feb 13 he had been shot in the 
head and his body was partially burnt 
kenyan authorities called in detectives from the london police 
headquarters at scotland yard to investigate the crime 
the newspaper said that last month that the detectives handed an 
interim report to kenyan authorities which has not been published 
a final report is now being written and should be completed by the 
end of this month 
the sunday correspondent predicted that although the kenyan 
government might not publish the final report its contents could 
end the rule of president daniel arap moi 
moi is currently under pressure from aid donors including the 
united states to make political reforms antigovernment riots in 
nairobi earlier this month resulted in almost two dozen deaths

farzad bazoft the iranianborn journalist who was 
hanged in iraq after being convicted of espionage might have saved 
his life if he had refused to make the confession his captors 
demanded a newspaper said sunday 
bazoft believed his interrogators when they told him he would 
be released if he confessed reported the observer which 
employed him at the time of his arrest 
bazoft 31 was executed in baghdad on march 15 
daphne parish 53 the british nurse accused with him refused 
his urging to make a joint confession and was sentenced to 15 years 
in prison 
mrs parish was freed july 16 after intervention by zambian 
president kenneth kaunda a friend of iraqi president saddam 
hussein she arrived home on wednesday 
bazoft went to iraq from london on an official press visit in 
the aftermath of the iraniraq war while there he investigated 
reports of a massive explosion at a military installation south of 
baghdad 
he met mrs parish who was working in a baghdad hospital and 
asked her to drive him to the site bazoft took photographs and 
collected dust samples he was arrested as he was about to fly home 
in september and mrs parish was arrested at her workplace 
the observer which last week interviewed mrs parish about her 
10 months under arrest and in prison said that when she and bazoft 
met in the interrogation center where they were being questioned 
the journalist told her look well probably be flying out in a 
day or so if we get these last points sorted out 
the report said bazoft was suggesting that she also should 
confess to being a spy but when he urged her do it do it 
she replied look farzad ive told them everything there is i 
have nothing else but he said tell them everything dee and 
well be out of here 
according to the report when mrs parish refused to make a 
confession her interrogators kicked her pulled her hair 
threatened her with a length of rubber hose held a knife in front 
of her and blindfolded her she was also put under pressure to 
incriminate a contact in the british embassy in baghdad 
the report said she was shown a videotape of bazofts confession 
and when she met him again she asked why he had done it he 
replied because of the electric shocks they gave me a prepared 
statement 
the report went on she had no chance to ask him if the shocks 
had been threatened or actually given but she got the impression 
he thought things were looking up that once he had given them a 
confession he would be free 
the report said both pleaded innocent at their trial by a 
military court

the defense for three former northwest 
airlines pilots accused of flying while drunk will argue that in 
spite of blood test results alcohol had no effect on their 
performance lawyers say 
you cant fake a perfect flight and a perfect landing said 
william mauzy the lawyer for former 1st officer robert kirchner 
the routine nature of the flight is the best evidence that mr 
kirchner was not impaired 
the trial of kirchner of highland ranch colo capt norman 
prouse of conyers ga and flight engineer joseph balzer of 
antioch tenn is scheduled to begin wednesday in us district 
court 
assistant us attorney elizabeth de la vega said its the first 
time the federal government has charged a pilot of a commercial 
flight with flying while under the influence of alcohol a felony 
the maximum penalty 15 years in prison and a 250000 fine 
kirchner piloted the boeing 727 from fargo nd to minneapolis 
on march 8 the plane carrying 91 passengers left as scheduled at 
625 am less than seven hours after kirchner prouse and balzer 
were seen drinking at a bar in moorhead minn adjacent to fargo 
a bar patron tipped the federal aviation administration and 
northwest that the crew was quite intoxicated and might be 
piloting an early morning flight according to records 
an faa investigator has testified the crew members smelled of 
alcohol at the airport while he was phoning for instructions the 
plane departed another faa official made a citizens arrest when 
they arrived at minneapolisst paul international airport 
peter wold prouses lawyer said bloodalcohol tests wont be 
enough to convict the pilots even though readings for all three 
equaled or exceeded 010 percent 
that is the level cited in the 1986 antidrug abuse act 
prohibiting operation of a common carrier while under the influence 
of alcohol or drugs as evidence that a person is presumed to be 
under the influence its also the legal limit for driving a 
vehicle in most states 
prouse had the highest readings in tests by the faa and 
northwest 012 percent and 010 percent 
there is a presumption that one is under the influence at 
010 but the issue here is impairment wold said the charge 
is whether they were under the influence not whether their 
bloodalcohol was over 010 
de la vega would not comment on her strategy but wold and mauzy 
said she is likely to emphasize the bloodalcohol tests and 
testimony from people in the bar who observed prouse drink 19 mixed 
drinks rum and diet cokes and kirchner and balzer share seven 
pitchers of beer 
bar patrons said prouse fell out of his chair and got lost on 
the way back to his hotel investigators said 
the jury may have the inclination to convict based on the 
antecedent behaviors mauzy said we have to make them focus 
not on what could have been but what was and that was a 
perfectly executed flight 
we need to make the jury concentrate on the real issue these 
guys ability to fly wold said 
minnesotabased northwest fired all three for violating a 
company rule by drinking within 12 hours of a scheduled flight the 
faa revoked their licenses for drinking within eight hours of a 
scheduled flight and for having bloodalcohol levels exceeding 004 
percent 
the pilots have said they will appeal the revocations 
the case prompted a few pilots to seek treatment for alcohol 
abuse a union official says and made some air travelers skeptical 
of pilot drinking habits on april 19 a northwest flight from 
detroit to atlanta was delayed four hours after a passenger asked 
if a substitute pilot had been partying 
there is no doubt that this has hurt the publics image of the 
airline pilot said john mazor a spokesman for the air line 
pilots association in washington dc 
duane worth alpa president at northwest said maybe a 
handful of northwests 5600 pilots sought treatment for 
alcoholism following the arrests 
in north dakota the three face state misdemeanor charges 
punishable by a 1000 fine and one year in prison trial is set 
for aug 27

colleges are recruiting topnotch college 
professors in much the same way professional sports teams lure star 
athletes the american council on education said sunday 
although little can compare with the salary and compensation 
offered to athletes star professors are being coaxed away from 
comfortable positions with promises of higher pay better research 
opportunities help with housing costs reduced teaching loads and 
even jobs for spouses 
such offers were unheard of only a few years ago but the 
councils annual state of the campus report found that a 
shortage of qualified faculty predicted to begin in 1995 already 
has begun 
so far these very attractive recruiting packages are pretty 
much for star faculty really highly qualified faculty who are 
going to help make the reputation of the department said elaine 
elkhawas the councils vice president for policy analysis and 
research who wrote this years campus trends 1990 
colleges and universities will have to make more competitive 
offers as it gets more difficult to hire the people they want 
not just the wellknown faculty she said 
the association of american universities said in a recent report 
the nation is expected to suffer an annual shortage of 7500 
natural science and engineering doctorates early in the next 
century shortages of doctorate degrees in the humanities and 
social sciences will occur even sooner it said 
highdemand academic fields include math science computer

academic officers found nearly all of them were concerned about 
the effects of shortages on at least a few departments or 
disciplines while more than half were worried about the impact on 
their institutions generally 
existing shortages have worsened in the past year the survey 
said 63 percent of the 364 institutions reported greater difficulty 
in getting top applicants to accept positions while 65 percent 
reported it was taking longer to find qualified persons for job 
openings 
last year only half the institutions had similar responses 
sixtyfive percent of all institutions said they have taken 
steps recently to improve fringe benefits for faculty while 79 
percent reported efforts to increase the attractiveness of 
available jobs to current faculty members 
more competition compels institutions to offer higher 
salaries better research opportunities help with housing costs 
or reduced teaching loads said elkhawas the rising cost of 
retaining and attracting topnotch teachers and researchers will 
increase the pressure on college administrators students families 
and public policy makers 
a common strategy is to offer new faculty unusually high 
salaries that elkhawas said in highdemand fields could average 
40000 although they differ with the institutions salaries for 
new faculty usually are in the mid30000 range 
a real faculty star who is an expert in laboratory sciences 
could negotiate for stateoftheart labs with two or three 
assistants a certain level of travel and publication funds a 
very large package of benefits elkhawas said 
if its a star humanities person negotiations could include 
sabbaticals after only two years traditionally sabbaticals are 
granted after more than a halfdozen years she said 
elkhawas conceded that such actions could soon lead to tuition 
increases or other increased costs as universities try to cover 
the costs 
to avoid the problem donna waselus said the university of 
pennsylvania last year decided to seek donations to pay for 
additional prestigious facility positions the goal is to have by 
1995 200 or more endowed chairs 125 million per chair 
the survey found that 41 percent of institutions have hired 
faculty in highdemand fields at a salary above their usual scale 
or their generally accepted salary range 
twentyfive percent of institutions reported hiring new junior 
faculty in a few fields at salaries above those of senior faculty 
in the same department 
nearly half of the institutions reported having recruiting 
situations involving dualcareer couples and about four in 10 have 
assisted a spouses job search

over a span of two decades as hes discovered brothers and sisters 
he hadnt known existed

seven siblings meet a sister they havent seen in more than three 
decades 
all of us under the same roof finally said grimm 34 of 
charleston after so many years the anticipation is huge its 
like waiting for christmas morning

about 1 and his father was serving time in prison for stealing 
copper wire from a mine and selling it to buy food for the family 
the children were either adopted or taken in by relatives 
the family reunion began 21 years ago when a friend told grimm 
and his twin brother gary they had an older brother who lived

i dont know how many times when we were bored gary and i would 
wish we had a brother or a sister to play with 
since then grimm has met five other siblings his birth mother 
and the five children she had by a second marriage 
but he said the puzzle remained incomplete without his sister 
sandra 
when wed all get together bobby the oldest brother would 
say i wonder where little sandra is wed wonder if she were 
living or dead grimm said 
but it turns out sandra was looking for them too 
this summer sandra goldman 37 of leander texas found grimm 
and his seven other siblings after years of searching including an 
unsuccessful visit to charleston two years ago 
one of goldmans adopted cousins who lives in the area took up 
the search on her behalf at the library the cousin found an 
obituary that led him to an aunt who provided names and telephone 
numbers 
she called and said this is your sister sandra grimm 
said all i could think to say was but nobody knows where you 
are i was just astounded

a blast caused by a commercial 
explosive that has become a trademark of attacks by white 
extremists damaged the offices of the governing national party 
before dawn sunday 
no one immediately claimed responsibility for the explosion and 
no injuries were reported authorities said 
a police spokesman maj mike lombard said that about 11 pounds 
of the explosive were used in the blast at the deserted offices of 
national party in the central city of bloemfontein the explosion 
just outside the front of the building damaged doors windows and 
equipment in a front room police said 
whites extremists have claimed responsibilty for a series of 
bombings in the past month aimed at blacks and whites who oppose 
apartheid 
investigators found traces of the commercial explosve used 
sunday in those incidents as well 
rightwing whites oppose reforms introduced by president fw de 
klerk and his national party and have vowed to resist any lessening 
of white privilege 
both de klerk and african national congress leader nelson 
mandela say a widespread guerrilla campaign by white extremists 
could undermine efforts for blackwhite negotiations on ending 
apartheid and sharing power 
police have arrested more than 10 whites for questioning but no 
one has been charged in any of the attacks 
in another development two sunday newspapers reported that 
police have arrested dozens of armed anc guerrillas who recently 
infiltrated the country 
the sunday times and the sunday star said the weapons seized 
included grenade launchers mines and combat rifles the reports 
cited unidentified security sources 
lombard said a number of people had been detained but he 
declined to release any details 
anc leader walter sisulu said there have been significant 
arrests in the past few weeks and that the detentions go against 
the spirit of the talks held between the anc and the government in 
may 
he also said that anc guerrillas were still infiltrating south 
africa clandestinely 
people have always been infilitrating here since we launched 
our armed struggle in 1961 sisulu told the independent south 
african press association 
the anc supports a guerrilla campaign against the whiteled 
government but it has not carried out any major attacks this year 
the anc the countrys leading black opposition group says it 
will not suspend or call off its ineffective armed struggle until a 
formal treaty is negotiated with the government 
chris hani leader of the ancs armed wing said last week that 
the anc still may have to seize power if the government refuses 
to share power 
de klerk criticized the anc saying it must desist from such 
inflammatory statements if it is sincere about negotiating a new 
constitution 
de klerk and mandela met friday and agreed on a second round of 
talks aug 6 between the government and the anc the two sides met 
for the first time in may 
the anc says that before formal constitutional negotiations can 
begin the government must allow 20000 anc exiles to return and 
release some 3000 people conticted of politically motivated crimes 
under the current apartheid system the 5 million whites 
dominate politics and the economy and the 30 blacks have no voice 
in national affairs residential areas schools and politics are 
the main institutions that remain legally segregated many other 
facilities have been integrated in recent years

the return of 17yearold dimitry 
semionov to the soviet union for trial on aircraft hijacking 
charges illustrates swedens belief that justice now is possible in 
soviet courts 
we have assurances from many quarters in the soviet union 
that semionov will be tried according to law said foreign ministry 
spokesman bo heineback the situation in the soviet union is 
different from what it was one or two years ago 
on tuesday semionov became the first person extradited to the 
soviet union from sweden since the end of world war ii when the 
kremlin pressured neutral sweden into returning some balts accused 
of being nazi sympathizers 
many swedes criticized the action at the time believing the 
balts were sent to summary executions swedish opposition to the 
death penalty prevented further extraditions during the cold war 
sweden tried a 33yearold soviet hijacker in 1977 and 
imprisoned him for four years rather than release him to soviet 
authorities then granted him asylum 
a baltic seaman who forcibly took over a soviet fisheries vessel 
and sailed it to sweden in 1986 was put on probation and allowed to 
stay 
many swedes vacation in their country cabins during july and 
semionovs extradition caused little public comment 
on thursday the attorney generals office said it had no 
objections to sending a second teenage soviet hijacker home for 
trial spokesman sten falkner said the seriousness of the crime 
outweighed any humanitarian considerations for anatoly michajlenko 
19 
michajlenko accused of hijacking a soviet airliner with 159 
people aboard to stockholm on june 30 said later he had failed to 
report for soviet military service swedens supreme court is 
expected to review the case this week 
dagens nyheter an independent stockholm daily said solveig 
riberdahl director of public prosecutions was satisfied that 
michajlenko would not be persecuted for his political views if he 
were sent home 
a third young soviet hijacker is in swedish custody and two more 
are held in finland the soviet union has asked that all be 
extradited 
semionov who was upset by a family dispute began the hijack 
parade june 9 using dummy explosives to commandeer an airliner 
carrying 121 people if convicted in the soviet union he could be 
jailed for five to 10 years 
alexandre koudriachov third secretary of the soviet embassy 
said the extradition reflected a new swedish policy toward moscow 
and we are very good neighbors now 
heineback the foreign ministry spokesman said nothing was 
different except conditions in the soviet union 
this is not a change in swedish policy he said we regard 
hijacking as a serious crime but if we did not know that semionov 
would not face the death penalty there would be no extradition 
it doesnt mean that we compare the soviet union to our system 
or to other western systems but it is obvious that things have 
changed

rep barney frank says he accepts an ethics 
committee report detailing his ticketfixing and misleading 
statements to a prosecutor about male prostitute stephen gobie 
but what matters this week is whether franks colleagues in the 
house accept the committees recommendation and reprimand the 
massachusetts democrat thereby meting out the most lenient formal 
sanction available to them 
that question is expected to come in a floor vote this week 
frank is not without support in the house house speaker thomas 
foley dwash is one major backer who predicts the storm 
surrounding frank will quickly blow over 
but republicans have made it clear that they will give members 
more choices than simply accepting or rejecting the ethics 
committee recommendation rep william dannemeyer rcalif plans 
to move an expulsion proposal and other house republicans are 
expected to propose that frank be censured 
rep tom petri of wisconsin a member of the committee who voted 
for the reprimand recommendation said he told the committee that 
he reserves the right to vote for censure on the floor 
a censure would be more appropriate than a reprimand petri 
said 
a censure would be more severe punishment requiring frank to 
stand before the house while a resolution condemning his conduct 
was read 
frank said friday there was every reason to believe the house 
would accept the committee recommendation of a reprimand and reject 
tougher punishments 
members of congress just got this report made available to 
them today and it may be a blow to my ego but i have to report 
that a lot of them are a lot less interested in this than a lot of 
you frank told reporters i dont believe this damages my 
effectiveness as a member of the house 
frank has worked energetically to show that he can regain his 
stature as one of the houses leading liberals he has fought for 
housing legislation criticized federal banking regulators 
proposed that defense spending be slashed and pushed for increases 
in domestic programs 
he was able to make a tremendous comeback one that i think 
nobody could have predicted said rep joseph p kennedy ii 
dmass 
the committee which has been investigating the frank case since 
sept 11 concluded that frank improperly fixed 33 parking tickets 
some of them accumulated by gobie using franks car on personal 
business and the panel said that frank wrote a misleading memo 
that an unidentified friend passed on to a prosecutor overseeing 
gobies probation on drug and sex offense convictions 
in the memo frank falsely claimed that he met gobie through 
mutual friends when in fact he met gobie in 1985 through an 
escort service ad placed in a gay publication and by claiming 
in the memo that gobie was obeying the law frank was concealing 
what he obviously knew that gobie was involved in prostitution and 
that one of his clients was frank 
but the committee made three other rulings in franks favor that 
frank was unaware contrary to gobies claim that his own capitol 
hill apartment was being used by gobie for prostitution that frank 
never engaged in sex in the house gymnasium with gobie or anyone 
else and that frank did not try to directly influence probation 
officers handling gobies case

president bushs first supreme court appointee 
likely will strengthen an alreadydominant conservative majority 
that no longer need battle william j brennans liberal leadership 
the result a rightwardmoving supreme court is expected to grow 
even more conservative when addressing such issues as abortion 
civil rights and criminal justice 
speaking a month before brennans retirement friday justice 
harry a blackmun predicted the inevitable departure of the courts 
three liberal octogenarians himself brennan and justice thurgood 
marshall would leave conservatives in control for half a century 
we shouldnt resent it blackmun told the associated press 
thats the way the system works that pendulum swings it will 
stay this way now 40 or 50 years im sure 
the impact of brennans retirement in part is purely 
mathematical the presidents stated intention to pick a strict 
constructionist means six rather than five conservative votes 
among the nine justices 
but brennans departure may have a more profound impact one 
that goes to the personal dynamics of the court as a political 
institution 
combining keen intellect and charismatic charm brennan was a 
master politician and coalition builder who for years blunted 
conservative gains 
brennans use of his law clerks as emissaries to the offices of 
his fellow justices was a behindthescenes fixture as well known 
as his memos to fencesitting court members 
in recent years if one or more of the courts conservative 
justices byron r white sandra day oconnor antonin scalia or 
anthony m kennedy could be attracted to the liberal side of an 
issue it was brennan doing the wooing 
none of the three remaining liberals blackmun marshall or 
justice john paul stevens can assume that role easily 
no one will fill those shoes said ae dick howard a 
university of virginia law professor 
bruce fein a conservative court analyst predicted the court 
without brennan will become a conservative juggernaut 
the remaining liberals will become dispirited they just dont 
have the strength and winsome character to bring up that fifth 
vote fein said 
although less successful against chief justice william h 
rehnquists conservative leadership since 1986 brennan still could 
claim some victories 
in the 198990 term that ended in june brennan led the court as 
it upheld a federal affirmative action plan giving minorities 
special consideration in awarding television and radio licenses and 
struck down a ban on flag burning both cases were decided by 54 
votes 
the affirmative action ruling surprised and delighted many civil 
rights activists who in recent years have criticized the courts 
decisions making racial and sexual discrimination more difficult to 
prove 
brennan who joined the court in 1956 was a leader of the 
liberal majority that through the 1960s expanded individual rights 
and mandated greater equality for the nations minorities 
but more recently an increasingly conservative court has 
curtailed some of the legal doctrines he fashioned particularly 
those that limited police powers 
brennans successor will join a court now more likely to give 
greater weight to the frustrations of law enforcement officials 
than to the asserted rights of those suspected of crime 
no legal battleground is more closely or fiercely contested at 
the high court than that of abortion and any new court appointee 
is sure to have an impact on the future of abortion in the united 
states 
there appear to be four votes rehnquist white scalia and 
kennedy to overturn the courts 1973 ruling in roe vs wade that 
established a constitutional right to abortion 
there also appear to be four votes opposing such a move 
blackmun marshall and stevens are strong supporters of abortion 
rights and the generally conservative oconnor has refused so far 
to cast the fifth vote to reverse roe vs wade and let states 
outlaw abortion

its admittedly a long shot but 
nasa officials are hoping this weeks test on atlantis fuel system 
will find the shuttle free of leaks and ready to fly next month 
if we can fly again it might take away some of the stigma 
said david winterhalter director of systems engineering and 
analysis for nasa 
winterhalter and others in the beleaguered space agency say 
theres nothing to lose and possibly much to gain public 
confidence in particular by tightening bolts in atlantis leaky 
fuel line and repeating the tanking test for a third time the test 
is scheduled for wednesday 
the public nasa employees well all be real happy to get the 
next successful launch behind us and go on to the next said 
keith hudkins chief of nasas shuttle orbiter program 
both atlantis and columbia have been crippled by hydrogen leaks 
that until last week had grounded the threeshuttle fleet the 
leaks believed to be in different places on each vehicle were not 
discovered until the shuttles were moved to the launch pad 
discovery meanwhile has its own problems one of 44 thrusters 
was dented when it fell off a work stand thursday a new 600000 
thruster will be installed 
nasas bad luck with leaks isnt limited to shuttles on friday 
a helium leak forced postponement of the launch of an unmanned 
atlas rocket carrying a nasa and air force satellite designed to 
illuminate earths normally invisible magnetic field 
the problem was corrected by rocket builder general dynamics 
but plans for a second launch attempt sunday were scrapped because 
of bad weather another try may be made monday 
john logsdon director of the space policy institute at george 
washington university said it will take more than a successful 
shuttle launch to get nasa back on track 
the agency is supposed to be doing more than just getting 
shuttles launched he said thats important but in a sense 
its the minimum requirement 
logsdon expects it will take years for nasa to clear its name 
over the debacle created by the hubble space telescope a 15 
billion project unable to fulfill its potential because of a flawed 
mirror that cannot be repaired until 1993 at the earliest 
nasas proposed space station freedom has come under attack by 
congress too a study released friday shows up to 10 spacewalks a 
week will be needed to maintain outside components of the station 
unless major design changes are made 
the bush administration last week ordered an outside panel of 
experts to consider the longterm direction of americas space 
program 
most of nasas problems according to logsdon are not of nasas 
making 
they are the reflection of the country not lowering its 
expectations at the same time it lowers the budget he said 
in fiscal 1964 as the agency busily prepared for the apollo 
moon landings nasas 51 billion budget represented a record 385 
percent of the federal budget nasas budget for the current fiscal 
year is 123 billion not quite 1 percent of the federal budget 
the national aeronautics and space administration is requesting 
151 billion for fiscal 1991 which begins oct 1 thats 109 
percent of the federal budget 
the agency has learned to lie to itself about what it can do 
with the available resources logsdon said the feeling is if 
theres total honesty theyll lose even more political support and 
priority and have an even smaller budget 
nasa officials are quick to point out the trouble with hubble is 
totally different from the shuttle problems all but unavoidable in 
such a complex craft 
it doesnt mean when you fail that youre no good at managing 
it means thats the nature of this business nasa administrator 
richard truly said during a congressional hearing last week 
technicians tightened most of the 48 bolts on atlantis leaky 
fuel line on friday in a lastditch attempt to correct the leak at 
the launch pad 
if no leaks are detected when liquid hydrogen is pumped into 
atlantis external tank wednesday nasa will attempt to launch the 
shuttle with a classified defense department payload in midaugust 
if atlantis must be returned to the hangar for repairs only one 
shuttle can fly before discoverys october flight with the 
sunprobing ulysses satellite nasa will either move columbia back 
out to the pad for an early september liftoff or give atlantis a 
new external tank and try for a midseptember launch 
nine shuttle flights originally were scheduled for 1990 so far 
only three missions have been flown but nasa still hopes to get 
eight flights finished by years end 
each year were going to fly more than what were flying this 
year thats the plan hudkins said but he noted were not 
going to fly any shuttle before its time

israels new rightwing government has its 
first encounter with european community leaders this week at a time 
of increasing european pressure on israel to move foward with 
middle east peace moves 
the visit starting monday by the troika of ec foreign 
ministers is to focus on various proposals for resolving the 
israelis standoff with the palestinians it comes as israel is 
seeking trade concessions from europe and european leaders are 
backing a us peace plan that the government here is resisting 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir has called for improving 
relations with europe but he admits it wont be easy 
we have a lot of problems with europe and we have to try to 
explain our positions straighten out the problems and move 
closer shamir told reporters last week 
at their summit in dublin in june european community leaders 
renewed their call for an international peace conference that would 
include participation of the palestine liberation organization 
which israel considers a terrorist organization 
israel refuses any dealings with the plo and has repeatedly 
rejected an international peace conference believing such a 
meeting could force concessions on the jewish state 
after their visit here the three foreign ministers will travel 
to tunis on tuesday for talks with the arab league whose current 
president is farouk kaddoumi chief of the plos political 
department 
the visiting foreign ministers led by gianni de michelis of 
italy are to meet with shamir and israeli foreign minister david 
levy 
italy now holds the rotating presidency of the ec the troika 
also includes foreign ministers gerard collins of ireland whose 
country last held the presidency and jacques poos of luxembourg 
which will take the post next 
it is the first official visit by representatives of the 
12nation european community since shamir formed his rightwing 
government in june 
j gwyn morgan the ec delegate to israel said in an interview 
that the purpose is to discuss with the new israeli government 
their ideas about the peace process and the possibility of 
movement 
morgan said the community was coordinating its peace efforts 
with the united states and that the visit was discussed in great 
detail with us secretary of state james a baker iii 
israel has so far rejected bakers efforts to set up preliminary 
peace talks with a palestinian delegation in cairo as a step toward 
israels own proposal for elections in the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip 
israel introduced the proposal in may 1989 as a way to choose 
palestinians to open talks with israel on limited autonomy for the 
occupied territories 
but the election idea has become mired in disagreements with 
baker and the new governments emphasis has shifted to another 
aspect of israels plan which urges neighboring arab countries to 
open peace negotiations 
european diplomats are skeptical as to whether israel can 
improve relations with arab states until it resolves the 31month 
uprising in the occupied territories 
the europeans have been highly critical of israeli efforts to 
put down the palestinian revolt with force 
the european parliament earlier this year called for sanctions 
against israel for its handling of the uprising in which 723 
palestinians have been killed by israeli soldiers or civilians 
so far a trade conference has been canceled and a meeting to 
select new israelieuropean scientific projects has been postponed 
indefinitely 
israels goal of expanding trade ties with europe could be at 
risk too 
israel which has a freetrade agreement with the ec wants some 
modifications so it wont be disadvantaged when a unified european 
market is formed in 1992 it has requested a meeting with community 
leaders for september but no date has been set 
the jewish state currently exports about 32 billion worth of 
goods to europe each year and imports 65 billion in european 
goods 
although israeli imports represent only a fraction of europes 
trade israels exports to europe constitute onethird of its total 
foreign sales

foreign rescuers stopped searching 
sunday for more survivors in this earthquakeravaged city after 
finding no signs of life in buildings devastated by the temblor 
the death toll surpassed 1000 
several strong aftershocks rocked baguio and manila 130 miles 
to the south hampering recovery efforts religious services were 
held outdoors because of fears of more damage 
british and other foreign volunteers said they were abandoning 
the search after failing to find signs of life in the hyatt hotel 
the last area of baguio where experts believed there might still be 
survivors of the july 21 quake 
hopes that some people were still alive at the hyatt faded after 
rescuers no longer heard tapping sounds on walls near the hotel 
basement 
british rescuers said they feared the last of the survivors died 
saturday when aftershocks shifted the rubble either crushing 
victims or depriving them of air 
there are no sounds at all british team leader willie 
mcmartin told reporters it means effectively that the person 
making the sounds has died 
asked if he believed anyone was still alive at the hyatt 
mcmartin replied no 
filipino authorities said they would keep searching for 
survivors but admitted chances of finding any were slim 
the analysis of the foreign experts assisting in the rescue 
operations in baguio city is that the chances are nil for finding 
anyone still alive in the wreckage in various buildings in the 
city a government statement said 
while we would welcome a continuation of their working with 
us we leave it to them whether to continue their operations in 
baguio at any rate for the work they have already done the 
filipino people will be forever grateful 
the statement said philippine recovery efforts would continue 
as long as safety warrants 
figures released sunday by the office of civil defense red 
cross and the regional disaster coordinating center put the death 
toll at 1043 as more bodies were discovered 
more than 200 bodies are believed still buried beneath the 
rubble of nearly 30 buildings damaged in the quake which measured 
77 on the richter scale 
others were believed to have died in scores of landslides across 
northern luzon in nueva vizcaya province a landslide dammed up a 
river and water was threatening to spill over into nearby villages 
president corazon aquinos government has been sharply 
criticized for a slow response to the disaster and it appeared 
officials did not want to take the political responsibility for 
calling off the search 
on sunday roman catholic masses were said outdoors in baguios 
burnham park because bishop ernesto salgado said it was too 
dangerous to worship inside the cathedral salgado said priests 
visited collapsed buildings blessing the bodies of those who may 
be entombed there 
jose de jesus presidential relief coordinator said 373 people 
were killed in baguio alone and another 175 in the surrounding 
province of benguet 
de jesus said 135 people were believed trapped inside eight 
factories in baguio but all are believed dead de jesus said 
information on deaths and damage was still trickling in from remote 
areas including nueva vizcaya province where many villages and 
roads were buried by landslides 
philippine pilots who surveyed the areas saw huge columns of 
survivors walking over the mountains to safety the pilots 
described them as loking like columns of ants silhouetted 
against the barren mountain slopes

unfortunately rhinos arent very good swimmers and she drowned 
there was nothing anybody could have done to prevent it 
the baby rhino the 19th born at lion country safari had been 
doing well wolf said 
the water situation is always a problem but the animals need 
water he said the adults need it to cool off and the canals 
also provide drainage for the park

the president of ecuador arrived in washington 
sunday to discuss with president bush his plan for creating a 
hemispherewide freetrade zone 
rodrigo borja is the first latin american head of state to meet 
with bush since bushs announcement last month that the united 
states also will move to increase the flow of capital into latin 
american nations bush said the effort is designed to further ease 
the regions foreign debt burden and promote marketoriented 
economies 
bush is planning a september visit to brazil chile argentina 
uruguay and venezuela 
us officials say the administrations initiative is needed to 
build a stronger and more comprehensive economic partnership with 
latin america in order to support what is regarded as a process of 
democratic change and growing economic realism there 
analysts also view the move as a us effort to counter the 
creation of a strong european economic bloc lead by west germany 
and the increasing economic expansion of japan in asia 
borja will meet monday with bush and separately with officials 
of the world bank international monetary fund and interamerican 
development bank 
borja who was invited by bush said after arriving that he 
brought with him no specific requests 
he is expected to explore in full bushs trade initiative in 
separate meetings with secretary of state james a baker iii 
treasury secretary nicholas brady and us trade representative 
carla hills 
the united states is involved in talks with mexico that could 
lead to a free trade with that country agreement similar to the one 
negotiated during the reagan administration with canada 
the colombian embassy here announced last friday that the us 
had signed a framework agreement with colombia with a view to 
establishing bilateral negotiations aimed at creating a freetrade 
zone between the two countries 
undersecretary of the treasury david mulford told congress last 
thursday that bush envisions a hemispherewide open trade system 
that links all the americas 
the achievement of an agreement with mexico mulford added 
will be a gigantic step forward 
as we have seen in the case of canada these agreements can 
offer significant and lasting benefits to both sides he said

in unprecedented attacks on the soviet unions 
most sacred icon vandals are defacing and toppling statues of 
vladimir lenin and one city is even relegating its statue to the 
ultimate capitalist fate selling it to the highest bidder 
weekend reports in the staterun media said statues of the 
soviet founder have been toppled in two dozen towns in the southern 
republic of georgia barbarously disfigured in lithuania and 
to the outrage of local communists dismantled and put up for sale 
in the ukraine city of ternopol 
all the incidents came in republics that have active 
independence movements and growing nationalistic sentiment 
under president mikhail s gorbachevs reforms past soviet 
leaders like josef stalin and leonid i brezhnev have been 
denounced in the official press and monuments and plaques in their 
honor have been taken down 
lenin is still officially lionized but that doesnt mean all 
soviet citizens hold him sacred 
in the georgian capital of tbilisi police are guarding the 
lenin statue in the citys central square around the clock to keep 
it from suffering the same fate as a bronze monument that was 
toppled near the zemoavchalskaya hydroelectric station in another 
part of town the newspaper soviet culture reported saturday 
he was lying looking at me with his frightening empty eyes 
the creator of my motherland ussr vladimir lenin wrote 
correspondent s babayev of the toppled statue he added that the 
plants labor committee decided to destroy the statue 
in recent weeks monuments to the soviet founder were destroyed 
in the georgian towns of kodzhori kutaisi batumi and about two 
dozen others attempts were made to topple them in the azerbaijan 
capital of baku and the armenian capital of yerevan soviet culture 
reported 
in the small town of varniai in northwestern lithuania 
meanwhile a statue of lenin in the central square was 
barbarously disfigured on saturday the official tass news 
agency reported 
the day was the 50th anniversary of the declaration of soviet 
power in the three baltic republics which are trying to break away 
from moscow 
tass didnt say exactly what was done to the statue but called 
it a crude provocation it said representatives of a local 
extremist group the league for freedom of lithuania claimed 
responsibility 
official criticism of lenin is not unheard of 
in the spring a bust of him was removed from the chambers of 
the city council in moscow where radical reformers won local 
elections earlier this year and one critic suggested this year 
that his body be removed from its red square mausoleum and buried 
but such attacks were rare 
in ternopol about 200 miles west of kiev the city council 
voted 640 with 21 abstentions to remove the statues of lenin and 
karl marx from the central square and sell them according to the 
newspaper rural life it quoted ternopols local party ideologist 
yelena n sosnitskaya 
city officials also decided to take down statues of yaroslav 
galan who fought against ukrainian nationalism and vladimir 
zatonsky a prominent soviet communist party figure tass reported 
several military monuments are also to be scrapped it said 
mrs sosnitskaya told rural life that orthodox communists were 
frightened and indignant over the decision to take down and 
sell the lenin statue 
i told them the city council that you have the bolshevism 
syndrome she said if we start breaking and destroying how 
will it all end 
she said the move to tear down statues of lenin and marx could 
have been caused by authorities failures to put up monuments to 
those who helped the national rebirth of the ukraine 
honoring ukrainian heroes is all very well she said but that 
doesnt mean the likes of marx and lenin should be tossed aside 
we supported the decision of deputies to put up monuments to 
those who really contributed to our area but as to the 
dismantling we consider it an act of vandalism and barbarism 
she said 
mrs sosnitskaya told rural life she hoped the lenin statue 
could be saved by invoking laws protecting cultural monuments 
tass quoted an unidentified city council representative as saying 
only a court decision or a referendum could save the statues 
if the sale goes ahead mrs sosnitskaya said the statues would 
be sold to whatever organizations are interested asked if 
there are interested buyers she replied there are but did 
not identify them 
removing the statues would cost about 480000 mrs sosnitskaya 
said 
but she said we still hope it wont happen

four defendants in the rape and 
beating of a 79yearold woman will be tested for aids in what may 
be the first use of a new state law that allows a rape victim to 
demand tests of the accused 
this is certainly the first case ive heard said stephen 
kindland of the state department of health and rehabilitative 
services aids prevention headquarters in tallahassee 
circuit judge burton c easton agreed friday to allow the tests 
under the law that took effect july 1 
the test results will not be admissible as evidence if the case 
comes to trial 
attorneys for the four defendants retained the right to argue 
against further tests that the state might seek as evidence to 
compare the results with blood and semen found in the victims home 
after the may 9 attack 
basically if the victim wants the tests done the law allows 
them to be done said samuel williams who is representing 
defendant jeffrey joseph digeronimo but the results must be 
released only to the victim and the defendants and the tests must 
be kept confidential 
the woman and her husband required hospital treatment after the 
attack 
while the tests will tell the victim whether she is at risk now 
they will not conclusively answer the question 
the tests detect antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus 
which causes aids but kindland said they dont reach a point of 95 
percent reliability until six months after contact 
it is likely the victim and defendants will have to undergo 
subsequent tests before doctors can be conclusive he said 
digeronimo 19 brian scott geiger 18 robert dennis kaczmarek 
21 and robert allan anderson 16 each are charged with multiple 
counts of armed burglary kidnapping and sexual battery from a 
series of breakins including the attack on the elderly woman

lawmakers breaking constitutional 
deadlines in their struggle to resolve a record budget stalemate 
are bitterly divided as the courts intervene to order payments to 
the poor disabled and the elderly 
californias 50 billion budget crisis an electionyear 
exercise in stubbornness pits lameduck republican gov george 
deukmejian and the assemblys republican caucus against the 
legislatures majority democrats 
assemblywoman maxine waters who grew up on welfare in st 
louis cried during a floor debate as she recalled her welfare 
childhood and accused republicans of saying poor children may not 
eat 
assemblyman john vasconcellos the budget committee chairman 
said he cried while driving home out of hopelessness and 
embarrassment that the richest state in the richest nation in the 
worlds entire history is hurting the poor and helpless 
deukmejian and the republicans maintain that democrats 
unwillingness to live within the states means would only worsen 
the fiscal crisis in future years 
dog doo is what gop assemblyman bill baker bluntly called a 
spending plan passed by the state senate and rejected by the 
assembly 
dog doo ii the sequel is what baker called a similar 
budget proposal that was mostly the product of assembly democrats 
and was rejected by assembly republicans last week 
this is a bandaid solution that covers up the problems for 
another year said ross johnson the assemblys republican leader 
the budget for the 199091 fiscal year that began july 1 is 
three weeks overdue with no resolution in sight previously the 
latest the state had ever passed a budget was july 19 that record 
was set during the recession of 1983 
unlike 1983 californias economy this year is relatively 
strong the problem as both sides agree is a 36 billion gap 
between estimated tax revenues and the spending necessary for 
current services plus increases for inflation and population and to 
maintain a 13 billion emergency reserve 
the agreement ends there 
democrats say the problem is caused by exploding populations in 
costly programs such as public schools prisons aid to the elderly 
and aids patients and by the 29 billion in various tax cuts 
handed out since 1978 
republicans say the problem is runaway government spending 
overly generous welfare programs and a series of initiatives that 
have forced minimum spending levels for programs such as public 
schools 
deukmejian and the legislatures republicans particularly those 
in the assembly want the gap closed entirely with cuts refusing 
to agree to any tax increases 
democrats say cuts would be too harsh in public health school 
university and mental health programs and want a combination of 
some cuts and some tax increases neither side is willing to budge 
without a budget state government goes on but the controller 
has no authority to pay bills and issue paychecks 
however groups owed money have gone to the federal courts 
which through friday had ordered payment of 688 million in bills 
for medical doctors hospitals and nursing homes for welfare 
mothers children and for inhome workers 
california is not the only state with budget problems this year 
the state senate office of research said last week that 24 other 
states have had gaps between revenues and expenditures fifteen 
states chose to raise taxes to solve the problem 
californias bond rating is currently aaa the highest 
possible from the three major rating houses some states with 
budget problems have had their bond ratings lowered 
controller gray davis warned i think each day we go without a 
budget we run the risk of annoying the credit rating agencies 
as the budget standoff continues many groups have staged 
rallies and sitins in the capitol about four dozen people in 
wheelchairs have been arrested in a series of demonstrations in the 
governors office this month 
vasconcellos a democrat brought three welfare mothers and 
their nine children to the capitol and asked deukmejian to meet 
with them and explain why he wants to freeze their benefits the 
governor declined 
despite the crisis the capitol this weekend was nearly empty 
the senate passed a budget proposal on july 10 and went home until 
the assembly acts the assembly rejected a second budget proposal 
thursday and adjourned for the weekend 
the capitol is deserted that is except for one legislator 
democratic assemblyman norman waters began a vigil friday in the 
assembly chambers waters who faces a tough reelection race in 
november said hell sit there alone until the budget crisis is 
solved because compromise cant happen if people dont bother to 
show up 
waters could have a long wait 
assemblywoman waters who is not related said during floor 
debate it will be a cold day in hell before i participate in a 
society giving up on its children 
republican assemblyman chris chandler said he partially agreed 
with her there are many of us over here who are prepared to stay 
here until hell freezes over

mohawk indians 
embroiled in a land war with the united states and canada claim 300 
years of racism are at the root of their quarrel 
government negotiators say it has nothing to do with race 
they say the latest clash which left one person dead stems 
from the mohawks impatience with the government to resolve land 
disputes the death of two mohawks in may involved an indian 
dispute over gambling 
many of our ancestors have died because theyve trusted the 
white government said grand chief joe norton of the kahnawake 
mohawk reservation south of montreal 
the reservation home to 6000 indians has been closed by 
police and indian blockades since july 11 when police stormed a 
mohawk barricade at the nearby kanesatake reserve where 750 
mohawks live near oka quebec 
indians there have blocked roads for four months to stop a golf 
course expansion project on land they claim is mohawk ancestral 
territory 
a quebec provincial police officer died in a shootout between 
police and indians at oka experts are trying to determine if the 
bullet that killed him was fired by an indian or a fellow officer 
during the wild shootout 
the uneasy standoff between indians and police continued sunday 
in the small town of oka and around kahnawake negotiations between 
the mohawks and canadian officials broke off last week and no new 
talks are scheduled 
this is a settler country said loran thompson spokesman 
for mohawks at the oka barricade people came in and settled our 
land we let them and then they took it away 
in the 17th century jesuit missionaries who tried to convert 
mohawks and other tribes in the iroquois confederacy called the 
indians pagans and savages thompson said canadians and 
americans still view indians as an inferior race he claimed 
the quebec human rights commission saturday issued a statement 
deploring the increase in racial intolerance and the 
multiplication of racial incidents around mohawk territory 
last week mobs in chateauguay a city of 40000 people on the 
southern border of kahnawake burned mohawks in effigy taunted 
indians at a barricade with war whoops and yelled damn savages 
chateauguay residents are angry over the mohawk blockade of the 
mercier bridge over the st lawrence river north of the 
reservation commuters use the bridge to reach jobs in montreal 
their 30minute commute now takes up to two hours because they have 
to cross the river at another bridge 
on sunday canadian officials announced that beginning monday a 
special train will carry commuters to montreal in a onehour trip 
about 1000 people gathered outside the barricades in 
chateauguay on saturday night the smallest crowd all week two men 
carried a banner showing a mohawk in feathers and other indian 
regalia a circle was painted around the caricature with a slash 
through the indians face 
the indian people have always been looked upon as less than 
human said thompson a member of the militant mohawk warriors 
society 
members of the group have been accused of inciting violence on 
mohawk territory including the st regis indian reservation along 
the uscanadian border two indians died there in may in a 
gunfight between opponents and supporters of the reservations 
casinos 
this is a racial war thompson said referring to oka 
dispute thats what it all comes down to 
john bray a spokesman for canadian indian affairs said the 
situation is a dispute between the government and a faction of 
canadians who have legitimate land claims 
this is not a racial war bray said theres a certain 
degree of frustration among the mohawks its their perception of 
how the federal government has not moved as broadly or quickly as 
the indian people wish it to be 
extremist mohawks want canada to give them 5 million acres of 
land in eastern canada and the united states to hand over another 9 
million acres in new york and new england the mohawks now have 
10200 acres at kahnawake 28000 acres at st regis 2000 at oka 
and 700 at the ganienkeh encampment in northern new york near 
plattsburgh 
each mohawk territory has been blockaded at various times by 
police in the past four months canadian police and new york state 
troopers continue to occupy st regis at ganienkeh a military 
helicopter made an emergency landing in march after it was hit by 
gunfire prompting an 11day standoff between indians and police 
chateauguay mayor jeanbosco bourcier blamed the racial slurs 
shouted at mohawks last week on a minority of overly excited 
people bourcier himself was taunted by a mob of about 2000 
people who marched through the town friday night the mob blamed 
bourcier and other officials for failing to build a commuter route 
to montreal that would bypass the reservation 
some in the crowd yelled racial insults about the mohawks 
theyre ignorant theyre uneducated they stink yelled one 
young man 
i still have friends on the reservation but a lot of people 
in chateauguay wont stand the indians any more said town 
resident audrey pepin 
most in the crowd seemed to agree with bourcier that racism 
against mohawks was limited to a handful of people 
i dont think its fair to say the people of chateauguay or 
quebec are more racist than any other said jean dorion 
president of the french nationalist st jean baptiste society a 
quebec secessionist group

by europeans 
the victory came a day after lemond rallied to take the lead 
from italian claudio chiapucci the italian finished second in the 
grueling threeweek race 
lemond was in command throughout the day sunday taking his 
second title in a row with relative ease following a dramatic 
finalday battle with frenchman laurent fignon last year 
cheered by thousands who gathered along paris famed champs 
elysees the 29yearold cyclist stayed with the rest of the pack 
sunday it was enough for him to preserve his twominute 16second 
lead over chiappucci 
dutch rider eric breukink finished third 13 seconds behind 
chiappucci 
the last stage wasnt difficult lemond said but all day 
i was nervous i didnt want to take chances but i was impatient 
to cross the finish line 
it was the culmination of an exhausting 2112mile odyssey 
around france 
lemond has now competed in five tours placing in the top three 
finishers each time his 1986 victory made him the first american 
to win the race

last year by squeaking past fignon by only eight seconds on the 
final day 
lemond a native of wayzata minn was asked on french 
television sunday if he was trying to match the record of five tour 
de france victories coheld by two frenchmen

british authorities have banned a pakistani film 
which portrays author salman rushdie as a killer and torturer of 
moslems who is finally slain himself a published report said 
sunday 
rushdie a british subject born into a moslem family in india 
has been in hiding under guard since february 1989 because of an 
iranian death threat many moslems considered his novel the 
satanic verses blasphemous 
the british board of film classification refused to license 
distribution of the film because police advised that it could be 
criminally libelous the independent on sunday newspaper reported 
the film titled international guerrillas portrays rushdie 
as the agent of an jewish conspiracy against islam 
the 3hour film depicts him killing and torturing moslems until 
he himself is killed by a bolt of lightning 
mohammed fayyaz who owns worldwide distribution rights to the 
film said banning it amounted to double standards 
they say this is an independent country but they ban a film 
which gives the real feeling of moslems the newspaper quoted 
fayyaz as saying 
a spokeswoman for the salman rushdie defense committee said 
rushdie believes the film should be in the public domain so that 
any libel or offense may be dealt with according to the due process 
of law 
committee spokeswoman frances dsouza also said it was 
debatable whether the film would expose rushdie to increased 
danger 
it is also debatable whether the majority of british moslems 
would condone let alone support its message she said 
james ferman director of the film classification board told 
fayyaz the film could be licensed if the rushdie character were 
given a different name and all speeches calling for his death were 
excised 
this would turn it into a more traditional entertainment with 
a villain who is an enemy of islam in a general sense rather than 
a specifically named individual the independent on sunday quoted 
the letter as saying 
lawmakers weighed in on both sides of the issue 
max madden a labor party lawmaker who has been calling on 
rushdie to cancel any further editions of the book said sunday 
that the ban would bewilder and confuse many moslems who were 
unable to go to any court to try to ban the satanic verses 
it is further evidence of the need for the government to 
clarify the law about the publication of any material thought 
capable of inciting relgious racial or personal hatred he said 
conservative lawmaker anthony beaumontdark though said the 
banning was absolutely right 
anything that incites people to violence should be banned 
and i am not a great banner of anything beaumontdark said 
surely everybody moslems included must be against incitement to 
violence 
rushdies publisher announced earlier this month that two new 
books by him would soon be brought out they will be his first 
since the satanic verses brought death threats from the late 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
granta books in association with penguin books said it had 
acquired world englishlanguage rights to rushdies novel haroun 
and the sea of stories and to imaginary homelands a 
collection of essays 
the novel will be published in britain on sept 27 and in the 
united states next year 
the death threats against rushdie have hampered restoration of 
diplomatic ties between tehran and london which were effectively 
severed in june 1987 after a series of expulsions of diplomats

a bipartisan commission on sunday said the 
government should help the elderly poor pay medicare charges add 
coverage of preventive services to medicare and order improvements 
in supplementary insurance coverage 
the 28 billion package recommended by the pepper commission 
would add to a 66 billion plan the panel suggested in march that 
would provide health care coverage to nearly all americans 
the panel voted 114 for the latest three recommendations 
people may think that because the elderly have medicare they 
are adequately protected thats wrong sen jay rockefeller 
dwva commission chairman said in the panels announcement of 
the action 
the improvements are desperately needed to assure older 
americans the same minimum standard of protection weve already 
recommended providing americans under 65 he said 
the panel created by congress in 1988 as the us bipartisan 
commission on comprehensive health care includes 12 members of 
congress and three white house appointees it was later renamed to 
honor the late rep claude pepper dfla 
the commissions larger package of proposals in march was 
criticized by some of its own members for failing to recommend 
funding 
in its earlier action the panel split 87 on the plan to 
achieve universal access by requiring businesses to provide private 
health insurance to their workers or to contribute to a public plan 
for employees and nonworking dependents 
at that time panel members also voted 114 for a plan offering 
all americans coverage for longterm care in their homes and for 
the first three months in a nursing home 
the same four who voted against that plan also voted against the 
latest recommendations rep willis gradison jr rohio rep 
fortney pete stark dcalif john f cogan a senior fellow at 
the hoover institute in palo alto calif and rep thomas tauke 
riowa 
the vote was taken by mail or telephone over the past week 
commission spokesman philip shandler said 
stark opposed the latest recommendations for the same reason he 
voted against the earlier ones because the panel didnt propose a 
way to pay his spokesman said 
the first recommendation would help the nearpoor elderly pay 
for medicare premiums and deductibles those people are the 82 
million elderly whose incomes are between the poverty level 
6280 per year for an individual and 200 percent of poverty or 
12560 
the 35 million people over 65 whose incomes are below the 
poverty line currently are helped or will be when the program is 
completely phased in by 1992 by medicaid picking up the medicare 
premiums and deductibles 
the panel also recommended the extension of medicare coverage to 
screening tests for early detection of breast colon and prostate 
cancer other preventive services would be added to medicare 
coverage when they are determined to be effective relative to 
cost the commission said 
the commission also recommended new federal standards for 
medigap insurance policies that are intended to supplement medicare 
coverage 
these standards would require insurers to use more of their 
premium revenue for benefits prohibit insurers from refusing to 
sell coverage based on health status and limit commissions for new 
policies 
insurers also would be required to develop simpler policies that 
are easier to understand and that would be standard throughout the 
industry

iranianbacked fundamentalists sunday 
crushed a joint attack by rival shiite moslems and palestinian 
guerrillas capping two days of closequarter combat at a 
mountaintop town in south lebanon police said 
a police spokesman said 52 people were killed and 135 wounded in 
the ferocious battle that turned the town of jarjou into a 
graveyard littered with uncollected corpses 
the spokesman who cannot be identified in line with standing 
regulations said the casualty toll would rise sharply when 
rescuers are allowed to go into jarjou the largest town in south 
lebanons iqlim altuffah or apple province 
the new casualties raised the toll of the weeklong clashes 
between the proiranian hezbollah or party of god and the more 
secular syrianbacked to 125 killed and 367 wounded 
the two factions have been fighting each other intermittently 
for three years for leadership of the 12 million shiites who make 
up lebanons largest sect by police count at least 1166 people 
have been killed and 4009 wounded in the power struggle 
in a statement amal accused hezbollahs fighters of 
boobytrapping corpses in jarjou it said one amal militiaman was 
killed when the explosiveladen body of a comrade exploded as he 
tried to remove it from the battlefront sunday evening 
iran has stepped in to try to arrange a ceasefire allam riza 
walizadeh political officer of the iranian embassy in beirut 
traveled to the southern city of sidon for meetings with factional 
leaders sunday 
a hezbollah communique sunday claimed to have regained the 
whole of jarjou from amal and the mercenaries 
amal denied the claim saying it still held a quarter of jarjou 
but police and reporters said amal and plo fighters had 
withdrawn from the town 
the term mercenaries appeared to be an allusion to a 
600member force of palestine liberation organization guerrillas 
that was deployed in the region ostensibly to halt the latest round 
of amalhezbollah warfare 
police said the plo force drawn mainly from yasser arafats 
fatah mainstream faction became actively involved on amals side 
after a series of grenadethrowing hezbollah assaults that killed 
three guerrillas near jarjou on friday 
an estimated 250 plo fighters teamed up with 300 amal militiamen 
in a twopronged storming of jarjou on saturday 
hezbollah had taken the town from amal at the outbreak of the 
latest round of intrashiite fighting on monday 
a police spokesman said the plos total casualties since their 
deployment in the apple province on tuesday stood at nine killed 
and 23 wounded

the man who five years ago 
convinced a jury that roswell gilberts slaying of his elderly 
ailing wife was murder not mercy now wants to help set gilbert 
free 
he should be released says kelly hancock who prosecuted 
gilbert but left the state attorneys office in 1989 for his own 
legal practice 
he says he still believes gilbert now 81 was wrong in killing 
his 73yearold wife emily and he says gilbert agreed last month 
in a private meeting in prison that the killing was wrong 
the state never sought the death penalty and the only 
alternative was life in prison with no chance of parole for 25 
years 
i prosecuted the crime hancock told the miami herald in an 
interview published sunday i didnt prosecute the man 
i think its right to take this stand now i never thought he 
should spend 25 years in prison which would certainly be a death 
sentence 
mrs gilbert was suffering from alzheimers diasease and 
osteoporosis when gilbert shot her in the head in their suburban 
condo on march 4 1985 
gilbert said he killed her to end her suffering his defense 
lawyer told jurors that the killing was the greatest act of love 
youll ever witness 
hancock called it coldblooded murder base your decision on 
the hard cold facts he told the jury you must follow the law 
or your verdict will be a miscarriage of justice 
hancock said the case has never left his mind since 
on june 20 he went to the lawtey correctional facility to talk 
with gilbert who suffers from a variety of ailments including 
lung and heart diseases 
i wanted an opportunity to talk to roswell to get to know him 
on a onetoone basis to learn about his background said 
hancock i wanted to find out if he thought i was a fair 
prosecutor 
hancock also said he wanted one thing from gilbert before 
helping him seek clemency and he said he got it gilbert admitted 
that what he did was wrong 
i dont think hes going to get out and say he did the right 
thing he said 
hancock says the system of justice that worked when it convicted 
gilbert of murder will work to win him clemency 
if his attorney asks me i will write a letter and state my 
position to the governor he said if a clemency hearing is 
held i will give my opinion at that point 
brad stark gilberts appellate attorney said he is seeking a 
september hearing by gov bob martinez and members of the florida 
cabinet who sit as the executive board of clemency 
peter dunbar the governors chief legal counsel noted that the 
gilbert case has a uniqueness around it but said the state 
receives 12000 clemency requests a year he also said the trial 
judge and the chief prosecutor not just the trial prosecutor 
would have a say if a hearing is granted

soldiers shot and killed four armed 
palestinian guerrillas who infiltrated from syria jordanian 
officials said sunday 
a police official speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
heavily armed guerrillas illegally crossed jordans northern 
border a military spokesman said the incident occurred late 
saturday 
the official said the guerrillas carried documents identifying 
them as members of the popular front for the liberation of 
palestinegeneral command headed by ahmed jibril the group is 
based in damascus syria 
mustafa khmyes a member of the marxist groups central council 
denied involvement by his organization he said the documents 
carried by the men were probably false 
an army spokesman told jordans official petra news agency the 
guerrillas entered jordan via an area usually used by drug and 
arms smugglers two miles west of the ramtha border post 
the military spokesman told petra the guerrillas were killed 
when our men warned them to stop and they did not respond which 
forced our army to open fire at them and kill them 
jordanian authorities suggested that because the men were 
carrying heavy weapons it appeared that they had targets in jordan 
rather than using it as a route to israel 
our group did not infiltrate into jordan and we did not plan 
any assassinations in jordan khmyes said from amman we are 
not responsible for this attack 
the police official refused to say precisely where the shooting 
took place but he said the four were shot a few minutes after 
they actually crossed into jordanian territory 
the official said the slain men had four silencerfitted 
handguns 15 hand grenades and four sovietmade kalashnikov assault 
rifles 
it was the third recent report of such an infiltration attempt 
on the jordaniansyrian border 
in january jordan asked syria to help prevent incursions by 
damascusbased palestinian factions they have been using jordanian 
territory as a path for military attacks against israel on 
jordans western border 
the popular front for the liberation of palestinegeneral 
command opposes yasser arafat chairman of the palestine liberation 
organization and denounces his recent moderate policy of peace

death an alleged collaborator with israel in jerusalem 
at a refugee camp in the israelioccupied gaza strip 10 
palestinian teenagers were shot and wounded by soldiers in a third 
day of violence there arab sources said 
in the occupied west bank 30 israelis demanding the right to 
build a jewish settlement in the arab town of jericho occupied the 
remains of an ancient synagogue they were dislodged by soldiers

youths in silwan an arab village within jerusalems boundaries 
city police spokesman uzi sandori said 
arab sources identified the victim as yasin mohammed iskafi 
sandori said the slayers apparently suspected that iskafi who 
worked as a gardener for the city government was collaborating 
with israeli authorities 
residents of the village speaking on condition of anonymity 
said iskafi was beaten with clubs embedded with nails 
late sunday police reported that an elderly palestinian man in 
the israeliarab village of abu ghoush near jerusalem was stabbed 
in the chest by two masked assailants 
the assailants told the old man he was suspected of 
collaborating with israel sandori said 
iskafis death brought to 240 the number of palestinians killed 
by fellow arabs in the 31month uprising against the israeli 
occupation 
during the revolt 723 palestinians have been slain by israeli 
soldiers and civilians and 45 israelis have been killed by 
palestinians 
in the gaza strips rafah refugee camp 10 palestinians ranging 
in age from 15 to 19 were shot in the legs by soldiers in renewed 
clashes between troops and stonethrowing youths arab hospital 
officials said 
more than 40 palestinians have been shot and wounded since 
clashes between soldiers and stone throwers resumed friday in the 
refugee camp

experiment on how to reduce casualties at a time when israel faces 
international criticism over its efforts to put down the 
palestinian revolt 
we dont use our weapons even when people are hit with 
stones even when your life is threatened you restrain one 
lieutenant on patrol in gaza city told israeli television his name 
was not given 
the wouldbe jewish settlers who took over the site of jerichos 
ancient synagogue waved israeli flags and signs saying jericho is 
ours israel army radio reported 
an army spokesman said the israelis were ordered out because 
they did not have a permit to occupy the site 
the policy of israels new rightwing government is to encourage 
jews to settle in the occupied lands however new settlements have 
been limited following repeated complaints by the us government 
which views the jewish enclaves as an obstacle to peace 
since the west bank and gaza were seized in the 1967 middle east 
war about 75000 israelis have moved into 130 settlements in the 
occupied territories more than 17 million palestinians live in

sunday services to break the deadlock in peace talks aimed at 
ending their countrys decadelong civil war 
listen to the clamor of the people who demand peace give 
peace back to these long suffering salvadorans roman arrieta 
san joses archbishop said in the mass homily 
salvadoran archbishop arturo rivera damas echoed arrietas words 
in a similar homily at sacred heart church in san salvador warning 
that our countrys social fabric continues tense and torn and 
the mechanism of war continues with its friendagainstenemy 
ideology 
guerrilla leaders of the farabundo marti national liberation 
front also known as the fmln and delegates from president alfredo 
cristianis rightist government attended arrietas mass before 
entering into their third day of talks here 
let us hope this meeting brings an extraordinary advance in 
the search for peace and puts an end to so much pain so many 
orphans and widows in el salvador arrieta added may god 
illuminate you so that you can attain the conquest of peace 
the fiveday session the latest of several rounds since 
cristiani took office in june 1989 has stalled over rebel demands 
that el salvadors military be sharply reduced in numbers and 
purged of officers guilty of human rights violations

labor party leader shimon peres scored 
an important political victory sunday over his longtime rival 
yitzhak rabin who has been maneuvering to oust peres as party head 
i fell in love with my party again declared a happy peres 
whose victory in a key vote came as a surprise even to some of his 
own supporters 
the party and the country shall benefit from this victory 
he said 
the 1400member labor central committee was called into session 
to consider demands by rabin labors no 2 man for a vote soon on 
the post of party chairman peres wanted it postponed until next 
year 
the committee also voted on how to elect the chairman rabin 
wanted a candidate for prime minister separate from the party 
chairman peres opposed that demand 
according to official results about 54 percent of the 1212 
labor members present supported peres and decided to postpone the 
leadership contest as opposed to rabins 46 percent the vote was 
the same against establishing separate candidacies for prime 
minister and party chairman 
peres a former prime minister had argued for delaying the 
contest because he felt the centerleft party should prepare for a 
battle with the rival likud bloc and not waste time on internal 
struggles 
just before official results of the vote were announced at the 
end of the sevenhour meeting here dancing and singing supporters 
surrounded peres and many kissed and hugged him 
rabin has been jockeying to oust peres since may when peres 
failed to form a laborled government after bringing down the shaky 
coaltion with likud 
the failure enabled likud leader prime minister yitzhak shamir 
to form his rightwing cabinet in early june 
i accept the majority decision rabin said after the vote 
i thank the great number of central committee members who saw the 
need for a change but the majority decides i believe that from 
now on the party should be united and organize itself as an 
opposition confronting likud 
the two leaders then briefly shook hands 
although both rabin and peres appealed for party unity and 
peres promised not to settle accounts observers predicted that 
labor will remain split and unable to present a strong opposition 
we will see two organized and hostile camps with leaders who 
hardly speak with each other a kind of prolonged war of 
attrition said israel radios political observer hanan cristal 
likud may forget about opposition it will have an easy life in 
the government 
mordechai gur a senior labor member and a rabin supporter said 
peres victory had weakened the party 
we thought we should change the leadership to lead a strong 
active opposition with peres it would be very difficult we shall 
do our best but im afraid it would not be as strong as it could 
have been gur said 
recent polls have consistantly indicated that rabin 68 is 
israels most popular leader 
also a former prime minister he gained popularity for his tough 
stance as defense minister in the last government in dealing with 
the 31month palestinian uprising in the occupied territories 
he also is remembered as chief of staff in the 1967 middle east 
war when israel captured the west bank from jordan and the gaza 
strip from egypt 
by contrast the popularity of the polishborn peres who turns 
67 in 10 days has been on the decline

randy wells says he remembers vividly the 
chilling frequent conversations he had in prison with a cellmate 
now charged with murder in the killings of six young women found 
buried in the desert 
the dudes crazy wells 27 said in an interview last week 
with the fort worth startelegram at the eastland county jail 90 
miles west of fort worth 
wells said the man charged in the deaths david leonard wood 
told him he lured his victims to the desert with drugs and that he 
thinks he buried one victim alive he said his information on wood 
led to woods indictment 
wood claimed he tied his victims between a tree and the bumper 
of his truck which he then used to stretch them before he raped 
and choked them wells said 
wood a 33yearold convicted rapist from el paso was indicted 
july 13 on murder charges in the slayings of six young women and 
teenagers whose bodies were found in shallow desert graves about 
18 miles northeast of el paso 
the remains of the victims ranging in age from 14 to 23 were 
found within a halfmile of each other between sept 4 1987 and 
march 14 1988 
some were runaways or prostitutes police were criticized for 
not responding more quickly to reports of their disappearances 
wells and wood were cellmates for nearly two months at the 
eastham unit of the texas department of corrections wood claimed 
to have killed 15 women wells said 
hed mumble in his dreams i knew he was tore up hed stay 
up for days wells said 
wells said wood was particularly haunted by one victim 
i think she was alive when he buried her he was throwing dirt 
on her and it was running over her face wells said when she 
breathed the dirt came out around her nose and mouth 
wood frequently reenacted dying quivers he said 
wood had been a suspect in the killings for some time but police 
had insufficient evidence authorities said the indictment resulted 
from unspecified new information but wells said he was the source 
of that information 
neither el paso investigators nor prosecutors would comment on 
wells statements or on whether he and another prison inmate were 
responsible for the new evidence that resulted in the indictment 
officials said they are under explicit orders not to talk about 
any aspect of the case el paso county first assistant district 
attorney gonzalo garcia said authorities are trying to keep the 
publicity down and are under a selfimposed gag order 
but according to the startelegram a letter on el paso 
district attorney steve simmons stationery lauds cooperation in 
the case by wells and james carl sweeney another prisoner who 
acted as woods jailhouse lawyer wells said 
wells courtappointed lawyer gary lewellen said wells help 
did not come free if wells continues to cooperate and testifies 
against wood wells will receive a 15year prison sentence for 
forgery lewellen said prosecutors also would not pursue a capital 
murder charge against wells 
eastland county district attorney emory walton refused to 
confirm an agreement had been made with wells 
wood is jailed in el paso he doesnt have an attorney for the 
serial murder case yet 
wood was arrested in october 1987 and five months later was 
convicted of sexual assault for a july 1987 rape

desert near where bodies later were found and started digging a 
hole behind a bush then raped her and left her naked in the desert 
he was sentenced to 50 years in prison and fined 10000 he had 
previous convictions for indecency with a child and rape 
wells also was on a return trip to prison when he met wood he 
had served time for burglary and was serving two years for theft

federal officials trying to balance 
northwest logging jobs against protecting the rare northern spotted 
owl got their first closeup look at the birds that officially 
become a threatened species monday 
they are a magnificent creature said jim moseley an 
assistant agriculture secretary and head of a committee meeting 
with timber industry leaders government officials and 
environmentalists 
and when you see something like that for the first time and 
also to see an oldgrowth tree for the first time its an 
experience it was extremely valuable to me to see that moseley 
said 
moseleys committee represents a federal interagency task force 
charged with devising a plan that balances owl interests against 
northwest timber jobs 
one of the things thats become clear to me the issue goes 
beyond just the spotted owl moseley said it is an oldgrowth 
issue clearly cooperation between the agencies between the 
state between private landowners is something that is 
recommended 
the us fish and wildlife service said last month the northern 
spotted owl would be listed as threatened under the federal 
endangered species act which means the government must come up 
with a protection plan 
in the wake of that decision the bush administration created 
the task force which is to report by sept 1 
each nesting pair of owls needs large areas of undisturbed 
oldgrowth forest to survive bush has said he wants to balance the 
needs of timber communities against owl protection 
representatives of various groups emerged from meetings with the 
task force saying they had had a good hearing but doubted if the 
panel could accomplish anything significant 
its probably more wheel spinning but its necessary said 
mike burrill president of burrill lumber in medford they cant 
solve it on their own the problems were created by laws passed by 
congress 
doug frank of the environmental group friends of the 
greensprings said an outside group like the task force is needed to 
find a compromise 
when you have a dysfunctional family you dont expect anybody 
in the family to solve the problem frank said you expect 
somebody from outside to come in and help 
on saturday forest service biologists led the task force onto 
the butte falls ranger district of the rogue river national forest 
in the cascade range where they saw an adult male spotted owl and 
an owlet living in a 14acre forest patch surrounded by heavy 
logging said spokeswoman christina mcgown 
the owlet will be a sitting duck when its time to leave the 
nest because surrounding clearcuts will leave it vulnerable to its 
chief enemy the great horned owl said forest service biologist 
mario mamone 
scientists have suggested leaving swathes of trees uncut as 
protected corridors for owls and other wildlife 
a panel of federal scientists has recommended placing 3 million 
acres of forest offlimits to logging to serve as owl habitats the 
forest service has estimated that would cost 28000 northwest 
timber jobs over the next decade 
besides moseley the task force includes officials from the 
interior department environmental protection agency and office of 
management and budget

republican and democratic senators alike on 
sunday warned president bush not to apply an antiabortion litmus 
test as he searches for a successor to retired supreme court 
justice william j brennan 
if you have to have someone who wants to overturn roe vs 
wade its going to be a blood bath getting the nomination 
confirmed and the same is true on the other side predicted 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas 
there shouldnt be a single litmus test in picking a supreme 
court justice dole said on nbctvs meet the press program 
sen patrick leahy dvt a member of the senate judiciary 
committee agreed it would be a mistake for bush to base his choice 
on how prospective nominees views the high courts 1973 ruling in 
support of abortion rights 
leahy appearing on cbstvs face the nation said there was 
a very real question on whether the senate would go along 
with a nominee who had been selected because he or she would vote 
a particular way on abortion 
bush met for 90 minutes with top lieutenants at the white house 
sunday evening for an update on the search for brennans successor 
but no decisions were made white house spokeswoman alixe glen said 
she said the meeting was attended by vice president dan quayle 
attorney general dick thornburgh presidential counsel c boyden 
gray and white house chief of staff john sununu 
the brief session in the presidents residence was called to 
fill in bush on what had been done since the president convened a 
75minute meeting saturday morning with the same three officials to 
get the ball rolling on the search 
a source who was familiar with the meeting said afterward that 
it consisted of a review of material being gathered on all 
potential nominees rather than an attempt to narrow the field to a 
short list the source spoke on condition of not being 
identified by name 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio said bush should look for 
someone who has a good judicial record judicial temperament 
metzenbaum appearing sunday on abctvs this week with david 
brinkley program said he doesnt expect to like bushs nominee 
but added that there was an overwhelming likelihood that whomever 
the president sends up will be confirmed by the senate 
bush has said he hopes to have a new justice seated on the court 
by october to succeed brennan who was a leading voice of 
liberalism on the supreme court for 33 years brennan 84 
announced his resignation friday citing his age and health 
most senators on sunday declined to identify their choices for 
the high court but sen orrin hatch a utah republican who himself 
has been mentioned as a possible nominee had a long list of 
possible contenders ready 
i dont think im going to be selected nor do i really want 
to be hatch said on abc 
possible candidates mentioned by hatch or elsewhere include 
solicitor general kenneth w starr federal appellate judges edith 
h jones and patrick e higginbotham of the 5th circuit william w 
wilkins jr of the 4th circuit and david souter of the 1st circuit 
other federal appellate judges mentioned are roger j miner and 
ralph k winter jr both of the 2nd circuit j harvie wilkinson 
iii of the 4th circuit and pamela a rymer a former federal 
district judge whom bush recently put on the 9th circuit 
there also has been speculation bush might want to appoint the 
courts first hispanic justice possible candidates would be 
ferdinand fernandez a federal judge from california and ricardo 
hinojosa a federal judge from texas 
south carolina gov carroll campbell and sen strom thurmond 
rsc called the white house on saturday to lobby on behalf of 
wilkins 
the south deserves a seat on the supreme court campbell 
said in columbia sc 
but while senators were warning bush not to use abortion as the 
overriding factor in his choice of a nominee some observers were 
predicting that abortion would be a focal point in the senates 
confirmation debate 
conservatives have held a slim 54 majority on the court and 
liberals fear brennans successor could push the court further to 
the right and jeopardize the constitutional right to an abortion 
professor eleanor holmes norton of the georgetown university law 
center said both prochoice and prolife advocates regard abortion 
as a central issue in finding a successor to brennan 
you can bet your bottom dollar that sitting in the senate are 
going to be men who will insist upon bringing out the views of 
the justice on this issue norton said on abc 
norman ornstein of the american enterprise institute appearing 
on cbs said if bush picks someone who clearly opposes roe vs 
wade we are going to get that as the focal point of hearings 
that will be extended for a long time probably right up into 
november

lech walesa won a victory sunday over 
supporters of prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki in their battle for 
the allegiance of grassroots solidarity groups 
in recent weeks the solidarity movement has become split into 
two rival camps one supporting walesa the solidarity chairman 
and the other mazowiecki the head of the government 
the two camps have been battling for control of local solidarity 
citizens committees which have dominated polish politics since the 
communists lost power last year 
on sunday delegates representing local citizens committees 
overwhelmingly rejected a proposal to form a centralized federation 
supporters of mazowiecki had wanted the local committees to 
create a national federation to support his government especially 
now that it is carrying out painful economic reforms 
during sundays sixhour meeting an overwhelming majority of 
the 136 delegates decided instead to hold occasional national 
conferences without creating a standing organization 
walesa in a letter read at the opening of sundays meeting 
made clear that he felt victory was his 
a few weeks ago there was an attempt made to centralize the 
whole citizens movement it is good that you did not agree to it 
one must not forcibly create any kind of unclear unity walesa 
said 
walesa said he could not attend the meeting because he had 
broken his arm while on vacation and his doctor advised him not to 
travel mazowiecki said he couldnt attend because he had influenza 
the local citizens committees sprang up to wage last years 
successful parliamentary campaign that opened the way to a 
solidarityled government in august they have been informally 
overseen by a 200member national citizens committee of leading 
intellectuals and union activists who served at walesas invitation 
last month 63 prominent solidarity intellectuals and activists 
on the national committee broke ranks with walesa they called for 
disbanding the national body 
walesas critics accused him of acting in an autocratic manner 
and trying to make the committees into tools for his widely 
expected campaign for president of poland a post now held by 
former communist leader wojciech jaruzelski 
the antiwalesa group finding itself shut out of control of the 
national citizens committee had hoped to persuade local committees 
to form a national federation to support mazowiecki 
last monday walesas opponents including some major figures of 
the solidarity movement announced the formation of a centerleft 
political movement democratic action which supports the 
mazowiecki government 
democratic action is expected to challenge a prowalesa 
political group the center alliance which was formed two months 
ago 
in his letter walesa urged the local committees to get ready to 
choose their own candidates for upcoming free parliamentary 
elections which are expected to be held by early spring 
the committees endorsement is important because most of the 
candidates backed by them have won in local and national elections 
walesas remarks appeared to be setting the stage for a battle 
with his solidarity rivals for control of the next parliament 
which could elect a new president 
the split within solidarity emerged after walesa criticized the 
mazowiecki government for what he considers the slow pace of 
political and economic reforms 
walesas former allies accuse him of becoming a danger to 
democracy because he stirs emotions against the government at a 
time when it faces populist attacks for carrying out difficult 
economic reforms

officials did not expect any public health problems due to the 
shutdown of the wards island plant said department of 
environmental protection spokesman peter cannavo

abc lost 14 million in advertising revenue 
last season to advertisers that boycotted programs they deemed 
offensive network entertainment president bob iger said sunday 
its a sorry state of affairs when advertisers are acting as 
skittish as they are iger told a news conference attended by 
television critics the networks get the heat but i really think 
it should be the advertisers 
the lost revenue was slightly more than 1 percent of abcs total 
advertising revenues of 1 billion for this year iger said 
iger declined to name the advertisers who withdrew their 
commercials and said the 14 million figure represented the first 
time abc had counted such lost revenue since he took over as 
programming chief 16 months ago 
his remarks were in response to continued questioning about 
abcs refusal to rerun an episode of thirtysomething that 
showed two gay men in bed talking about friends who had died from 
aids 
igers economic decision to shelve the installment was 
labeled as cowardice by gay and lesbian groups that have 
launched a letterwriting protest 
iger said saturday he pulled the episode because half of 
thirtysomething advertisers boycotted its first showing last 
season costing the network more than 1 million 
other shows that suffered a similar fate last season included an 
episode of roseanne that focused on teenage drinking iger 
said 
one sponsor pulled out of that program iger said thirtysecond 
commercial spots on roseanne usually range from 300000 to 
400000 according to trade publications 
igers questionandanswer period with television critics also 
covered abcs upcoming fall and spring schedules 
with six new shows abc has a smaller number of fall programs to 
launch than cbs or nbc it makes the task at hand easier iger 
said 
of those cop rock is probably abcs best hope iger said 
the new show about singing police officers has drawn a decidedly 
mixed response from abcs affiliated stations

federal and state investigators on sunday 
delayed the cleanup of a chemical plant leveled by a deadly 
explosion last week 
basf corp had hoped fire officials could begin removing 
hundreds of barrels of chemicals from its plant site on sunday 
said quality assurance manager ron leisner 
but theres a lot of consideration that has to be made in a 
situation like this he said we dont even have access to some 
of the sites yet 
thursdays blast killed one man injured at least 68 people and 
shattered glass in buildings surrounding the plant on the citys 
north side buildings in the nineacre complex were leveled or 
gutted 
both patients at university hospital remained in critical 
condition sunday a third person was in critical condition at 
bethesda hospital 
teams from the occupational safety and health administration and 
the state and federal environmental protection agencies were on the 
scene leisner said 
the investigators want to make sure the area is secure before 
we get too deep into the cleanup and removal of any of the damaged 
materials he said 
some asbestos was found in the building debris but no airborne 
particles leisner said he said the area will continue to be 
monitored for asbestos and other dangers 
some of the drums to be removed contain hazardous materials and 
could explode if punctured or ignited said william murphy oshas 
area director 
he said the ohio environmental protection agency will not allow 
those to be removed from the site and that any that are 
potentially explosive will be moved to an isolated area 
officials barricaded the area after a rekindled fire was 
discovered next to some barrels saturday but the fire was 
extinguished and all but a portion of one road was reopened 
the plant owned by inmont corp until 1985 was cited four 
times after recent osha inspections state inspectors found eight 
waste storage problems in a feb 27 check 
investigators said they could not be sure whether waste 
management problems were a factor in the blast company officials 
said preliminary indications were that it was caused by a piece of 
equipment that overheated

south korea is ready to negotiate 
north korean preconditions for opening the border to free travel 
between the rival nations south korean officials announced monday 
the decision follows a major policy speech friday by president 
roh taewoo who proposed to north korea that the common border be 
opened for five days in august on a trial basis to allow free 
travel for residents of the two sides he said open borders could 
lead talks on eventual unification of the koreas 
communist north korea immediately dismissed rohs proposal as 
fraudulent propaganda it said south korea must first tear down 
concrete walls allegedly built along its border end national 
security laws banning procommunist activity and release 
dissidents jailed for promoting unification 
three cabinet ministers monday proposed that interkorea talks 
be held friday to discuss the north korean preconditions 
the heavily fortified border between the two koreas is tightly 
sealed and more than 15 million troops are stationed on either 
side behind concrete bunkers and barbed wire there is no mail 
travel or other communication between the two sides 
justice minister lee jongnam defense minister lee sanghoon 
and national unification minister hong sungchul held a joint news 
conference to announce the south korean policy 
in order to open the border and realize grand national 
exchanges we are ready to discuss any problems related to it 
the unification minister said on national radio and television 
prowestern south korea and communist north korea were divided 
at the end of world war ii and fought the korean war from 1950 to 
1953 they are technically still at war because no peace treaty was 
signed 
in their announcement monday hong and other ministers said the 
discussions should include any problems either side would raise 
they noted that north korea has a number of legal and systematic 
barriers to free travel 
the north koreans had also demanded that south korean radical 
students and dissidents be allowed to attend a pannational 
congress the north plans to hold at the border village of 
panmunjom on aug 15 to promote unification 
the unification minister hong said the seoul government would 
support the aug 15 rally if the south korean delegation would 
include representatives of all walks of life the north invited 
only dissident and radical student leaders from the south 
hong also said his government would allow a crossborder march 
by any organization on the two sides south korea banned such 
marches by its dissident groups in the past 
the justice minister said south korea can discuss preconditions 
north korea has set in connection of the border opening but he 
noted that pyongyang also has harsh national security laws and 
human rights problems 
several prominent south korean dissident leaders have been 
jailed for making unauthorized trips to north korea in violation of 
national security law north korea has demanded the release of the 
jailed dissidents and the repeal of the law under which they were 
punished 
the justice minister said north korea also has laws calling for 
capital punishment for those supporting south korea and its 
constitution states that the no 1 goal of the north is bringing 
communism to the south 
quoting reports by international human rights groups lee said 
north korea is holding 152000 political prisoners at 12 
concentration camps the prisoners included former prime minister 
lee kunmo former vice presidents kim changbong and park 
kumchul and exnational security chief kim byungha 
the minister also said north korea imposes tight domestic travel 
restrictions the norths 21 million people cannot travel beyond 
the boundary of a country they live in without prior government 
approval he said 
the defense minister proposed an onsite joint investigation of 
the alleged concrete walls in the south along with similar 
barriers which he claimed exist along the northern sector of the 
border 
he said the walls are in fact a series of tank traps built 
along several sections of the 155mile border to block a possible 
north korean invasion 
north korea also has antitank barriers along the border the 
minister said 
the defense minister also demanded a joint investigation of four 
invasion tunnels allegedly dug by north korea under the 
demilitarized zone separating the two koreas 
north korea has denied digging the tunnels

wildfires burned over more than 900000 
acres of alaska on sunday producing smoke that hampered 
firefighting and triggered an airquality alert in fairbanks and 
much of the rest of the interior 
visibility at the riley creek visitors center at denali national 
park 120 miles south of fairbanks and alaskas top tourist 
attraction dropped to a quartermile at times over the weekend 
the park is up and running as usual but theyre cautioning 
people not to exert themselves and to spend time indoors said 
park service spokesman john quinley 
people in fairbanks were given similar warnings 
no injuries or serious damage has been reported 
smoke from wildfires that have already burned more than a 
million acres made it impossible to get accurate estimates of the 
sizes of some blazes quinley said 
thick smoke grounded some aircraft used in fighting the 
54000acre tok river fire said trish hogervorstrukke a 
spokeswoman with alaskas interagency fire information center 
but the smoke also held down temperatures in the interior and 
pushed up the humidity reducing the intensity of the blazes 
the tok river fire started by lightning three weeks ago 
remained the states most laborintensive blaze occupying 789 
firefighters 
officials estimate that firefighting statewide is costing 
700000 a day 
the beaver fire named for a village on the yukon river 
remained alaskas largest on sunday it was burning a 10by48mile 
section of spruce forest said hogervorstrukke 
fires along the alaska highway reduced visibility to less than 2 
miles in a wide region north of tok to fairbanks 
authorities said alaska firefighting crews were also sent to the 
canadian border village of old crow where about 280 people were 
evacuated because of fire near the porcupine river 
a fire 25 miles northeast of king salmon was estimated at 1100 
acres and was being fought with specially designed planes from 
canada that fly low scooping water from lakes and depositing it 
over fires 
the kanuti flats fire about 140 miles north of fairbanks was 
burning 100000 acres on sunday and was within two miles of the 
transalaska oil pipeline authorities were monitoring the fire but 
not fighting it 
authorities said there was no danger to the pipeline which 
quinley said isburied beneath the tundra near where the fire is 
burning
