supreme court justice william j brennan 
resigned friday after a 34year career as a leading voice of 
liberalism on the nations highest court 
brennan 84 said his advancing age and medical condition 
led to his decision to step down 
his departure gives president bush his first chance to name a 
justice to the court which has been deeply divided in recent years 
on such issues as a womans right to an abortion affirmative 
action and separation of church and state brennan has been a firm 
advocate of all three 
bush told reporters that brennans decision had taken him by 
surprise 
obviously his resignation is accepted i also thank him for 
his distinguished service to the united states the president 
told reporters aboard air force one en route to washington from 
wyoming 
bush said he would meet with top aides saturday morning to 
start the process of finding a successor and already outside 
groups were seeking to influence his decision the president said 
that he wanted the bestqualified person for the post and was not 
afraid of starting a nomination fight 
the president called brennan during the flight said white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater fitzwater declined to say what was said 
in the conversation 
an antiabortion group in iowa looked forward to a new justice 
who opposes abortion while eleanor smeal former president of the 
national organization of women said a potential justices views on 
the subject will be the key political issue of the 1990 
senatorial elections 
whatever the course of the confirmation process brennans 
brethren on the court rushed to praise him 
justice thurgood marshall said brennan has been a voice of 
caution and compassion in urging that this court not retreat from 
its constitutional mission to protect individuals rights of 
freedom and expression guarantee that minorities be free from 
discrimination and to assure the rights of those accused of 
crimes 
justice byron r white a member of the high court since 1962 
said i enjoyed every day i spent with him he is a great justice 
and he will be remembered for that 
sen edward m kennedy hailed brennan appointed by president 
eisenhower in 1956 as one of the greatest justices the country 
has ever had 
last april just days before his 84th birthday brennan said he 
was not dismayed by the courts growing conservatism and said would 
not retire unless his health required it 
im not discouraged to the point of giving up he said 
im not going to walk out and say the hell with it 
but brennan suffered a small stroke after the term ended 
falling down in newark airport en route to a scandinavian vacation 
said court spokeswoman toni house his doctor advised brennan to 
avoid stress and strain and consider retiring ms house said 
in his letter to bush brennan said strenuous demands of 
court work and its related duties required or expected of a justice 
appear at this time to be incompatible with my advancing age and 
medical condition 
i therefore retire effectively immediately as an associate 
justice of the supreme court of the united states 
brennan suffered a small stroke in 1979 that left his right arm 
and hand partially paralyzed and in 1978 underwent radiation 
treatments for a cancerous tumor in his throat 
he had said he considered retiring in 1979 burdened also by the 
illness of his wife of 51 years his wife marjorie died of cancer 
in 1982 and brennan subsequently married his secretary of 25 
years mary fowler 
after his appointment by eisenhower brennan quickly found a 
home among the liberal majority led by chief justice earl warren 
along with fellow liberal justice marshall brennan has 
maintained that the constitution forbids the death penalty as cruel 
and unusual punishment 
among the more than 1200 opinions authored by brennan are 
landmarks that imposed a onperson onevote standard for 
electing state legislatures created constitutional protections for 
libel lawsuit defendants and helped invent a legal definition of 
obscenity 
he remains among four justices on the court who wholeheartedly 
support the courts 1973 ruling that legalized abortion nationwide 
brennan said in a statement friday that his retirement is a 
very difficult decision after almost 34 years of service on the 
court 
it is my hope that the court during my years of service has 
built a legacy of interpretation of the constitution and federal 
laws to make them responsive to the needs of the people whom they 
were intended to benefit and protect this legacy can and will 
withstand the test of time 
brennan served under eight presidents his departure is bound to 
cause a dramatic change in the liberalconservative balance at the 
court 
only one justice in the courts history william o douglas 
wrote more opinions only three served at a more advanced age 
oliver wendell holmes 91 roger taney 87 and hugo black 85 
for more than three decades brennan has been a leading exponent 
of liberalism and by most accounts a leading behindthescenes 
strategist in helping mold liberal rulings and in later years in 
preserving them on an increasingly conservative court 
although the court and its changing cast of justices grew more 
conservative over the years he remained a powerful force 
conservatives have consolidated their power and in most cases 
command a 54 majority but in several key areas liberals led by 
brennan have been able to win important victories 
just last month with brennan wrote for a fivemember majority 
that upheld the federal governments power to implement affirmative 
action the court upheld policies of the federal communications 
commission giving minorities special preference in the award of 
broadcast licenses 
brennans health has generally appeared good despite his 
advancing age he was weakened badly by the flu this year but he 
appeared to have recovered by the end of the term last month 
at the time of his appointment he was a member of the new 
jersey supreme court he was confirmed by the senate early in 1957 
with only sen joseph mccarthy rwis voting against him 
mccarthy accused brennan of being too soft on communism 
a graduate of the university of pennsylvania and harvard law 
school he had practiced labor law in newark before becoming a 
state judge in 1949 and rising through the judicial ranks

president bush thanked retiring justice 
william j brennan on friday for his distinguished service in 
34 years on the bench and said he would meet with advisers saturday 
to begin choosing a successor 
brennans colleagues remembered him as a voice of caution and 
compassion whose decisions over 34 years fought to preserve the 
liberties of americans 
i greet the news of my brother justice brennans departure 
from the court with deep regret justice thurgood marshall said 
in a statement he is an eminent jurist whom no one can equal for 
his breadth of knowledge integrity and commitment to justice for 
all humankind 
without doubt his opinions will go down in history as the 
greatest of the courts 
marshall was perhaps brennans closest collaborator on the 
court both for example opposed the death penalty in all 
circumstances they voted to stop the execution of a virginia man 
thursday night but were outweighed by their colleagues 
chief justice william h rehnquist said brennan has made a 
major contribution to american constitutional law i hope his 
retirement will enable him to relax from the cares of office and 
restore his health 
bush who received a facsimile of brennans resignation as he 
boarded air force one in wyoming said the announcement came as a 
complete surprise 
the matter is now official and we will now start the process 
of finding a successor bush said adding that he would meet 
saturday at the white house with attorney general dick thornburgh 
chief of staff john sununu and white house counsel c boyden gray 
to discuss a successor 
asked what judicial philosophy he would seek bush said its 
too early to express anything of that nature ive always said i 
want somebody who will be on there not to legislate from the bench 
but to faithfully interpret the constitution so that gives me a 
wide latitude 
sen edward kennedy dmass a member of the senate judiciary 
committee ranked brennan with marshall and former justices oliver 
wendell holmes jr and louis brandeis as the greatest justices 
this country ever had 
brennan at 84 was the oldest justice and with more than 33 years 
on the court was the senior in point of service 
i am justice brennans oldest colleague on the court and i 
enjoyed every day i spent with him justice byron white said 
marshall called him a treasured colleage and a dear friend i 
will miss his warm heart and kindred spirit 
justice brennan consistently has been a voice of caution and 
compassion in urging that this court not retreat from its 
constitutional mission to protect individuals rights he added 
american civil liberties union president norman dorsen said 
brennans resignation would be an incalculable loss to the law 
and civil liberties and to every person whose rights are threatened 
in the united states 
justice brennan has been a courageous insightful and above 
all humane jurist he will not be easily replaced 
brennans replacement was the subject of immediate speculation 
and jockeying by interest groups friday night 
kate michelman president of the national abortion rights action 
league said friday was a very very dark day 
ive been saying for months that the threat to our right to 
choose is as close as the next supreme court appointment she 
said in an interview clearly this is a very serious loss for all 
of us who value individual liberty and privacy rights 
the iowa right to life committee however said the 
appointment of one more justice who believes that all human life 
both born and unborn deserves protection will be the beginning 
toward our country once again protecting preborn life 
the court has been split 54 recently on such heated political 
issues as abortion and legal experts predicted the balance was 
about to shift 
sen paul simon dill a member of the judiciary committee 
said that because of the frequent 54 votes brennans resignation 
is a monumental change it is important that president bush make 
an appointment that will not polarize the nation 
susan low bloch a law professor at georgetown university said 
a lot of the 54 decisions that went the way brennan voted are 
likely to switch because i think its likely that president bush is 
going to pick someone whose views differ from brennan

here are excerpts from the us court of 
appeals decision in the oliver north case and from the dissenting 
opinion by chief judge patricia wald 
at trial north was convicted on three of 12 counts aiding and 
abetting the obstruction of congress count 6 altering and 
destroying national security council documents count 9 and 
accepting an illegal gratuity count 10 the kastigar case 
referred to is a 1972 supreme court decision setting out safeguards 
to make sure that someone forced to testify under a grant of 
limited immunity is not convicted later as a result of his own 
testimony directly or indirectly 
the appeals court panel said 
because of the length and complexity of our disposition of 
norths appeal we summarize our holdings 
1 the district court erred in failing to hold a full hearing 
to ensure that the ic independent counsel made no use of 
norths immunized congressional testimony norths convictions on 
all three counts are therefore vacated and remanded to the district 
court 
2 the district courts jury instructions on count 9 were 
erroneous in that they allowed the jury to convict without 
unanimously concluding that north committed any one of the criminal 
acts charged in count 9 this error mandates reversal of 
norths conviction on count 9 
3 the district court did not err in refusing to instruct the 
jury on the defense of authorization the district court did 
err however in limiting the jurys consideration of authorization 
evidence as that evidence was relevant to the issue of intent in 
count 9 norths conviction on count 9 is therefore reversed 
4 the district court did not err in quashing norths subpoena 
of former president reagan and the quashal did not violate norths 
sixth amendment rights 
5 the district court erred by instructing the jury that as a 
matter of law a congressional inquiry was pending we 
conclude however that this error was harmless 
6 although the prosecution made highly improper remarks 
during closing argument the district court did not err in refusing 
to grant a new trial on that basis 
7 the district courts rulings with regard to the classified 
information procedures act cipa did not violate the due process 
clause and were not otherwise erroneous 
8 the credit given by the district court to a jurors denial 
of bias even though the juror made false statements on the juror 
questionnaire was not erroneous and in no way prevented north from 
exercising his peremptory challenges 
9 the district court did not err in declining to allow into 
evidence an edited videotape of the congressional testimony of adm 
john poindexter norths former superior at the nsc 
10 the district court did not violate the jury selection and 
service act jssa 
11 although the district court may have been better advised 
to use a different verdict form the district court did not 
improperly foreclose a general verdict of guilty or not guilty on 
counts 6 and 9 
12 other than with respect to the element of intent in count 
9 the district court committed no reversible error in its jury 
instructions concerning the critical elements of each offense 
13 venue in the district of columbia was proper for count 10 
14 the district court committed no error in allowing north to 
be tried as an aider and abettor on count 6 
the fact that a sizable number of grand jury witnesses trial 
witnesses and their aides apparently immersed themselves in norths 
immunized testimony leads us to doubt whether what is in question 
here is simply stimulation of memory by a bit of compelled 
testimony whether the governments use of compelled testimony 
occurs in the natural course of events or results from an 
unprecedented aberration is irrelevant to a citizens fifth 
amendment right 
from a prosecutors standpoint an unhappy byproduct of the 
fifth amendment is that kastigar may very well require a trial 
within a trial or a trial before during or after the trial if 
such a proceeding is necessary for the court to determine whether 
or not the government has in any fashion used compelled testimony 
to indict or convict a defendant 
we readily understand how court and counsel might sigh prior 
to such an undertaking such a kastigar proceeding could consume 
substantial amounts of time personnel and money only to lead to 
the conclusion that a defendant perhaps a guilty defendant 
cannot be prosecuted yet the very purpose of the fifth amendment 
under these circumstances is to prevent the prosecutor from 
transmogrifying into the inquisitor complete with that officers 
most pernicious tool the power of the state to force a person to 
incriminate himself 
on remand if the prosecution is to continue the district 
court must hold a full kastigar hearing that will inquire into the 
content as well as the sources of the grand jury and trial 
witnesses testimony that inquiry must proceed witnessbywitness 
if necessary it will proceed linebyline and itembyitem for 
each grand jury and trial witness the prosecution must show by a 
preponderance of the evidence that no use whatsoever was made of 
any of the immunized testimony either by the witness or by the 
office of independent counsel in questioning the witness 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
wald chief judge dissenting 
oliver norths was a case of epic proportions massively 
publicized for many weeks engaging the rapt attention and emotions 
of the nation the panel today reverses his convictions on three 
separate grounds including a remand for an itembyitem 
linebyline hearing on whether any bit of evidence as yet 
unidentified may have reflected exposure to norths immunized 
testimony before congress 
after studying for months the thousands of pages of 
transcripts and hundreds of documents produced for the grand jury 
and trial i on the other hand am satisfied that north received a 
fair trial not a perfect one but a competently managed and a fair 
one as in all trials of this magnitude a few errors were made 
but in analyzing and researching norths claims including the 
three grounds on which the per curiam court majority reverses i 
do not find singly or cumulatively that any of them rose to the 
status of reversible error i am convinced that the essentials of a 
fair trial were accorded north and that his conviction on the 
three counts of which the jury found him guilty should be 
affirmed

even mcdonalds couldnt bring fast food to moscow 
hundreds of young soviets are selling beeg maks as fast as 
their hands can move ricocheting off each other in the crush 
behind the counter at the mcdonalds less than a mile from the 
kremlin 
but even 5000 sandwiches an hour is not enough to satisfy 
soviet hunger for a taste of the west the lunchtime line is 90 
minutes and 1200 people long 
six months after opening the golden arches have eclipsed the 
popularity of even lenins tomb where a recent wait to see the 
preserved body of the soviet founder took only 20 minutes 
feelayohfeesh whats that asked a grandmother as she 
sounded out the russian transliteration of a filetofish 
sandwich on a mcdonalds brochure a freshfaced young mcdonalds 
staffer had given her the brochure when she joined the end of the 
threeblock line curling around the fountain and wroughtiron 
lampposts of pushkin square 
entrepreneurs hawked their wares along the line one ruble for a 
latvian humor newspaper just 25 times the price of pravda or 25 
rubles for an application to immigrate to the united states the 
stack of blank paperwork is available free to anyone willing to 
stand in another line at the embassy 
inside the sheer volume has taken its toll a milkshake is 
served melted and the big mac is a bit flat because iceberg 
lettuce doesnt curl quite the same when grown under glass in these 
northern latitudes 
but the fries were salty and golden a straw stood in a second 
shake and soviets found lettuce wondrous enough without worrying 
about its ability to fluff up a sandwich 
four hours into their day few of the 250 young people cooking 
and manning 27 cash registers managed obligatory mcdonalds smiles 
but all were unfailingly polite for soviets accustomed to snarling 
clerks slopping out cafeteria hash this is nothing short of 
unbelievable 
we really like the service said a smiling irina borunova 
who came to moscow from the town of murom 150 miles to the east 
with her husband and small son 
its so clean not like a soviet restaurant marveled nina 
balitskaya a student teacher who admitted to having braved the 
line 15 times 
for galina voyevodkina of moscow the queue and the prices were 
just too much 
for this kind of money i could sit in a real restaurant and 
be served she pointed out and its not fast i had to stand 
in line for an hour and a half 
a big mac costs 375 rubles or a little over two hours pay for 
the average soviet restaurants in state hotels charge two to three 
rubles for a entree while private soviet restaurants may demand 10 
to 50 rubles 
already mcdonalds has spawned a soviet clone across town on 
taganka square the same yellow and red colors spell out 
gamburger kafe that is the russian transliteration of 
hamburger because the language has no letter h 
the small cafe abandons the usual soviet restaurant gloom in 
favor of its competitors idea of allowing sunlight to stream 
through the windows the decor is typically soviet with five 
clashing patterns of ceramic tile 
the gamburgers arrive in unusually fresh and crusty buns 
served with white cheese onions green pepper and cucumber 
soviet approximations of the cheddar cheese onions lettuce and 
pickles that mcdonalds found only by building its own 50 million 
moscow food factory 
gamburgers are fairly fast served to a line of five people 
in just minutes but theyre stone cold 
mcdonalds figured the demand would be overwhelming when it 
opened moscows first taste of the west six months ago but 
managers were stunned when the volume hit 30000 meals a day now 
its more than 50000 the restaurant is the chains biggest and 
busiest 
to deal with it the staff has nearly doubled from 630 to 1100 
said operations supervisor glenn steeves from mcdonalds of canada 
which operates the restaurant in a joint venture with the city of 
moscow 
the crush and resulting staff expansion also created dozens of 
unexpected openings for frontline supervisors and an unforseen 
boon suddenly mcdonalds promise of fast promotion for peak 
performance was a reality and a marvelous incentive to stay 
working hard and honestly 
karina pogosova 21 said she had been hired as a regular crew 
member for the opening in january and in six months had been 
promoted to shift supervisor on the counter overseeing 40 to 45 
staffers her salary has more than doubled from the 250 rubles a 
month mcdonalds starting wage about average for soviet workers 
to 550 rubles 
even soviet staffers had expressed worry when mcdonalds opened 
that it would lose a fortune to staff theft considered by many 
soviets a more important benefit than salary but steeves said 
clear warnings of prosecution and strict accounting have worked 
we count every bun every patty every pickle he said 
its not a problem

rome police denied there was violence 
acts of physical abuse were committed against the crew after 
the wednesday night concert at a stadium phillips said in a 
statement distributed by princes paisley park studios of

calvin hostetler had long suspected 
his home was hiding a historical secret this summer he began 
tearing the building down and discovered he was right 
hidden within the thick walls of the condemned house about 18 
miles west of south bend was a small log cabin in nearperfect 
condition 
the cabin has one tiny main room and two even smaller side 
rooms underneath is a cellar lined with stones that hostetler 
estimates weigh 20 to 25 tons 
a preliminary search by fern schultz president of the laporte 
county historical society revealed the land was purchased by a 
tobias miller on aug 12 1833 
settlers began building cabins and clearing land in the area in 
the late 1820s but mrs schultz said records do not indicate when 
the cabin might have been built 
theres no way of proving that miller built the cabin she 
said thursday whether he was a land speculator or a farmer i 
dont know 
hostetler lived in the house in the mid1970s he suspected that 
a log cabin was inside the thick walls because he had seen the 
uncovered logs in an entry way in the house 
after the county condemned the building he began dismantling it 
finding a cabin within a home is unusual as most log structures 
were destroyed in the construction of newer homes mrs schultz 
said 
hostetler said he plans to probably show it to the public 
weve had a lot of interest in it with people asking to look over 
it 
mrs schultz said the historical society would continue to 
examine its records seeking clues to the cabins history

as the yellow submersible delta 
slips beneath the gulf of maine 22 miles off massachusetts bubbles 
form outside the portholes and the craft enters a different world 
the tiny twoperson sub skims the sea floor scattering fish 
and moving noiselessly through rocky canyons this 
onceinalifetime experience 200 feet underwater is part of a 
program for high school students designed to bring the reality of 
the ocean and the environment up close 
dont be scared the pilot barks at a reporter as the sub 
hits the edge of a sharp ledge and bounces off backwards into a 
murky crevasse it sounds bad but nothings gonna break 
as the sub meanders along the bottom a new kingdom slowly comes 
to life vivid pink and red stems of algae rising from the rough 
sand flutter eerily like lone longstemmed roses ivorycolored 
sponges decorate black craggy rocks 
flounder swim lazily by the portholes an enormous skate lying 
flat along the bottom like a gray throw rug heaves awake under the 
bright flood lights of the sub and circles the craft in apparent 
irritation 
the high school aquanaut program is an opportunity for high 
school students and their teachers to participate in real undersea 
research in the gulf of maine the waters off southern new england 
the midatlantic bight and the laurentian great lakes 
i couldnt believe what i was seeing said mary wohlleber 
17 who will be a freshman at eastern connecticut state university 
next year and has made two dives it makes you appreciate the 
ocean more youre there doing the work firsthand and until you do 
it firsthand you dont respect the animals or their environment 
the program is sponsored by the federallyfunded national 
undersea foundation at the university of connecticut at present 
the students are from southeastern connecticut high schools but 
there are plans to bring in innercity students from new york next 
year 
theres no better way to get youngsters excited about the 
ocean and the environment than to make them diving scientists 
said richard a cooper director of the national undersea research 
center 
its safe too the delta has made 1969 dives with no 
accidents the sub is made of reinforced steel equipped with the 
same type of battery in a golf cart it can go to 1200 feet 
maximum without pressurized air 
students in the program now in its third year take part in 
ongoing research experiments they are selected on a competitive 
basis from their schools and plan their individual projects with 
their teachers and program coordinators before they go to sea 
it was the experience of a lifetime 17yearold brad martin 
said the views the crew being in a place that not many others 
are able to travel and explore the program has been a dream come 
true 
in the socalled pigeon hill area at jeffreys ledge off 
gloucester students help marine biologists measure the pollution 
content in scallops which in turn determines the contaminant level 
in surface sediments they deploy scallop cages on certain dives 
and later retrieve them with the aid of the mechanical arm of the 
delta 
we want to make them see that it takes only a short time to 
pollute the planet and several thousand years to reverse the 
process said cooper 
the data gleaned from the scallop samples also has a larger 
significance according to bill robinson a marine biologist with 
the new england aquarium and a program coordinator 
we know more about corn in the midwest than we do about fish 
in the ocean he said thats why we can harvest corn so well 
we dont know anything about scallops but once we know about their 
reproduction cycles itll make all the difference 
performer richie havens was aboard the research vessel jw 
powell this week as it left gloucester with a group of scientists 
and teachers to discover firsthand how the program works 
havens 49 who grew up in brooklyn works with underprivileged 
students in new york city in addition to his singing career he 
helped found the northwind undersea institute for children on city 
island in the bronx he also heads the natural guard based in 
washington dc a program which offers innercity youth a chance 
to experience other environments 
i was a city kid and city kids need a place to go away from 
the concrete said havens who will be bringing students into the 
program next year were trying to raise their consciousness 
about their environment by showing them something they wouldnt 
otherwise see 
coordinators from the national undersea foundation hope the 
program will expand nationwide

house republicans are scrambling to find a 
clear position on tax increases as congressional democrats and 
president bush duel over who is to blame for swelling budget 
deficits 
minority leader robert michel rill said friday that he is 
unsure how many republicans will ultimately support a 
deficitreduction package that includes tax increases 
i dont know that anything is clearly definitive we havent 
come up with a package yet michel told reporters 
in more than two months of bargaining administration and 
congressional budget negotiators have been unable to agree to 50 
billion in tax increases and spending cuts for the 1991 fiscal year 
that begins oct 1 
their talks were rocked wednesday when the houses 176member 
gop caucus voted informally to oppose new taxes and all tax rate 
increases as a means of reducing the federal budget deficit 
but the next day the no 2 house republican minority whip newt 
gingrich of georgia who supported the gop resolution told 
fellow budget negotiators that he could sponsor and support a 
compromise that includes spending cuts and tax increases 
gingrich and rep richard armey rtexas who sponsored the gop 
resolution said there was nothing inconsistent about their 
positions gingrich said he voted for armeys resolution 
i presented the resolution as our policy position and i 
didnt present it as one that bound any individual members vote 
armey said 
id not expect to agree to a budget package that wouldnt get 
a substantial number of house republican votes gingrich said 
but democrats said they do not know where republicans stand on 
the question of taxes 
they ought to resolve that and let us know whos in charge 
said sen lloyd bentsen dtexas chairman of the senate finance 
committee 
bentsen his partys 1988 vice presidential candidate was one 
of several democrats who criticized bush on friday for pointing his 
finger at them for causing the deficit problem 
thats incredible bentsen said when told that bush had 
blamed the democratic stranglehold on congress for continuing 
budget shortfalls 
rep william gray of pennsylvania who is no 3 in the house 
democratic leadership said bushs comments at a gop fundraising 
breakfast friday were an example of usual electionyear 
hyperbole 
he said the president was ignoring a national debt that has 
grown from less than 1 trillion when bush became vice president in 
1981 to more than 31 trillion today 
its tantamount to the captain of the titanic saying dont 
blame me blame the crew i just happen to be here gray said 
foley called bushs remarks a partisan speech for a partisan 
audience for a partisan purpose 
bentsen accused the bush and reagan administrations of eight 
years of 200 billion hot checks a reference to budget gaps that 
have surpassed 200 billion annually in some recent years 
some of us have been saying this should be turned around and 
the administration has not done so he said 
in his remarks in billings mont bush said democratic control 
of congress which has lasted 29 of the last 35 years has gone 
on long enough 
we must end this deficits dont matter mentality he said 
the fiscal 1991 deficit is expected to be 169 billion not 
counting the tens of billions of dollars it will cost to rescue the 
savings and loan industry

the mexican government wants a us drug agent 
arrested and extradited to mexico to face charges that he kidnapped 
a mexican doctor wanted in the 1985 slaying of drug enforcement 
administration agent enrique camarena 
the mexican embassy delivered two diplomatic notes to the state 
department on friday seeking the arrest of dea agent hector 
berrellez and dea informant and former mexican police officer 
antonio garate said spokesman antonio ocaranza 
ocaranza said his government wants the two extradited to face 
charges that they kidnapped dr humberto alvarez machain who was 
taken from his guadalajara office and delivered to el paso texas 
where he was arrested by dea agents april 3 
the us government has denied that any laws were broken in the 
arrest of alvarez one of 19 mexicans indicted in los angeles on 
charges of kidnapping torturing and killing camarena in february 
1985 
there was no immediate response to the request ocaranza said 
dea spokesman bill ruzzamenti said this is somewhat of a 
unique situation so we dont have a lot of precedent to deal 
with 
the state department will study the request and determine what 
should be done ruzzamenti said 
the state and justice departments had no immediate comment on 
how the government plans to respond to the mexican request 
alvarez is accused of administering drugs to camarena after the 
dea was kidnapped in mexico in 1985 
the delivery of alvarez has caused tension between the us and 
mexican governments mexico has demanded his return claiming the 
incident violated mexican sovereignty 
however justice department officials said there are no plans to 
return alvarez to mexico 
alvarez a gynecologist testified in los angeles in may that he 
was brought to the united states against his will and that he was 
tortured with electronic equipment and hit in the stomach while 
being abducted 
garate testified in los angeles that he arranged for friends in 
mexico to spirit alvarez across the border and that the plan was 
approved by berrellez his dea supervisor 
he said he told his friends that he would pay all their 
expenses although no money would be provided up front and no 
assistance from the dea in addition garate testified that he 
specified that alvarez should not be harmed during the operation 
the us government initially denied that it had paid any money 
for the delivery of alvarez to us soil 
but in late may the government acknowledged that it paid at 
least 20000 to the people who brought alvarez to el paso 
berrellez testified that up to 50000 in reward money had been 
authorized by dea headquarters in washington 
attorney general dick thornburgh said in may he was not 
concerned about the circumstances of alvarezs delivery to us 
territory and he invited mexican authorities to turn over more 
people wanted in the camarena case in the same way

the future of a plutonium processing plant in 
washington state is in new doubt with a report that questions 
whether the government facility should ever be restarted in view of 
safety concerns and changing defense policy 
the general accounting office said in a report made public 
friday that the department of energy has failed to prove that the 
purex plant at the hanford nuclear reservation is needed to produce 
plutonium or assist in the management of radioactive wastes 
doe has not demonstrated that a need exists for the remaining 
weaponsgrade plutonium that could be extracted and it has not 
fully compared purex with other waste processing alternatives to 
determine whether purex is the best approach the congressional 
investigative agency said 
the plant was shut in december 1988 because of recurring safety 
problems 
does plans for restarting purex are inadequate said the 
report requested by rep mike synar dokla chairman of the house 
government operations subcommittee on environment energy and 
natural resources 
a more important question is whether purex should be restarted 
at all given the costs to operate purex in combination with the 
costs to prepare a supplemental environmental statement the time 
and costs associated with correcting identified safety and training 
deficiencies and the possibility that a better alternative 
exists to dispose the fuelgrade plutonium the study said 
doe spokesman tim tomastik said energy secretary james d 
watkins had not seen the gao report and would have no immediate 
comment however tomastik said there appeared to be some false 
assumptions in the recommendations 
it makes the assumption that doe has made a decision about 
restarting purex the doe has not made a decision at this time with 
respect to whether or not to restart purex tomastik said 
synar said friday his subcommittee estimates that putting the 
plant in mothballs would save the government more than 750 million 
over the next 15 years 
given the bush administrations decision to cancel the special 
isotope separation plant in idaho which was expected to use the 
plutonium produced by the purex plant the longterm plutonium 
production mission at purex has disappeared synar said 
the doeowned contractoroperated facility near richland 
wash formally known as the plutoniumuranium extraction plant 
began operation in 1956 
its main function has been to reprocess spent uranium fuel rods 
from hanfords nowclosed nuclear materials production reactor the 
nreactor the process involves dissolving the rods in acid and 
extracting plutonium that can be used in making nuclear weapons

one of the governments chief witnesses in 
mayor marion barrys drug and perjury trial has ties to the family 
of a convicted washington drug lord barrys chief lawyer says 
attorney r kenneth mundy contended friday that charles lewis 
was far from the smalltime drug peddler he claimed to be 
instead lewis a twiceconvicted drug dealer was trying to 
strike a bargain and connection for a much larger drug enterprise 
with rayful edmond 
the confusion began there did mundy mean rayful edmond jr or 
rayful edmond iii 
the distinction is important 
rayful edmond iii is serving two consecutive life terms in 
prison plus an additional sentence of 99 years for convictions on 
a host of drugrelated charges 
prosecutors said the younger edmond was responsible for 
distributing between 20 percent and 30 percent of the cocaine in 
the nations capital during the height of his operation 
witnesses testified in the younger edmonds trial that the elder 
edmond was also involved with drugs but he has never been charged 
with a crime 
the ties between lewis and edmonds family came out as mundy 
questioned an fbi agent about notes he had taken during 
interrogations of lewis last summer 
lewis a key government witness against barry has described 
himself as a drug user who was only marginally involved in drug 
dealing but mundy said the notes from the interview show that 
lewis had once brought his drug cohorts together with rayful edmond 
jr 
did his notes mention anything about he lewis and sonny 
whatley and james mcwilliams hooking up with a very notorious 
dc drug dealer mundy asked fbi agent michael mason 
before mason could answer us district judge thomas penfield 
jackson ordered the jury and the witness out of the courtroom 
after the courtroom was cleared mundy zeroed in on the notes 
without making clear which edmond he believed lewis had been 
referring to 
charles lewis said to the fbi agents that he hooked up with 
rayful edmond mundy said 
mundy also brought up notes from a party in which one rayful 
edmond had brought cocaine for lewis and his friends to sample 
but in a bench conference assistant us attorney judith 
retchin stressed that the man referred to in the notes was the 
father of the convicted drug dealer 
retchin also insisted that in another interview lewis had said 
he knew of the younger edmond only through the newspapers 
the confusion was exacerbated by barry who said outside court 
that his attorney had meant rayful edmond iii 
he was talking about the one who had a long trial barry 
said with a smile 
mundy said he brought up the subject to impeach the testimony of 
lewis but after a lengthy debate jackson ruled that mundy could 
only do so if he called lewis as a witness 
mundy then said he expected the government to make lewis 
available for questioning 
earlier one of barrys security guards testified that he never 
saw barry use drugs during a 1988 trip to the virgin islands lewis 
has testified that he barry and others smoked 300 worth of crack 
cocaine during the mayors fourday stay 
however the guard ulysses walltower acknowledged under 
crossexamination that he was not around barry during the times 
lewis has testified drugs were used 
barry 54 is being tried on 10 misdemeanor cocaine possession 
charges one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy charge and three felony 
counts of lying to a grand jury about his alleged drug use

the administration is moving to make sure an 
industrial furnace capable of casting metal parts for nuclear 
weapons is not delivered to the government of iraq officials say 
the commerce department has asked the new jersey furnace 
manufacturer to apply for a special export license for items that 
have some sort of nuclear application a state department 
official said friday 
this license would be very difficult to get said the 
official who is familiar with interagency discussions on the 
furnace export and spoke on condition of anonymity 
one of the furnaces has been detained by us customs officials 
at philadelphia since june 26 at the pentagons request 
the iraqi government said it was purchasing the furnace to cast 
lightweight titanium for artificial hip and knee joints for victims 
of the iraniraq war however us officials fear it could use the 
furnace for weapons production 
certain furnaces can be used for casting components for 
weapons and missiles state department spokeswoman margaret 
tutwiler said friday noting she was prohibited from discussing 
details of the case 
raymond j roberts president of consarc corp of rancocas 
nj said earlier this week that the commerce department advised 
the company more than a year ago that only a general license was 
necessary for the export of the furnaces he was reported out of 
the office and unavailable friday 
one white house official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said it appeared the socalled validated export license would not 
be granted 
he said he believed the license decision was made through an 
interagency review involving the commerce state and defense 
departments and the national security council staffs but not any 
senior white house officials 
british and american officials have seized other cargoes this 
year suspected of containing weapons components for iraq 
in march british customs officials stopped americanmade 
electronic devices they said would be used by the iraqis as nuclear 
weapons triggers the following month british officials stopped an 
iraqbound shipment of parts they suspected would be used for a

rep barney frank dmass is accepting an 
ethics committee recommendation that he be reprimanded for his 
relationship with a male prostitute as the house girds for a debate 
next week on franks fate 
the panel unanimously reported friday that aspects of franks 
relationship with stephen l gobie reflected discredit upon the 
house and recommended he be reprimanded before the full house 
next week 
a short time later frank told reporters in newton mass i 
accept the judgment of the committee report 
it will be up to the house to decide whether to accept the 
committee report or impose a more severe punishment such as 
censure or even expulsion 
house speaker thomas foley dwash promised a public debate by 
next week but predicted frank would survive the storm 
i think this matter will be soon put behind us foley said 
barney frank remains one of the most effective and i think 
throughout the house highly regarded members here 
rep william dannemeyer rcalif is expected to try to force 
expulsion of frank a daunting task because it would require a 
twothirds vote by the democraticcontrolled house but the 
conservative lawmaker would not concede that point 
who knows dannemeyer responded when asked about his 
chances every member is going to have to vote his or her 
conscience 
at least two republicans say frank should face a censure which 
is a more severe punishment than reprimand because it would require 
frank to stand before his colleagues while a resolution condemning 
his activities is read 
rep henry hyde rill said he expected that republicans would 
push for censure and rep tom petri rwis a member of the 
ethics panel said he would argue for a sterner punishment petri 
said he agreed to the committee recommendation for a reprimand to 
preserve the panels tradition of making its decisions unanimously 
rep julian dixon dcalif the ethics committee chairman 
defended the recommendation barney frank will certainly not 
consider it a slap on the wrist he said the committee 
certainly does not consider it a slap on the wrist 
frank one of two acknowledged homosexuals in the house 
rejected the notion that he had received lenient treatment from the 
committee i dont think theyd say theyre being soft on me 
frank said 
gobie meanwhile told boston radio station weei he was pleased 
the committee was not harder on frank 
frank paid gobie 80 for sex and then hired him in july 1985 as 
a housekeeper and driver paying him with personal funds frank 
says he ended the relationship in august 1987 after learning that 
gobie was operating a sexforhire ring out of the lawmakers 
capitol hill apartment 
the ethics committee which has been investigating the case 
since last sept 11 concluded that frank improperly fixed parking 
tickets some of them accumulated by gobie using franks car on 
personal business 
and the panel said frank set in motion a memo containing 
misleading information about gobie sent to a virginia prosecutor 
and which could have affected mr gobies probation after prior 
felony convictions

postcommunist czechoslovakias military 
chief concluding a us visit says withdrawal of soviet forces 
from his country will be completed by the end of march 1991 
withdrawal of red army units in czechoslovakia since the 1968 
warsaw pact invasion is a complex process but is on schedule and is 
being monitored by the democratically elected parliament lt gen 
anton slimak told a news conference friday 
he was summarizing information he said he provided defense 
secretary dick cheney gen colin powell chairman of the joint 
chiefs of staff and other officials at a series of pentagon 
meetings 
slimak became chief of the czechoslovak general staff after last 
decembers peaceful revolution ended four decades of communist rule 
in his homeland a graduate of the soviet unions voroshilov 
general staff academy he is also deputy defense minister in the 
postelection government 
during a weeklong tour of major bases on the atlantic seaboard 
slimak said he and his aides learned much about us military 
spirit from democratic principles to pride of command that we 
will be trying to apply in the reorganization of our armed forces 
us army units are based in neighboring west germany and now 
we think of them as our neighbors slimak said 
he described as an optimal solution the new agreement 
between west german chancellor helmut kohl and soviet president 
mikhail gorbachev for reunited germany to belong to the north 
atlantic treaty organization 
the warsaw pact still has a purpose for the near future and 
we believe that after its demise and with the new security 
arrangements in place czechoslovak membership in nato would make 
no sense slimak said 
he and his staff visited macdill air force base florida fort 
bragg and camp lejeune marine base in north carolina and langley 
air force base in virginia they plan to tour canadian military 
bases next week

oliver norths irancontra convictions calling it good news 
i just feel good about it bush said of the court victory 
for the former reagan administration national security council aide 
bush made his first comment on the appeals court ruling friday 
night as he flew back to washington from cheyenne wyo 
i think this is good news i have not wanted to see the north 
matter go any further the president said 
my view is ollie north ive said i dont want to comment 
while its in the court system so maybe i ought to get back to 
that but i felt a certain sense of pleasure that he has been in 
some sense relieved of one of these charges i just feel good about 
it he said 
the divided appeals court panel reversed one of norths 
convictions and ordered a lower court to determine whether norths 
trial was tainted by congressional testimony he gave under a grant 
of immunity 
north was convicted in may 1989 on three of 12 counts stemming 
from the reagan administrations clandestine effort to sell arms to 
iran and aid the nicaraguan contra rebels 
the divided threejudge panel reversed norths conviction on the 
charge of altering and destroying sensitive nsc documents finding 
that us district judge gerhard gesell gave erroneous instructions 
to the jury

up to 10 spacewalks a week will be needed to 
maintain outside components of the proposed space station freedom 
unless there are major design changes a study says 
the study by astronaut bill fisher and johnson space center 
engineer charles price and released friday showed that in peak 
maintenance years with the present space station design two 
astronauts working together would have to spend up to 6462 hours a 
year in space suits repairing and replacing parts 
other years the maintenance would require fewer space walks 
the study said but over the 35year lifetime of the station the 
time spent on repair space walks would average about 3276 
astronauthours a year this would amount to 273 twoperson space 
walks a year or 53 a week 
each space walk takes about six hours 
fisher and price said that the number space walks could be 
reduced by up to half if more work can be done by robots that could 
be controlled from inside the space station or from the ground 
simplifying repair tasks and making all parts replaceable by 
robots could drop the total annual space walk hours to 507 a 
number that fisher said would be manageable 
nasa has been criticized by congress for designing a space 
station that would require so much maintenance so much so that 
much of the time of at least two astronauts on board would be spent 
on repairs and parts replacement 
the current plan calls for eightmember crews 
richard kohrs director of the space station program said that 
design of the station is now undergoing a major review and that 
each of the recommendations in the fisherprice study will be 
evaluated 
he said changes are being made that will cut down on the weight 
power use and maintenance of the station 
reducing the number of space walks he said is a major goal 
were going to build the space station for science research 
kohrs said at a news conference friday if you are spending a 
major part of your time on eva extra vehicular activity or space 
walks then you are taking that away from science 
nasa executives had ordered the space walk study to coincide 
with the space station design review kohrs said the purpose of the 
study was to spot problems so that corrections can be made before 
construction of station parts begins 
assembly of the space station is expected to begin in about 
three years and it is expected to be permanently occupied by 1996 
the station is expected to cost about 30 billion and last about 
35 years nasa has said the station is critical to the agencys 
future plans to explore the moon and to voyage to mars 
the fisherprice report said that a major problem to overcome is 
the number of hours of space walking required to maintain the 
station while it is being assembled the station will be put 
together with a series of 18 flights by the space shuttle and 
parts of the station will spend months in orbit before it is 
permanently occupied by astronauts 
during that 30month assembly period the report said there 
will be a need for 6267 hours of maintenance by spacewalking 
astronauts this equals about four twoman spacewalks a week 
all of these would have to be done from the space shuttle 
said fisher 
another study started after the fisherprice team made a 
preliminary report in the spring concluded with estimates close to 
those of fisher and price the study led by william simon of the 
johnson space center said however that with changes in design 
the spacewalks required to maintain the station could be reduced to 
about 485 manhours a year

womens and homosexual rights organizations 
praised a liberal district of columbia law that provides employees 
with up to four months unpaid family and medical leave 
meanwhile the business community vowed to lobby against the 
bill in congress saying it would severely hurt the citys small 
business community 
this is a very compassionate piece of legislation designed to 
protect those who are often most vulnerable working women gays 
children the elderly said ivy young spokeswoman for the 
national gay and lesbian task force 
claudia withers spokeswoman for the womens legal defense fund 
a public policy advocacy group that monitors laws dealing with 
family and womens issues said although paid leave is best 
we think itll be the best in the nation 
the legislation would apply to fulltime and parttime workers 
who want leave to care for a family member including newborns 
ill relatives or partners in committed relationships it would 
also provide up to 16 weeks of unpaid leave if the employee is 
suffering from a serious health condition

an indianapolis radio station has been fined 
10000 for broadcasting sexually explicit material in violation of 
federal indecency rules the federal communications commission says 
the action announced friday against wfbqfm owned by great 
american television and radio co in cincinnati was the latest in 
a spate of moves in the past year by a newly constituted fcc bent 
on cracking down on disc jockeys often called shock jocks 
the fcc led by new chairman alfred sikes has issued a number 
of warnings and fines against stations most recently a 20000 
fine in june against a san jose calif radio station ksjofm 
in all cases the commission cited indecent material 
involving sexual innuendo or descriptions of sexual organs 
broadcast between 6 am and 8 pm 
the commission earlier this month repeated its intention to try 
to extend the ban on indecent broadcast material to 24 hours a day 
a court ruling on a 24hour ban is pending 
the fcc warned great american officials a year ago that material 
broadcast in 1987 on a show featuring disc jockeys bob kevoian and 
tom griswold on wfbqfm and its sister station wndeam may have 
violated the fccs indecency rules 
those rules prohibit the broadcast during daylight hours of 
language or material that depicts or describes in terms 
patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards 
for the broadcast medium sexual or excretory activities or 
organs 
the commission also reviewed material the station broadcast in 
1989 and considered the companys arguments 
in a letter to great american officials dated thursday the fcc 
agreed with the companys assertion that two skits in question were 
not indecent 
but the commission said that material in several other programs 
fit squarely within our definition of indecency 
station manager chris wheat said the company had not decided 
whether to appeal 
the fines stem from a complaint filed by john r price a 
carmel ind lawyer who founded decency in broadcasting

a teenage girl roughed up by a man 
who pulled her from her bicycle and dragged her into woods is 
fighting back with a selfdefense book for her peers 
at first amber erling couldnt bear to stay home alone after 
the 1989 attack when she was 14she enrolled in karate to help 
regain her confidence and before long was holding selfdefense 
workshops with her karate instructor and mother 
prevention is the main lesson of the book called safe amp 
sound a parents guide on selfprotection for kids 
i figure if i can save one person it will work said amber 
now 15 and a high school sophomore 
ambers mother susan erling said her 90pound 4foot11 
daughter was wearing ballet practice clothes when a man in a car 
pulled alongside her as she rode her bicycle on a brooklyn park 
street near her home 
the man grabbed ambers moving bike and dragged her into the car 
as she kicked screamed and bit him he drove to a nearby park and 
dragged her out of the car and into the woods where her screams 
attracted residents the attacker fled when a man came running to 
her aid 
since we cant always take the bad guys off the streets we 
need to make their disgusting job of attacking kids much tougher 
amber said in a statement promoting the book 
we need to teach kids how to be imperfect victims the kind of 
victims that child attackers hate 
in many cases efforts to ward off an attacker are just what 
experts advocate 
allen garber an fbi supervisory special agent in minneapolis 
advises parents to instruct their children to create attention by 
making noise if theyre attacked 
child abductors dont want attention garber said 
mrs erling and ambers karate teacher e gordon franks 
suggest in the book that children should jab or bite attackers if 
they cant flee immediately unless the attacker is armed 
as law enforcement officials recommend the book advocates 
submission in the face of weapons 
although martial arts schools may teach a kid how to directly 
defend against a particular weapon we feel that its wiser and 
safer for a child not to directly resist at all the book says 
instead a child should resist in an indirect way by looking 
for an opportunity to escape when the attacker is distracted or 
slightly offguard 
the book also warns against the danger of only a little 
knowledge of selfdefense for children 
unfortunately there are drawbacks to giving children just a 
brief education in selfdefense especially if the child somehow 
gets an overconfident or invincible attitude as a result the 
book says 
the mother daughter and karate teacher had the book published 
themselves the first printing of 5000 books has nearly sold out 
mrs erling said they are planning a second run 
mrs erling and franks spent about 7500 each on the endeavor 
mrs erling said the book sells for 595 a videotape book and 
curriculum guide cost 100 and have been ordered by about 10 
minnesota school districts

canadians landlocked by mohawk 
indians blockading a commuter bridge have staged an impromptu march 
that ended in a brief but tense confrontation with police in riot 
gear 
about 2000 people marched on foot for two miles friday night 
through town said chateauguay police constable raymond picard 
there were no injuries 
chateauguay is on the southwestern border of the kahnawake 
reserve where mohawks have blocked the mercier bridge over the st 
lawrence river to montreal for more than a week 
about 150 indian chiefs from across the nation friday called on 
prime minister brian mulroney to reconvene parliament to deal with 
the national crisis 
they also called on police to withdraw from barricades in oka a 
town 18 miles west of montreal where authorities are locked in an 
armed standoff with mohawks who claim land there as ancestral 
territory 
the indians are trying to block a plan by municipal officials to 
build a golf course addition on the disputed land a shootout 
between indians and canadian police at oka on july 11 left one 
police officer dead though it was not clear whether the officer 
died from police or mohawk gunfire 
mohawks in chateauguay blockaded the mercier bridge in support 
of the indians in oka 
the protest started at 930 pm with 300 marchers at the border 
of chateauguay and the mohawk reserve where police have manned 
barricades to keep people away from the indian blockade 100 yards 
down the road 
others joined the march as it wound through town and returned to 
the barricades protesters toppled a 100yard length of metal 
barricades set up by police 
about 150 officers from the royal canadian mounted police and 
the town and provincial police forces formed a line to keep 
marchers off the reservation the police wore riot helmets and 
carried billy clubs 
chateauguay residents are angry over the bridge blockade which 
forces a detour of up to two hours for workers who commute to 
montreal 
close the mercier open the 30 highway the marchers chanted 
in french 
they referred to plans for a new commuter highway route 30 
which would bypass the reservation 
marchers complained that provincial and local leaders have 
failed to act on the proposed highway if that road were built 
future clashes with mohawks would not disrupt traffic protesters 
said 
the marchers were escorted by half a dozen police cars and 
traffic was blocked as the marchers filled several main roads 
about 100 cars joined the procession 
one woman rushed from her house in bare feet and a white bath 
robe to join the march 
the protesters went to chateauguay mayor jeanbosco bourciers 
home to complain about local leaders inaction over the 
transportation problem bourcier was not home 
most of the protesters had dispersed by 1 am officials said 
earlier this week crowds tried to push their way through police 
barricades burned effigies of mohawks and taunted the indians with 
war whoops

a jury deliberating the fate of the only 
remaining defendant in the 7yearold mcmartin preschool 
molestation case has returned its first sealed verdict and resumed 
consideration of seven other charges 
its almost like waiting to wonder if youre going to get the 
electric chair or if theyre going to let you go raymond buckey 
told reporters friday after the first verdict was delivered 
jurors in buckeys second trial heard nearly three months of 
testimony and have been discussing the case for two weeks 
the jury appeared to be following the same procedure used by the 
jury in buckeys first trial which ended earlier this year that 
jury submitted separate verdicts in sealed envelopes but none was 
announced until all of the verdicts were reached 
a clerk in the court of superior court judge stanley weisberg 
said the first verdict was sealed and would remain that way for the 
time being jurors were told to continue their talks 
buckey 32 is charged with molesting three young girls at his 
familys nowdefunct manhattan beach nursery school in the early 
1980s he and his mother peggy mcmartin buckey 63 were acquitted 
of 52 molestation charges on jan 18 after a trial lasting nearly 
three years 
the jury in that trial deadlocked on 13 counts against buckey 
alone and district attorney ira reiner decided to retry him on 
eight of those charges 
in the second trial the prosecution relied heavily on the 
testimony of the three girls now in adolescence who had trouble 
remembering events alleged to have occurred when they were 
toddlers however they said buckey molested them 
buckey took the witness stand and swore he never molested any 
children 
the case is the nations longest criminal court proceeding

move over alfred mr french and lurch take a 
hike jeeves a new breed of butler is standing at the door ready 
to take the sting out of daily life 
but please sweep the word butler under the rug now its 
household manager thank you very much 
from a victorian mansion where theres nary a speck of dust the 
starkey institute for household management began cranking out the 
next generation of helpers in january theyre a far cry from the 
crusty pursedlipped englishman good at answering the front door 
and serving tea 
mary starkey the institutes president and founder says her 
graduates are trained to perform myriad tasks in todays 
complicated world from balancing the family checkbook to knowing 
when the water heater needs maintenance 
this business is not about cleaning someones home its about 
helping to run their daily lives she says 
the institute was conceived on the basis of studies that 
american households especially those with two incomes require 
specialized management starkey says 
her students about 50 so far agree and they dont have much 
in common with stereotypical butlers popularized by televisions 
mr french of family affair lurch of the addams family 
alfred of batman or jeeves from the bertie wooster books by 
pg wodehouse 
ginny spencer was a successful real estate agent who dabbled in 
catering she heard about the institute from sandy wischmeyer a 
caterer and the schools director of curriculum 
spencer liked the idea so much that at 53 she decided to change 
careers 
the program is just wonderful spencer says theres a 
definite need for this kind of industry i feel lucky to be in on 
the ground floor 
the institute is housed in a 10000squarefoot victorian 
mansion that is impeccably decorated with antiques the mansion 
gives the students handson experience starkey says 
starkey acknowledges the household manager idea is not widely 
popular in the united states but she says its catching on 
tuition for the eightweek program is 4000 which covers 300 
hours of education the price may seem a bit steep to some but 
starkey has a decisive defense 
where else would you train household managers but in their 
workplace and where else can you go to school for two months and 
come out qualified for a job that pays 18000 a year its a 
perfect setup starkey says 
students cover seven general areas during the eightweek program 
organization cleaning and maintenance of the household fine 
dining entertaining clothing and travel art security and 
finance and perhaps most important of all finding themselves 
jobs 
we want them to leave with a repertoire of management 
organization skills recipes overall knowledge of anything and 
everything that can happen in a household starkey says 
graduates with no prior experience in a serviceoriented 
profession can expect to earn between 18000 and 30000 a year 
plus living expenses starkey says if a student has experience 
say in a hotel or restaurant 24000 to 40000 is a reasonable 
salary 
starkey runs her own placement agency which she began nine 
years ago she started the agency mainly to place nannies and baby 
sitters 
starkey receives 30 to 40 telephone calls a week from people 
needing one of her students and 150 calls a week from prospective 
students 
shes currently trying to assemble a staff of 20 to help a 
wealthy entrepreneur run his island estate 
we may have to hurry this current class along a little

the former exxon valdez is afloat again after a 
30 million repair job to its hull which was mangled when the 
tanker struck a reef and caused the nations worst oil spill 
the vessel renamed the exxon mediterranean was maneuvered 
friday night from the dry dock where it spent 11 months being 
rebuilt to a shipyard pier a quartermile away in san diego bay 
its engines pumps and other machinery will be tested before two 
weeks of sea trials 
theyll make sure everything runs and theres no leaks in any 
of the systems its basic operating like idling a car 
shipyard spokesman fred hallett said 
at sea theyll go full speed putting her through her 
maximum paces and making sure not only that she works but that she 
works to the specifications shes supposed to 
repairs on the ship began last august after it was towed 2500 
miles from alaska to the dry dock where it was built and launched 
in 1986 workers replaced the singlehulled ships mangled steel 
with 3000 tons of new inchthick steel 
the 24hour process of flooding the dry dock and ballasting the 
ship began late thursday 
robert weatherford a business and planning manager for exxon 
shipping co said at a news conference aboard the tanker that 
the refloating is a big milestone in returning this vessel to 
service 
the 987footlong ship the largest tanker in exxons 13ship 
fleet will be thoroughly tested 100 to 150 miles offshore away 
from shipping traffic lanes that run up and down the california 
coast said its captain mike stalzer 
the testing also will determine whether the vessel obtains 
certification as a seaworthy vessel said coast guard inspector lt 
bill uberti who will be aboard the ship during the trial run 
exxon denies that the renaming of the ship and its relocation to 
middle east oil routes were related to last years spill fully 
loaded the vessel is too big for any us pacific ports and 
declining oil production in alaska has reduced the need for such 
large tankers on the west coast 
the ship spilled almost 11 million gallons of oil after it 
struck a reef in alaskas prince william sound on march 24 1989 
fouling hundreds of miles of coastline and killing untold numbers 
wildlife 
after the seaworthiness tests are finished next month the ship 
and its 20member crew are to return to san diego for supplies 
before heading for its new base of operations stalzer said 
the tanker which holds nearly 14 million barrels of crude 
will stop in singapore en route to ports in egypt and turkey where 
it will be loaded 
the tanker will continue to carry us registry and an american 
crew

giovanni torlonia the famed spanish steps as a runway and a gala 
hosted by princess marina doria of savoia combined to ennoble the 
sagging image of italian couture 
with all the partying and aristocratic elbowrubbing it was more 
of a high society than high fashion week with almost as many 
elegant clothes seen off the runway as on the weeklong showings 
for next fall and winter ended friday 
talk of the town was the descent on rome by marina doria wife 
of victor emmanuel iv son of the last king of italy the royal 
family was exiled from italy when the country became a republic in 
1946 and the male heirs banned from returning even for a visit 
however judging from the scramble for invitations to the 
blueblooded event in honor of italian designers monarchic 
nostalgia still lingers in the italian capital 
despite the show of strength on the spanish steps and the top 
drawer guest lists italian couture is having problems whereas 
milan home of italys readytowear has given paris a run for its 
money italian couture with headquarters in rome has maintained 
its clients at home but lost a good chunk of the international 
market to paris in the past several years 
the greatest blow to its image was the desertion at the 
beginning of the year by valentino who now shows both his 
readytowear and high fashion collections in paris several years 
ago milanese designer gianfranco ferre brought new blood to rome by 
showing his couture collection in the city but he too has 
abandoned rome for paris where he designs couture for dior 
another of this weeks most soughtafter events was the 
presentation of his evening wear collection by prince giovanni 
torlonia it was the first couture collection of the young 
designer sole heir to the vast torlonia fortune and also first 
member of the ageold dynasty to go to work 
to best set off his sumptuous gowns torlonia chose young ladies 
of roman aristocracy as models who looked like they stepped out of 
giltframed ancestral paintings as they walked through the halls of 
the familys renaissance palace in downtown rome 
a stones throw from the torlonia homestead are the spanish 
steps which for the past five years have served as backdrop for the 
grand finale of the rome fashion week with couture and 
readytowear designers alike parading their wares for next years 
winter fashion 
thursday night 18 of italys top designers including armani 
valentino versace fendi and ferre showed the best of their 
evening wear on the moonlit steps for the mega production which 
was televised around the world each designer chose a celebrity to 
accompany the collection 
thus actress johanna pakula made her way down the steps in a 
gray chiffon sequined gown for armani while anthony quinn lent a 
supporting arm to a red cashmere clad model for laura biagiotti 
anthony delon son of french actor alain delon was all too 
happy to escort his lady down the stairs as she flashed her legs 
in a supermini brown silk sequined dress by pino lancetti 
valentino preferred to let his lady stand alone sending a 
stunning ornella muti in a 1965 red chiffon valentino floorlength 
gown down the spectacular runway 
hollywood favorite gianni versace stole the show when he sent 
top model jennifer flavin in an ultratight sequined jump suit 
slowly down the steps and into the arms of current boyfriend 
sylvester stallone 
in general the high fashion look for next years chillier 
weather is either super short and sexy or long flouncy and elegant 
sequins and elaborate detailing abound heels are very high the 
models who tottered down the spanish steps could tell a tale and 
jewelry is discreet playing heavily on the earring 
makeup is demure boyish haircuts are out long loose and softly 
curled is in aside from the traditional black evening gown 
brightend by spangles the best were seen at mila schoen favorite 
colors are electric shades of red blue green and purple

imposing jail sentences on people 
convicted in major savings and loan fraud cases is often more 
important than the amount of time they eventually serve the 
nations top prosecutor says 
attorney general dick thornburgh said 78 percent of the people 
convicted of largescale fraud during the last two years landed in 
prison and they received prison terms ranging from 30 days to 30 
years 
in the whitecollar cases its the imposition of the jail 
time often more than the length of the jail time thats 
important thornburgh said friday 
whitecollar criminals are less accustomed to hearing a jail 
door slam behind them than drug traffickers or violent criminals 
thornburgh told a law enforcement group that coordinates financial 
institution fraud investigations in the area 
a study completed by thornburghs office this week found that 
329 people have been indicted and 213 convicted 
we are seeking jail time in every case a major fraud has 
occurred thornburgh said were going to be busy in this area 
for the foreseeable future 
the savings and loan crisis should remain a high priority for at 
least the next five years because 530 thrifts remain under 
investigation he said 
thornburgh reiterated that there is no need for a special 
prosecutor to investigate president bushs son neil a former 
director of the failed silverado savings amp loan in denver 
im not aware of evidence of any allegations from a credible 
source that mr bush has committed any criminal wrongdoing he 
said 
earlier friday thornburgh criticized a major civil rights bill 
passed this week by the us senate the measure which is intended 
to protect women and minorities from job discrimination is opposed 
by the president 
the bill cannot be one that promotes the notion of quotas 
thornburgh said at an 8th circuit judicial conference workers 
should not have to anticipate that employment decisions will be 
made by numbers

the united auto workers will not 
give chrysler corp a contract that varies from pacts reached with 
others in the big three the unions president says 
the unions president owen bieber made the promise friday 
shortly after talks opened with chrysler negotiations began 
wednesday with general motors corp and thursday with ford motor co 
the union will not divert from its past strategy of pattern 
bargaining with all three companies until sometime around labor 
day then selecting a strike target talks at the other two 
companies would be suspended 
a contract reached at the target then would be taken to the 
other two companies 
published reports have speculated that chrysler may break the 
pattern because of its financial problems 
abandoning the pattern concept will not solve problems 
bieber said it will create even more chrysler would gain 
nothing but lose a great deal of morale 
chrysler the nations no 3 automaker behind gm and ford faces 
the toughest financial tests at the start of talks contracts 
expire sept 14 
chrysler vice president anthony st john the companys lead 
negotiator was the only one among company and union officials to 
talk about proposals 
among three proposals st john mentioned friday was one that 
would establish a multiemployer healthcare trust 
such a proposal has drawn cool receptions at gm and ford the 
uaw had no reaction friday 
we are not constrained from establishing with union 
agreement a multiemployer trust with companies other than ford 
and gm although i would hope that they would have an interest 
as well st john said it could be a supplier or series of 
suppliers 
negotiators from each of the big three have said containing 
healthcare costs is a high priority in the talks in 1989 gm said 
it spent about 3 billion in healthcare costs ford spent about 
813 million and chrysler shelled out 684 million 
st john said under a multiemployer program the size of the 
group covered by the plan could be huge which would drive down 
costs also he said the companies could avoid increased costs 
anticipated in 1993 when new financial accounting standards board 
regulations could take effect 
chrysler says it currently funds healthcare and pension costs 
on a payasyougo basis the new regulations would require 
companies to set aside money for anticipated costs which chrysler 
figures to be about 7 per hour per employee that works out to 
just less than 200 million annually 
chrysler is expected to report by the end of the month that its 
secondquarter earnings were about half of the 341 million it made 
during the period last year

be charged police said 
the attack occurred in the mostly white workingclass 
neighborhood of highlandtown a southeast baltimore enclave ringed 
by predominantly black workingclass districts police spokesman 
dennis hill said 
the incident bore similarities to a 1986 attack by a group of 
whites on three black men in the howard beach section of queens in 
new york city one of the blacks was struck by a car and killed as 
he fled across a highway three of the whites were convicted of 
manslaughter assault and conspiracy

riots of the 1960s in baltimore whose population is roughly 60 
percent black 
i can point to more harmony among races in baltimore now than 
i could lets say 20 or 30 years ago said schmoke the citys 
first black mayor 
police said highlandtown has no history of racial confrontation 
in a separate incident several miles away early wednesday a 
black man was stabbed to death when he and a friend were attacked

the general director of the new york city opera 
says three naked virgins will remain in a fall production despite 
internal fears that a federal grant could be jeopardized a 
newspaper reported today 
the company will not change its plans for moses und aron 
the official christopher keene was quoted as saying in the new 
york times 
questions about the virgins surfaced in an internal memorandum 
from marc a dorfman who handles foundation and government gifts 
to the opera company 
he wondered in the memo whether the virgins presence could 
violate new obscenity guidelines issued last week by the national 
endowment for the arts which gave the opera company a special 
grant for the production 
nea spokesman virginia falck said it was unlikely the virgins 
will lead to problems 
the guidelines based on us supreme court precedent say an 
obscene work is one which the average person would find appeals 
to the prurient interests which depicts or describes sexual 
conduct in a patently offensive way and which lacks serious 
literary artistic political or scientific value 
keene said friday that moses und aron doesnt qualify 
we do not think that moses und aron or any other production 
we are doing is obscene in terms of the supreme courts 
definition 
moses und aron is set to debut sept 22 the unfinished 
opera by austrian composer arnold schoenberg is considered one of 
the 20th centurys masterpieces

a huge styrofoam wall at the site of the 
shattered berlin wall is the setting for a concert by expink floyd 
guitarist roger waters joni mitchell van morrison sinead 
oconnor and others 
about 180000 fans were expected at tonights outdoor spectacle 
that is raising money for victims of disasters and whose 
centerpiece is a performance of pink floyds 11yearold rock epic 
the wall 
waters who composed the wall but has since left the group 
for a solo career is headlining the extravaganza 
the celebrated record which was made into a movie in 1982 is 
about alienation and the manipulation of the minds of individuals 
by governments but not specifically about the berlin wall 
a giant 600footlong and 60foothigh structure made of 2500 
styrofoam bricks will come crashing down at the concerts climax 
the concert also will feature a sixstory inflatable pig and an 
equally large teacher two characters in pink floyds atmospheric 
otherworldly music 
workers for weeks have been building the gigantic stage on 35 
acres of potsdamer platz the historic square of old berlin that 
was converted into a desolate nomans land by the building of the 
berlin wall 
all of the berlin wall at potsdamer platz has been torn down in 
the last few months in anticipation of the unification of the 
german states in december 
the stretch of land between the two sections of wall where east 
germans were once shot and killed while fleeing to the west was 
expected to hold about 180000 concertgoers for tonights show 
more than 160000 tickets have been sold at 30 each and 20000 
additional tickets were to go on sale today said spokeswoman emma 
jenks 
the stage crew alone is literally hundreds and hundreds of 
people she said friday

galway thomas dolby albert finney model jerry hall the 
chieftains the scorpions the hooters and the east berlin rundfunk 
symphony orchestra and radio choir

as well as a planned album and video are to go to the memorial 
fund for disaster relief jenks said 
the londonbased fund was set up last year to create a permanent 
reservoir of cash for disaster relief 
the european community on friday said it would donate 378000 
to the concert 
jenks said organizers would not know until after the concert how 
much of the proceeds expected to approach 10 million would go to

two cosmonauts nearly ran out of oxygen when a 
sticky hatch prevented them from reentering their space station 
but they will take another space walk next week to repair the door 
according to a newspaper report 
the trouble occurred tuesday while the cosmonauts were outside 
their space station making repairs said the communist party 
newspaper pravda 
pravda in its friday editions quoted yuri isaulov a ground 
controller at the soviet mission control center in kaliningrad as 
saying cosmonauts anatoly solovyev and alexander balandin will make 
another space walk thursday to put things in order 
the sticky hatch was the latest in a series of problems the 
cosmonauts have faced during their sixmonth mission 
solovyev and balandin went outside the mir space station to fix 
thermal insulation that was damaged during the launch of the soyuz 
tm9 capsule they must use to return to earth 
the strenuous space walk took two hours longer than planned and 
the cosmonauts could not reenter the spacecraft because of the 
sticky hatch soviet media reported 
their oxygen was running dangerously low and they were forced to 
use an emergency porthole on another part of the space station 
complex to get back inside seven hours after their exit 
once inside the cosmonauts apparently closed an inner hatch to 
seal one end of the airlock compartment that leads to the 
troublesome outside hatch 
isaulov told pravda that the outside hatch is slightly ajar 
leaving the airlock compartment unsealed 
this is not a normal situation and we would not like it to 
continue he said so we have informed the crew that they 
would have to make another space walk on july 26 to put things in 
order 
in their rush to get back into the space station the cosmonauts 
also left behind some ladders on a work platform where they were 
fixing the insulation on the outside of the soyuz capsule ground 
controllers were studying videotapes of the exterior of the space 
complex to see if that would cause a problem pravda said 
the ladders and work platform attached to the soyuz might hinder 
the capsule when it separates from the mir complex said james 
oberg author of several books on the soviet space program in an 
interview from his texas home 
the thermal insulation protects the capsule while in space and 
is separate from the shield that deflects heat during reentry 
the cosmonauts have been in space since feb 11 the ground 
controllers plan to bring them home in the soyuz capsule on aug 9 
they originally were scheduled to return july 30 
a replacement crew is to be launched aug 1

a new round of salvadoran peace 
talks between the usbacked government and leftist rebels got off 
to a slow start and they were overshadowed by reports of heavy 
fighting in el salvador 
un mediator alvaro de soto said negotiators only scratched the 
surface of their agenda when the five days of talks opened friday 
they got into specific themes but without going very deep 
into the negotiations process he told a news conference 
the salvadoran army reported that six rebels were killed and 
seven wounded thursday in heavy fighting with soldiers near 
jucuapa 68 miles east of the capital san salvador it said another 
rebel was wounded in fighting near lolotique 75 miles east of the 
capital 
the talks are the third round of negotiations this year aimed at 
reaching a ceasefire in the 10yearold salvadoran civil war 
which has claimed and estimated 72000 lives 
the rebels have promised to stage an allout offensive if the 
negotiations fail to meet their expectations 
the armed forces said in a statement that military patrols 
seized about 20 rebel antipersonnel mines thursday in a raid at 
tecoluca 45 miles southeast of san salvador 
guerrillas dynamited five power line towers briefly blacking 
out eastern regions of the nation the statement said 
in washington state department deputy spokesman richard boucher 
deplored the threat of a renewed offensive 
he accused the rebel farabundo marti national liberation front 
of carrying out brutal assassinations directed at salvadoran 
military personnel and their families 
the purpose seems to be to polarize the situation further 
and to elicit a reaction from extremists on the right he said 
citing the recent killings of an offduty officer and of an army 
major on his way to law school 
the united states has been providing president alfredo 
cristianis rightist government with more than 1 million a day in 
military and economic aid to keep the government and country 
running many us lawmakers have accused the government of human 
rights violations and say the aid should be reduced or eliminated 
boucher said the left should put aside its tactics of 
assassination and violence and go to the table committed to a just 
peace 
the left is demanding reform of the military and elimination of 
rightist death squads connected to the army as a prerequisite to a 
negotiated ceasefire 
we demand that army members guilty of political crimes be 
purged rebel negotiator shafik handal said 
the army has maintained it will clean its house with no help 
from the rebels 
the last round of talks in mexico in june produced no accords 
after discussions got hung up on the subject 
but army col mauricio vargas head of the 3rd infantry brigade 
expressed hopes that this round of talks will produce results 
if there is the political will on both sides we expect to 
reach accords even if theyre not spectacular this will bring us 
closer to peace vargas said 
handal said the rebels plan to press for a reduction in el 
salvadors 54000man military force and demand that the military 
be purged of officers who have violated human rights 
the rebels also seek the dismantling of rightist death squads 
and elimination of compulsory military service handal said 
rights groups estimate more than 72000 people have been killed 
since the war began in october 1979 most of them civilians slain 
by death squads 
de soto a personal representative of un secretarygeneral 
javier perez de cuellar is mediating this round of talks

nine more cubans sought refuge in the spanish 
embassy in havana before dawn today bringing to 18 the number of 
asylumseekers in the mission the spanish news agency efe reported 
the development comes a day after five cubans entered the 
embassy four cubans have taken refuge at the residence of the 
italian ambassador and other similar cases this month have caused 
friction between diplomats and the communist government of fidel 
castro 
four cubans today entered the spanish embassy grounds at about 1 
am 2 am edt and five more gained access at about 3 am 
efe said in a dispatch from havana 
officials at the spanish foreign ministry in madrid could not 
confirm the efe report 
the first group today crossed a neighboring property and entered 
the embassy by way of a terrace while the second group scaled the 
embassy facade and broke a balcony while trying to enter the 
building efe said 
all nine asylumseekers were men who appeared to be between the 
ages of 25 and 40 efe said 
the new arrivals came two days after spain suspended its entire 
25 million 1990 aid package to cuba thursday to express its 
displeasure over cubas unusually harsh criticism of spanish 
foreign minister francisco fernandez ordonez 
on wednesday the cuban foreign ministry blasted ordonez in a 
threepage official statement calling him a frustrated colonial 
administrator and a victim of historical amnesia it 
threatened to send all the islands undesirable inhabitants to the 
12nation european economic community 
fernandez ordonez had previously suggested that castro would be 
cautious about allowing cubans to leave because he new their 
departure would cause his regime to crumble 
the first of the 18 refugees holed up in the spanish embassy 
arrived july 11 
spain has said it would not turn over the cubans in its embassy 
to cuban authorites and would try to negotiate their departure 
outside cuba 
five cubans who spent a week in a czechoslovak diplomats 
apartment gave up their bid for asylum thursday after receiving 
assurances they would not be prosecuted according to reports from 
havana 
diplomats accused cuban police of violating diplomatic territory 
to make arrests and a bitter dispute developed between spain and 
its former colony after cuban police seized one refugee on spanish 
embassy grounds 
in washington michael kozak a deputy assistant secretary of 
state called in a cuban diplomat on friday to protest the 
communist nations claims that the united states encouraged cubans 
to seek asylum in embassies the state department has called such 
allegations outrageous 
the official mexican news agency notimex said us and west 
german officials in havana have denied cuban allegations their 
countries were involved in a plot the us statement said cuban 
agents tried several times to compromise us officials in past 
months 
the cuban refugee problem has attracted widespread attention 
because it is reminiscent of the east german refugees who sought 
passage to the west at embassies in eastern europe last year their 
exodus helped precipitate the fall of east germanys rigid 
communist government 
albania which like cuba has refused to follow the soviet union 
and eastern europe in adopting democratic reforms last week 
allowed hundreds of people who had entered embassies in its capital 
to leave for new lives in the west 
in april 1980 thousands of disaffected cubans jammed the 
peruvian embassy in havana shortly thereafter many joined what 
became the mariel boat lift which eventually took 125000 cubans 
to florida

madrids suspension of aid to cuba 
underscores pressure for democratic change in the former spanish 
colony and further isolates fidel castro at a time when his main 
benefactor moscow is getting stingier 
its an abrupt and historic decision said political 
scientist manuel alcantara a professor of latin american affairs 
at madrids complutense university because of the events in 
eastern europe spain feels some kind of responsibility about cuba 
to work for change there 
as of today 18 cubans were in the spanish mission in havana 
the spanish news agency efe reported nine sought refuge today it 
said and on friday five entered the embassy the four others 
sought refuge last week 
spain says it will not expel the asylumseekers and will try to 
negotiate their departure from cuba 
cuba calls all those who have sought refuge in the spanish 
czech and italian missions scum and habitual vagrants 
spains secretary of state for international cooperation luis 
yanez told reporters in brussels on thursday that spain was 
suspending 25 million in direct grantsinaid to cuba the 
countrys total this year to the island that was a spanish colony 
for 406 years until 1898 
while the sum is not substantial another spanish foreign 
ministry official hinted friday that the move probably would not be 
the last to try to pressure the government of president fidel 
castro to grant more freedom to cubans 
more measures will be necessary said yago pico de coana 
director general for latin american affairs he said it would be 
imprudent to elaborate 
spain has also recalled its ambassador in havana for 
consultations 
cuba already has had to cope with a trade embargo by the united 
states and a loss of support from the soviet union and from east 
european countries that shed their communist governments since last 
year 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev whose reforms castro has 
criticized is not as forthcoming on aid as in the past castro 
repeatedly has rejected westernstyle balloting and said his 
country has no need for sovietstyle reform despite pressure from 
gorbachev 
as criticism of cuba has appeared in official soviet media 
castro has called on cubans to brace for possible cuts in the 
soviets 5 billion in yearly aid 
us sources last year said there had been substantial 
reductions already as evidenced in the marked decline in the 
purchase of sugar which the soviet union buys from cuba at prices 
substantially higher than world market levels as a form of subsidy 
castro also has lost his two closest caribbean allies panamas 
manuel antonio noriega who was toppled in a us invasion in 
december and nicaraguas leftist sandinistas who were defeated by 
a usbacked opposition coalition in elections feb 25 
yanez said the spanish aid cutoff effectively severed cubas 
umbilical cord with spain that afforded access to the european 
community he said resumption of the aid was contingent on the 
resolution of problems through political channels 
cuba has been attempting to reach some kind of aid agreement 
with the 12nation west european trading bloc but without success 
a spanish government spokesman who is customarily not 
identified denied that the decision to suspend aid represented a 
major shift in policy toward cuba he said the action was in 
keeping with remarks prime minister felipe gonzalez made to castro 
in march about the need for the marxist nation to move toward 
democracy 
spain has maintained cordial ties throughout its own 
authoritarian and democratic administrations with the former colony 
both gen francisco franco and the democratically elected 
administrations that have governed spain since his death in 1975 
have assured castro easy credit to purchase spanish goods and 
finance longterm projects 
cubas total commercial debt with madrid is estimated at about 
900 million making spain cubas secondmost important creditor 
after the soviet union to which cuba owes an estimated 3 billion 
the conservative madrid daily abc an outspoken opponent of both 
the castro and gonzalez governments pointed out that yanezs 
annoucement didnt affect spains softloan program to cuba for 
which 11 million are earmarked this year nor its commercial 
credit and guarantee program designed to back up spanish exports to 
cuba the spanish export credit insurance co held about 780 
million in debts on exports to cuba last year 
cuba consumes 15 percent of spains trade to latin america 
according to economy ministry figures

palestinian guerrillas and 
syriansupported shiite moslems today stormed southern positions of 
iranianbacked shiite fundamentalists behind a barrage of artillery 
and rocket fire 
police said at least 30 people most believed to be fighters 
were killed and 72 wounded in the battles 
one palestinian commander reported by radio from the embattled 
hilltop village of jarjou that fighting was handtohand and 
housetohouse 
jarjou was captured by the shiite moslem amal militias rival 
hezbollah or party of god in fierce fighting monday the 
village is five miles north of nabatiyeh the amal stronghold in 
southern lebanon 
the assault on jarjou came on the sixth day of a battle between 
the shiite factions in which more than 100 people have been killed 
and more than 300 wounded 
the first attack began at 3 am when about 300 amal fighters 
and 250 palestinian liberation organization guerrillas began 
fighting their way toward the hilltop village of jarjou 
it lies on the southwestern tip of an enclave controlled by the 
shiite fundamentalist hezbollah or party of god 
the enclave is bordered to the east by israels selfdesignated 
security zone an occupied strip of south lebanon from which 
the israelis frequently attack guerrilla groups 
the escalating clashes so close to israeliheld territory raised 
fears that it could provoke israeli military action 
fighters belonging to the palestine liberation organization had 
been trying to stop the fighting between the two shiite groups and 
apparently to halt the hezbollah advance toward sidon a southern 
port where plo guerrillas are based 
the syrianbacked militia and the palestinian guerrillas also 
have been enemies but they joined together to storm the hezbollah 
positions 
reporters close to the battle zone said 40 plo rocket launchers 
each with 40 barrels and dozens of amal mortar batteries blasted 
jarjou and five nearby hezbollahheld hamlets for two hours before 
the first assault was launched 
another ploamal force attacked hezbollah positions along the 
northwestern flank of the fundamentalists enclave police said the 
attackers were advancing into the village of kfar milki in savage 
fighting 
that village five miles northwest of jarjou was occupied by 
hezbollah last january 
at least 12 wounded amal men were evacuated from jarjou to 
hospitals in the market town of nabatiyeh 
one wounded militiamen told reporters as he was carried from an 
ambulance its hell in there there are dozens of bodies 
scattered in the alleyways 
in beirut an amal communique said the assault force had taken 
half of jarjou by midmorning 
but an hezbollah statement said the attackers were beaten back 
leaving scores of dead behind 
black clouds of smoke hung over jarjou as the palestinian and 
amal gunners pounded hezbollah positions to prevent its fighters 
from moving up reinforcements through jarjous northern edge 
plo commanders estimated hezbollah has about 300 fighters in 
jarjou 
a 600man plo force drawn mainly from plo chief yasser arafats 
fatah faction deployed around jarjou and other villages tuesday 
ostensibly to stop the fighting 
but their prime objective was to block hezbollahs advance after 
it seized jarjou the plos main bases are in sidon 10 miles 
northwest of jarjou and arafat does not want the iranianbacked 
guerrillas threatening them or linking up with antiarafat radicals 
in the region 
hezbollah and amal have been fighting off and on for three years 
for control of lebanons 12 million shiites the countrys largest 
sect 
more than 1100 people have been killed and some 3400 wounded 
in the inconclusive showdown between the shiite rivals

cambodias vietnameseinstalled 
government today urged the communist khmer rouge guerrilla group 
and its main supporter china to return to talks on arranging a 
ceasefire 
but khmer rouge radio said today the guerrillas were preparing 
for a renewed attack on kompong thom capital of the central 
province of the same name 75 miles north of the national capital 
phnom penh 
the radio said hundreds of civilian supporters including 
children were voluntarily carrying supplies weapons and 
ammunition to the guerrillas readying for the strike the khmer 
rouge has been known to press civilians into service as porters to 
carry their supplies through the jungle 
the official cambodian news agency made the appeal for a return 
to talks while hailing this weeks us policy shift away from the 
khmer rouge and their noncommunist allies 
the united states said wednesday it was withdrawing its 
recognition of a guerrilla coalitions seat at the united nations 
at the same time washington will open talks with vietnam on ending 
the cambodian war 
cambodias government in phnom penh has long rejected any 
settlement that would allow pol pots khmer rouge to return to 
power the khmer rouge killed hundreds of thousands of people in 
nearly four years of rule until vietnams 1978 invasion installed 
the current government 
we hope the khmer rouge and their patron in beijing will 
return to the negotiating table to resolve the cambodian problem by 
peaceful means the cambodian news agency spk said 
as immediate steps it said they should cooperate in last 
months agreement in tokyo to begin a truce stop receiving foreign 
military aid and participate in free elections under un 
supervision 
that agreement was signed by cambodias prime minister hun sen 
and prince norodom sihanouk whose noncommunist guerrilla group is 
allied in the coalition with the khmer rouge but the khmer rouge 
boycotted the tokyo talks because it said it was not being treated 
as an equal china later said it did not support the agreement 
either 
the agreement was to form a supreme national council to meet 
by july 31 to arrange a truce the government of hun sen sihanouk 
and son sann the leader of the third guerrilla party all have 
appointed representatives to the council the khmer rouge have not 
the problem with the tokyo agreement was that the khmer rouge 
was not involved if they are not involved there is no political 
solution a spokesman in sihanouks bangkok office roland eng 
said today 
the guerrillas have significantly escalated their attacks and 
some of their officials said a truce without an overall political 
settlement would only benefit the beleaguered cambodian government 
the government also has been weakened by internal dissent and a 
drastic loss of aid from the soviet union and eastern europe

around president samuel does mansion seizing much of the capital 
and its port washington turned down a desperate appeal by 
government officials for us troops to halt the fighting 
rebels in this west african country overran most of northern 
monrovia on friday capturing the citys 2squaremile port area in 
the northern suburb of bushrod island 
they advanced toward the two bridges linking the island to the 
center of the city witnesses reported heavy government casualties 
but no precise figures shipping sources said two liberian coast 
guard cutters were sunk in the port by gunfire 
the rebels led by exdoe aide charles taylor accuse does 
government of corruption and human rights abuses they have seized 
most of this ohiosized country of 24 million people since they 
began fighting in december 
in washington a state department official said today that us 
officials could not say whether doe has left liberia 
weve heard various rumors but im not in a position to tell 
you its true said the official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity there are a lot of rumors coming out of liberia 
a day earlier the state department said the united states had 
no plans to dispatch a us peacekeeping force as requested by some 
liberian officials 
spokeswoman margaret tutwiler confirmed president bush had 
received an appeal from foreign minister j rudolph johnson and 
eight other prominent liberians for a temporary us force 
most liberians would welcome us help in averting massive 
plunder and tribal revenge and in having doe evacuated from the 
country said one of the liberian signers former un ambassador 
winston tubman 
but nelson taylor the rebel leaders brother said the appeal 
for us help is just one of the scams that doe is using to 
involve the us in a battle with the citizens of liberia 
when asked if the rebels were prepared to fight us forces he 
said we will fight until the us can kill every one of us he 
spoke from his home in providence ri and said he represented 
the rebel forces 
in downtown monrovia every shop and office was closed friday 
nervous troops ordered civilians off the streets in an unofficial 
daytime curfew 
the curfew was in effect throughout the governmentcontrolled 
areas and has prevented refugees from reaching spriggs payne 
airport to catch the last few flights out of the country 
soldiers set up makeshift roadblocks at downtown intersections 
firing wildly into the air to clear terrified civilians off the 
streets 
hundreds of frightened monrovians gathered at the gates of the 
us embassy hoping to seek refuge while scores of others broke 
into a us marine compound demanding food and shelter 
representatives of the government and the rebels have met 
intermittently for peace talks in neighboring sierra leone but the 
negotiations have failed to make any progress 
the rebels have refused to compromise on their demand that doe 
resign before any ceasefire can be implemented 
the rebels have accused doe who took power in a 1980 coup of 
corruption mismanagement and widespread human rights abuses 
taylor has promised to maintain close us ties if he comes to 
power but he has ruled out immediate elections 
us ambassador peter de vos went in a wellguarded convoy to 
the presidents mansion friday morning an embassy spokesman said 
he was received by acting foreign minister george wallace but did 
not see doe the spokesman said he couldnt tell reporters what was 
said during the meeting 
diplomatic sources said doe was surrounded by bodyguards from 
his krahn tribe the guards were unwilling to let doe leave the 
capital without them 
there have been extensive discussions on the issue of giving the 
krahn who form the bulk of does remaining troops a safe 
passage through rebelheld areas to their stronghold in grand gedeh 
county 
taylor is reported to have rejected any such safe conduct which 
has contributed to the present stalemate 
random killings have been reported on both sides as the 
insurgency degenerated into tribal warfare most rebels come from 
the gio and mano tribes while government supporters are mostly 
krahns and mandingos 
the african nation founded by freed american slaves 150 years 
ago has traditionally had close ties with the united states

congress considers trade cutoff with iraq 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
usiraq relations could take another turn 
for the worse if members of congress are successful in their drive 
to cut off virtually all commerce between the two countries 
the senate banking committee last week unanimously approved 
legislation that would deny agricultural and exportimport bank 
credits to iraq as well as bar the sale of technological items that 
could be used by the military 
it sailed right through committee said sen nancy 
kassebaum rkan sponsor of the amendment i frankly was 
amazed 
kassebaum is concerned about iraqs human rights record 
particularly reports that children have been tortured and murdered 
as a way of punishing their parents 
there have been other reports that iraq has used chemical 
weapons against its own people and is developing nuclear weapons 
iraq a country with 17 million people and the secondlargest 
proven oil reserves in the world denies many of the charges 
including those that it used chemical weapons specifically against 
its kurdish minority 
mohammed almashat iraqs ambassador in washington claims 
accusations against iraq are simply planned organized propaganda 
by the israeli machinery in the united states 
kassebaums measure an amendment to the export administration 
act is likely to be brought to the senate floor before the august 
recess because lawmakers must meet a deadline to extend the export 
act 
rep howard berman dcalif a major player in trying to 
isolate iraq said sanctions are the only way the united states can 
force hussein to change his despotic tyrannical deplorable 
conduct 
iraq is a country where meaningful sanctions could deter its 
conduct he said 
in an interview almashat rejected that argument he said 
cutting off credits as well as ending trade would end up hurting 
the united states 
we think this is against the us national interest he 
said we can buy it goods from other countries and cheaper 
passage of the legislation in committee coincides with 
increasingly bellicose rhetoric from iraqi president saddam hussein 
and other developments that have soured ties between the united 
states and iraq 
john kelly assistant secretary of state for near eastern 
affairs said recently the bush administration is weighing whether 
to place iraq back on the list of countries that sponsor terrorism 
a designation that halts shipments of technology to baghdad iraq 
was taken off the list in 1985 
iraq has drawn the ire of us officials for harboring alleged 
terrorists including abu abbas a member of the palestine 
liberation organizations executive committee who claimed 
responsibility for an aborted shiplaunched attack on israel in 
may 
the iraqi ambassador said his government has no intention of 
acting against abu abbas we support the plo with all the means 
possible he said 
meantime husseins threats against neighboring kuwait prompted 
a response from defense secretary dick cheney that the united 
states was committed to come to kuwaits defense if the country 
were attacked by force 
and the white house moved to block the shipment of three 
advanced industrial furnaces because officials were worried they 
would be used for projects relating to nuclear weapons 
sen arlen specter rpa said he urged president bush to block 
the sale at a meeting at the white house on wednesday specter said 
he told bush we should not do anything to help iraq 
while the bush administration says relations with iraq are not 
particularly cordial it opposes congressional efforts to impose 
sanctions 
we want to do it our way said a state department official 
speaking on condition he not be named 
specter who has met with hussein this year agrees 
congressional action should only be taken as a last resort 
he advocates ending credits iraq receives about 20 million 
annually in credits from the exim bank and has about 500 million 
in credits from the agriculture department but wants the 
administration to take the action 
at the same time specter said iraq is too important a country 
to ignore 
they are an emerging major player and tensions are high 
particularly with israel he said we should establish a 
dialogue

the federal government is far more aggressive 
in prosecuting employers who violate environmental laws than those 
who jeopardize their workers safety a study released saturday 
says 
the federal establishment cares much more about water 
polluters than workplace killers said joseph kinney executive 
director of the national safe workplace institute which conducted 
the study 
he said the nations 20yearold occupational safety and health 
administration act is more dream than reality 
since 1970 the labor and justice departments have put only one 
employer behind bars for safety violations that caused the death of 
a worker the report said 
but during a fouryear period the federal government has won 
environmental jail terms totaling 271 years said the chicago 
group a private organization that calls itself a government 
accountability institute 
there has been an outrageous neglect of worker safety issues 
by the federal government said kinney who helped found the 
institute three years ago after his brother was killed in an 
onthejob accident 
spokesmen for both the labor and justice departments noted that 
courts not the federal government control what kind of sentences 
are given to defendants once they are convicted 
justice department spokesman doug tillett said that since the 
osha law was passed in 1970 his agency has received referrals of 
about 40 cases from the labor department for criminal prosecution 
the justice department has handled about onethird of those cases 
he said 
johanna schneider a spokeswoman for labor secretary elizabeth 
dole noted that mrs dole pushed for and obtained an additional 
177 inspectors for osha during her first year at the department 
she also has backed stiffer penalties for employers who violate 
osha laws ms schneider said 
it shows that we are committed to health and safety for 
american workers ms schneider said we feel weve made a 
great effort to enforce the law including criminal prosecution and 
increased criminal sanctions 
in the past osha has come under fire for issuing large fines 
against employers but then settling for small sums the agency has 
defended the process saying oshas purpose is to ensure that 
employers comply with laws rather than collect large amounts of 
money for the government 
kinney said that in oshas 20year history only one employer 
has been incarcerated and that was the owner of a south dakota 
plumbing company who received a 45day jail term for violations 
involving a 1988 trench cavein that killed two workers 
in contrast in 1989 alone there were 51 individuals convicted 
of environmental crimes and they were sentenced to an average of 
64 months in jail with an additional probation period of 205 
months the study said 
in 1986 the first person convicted and incarcerated for clean 
water act violations was the manager of a yeast plant in sumner 
wash who received a oneyear term for dumping yeast in a 
waterway the study said 
earlier this year a pennsylvania man was sentenced to three 
years for dumping sludge in a wetlands area kinney said 
its absolutely outrageous osha is the only agency where you 
have to have a dead body to prosecute kinney said 
the group called for the labor department to back a bill pending 
in congress to strengthen the jail terms for osha violators 
mrs dole has agreed to support stiffer fines but has given 
only limited support to the tougher jail terms the labor 
department has said in the past it believes courts should have 
discretion in sentencing violators 
the aflcio which represents about 142 million unionized 
workers estimates 10000 workers are killed on the job each year 
while another 70000 are permanently disabled

in here and expect to see old books and esoteric things and heres 
something everyone can identify with 
what they like about it most is they recognize the dog said 
nancy leroy the research assistant who prepared the exhibit

but schoolchildren were the novels greatest fans and hundreds 
wrote to him in appreciation in the yale exhibit a sampling of 
the fan mail is displayed on a lower shelf so children can see them 
i am not a crying type over books but in some parts of your 
book as i was reading along i found myself really tightening up and 
almost crying over some of lassies adventures a girl from 
kalamazoo mich wrote to knight in 1941

a day after a federal appeals court set 
aside one of his irancontra convictions oliver north stumped 
louisiana for a republican senate candidate and lambasted 
washington politics 
i am indeed grateful grateful to stand here as a man who can 
once again vote north said at a rally today for senate candidate 
ben bagert it was one of the few references he made to fridays 
legal victory 
north launched into his standard antiwashington rhetoric 
calling washington the swamp on the potomac while he praised 
bagert 
bagert is the state republican partys endorsed candidate 
running against 18year democratic incumbent j bennett johnston 
who has a strong lead in all recent polls running second is david 
duke under constant fire for his past as a former ku klux klan 
grand wizard with ties to neonazis the three face off in the 
states oct 6 open primary 
north never mentioned duke by name but in an apparent 
reference to duke north said there was no place in the country for 
the politics of hate 
after leaving this shreveport suburb north planned appearances 
in monroe alexandria and new orleans on bagerts behalf bagert 
said he is paying north for his appearances but wouldnt say how 
much except to say it was not very much 
the appeals court panel voted 21 friday to reverse one of 
norths convictions and ordered a judge to review the evidence to 
determine whether all three convictions were tainted by ties to 
testimony he gave congress under immunity 
it has been what we believe to be a major step in the right 
direction and what has been a long and difficult ordeal the 
former marine lieutenant colonel and white house aide said in a 
speech friday night in baton rouge 
in washington the us circuit court of appeals panel suggested 
that norths fifth amendment right against selfincrimination may 
have been violated 
the ruling also could spell trouble for the irancontra case 
against john poindexter who was convicted of five felonies in 
april like north the former national security adviser had given 
immunized public testimony to congress in 1987 
congress offered the grants of immunity as it tried to quickly 
determine what happened in the irancontra affair the reagan 
administrations sale of arms to iran and diversion of some of the 
proceeds to rebels fighting nicaraguas marxist government 
in six days of compelled nationally televised testimony in july 
1987 north admitted to many of the activities for which he was 
later charged with crimes 
a jury convicted north on may 4 1989 of three of the 12 
charges he faced 
aiding and abetting an obstruction of congress in connection 
with a november 1985 shipment of hawk missiles to iran 
altering and destroying national security council documents 
detailing his efforts to provide military assistance to the contras 
accepting an illegal gratuity a 13800 home security system 
from retired air force maj gen richard secord whom north had 
enlisted to get arms to the contras and assist the reagan 
administrations initiative toward iran 
i certainly hope the special prosecutor ends it now north 
said weve been under a virtual siege 
the special prosecutor lawrence walsh who is supervising the 
continuing irancontra investigation said only everyone 
familiar with these proceedings has recognized the difficulties 
presented by the grant of immunity by congress 
president bush told reporters i think this is good news i 
have not wanted to see the north matter go any further 
walsh could seek review of the ruling by all 12 members of the 
appeals court or he could go directly to the supreme court 
the appeals panel reversed one of norths convictions blaming 
faulty jury instructions from us district judge gerhard gesell 
the trial judge that conviction could be reinstated only through a 
new trial 
the panel reversed norths conviction for altering and 
destroying security council documents saying gesell had given an 
erroneous instruction to the jury on how to weigh evidence of what 
superiors might have told north to do 
gesell could reinstate the two remaining convictions if he found 
they had not been tainted by norths immunized testimony 
gesells inquiry must proceed witnessbywitness if 
necessary it will proceed linebyline and itembyitem the 
appeals court said in an opinion supported by judges laurence 
silberman and david sentelle both reagan appointees 
chief judge patricia wald a carter appointee dissented saying 
she was satisfied that north received a fair trial and received 
all of the constitutional protections to which he was entitled 
the majority held that the government must show by a 
preponderance of the evidence that no use was made of norths 
immunized testimony either by witnesses or by the irancontra 
prosecutors office 
norths conviction for destroying security council documents led 
to his 23100ayear marine pension being revoked 
in baton rouge north said at a reception for bagert i guess 
theyll give me my retirement benefits again 
a marine corps spokesman said that if norths attorney requests 
a review that would be something that the marine corps would 
have to look at

president bush today used the gleaming 
backdrop of a new us aircraft carrier to fortify his argument 
against weakening us defenses in the postcold war era 
we must maintain a policy of peacetime engagement and armed 
forces sufficient to sustain our vital national interests bush 
said at a christening ceremony for the nations newest nimitzclass 
carrier the george washington 
barbara bush with the president at her side smashed a bottle 
of champagne against the ships hull to formally dedicate the giant 
vessel in a shipyard where 240 other navy vessels have been 
constructed 
the 1040foot nuclearpowered vessel built at a cost of 31 
billion is to enter service in 1992 
standing directly under the carriers massive bow the president 
quoted the nations first president for whom the ship was named 
as saying to be prepared for war is one of the most effective 
means of preserving the peace 
bush a world war ii navy aviator who flew combat missions from 
a pacificbased carrier wore a navy blue tie adorned with gold 
navy aviator wings 
the trip to newport news coincided with congressional debate 
over whether to shrink the navys carrier battle group fleet the 
george washington is the sixth of the nimitzclass carriers to be 
built for the navy two more are under construction fifteen 
carriers now are in active service 
on friday during a tour of warren air force base near cheyenne 
wyo home of the nations arsenal of mx intercontinental missiles 
bush indicated he was willing to accept limited cuts in his 1991 
defense budget request 
last week the senate armed services committee firing an 
opening salvo in the battle over the first postcold war budget 
voted to cut 18 billion from bushs request for 307 billion in 
defense spending for the fiscal year starting oct 1 
the house armed services committee has yet to act on the budget 
but is expected to take an even bigger bite out of the 
administrations 6monthold proposal 
im asking congress to hold the line at the already painful 
reduction in the defense budget set down by the senate armed 
services committee the president said friday 
there were some positive things from the committee especially 
their support for strategic modernization as well as some other 
actions on the other hand that cause me problems 
he did not elaborate on the problems except to say he would 
like more latitude in making personnel cuts than the committee 
proposed 
speaking to several hundred workers at warren air force base 
the president said 
i especially need flexibility so that the bedrock of the 
military its highly trained highly motivated and exceptionally 
dedicated men and women people such as you will be protected i 
cannot support reductions in the defense budget that would unfairly 
penalize those of you who have given so much to our country 
bush stressed that while he could accept a lower 1991 spending 
total he was not going to let congress hold some kind of fire 
sale of us military assets 
as we strive for strength and stability we must maintain an 
effective deterrent especially in the face of continuing 
acrosstheboard modernization of the soviet strategic forces 
bush said 
this wont be easy in the fiscal environment we face now we 
all recognize that we must get the deficit under control and that 
defense will contribute its share but i dont want defense to 
contribute more than its share 
bush toured the silos at warren that hold all 50 mxs the 
nations most modern longrange nuclear missiles 
the president is pushing for 22 billion in 1991 to take the 
launchers for the 10warhead missiles out of their silos and place 
them on rail cars to make them less vulnerable to attack critics 
argue that current ussoviet arms control negotiations are likely 
to lead to a ban on mobile missiles 
reflecting a growing conviction in congress that the demise of 
the soviet military threat should mean big cuts in us defenses 
the senate armed services committee cut 16 billion from bushs mx 
plan it left in 548 million for research but prohibited any 
spending on procurement or construction

president bush moving quickly in the wake of 
supreme court justice william j brennans surprise retirement met 
today with top aides to discuss possible successors to the high 
courts leading liberal jurist 
i am going to try to make this determination as soon as 
possible bush told reporters aboard air force one the process 
is moving 
participating in the 75minute white house meeting were bush 
attorney general richard thornburgh white house chief of staff 
john sununu and presidential counsel c boyden gray bush declined 
to reveal the names of those discussed as possible supreme court 
nominees 
as bush flew to newport news va for a ship christening 
thornburgh and gray continued their discussions at the justice 
department 
the administration is reviewing about 15 candidates officials 
said 
solicitor general kenneth w starr the governments top 
courtroom lawyer has been mentioned as a leading possibility for a 
high court vacancy starr gave up a federal judgeship to take the 
justice department job 
other possible candidates include a number of federal appeals 
judges including ralph k winter of the 2nd circuit j harvie 
wilkinson iii of the 4th circuit patrick e higginbotham of the 
5th circuit and clarence thomas of the district of columbia circuit 
in washington others who have been mentioned have been us trade 
representative carla hills and sen orrin hatch rutah 
the list also includes appellate judges edith h jones of the 
5th circuit william w wilkens jr of the 4th circuit and chairman 
of the us sentencing commission and david souter a former new 
hampshire supreme court judge who now sits on the 1st circuit court 
of appeals in boston 
bushs choice will help determine the courts approach 
possibly well into the next century to abortion rights 
affirmative action freedom of expression and other contentious 
issues 
the republican president said he intends to choose the best 
qualified person even if it means triggering a confirmation battle 
in the democraticcontrolled senate 
the matter is now official and we will now start the process 
of finding a successor bush said he received a facsimile of 
brennans resignation letter as he boarded air force one in wyoming 
on friday the supreme court had handdelivered a copy of the 
letter to the white house at 740 pm edt 
ive always said i want somebody who will be on there not to 
legislate from the bench but to faithfully interpret the 
constitution bush said so that gives me a wide latitude but 
i do not plan at this point to talk about any issues or any 
judicial philosophy 
the stakes are unusually high in picking a successor to brennan 
84 he has been the liberals leading voice on an increasingly 
conservative court and by most accounts has been their most 
skillful negotiator in helping preserve past liberal victories 
brennans departure is an incalculable loss to the law and 
civil liberties and to every person whose rights are threatened in 
the united states norman dorsen president of the american civil 
liberties union said 
the battle lines over abortion already are forming 
ive been saying for months that the threat to our right to 
choose is as close as the next supreme court appointment kate 
michelman president of the national abortion rights action league 
said adding its a very very dark day 
the iowa right to life committee said the appointment of one 
more justice who believes that all human life both born and 
unborn deserves protection will be the beginning toward our 
country once again protecting preborn life 
the high court split 54 last year in giving states broad new 
power to limit abortions last month by the same vote the justices 
said states generally may require that unmarried teenage girls 
notify parents before getting an abortion 
on both occasions the court stopped short of overturning its 
1973 ruling in roe vs wade that said women have a constitutional 
right to abortion 
bush said its not like were starting from ground zero in 
picking brennans replacement but he refused to drop any hints on 
leading candidates 
the conservative court is led by chief justice william h 
rehnquist and includes three appointees of former president reagan 
justices sandra day oconnor antonin scalia and anthony m 
kennedy a fifth conservative vote often is provided by justice 
byron r white 
the liberal wing that brennan often led now is reduced to 
justices thurgood marshall harry a blackmun and john paul stevens 
brennan said he decided to end his 34year career on the court 
one that spanned the administrations of eight presidents because 
of his advancing age and medical condition 
he suffered a small stroke after the term ended falling down in 
newark airport en route to a scandinavian vacation court 
spokeswoman toni house said brennans doctor advised him to 
avoid stress and strain and consider retiring ms house said 
in a letter of resignation to bush brennan said strenuous 
demands of court work and its related duties required or expected 
of a justice appear at this time to be incompatible with my 
advancing age and medical condition 
appointed to the court by president eisenhower in 1956 brennan 
quickly found a home among the liberal majority led by chief 
justice earl warren 
as the court changed over the next three decades and the balance 
of power moved to the right brennan played a key role in 
preserving liberal victories while also speaking out numerous times 
as a dissenter defending individual rights 
among the more than 1200 opinions he wrote are landmarks that 
imposed a oneperson onevote standard for electing state 
legislatures created constitutional protections for libel lawsuit 
defendants and helped invent a legal definition of obscenity

in one of the most extraordinary 
political journeys of modern times helmut kohl has shaken off his 
image as a plodding unimaginative politician and positioned 
himself to become the first chancellor of a united germany 
the road has not been smooth as his ratings have risen and 
fallen over the years kohl has been written off by critics so many 
times that his survival as chancellor seems almost miraculous 
but early last week the portly conservative proved what his 
supporters long maintained he is a patient and skillful bargainer 
an ambitious man with an even more ambitious vision for germany 
at a meeting in the soviet union kohl won president mikhail 
gorbachevs approval of nato membership for a united germany and 
the promise to withdraw all soviet troops from east germany by 1994 
the agreements cleared the biggest obstacles to german 
unification which can now be sealed in allgerman elections in 
december 
germany divided for 45 years of cold war animosity will have 
nearly 80 million citizens after unification it will be the most 
powerful prosperous nation in western europe and a highstakes 
player in global politics 
the diplomatic coup in moscow kohl acknowledged was a high 
point of his career 
this day these 24 hours belong to the most important 
experiences of my life the jubilant chancellor told reporters 
after returning to bonn 
newspapers across the countrys political spectrum hailed the 
deal 
the masscirculation bild usually a government supporter 
nonetheless proclaimed wednesday the world is astonished at kohl 
adenauer and brandt outdone 
konrad adenauer was west germanys first chancellor who led the 
country from world war iis ruins to democracy and membership in 
the western alliance willy brandt chancellor from 196974 won a 
nobel peace prize for formulating ostpolitik west germanys 
rapproachement to the east 
even kohls political opponents congratulated the christian 
democratic union leader including oskar lafontaine the opposition 
social democrats candidate for chancellor in the next elections 
kohls public opinion rating has surged the latest poll by the 
research institute infas said an unprecedented 61 percent of 800 
west germans polled supported kohl as chancellor 
i think it was statesmanship at its best said klaus becher 
a foreign policy analyst for the private nonpartisan german 
society for foreign affairs in bonn 
the magnitude of what he has done is miraculous echoed hans 
binnendijk at the londonbased international institute for 
strategic studies part of it was i suppose being at the right 
place at the right time but being there at the right time he 
made the most of it 
kohl 60 has seldom had such moments of political eloquence 
since taking office in october 1982 
he frightened poles and worried allies earlier this year by 
playing to conservatives at home and not immediately assuring the 
inviolability of polands western border onethird of poland is 
former german territory and poles feared possible german 
revanchism 
both german states have since vowed to respect the border and to 
sign a treaty guaranteeing the frontier after unification 
in a 1986 interview with newsweek kohl caused an uproar when he 
likened gorbachevs public relations skills to those of the 
infamous nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels 
and he stirred international controversy in 1985 when he invited 
former president reagan to bitburg to visit a war cemetery that 
included the graves of 49 nazi ss soldiers 
i would say that a man grows with his tasks gerhard wettig 
a leading analyst at the federal institute for soviet and 
international studies in cologne said in explaining kohls earlier 
blunders 
but he said kohl had also been underrated 
as a rule is he not intellectually brilliant as was helmut 
schmidt wettig said referring to another former chancellor 
but he is a very clever and to some degree wise politician 
who is able to accomplish a lot of things which you would not guess 
when just having talked with him a few times 
said binnendijk obviously he is a politician who works from 
the gut and his instincts are very good hes not a smooth or 
urbane politician in american terms youd say hes a very clever 
chicago politician 
kohl has an ability to appeal to ordinary germans analysts said 
when hes talking its not too different from a man in the 
street his sentences are simple his thoughts are not 
complicated wettig said

the 357 billion aircraft carrier 
george washington was christened today as a crowd of more than 
15000 stood waving flags and cheering 
the nuclearpowered carrier was built in more than 150 huge 
modular sections at newport news shipbuilding and dry dock co the 
only shipyard in the nation capable of building the 
1092footlong 91487ton vessels 
president bush today praised the thousands of workers who helped 
build the carrier and said it represents americas commitment to 
liberty 
bush called aircraft carriers an indispensable element of our 
nations defense projecting power and preserving peace so 
today we must maintain a policy of peacetime engagement and armed 
forces sufficient to sustain our national interest first lady 
barbara bush officially christened the ship 
the ship is to be commissioned next year the navy commissioned 
the carrier uss abraham lincoln this year and has two other 
nimitzclass carriers under construction at newport news 
the washington built under the supervision of wb miff 
miffleton and james s morris is the third nimitzclass carrier to 
be assembled according to a modular plan involving 100tonormore 
sections called super lifts 
in the modular process super lifts are built in workshops 
and later lifted into place by crane to be welded together the 
process saved about 80 million and some 17 months in construction 
time 
the biggest piece is the 700ton bow section the deck house is 
seven decks high weighs 454 tons and lays atop the 4acre flight 
deck they were lowered into place by a 900ton crane that was 
built especially for carrier construction 
each of the nimitzclass carriers takes six years and 10000 
workers to complete before modular construction the ships were 
built one 40footby30foot panel at a time 
it was sort of like building a large house of cards 
miffleton said christening of the ship is the high point for the 
workers 
its like a fever that runs through the gang there may be as 
many as 2000 to 3000 workers on the ship at any one time they 
all feel they have a stake in her said morris veteran of 38 
years in the yard 
when the george washington is commissioned it will be home to 
2800 officers and men another 2700 will be aboard when the ship 
adds its air wing of 85 aircraft 
the carrier measures 1040 feet from bow to stern and 1092 feet 
on its flight deck from its keel to the top of its mast it is 244 
feet high the equivalent of a 24story building 
its top speed is about 45 mph

the new president of carnegie mellon 
university has decided to rent a house at his own expense rather 
than depend on the school to buy a residence for him as it did for 
his predecessors 
robert mehrabian who took office july 1 made his intentions 
known friday in an open letter to cmu 
two weeks ago cmu trustees disclosed plans to buy a 16acre 
estate for mehrabian and his wife at a reported price of 19 
million school officials said they wanted a house with substantial 
grounds because the mehrabians own six horses 
but after the purchase price was publicized the deal was called 
off 
mehrabian said in his letter i have relieved the board of 
trustees of all responsibility for providing a house for my wife 
and me 
mehrabian has been dean of the college of engineering at the 
university of california at santa barbara

president bushs abandoning his nonewtaxes 
pledges may have triggered a firestorm in the capital but it has 
not set off alarms elsewhere judging from the reception bush got 
on a fourstate western swing 
as bush headed off to california on wednesday house republicans 
were voting en masse to declare their opposition to tax increases 
in any form including tinkering with the maximum tax rates on 
upperincome earners 
that was just the latest display of unhappiness in the ranks of 
gop lawmakers about bushs confession last month that solving the 
deficit problem would require tax revenue increases 
coming from the man who made read my lips no new tax the 
mantra of his landslide 1988 campaign the reversal may have caused 
some erosion in bushs popularity his skyhigh approval ratings 
have dipped from a lofty 80 percent to 63 percent in a recent 
gallup poll 
but the crowds that lined the streets outside the nixon library 
in yorba linda calif on thursday morning and later in boise 
idaho and billings mont were waving flags and welcome mr 
president signs not tax rebellion banners 
he also got a rousing western welcome in the rain in cheyenne 
wyo where cheering crowds turned out for a white house parade 
grafted onto the citys frontier days celebration 
bush himself broached the tax issue if gingerly at a 
fundraising dinner for republican senate candidate larry craig in 
boise on thursday evening 
youve seen the firestorm about revenues being on the table 
he told the party faithful 
well ive done my part and now its their turn he said 
prodding congress to show its hands on spending cuts 
the next morning in billings he told another gop fundraiser 
ive taken a few shots youve heard it rebounding around out 
here ive said before that ill negotiate without preconditions 
and i will in spite of the outcry about revenues 
bush on the flight home friday night told reporters i 
didnt hear too much talk about tax increases but i sure got a lot 
of people mentioning to me in these side meetings about doing 
something about getting the federal deficit down 
maybe people understand my view on that i was very pleased 
with what i felt was support from the people to whom i was 
speaking which in these instances were largely republican 
audiences they seemed to be supportive of what i was saying the 
president said 
bush is building up to what aides say will be almost nonstop 
campaigning this fall for republican candidates especially senate 
races bushs fondest dream is that the voters will give him what 
ronald reagan enjoyed for six years of his presidency control of 
the senate where democrats now hold a 5545 edge 
but bushs retreat on tax increases has taken a powerful 
campaign weapon out of the hands of republican hopefuls who were 
only too happy to join the old bush in taking the nonewtaxes 
pledge 
there was a schizophrenic quality to much of bushs campaign 
trip on this political foray in one breath he lambasted the 
democrats as the party on the far side and blamed them for 
government by gridlock the skyrocketing deficit and pork 
barrel spending 
in the next he told gop loyalists in billings frankly i 
think in fairness to say we are getting some good cooperation with 
the leadership on the democratic side of the aisle in the budget 
negotiations 
it may be that the public took bushs nonewtaxes pledge with a 
grain of salt in the first place or perhaps they have learned not 
to get too excited about the talk of higher taxes until they see 
what bush and the leaders of congress actually come up with 
but white house officials say it came as no surprise to them 
that taxes did not generate much excitement or resentment on 
this trip 
it hasnt been a factor at all white house deputy chief of 
staff andrew card said as he stood by the presidents rainswept 
stage outside the golddomed wyoming state capitol on friday 
i think people respect his leadership and recognize that he is 
meeting with very difficult responsibilities in trying to 
generate some governing in washington card said 
and what kind of reception will bush get if the budget 
summitteers actually hit people in the pocketbook 
im sure there will be some reaction card said but he 
added as long as the people are not abused in the process i 
think theyll accept the results

the united states has opened the way 
for new approaches to peace in cambodia but khmer rouge guerrillas 
may escalate the fighting unless china goes along 
on wednesday the united states announced it was withdrawing 
recognition of the guerrilla coalitions seat at the united nations 
in order to open talks with vietnam on ending the war although the 
coalition has three factions two of them noncommunist the 
beijingsupported khmer rouge is by far the strongest 
because of the us action all of us can look forward with 
confidence to the whole peace process having new momentum said 
foreign minister gareth evans of australia a key mediator on 
cambodia 
washingtons decision widened the gulf between it and china but 
brought the united states closer to the soviet union the main ally 
of hanoi and the vietnamesesponsored government of cambodia 
evans noted the talks on cambodia to be held this week in 
indonesia by the association of southeast asian nations united 
states japan australia canada new zealand and the european 
community 
the bush administration changed the us position after american 
intelligence reported increased khmer rouge assaults reminiscent of 
those that brought it to power in april 1975 
by the time vietnamese forces invaded in december 1978 the 
khmer rouge had slaughtered hundreds of thousands of people in 
labor camps and execution chambers and hundreds of thousands more 
had died of starvation 
its 30000 fighters are the dominant force in the guerrilla 
coalition the other factions are led by prince norodom sihanouk 
the former ruler of cambodia and son sann 
many noncommunist resistance leaders say the us shift will 
drive the khmer rouge closer to china and convince its leaders they 
must win militarily because they have been shut out of a political 
settlement 
sihanouk overall leader of the coalition expressed anger at 
the us action and said the insurgents would be more firm and 
fierce in their determination to continue to resist 
china has said it will halt aid only when other countries do and 
only when a comprehensive political settlement is reached and 
demands the khmer rouge be included in a settlement us 
intelligence agencies estimate it gives the khmer rouge 100 
million worth of aid annually 
i havent seen any sign that theyre softening on either of 
these positions a western diplomat in beijing said of the 
chinese 
he said china wanted to remain the regions dominant power and 
was trying to head off vietnamese attempts to forge an indochinese 
bloc by controlling cambodia and laos china does not seek direct 
influence in cambodia but wants to ensure its neutrality he said 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
diplomats also said china has been serious in talks on cambodia 
with the united states soviet union britain and france the other 
permanent members of the un security council 
the chinese appear to us to have all sorts of options in their 
bag de montigny marchand canadian undersecretary of state for 
foreign affairs said thursday after talks in beijing they 
struck me as not being as doctrinaire as i expected them to be 
moscow has sharply reduced its economic aid and political 
support so vietnam and its client government in phnom penh may be 
more amenable to concessions 
the us dialogue with vietnam their first political talks 
since the vietnam war ended 15 years ago has inspired hope that 
hanoi will put pressure on phnom penh to make peace 
vietnam knows settling the war is essential to achieving normal 
relations with the united states which are critical to ending its 
isolation and solving its economic problems 
hope also flowered however when vietnam and china began talks 
on cambodia in january 1989 in june the fourth round collapsed in 
mutual recrimination 
despite many negotiations over 2 years the factions still 
disagree on who would govern until general elections the 
government wants to retain interim power and rejects any 
significant khmer rouge role the guerrillas demand a fourparty 
coalition government or a un authority 
diplomats said the us change could help induce vietnam and the 
cambodian government to accept a un authority which they have 
rejected because the guerrilla coaltion occupies the cambodian seat 
cambodias state news agency said the american decision would 
enable the united nations to play its honorable and appropriate 
role in a settlement vietnam expressed willingness to negotiate 
an early solution

a soviet sailor who says he overstayed his us 
welcome to satisfy his curiosity about america has been freed after 
25 days in immigration detention 
i am very glad nikolaj vetkovskij shouted friday as he ran 
from the detention center at the us immigration and 
naturalization service office asked why his release took an hour 
after bail was posted he added burocratya burocratya 
but bureaucracy in the form of hearings on his status also 
may keep nick as his adoptive american family calls him in the 
united states long enough for him to satisfy more of his curiosity 
coincidentally his freedom came on the opening day of the 
goodwill games which have drawn hundreds of soviet athletes to 
seattle and brought more than 1000 soviet citizens for home 
stay visits with americans in all the goodwill games have drawn 
some 2500 athletes from 50 countries 
vetkovskij was aboard the czechoslovakian merchant ship ms 
tatry when it docked june 14 in new orleans and he went ashore 
with a landing pass good for 29 days 
he had been to the united states before for threeday stints but 
wanted more in his broken english he explained many times 
visit america but its very little time its very good when every 
people can be every one two three months here 
the ship set sail the next day but the 29yearold native of 
peno near leningrad set off across the united states he 
hitchhiked to san diego and ended up in seattle on june 24 
he decided to look for a job in the citys port and found one on 
a ship the skipper told him he needed to go to the ins to get the 
proper papers 
but the captain of the czech ship had reported vetkovskij 
missing which invalidated his papers and when he walked into the 
ins building he was arrested as an illegal alien 
later nick was to describe the ins detention center as a 
retirement home compared with the soviet jail in which he said 
he spent 10 days for his refusal to take part in the soviet 
occupation of afghanistan 
nick was in the center for three weeks before marine engineer 
eric bergh whom nick had met while jobhunting decided to see 
what had happened to his acquaintance 
when he found out bergh contacted his sister kathryn sterbick 
on wednesday she got immigration lawyer dan danilov to take the 
case sterbick whose norwegianimmigrant family is full of 
sailors met nick and agreed to put him up in her tacoma home until 
his immigration status is resolved 
seamen are brothers its a law of the open sea sterbick 
explained hes a warm and friendly young man and he reminds me a 
lot of my brothers 
at a hearing thursday danilov got bail lowered from 5000 to 
4000 and by friday afternoon had raised enough in contributions 
to post bail 
vetkovskij waved his arms and clenched his fists in victory 
outside the ins detention center while remaining detainees cheered 
from the second floor windows 
hey tomorrow we meet again he shouted 
danilov said vetkovskij will decide over the next few days 
whether to seek political asylum a deportation hearing is set for 
july 27 but danilov said he will ask for a three or fourweek 
delay to give him time to prepare 
with the hearings and delays nick might be able to stay long 
enough to satisfy his curiosity

justice william j brennan is leaving behind a 
supreme court legacy of commitment to individual rights and 
fairness and his departure is likely to lead to a more 
conservative court legal scholars said saturday 
brennan 84 announced friday that he is leaving the court after 
nearly 34 years because of failing health and advancing age his 
tenure spanned the administrations of eight presidents and in 
recent years he has been a roadblock in a conservative march by the 
deeply divided justices 
scholars agreed president bushs choice to succeed him 
inevitably will help take the court further to the right on the 
most divisive social issues of the day abortion rights 
affirmative action school prayer and the separation of church and 
state 
he will be replaced by a justice surely more inclined to 
augment the states power to regulate abortions more accommodating 
of religion and more dubious of affirmative action said 
university of virginia law professor ae dick howard 
bruce fein a conservative court analyst predicted the court 
will become a conservative juggernaut 
brennan was the intellectual glue fein said the 
remaining liberals will be dispirited they just dont have that 
strength and winsome character to bring up that fifth vote and 
keep their cherished rulings intact 
but court watchers also said some of brennans major 
accomplishments will survive regardless of his successor 
robert bennett dean of northwestern universitys law school 
said what is most impressive is the enduring aspects of brennans 
work some of those principles are almost unassailable 
bennett cited opinions brennan authored that established the 
equal voting standard of one person one vote and that gave the 
news media broad constitutional protection against libel suits by 
public figures 
what justice brennan succeeded in doing was fashioning a body 
of jurisprudence that relied on fairness equality and human 
decency said howard the appeal of principles of that kind is 
lasting he succeeded i think in distilling some of the better 
instincts of modern american life 
some of brennans more recent pronouncements on freedom of 
speech also might endure 
brennan wrote for the court last month when it struck down a 
federal law against flag burning in a 54 ruling brennan said 
the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply 
because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable 
two of the courts most conservative members justices antonin 
scalia and anthony m kennedy were in the majority 
some legal scholars said that suggests that another conservative 
appointee by bush also might side with liberals on freespeech 
issues 
when kennedy joined the court in 1988 he solidified a 54 
conservative majority he was the third justice to be picked by 
president reagan who also promoted william h rehnquist to chief 
justice 
but liberals led by brennan have managed to win important 
victories in key cases by attracting a normally conservative 
justice 
for example at the conclusion of its 198990 term last month 
brennan authored the courts 54 opinion upholding the federal 
governments broad power to grant preferential treatment to 
minorities 
scholars agree that brennans departure means more than a loss 
of a key liberal vote 
the university of virginias howard said brennan combined 
unmatched experience and expertise formidable intellectual skills 
and amiable personal qualities 
no one hates justice brennan howard said no one will 
fill those shoes 
brennan is a diminutive man whose physical stature and 
irresistible irish charm remind some of a leprechaun 
justice harry a blackmun labeled a conservative when he joined 
the court but in recent years a reliable brennan ally has paid 
tribute to his colleagues peruasiveness and savvy 
blackmun has recalled how brennan came up to him one day in a 
corridor in the court building threw his arm around blackmun and 
said harry us liberals have to stick together 
the most closely watched battleground between conservatives and 
liberals continues to be abortion rights 
there appear to be four votes to overturn the courts 1973 
ruling in roe vs wade that established a constitutional right to 
an abortion 
justice sandra day oconnor the only woman ever to serve on the 
court has provided a fifth vote to give states new power to 
regulate abortions but has stopped short of voting to overturn the 
1973 ruling 
activists on both sides of the abortion debate expect bush to 
name someone who will provide the pivotal vote to reverse roe vs 
wade 
unless there is a massive and unprecedented political 
mobilization justice brennans departure may be a death knell for 
the right to choose in america said kate michelman head of the 
national abortion rights action league 
justice brennans resignation shakes the socalled abortion 
rights to its very foundation said joseph m scheidler director 
of the chicagobased prolife action league after 17 years the 
court that invented a womans right to destroy new life is rapidly 
disappearing a new court is emerging

one of the navys four battleships 
the uss new jersey is being stripped and readied for 
decommissioning the fourth time in its 47year history 
there were no bands no pomp and circumstance and no admirals as 
the vessel sporting menacing 16inch guns and 17inch armor 
pulled up to pier 6 at the long beach naval station on friday 
its last journey was a brief one running 45 minutes from seal 
beach where its crew unloaded ammunition 
this is just another day in the life of the battleship said 
the dreadnoughts skipper capt ronald d tucker 
maybe the new jersey was recommissioned four times since it was 
launched dec 7 1942 a year after the japanese attack on pearl 
harbor brought the united states into world war ii 
at a cost of 435 million it was last recommissioned on dec 
28 1982 under former president reagans plans for a 600ship 
navy the new jerseys latest tour of duty included firing salvos 
at syrian antiaircraft batteries in the mountains of lebanon in 
december 1983 
but the ship cost more than 35 million a year to maintain 
making it a deadinthewater target for congressional 
budgetcutters only three other battleships the iowa the 
missouri and the wisconsin exist 
on friday its 1500man crew began preparing the 887footlong 
battleship for decommissioning in february in march the ship will 
be towed to join its sister ship the uss iowa with the navys 
mothballed reserve fleet off bremerton wash 
in the pacific theater during world war ii its operations 
covered the marshall islands new guinea the marianas leyte 
luzon iwo jima and okinawa the ship also saw action in the korean

andrew youngs lackluster performance in last 
weeks georgia gubernatorial primary underscored the uphill battle 
black candidates are having as they seek some of the highest 
political posts in the south 
after slowly gaining a presence in local and state government 
blacks are making unprecedented runs for office in a region once 
known for racial discrimination 
though he failed to place first young has made it to an aug 7 
runoff for the democratic nomination for governor two other blacks 
are trying to win top elections elsewhere in the south 
in north carolina harvey gantt is the democratic nominee trying 
to unseat republican sen jesse helms in south carolina state 
sen theo mitchell has won the democratic gubernatorial nomination 
but young gantt and mitchell each are running against strong 
candidates as well as a history that says voters in the 
predominantly white states generally cast ballots along racial 
lines 
young a former atlanta mayor congressman un ambassador and 
civil rights movement veteran finished 12 percentage points on 
tuesday behind the frontrunner zell miller a fourterm 
lieutenant governor 
gantt the former mayor of charlotte nc is up against helms 
a nationally known incumbent who has been in office 18 years 
mitchell a state senator from greenville sc is challenging 
republican gov carroll campbell a popular incumbent with strong 
ties to the bush administration 
despite numerous differences between the three candidates their 
opponents and their states the three are bound by more than just 
the physical fact that theyre black said david ruffin of the 
joint center for political and economic studies a blackoriented 
think tank in washington 
all these candidates are using politics to renegotiate the 
compact between society and blacks said ruffin who edits the 
centers focus magazine all of them are looking for change the 
big difference is in the conditions in which theyre running 
the nation has no black senators and one black governor 
virginias l douglas wilder who was elected last year 
since winning the democratic runoff in north carolina in june 
gantt has been on the road meeting voters trying to offset the 
financial advantage held by helms an archconservative who some 
consider politically vulnerable this year 
we think what were doing is building support that is deep and 
wont be swayed by helms 30second television barrages said 
susan jetton gantts press secretary 
ms jetton said the gantt campaign is finding plenty of 
antihelms sentiment across the state 
he will have plenty of money and help in running against 
helms said earl black a political science professor at the 
university of south carolina there is so much opposition to 
helms that any democratic candidate can expect good financing 
but even some black supporters of gantt arent counting out 
helms 
tyrone brooks a black georgia state legislator who supports 
gantt said he was nonetheless skeptical about gantts chances in 
the north carolina election 
brooks was asked about the north carolinian earlier this month 
during a federal court hearing on a sofarunsuccessful suit 
challenging the runoff provision of georgias election law he 
testified that gantts runoff victory was an aberration and not 
representative of the climate for black candidates in southern 
statewide elections 
you cant say that because mr gantt won in north carolina 
that were going to win every runoff brooks said 
many political observers said the secondplace finish in the 
georgia primary was a disappointment for young who was well known 
and ran as a moderate stressing his talent for attracting business 
investment 
but young failed to win strong white support and urban blacks 
failed to give him the overwhelming backing he counted on 
young said the morning after the primary vote was counted that 
he was unsure why the black vote was smaller than he wanted 
mitchell on the other hand attracted a sizable black vote in 
the democratic primary and has been campaigning regularly at black 
churches said black 
mitchell soundly defeated state sen ernest passailaigue a 
white in the democratic primary earning 60 percent of the vote 
election officials said voter turnout was low overall but that 
mitchell was helped by the high black turnout he remains the 
underdog in the general election campaign however 
keith r billingsley an associate professor of political 
science at the university of georgia said youngs success with 
black voters may have been reduced because his two terms as mayor 
of predominantly black atlanta were not an unqualified success 
among the citys residents 
a number of black folks have told me they did not respect the 
way he ran the city especially the police department 
billingsley said 
race has not emerged as an overt issue in any of the campaigns 
though there is a definite racial undercurrent said billingsley 
young and miller each have promised that the candidates records 
will be the issue in their runoff campaign 
theyre going to talk about it the record and the voters 
are going to look at their color billingsley said

the pipe bomb that maimed environmental 
activist judy bari of the militant earth first movement nearly 
killed her spirit but she says the support of fellow 
environmentalists has revived her 
i didnt have any will to keep going after this happened 
she said referring to the may 24 car bombing that broke her pelvis 
and partially paralyzed her right leg 
bari spoke about the bombing in oakland and about what she 
considers an earlier attempt to kill her in an interview thursday 
with the associated press at the rehabilitation center where she is 
undergoing therapy 
she said that when a logging truck once ran her off a road i 
was able to reach inside of myself and find the courage to go on 
but this time i didnt have anything left it was the support of 
the movement that enabled me to go on 
supporters suspect the bomb that injured bari and passenger 
darryl cherney was planted by timber interests in retaliation for 
their roles organizing redwood summer a series of protests against 
the logging of oldgrowth redwood forests 
bari said she had received several written death threats 
she said she is kept awake nights by severe pain and fear that 
whoever planted the bomb might strike again 
but most frustrating she said was that authorities suspected 
her and cherney in the bombing they were arrested for 
investigation of explosives possession and transportation because 
police suspected they were carrying a bomb that went off 
accidentally 
i feel persecuted by the police i dont feel protected by the 
police bari said im the victim of a horrible crime and i 
think im in a position where i need the police to protect me and 
find who did it 
they have not for one minute dropped their view of me as a 
criminal simply because of my political views 
bari and her supporters felt vindicated last week when 
prosecutors said they would file no charges against the pair for 
the time being at least but investigators insist no one has been 
exonerated and that their investigation of the explosion is 
continuing 
investigators have been hampered by the refusal of some earth 
first supporters to cooperate said oakland police lt mike sims 
people who may support bari and cherneys side of the story 
have been directed by attorneys to refuse to talk to us he said 
bari has a simple response 
as long as they are presuming me guilty then we are foolish 
to cooperate with them she said 
at issue the tactics favored by some earth first members 
including monkeywrenching acts of sabotage against those 
who they feel are damaging the environment 
such sabotage has included tree spiking driving large nails 
into trees which can damage power saws and risk injury to timber 
and mill workers earth first activists also have chained 
themselves to treecutting machines blocked logging roads and 
occupied roadbuilding equipment 
but members say the group takes no official stance on such 
activity and that its members are mostly involved in acts of civil 
disobedience 
bari herself has rejected the use of sabotage although she does 
not condemn all of it 
the bombing has helped change the movement to save the redwood 
forests she believes 
obviously it has galvanized a lot of attention she said 
but on the other hand it knocked out the experienced leadership 
so i think it had both a negative and a positive effect 
although more moderate environmental groups have joined earth 
first in calling for an independent investigation of the bombing 
most have not spoken out in favor of the earth first movement 
itself 
bari is pleased by reports of antilogging protests although 
none of the protests yet this summer has attracted the many 
thousands of people organizers boasted would flock to the region 
bari wonders when shell be well enough to take an active role 
in the movement 
ive been really terrified to the depths of my soul she 
said but added 
my brain is still functioning

the air force has told congress it needs 
another 14 billion to acquire two b2 bombers on schedule an 
admission bound to further erode congressional support for the 
radarevading aircraft 
air force secretary donald b rice notified house armed services 
chairman les aspin dwis of the budget shortfall in a letter 
obtained by the associated press over the weekend it came on the 
eve of a speech monday by aspin in which congressional sources 
say he will propose canceling the b2 program entirely 
aspin who kept the increasingly expensive plane alive with 
compromise legislation last year has been moving towards halting 
funds for the program because of its high cost which has 
skyrocketed to about 860 million each 
the pricetag may surpass the 1 billion mark based on the latest 
revelations 
proponents of house legislation to limit the program to the 
planes currently in production say they are a handful of votes 
short of the number needed for approval 
but the plane still has staunch support in the senate where the 
chairman of the senate armed services committee sam nunn dga 
is a key proponent 
rice in his letter dated july 11 said that without the 14 
billion acquisition of the two bombers will have to be delayed 
until 1997 the two b2s are among 15 bombers intended to be bought 
through 1990 at a cost of 27 billion the air force had begun 
procurement of the two planes in 1988 and 1989 
rice also said that the cost of buying two other b2s and 
related items in the 1991 fiscal year beginning oct 1 will total 
46 billion an increase of about 500 million from the original 
figure 
rice blamed the increase in costs primarily on a jump in 
overhead charges and changes in the production rate 
defense secretary dick cheney facing economic pressure and a 
lessening soviet threat in april revised plans for the b2 
cutting the total number of aircraft planned from 132 to 75 and the 
1990 budget request from five to two 
rice said cheneys revision pushed the shortfall to an estimated 
14 billion 
this shortfall will become a liability when the contracts 
are signed and executed rice said in the letter initialing of the 
contracts is expected in december 1990 and the summer of 1991 
the air force examined several options to make up the shortfall 
including using unobligated money from past years or supplemental 
appropriations the service has decided to restructure the previous 
years purchases of 15 planes 
this restructure would involve moving two aircraft to fiscal 
1997 one from fiscal 1988 and one from fiscal 1989 rice 
said 
thus instead of the air forces current plans for 15 planes to 
be bought through 1990 at a cost of about 27 billion the air 
force would be left with 13 planes 
rice said the b2 is not unique to this type of shortfall as 
program costs react to changes in quantity or schedule

break into jail assistant district attorney chuck rosenthal said 
david matthew winfree 22 pleaded guilty to burglary for

a year in the harris county jail 
winfree a landscaper was apprehended inside a maintenance 
building thursday with a 270 battery charger he told police he 
was looking for landscaping tools to steal said rosenthal 
its gotten to the point that the judicial system has made it 
so attractive for criminals that criminals ask us for prison time 
instead of probation said state district judge michael mcspadden 
but weve hit an alltime low when they start knocking down 
doors to get into prison 
mcspadden referred to recent incidents where people have asked 
for prison time instead of probation because they expected to be 
out of prison quickly without the inconvenience of being on 
probation the states overcrowded prison system has forced 
authorities to release many inmates early

boulders two most attractive features 
its laidback lifestyle and rugged geography also help attract 
drug traffickers who use it as a base law enforcement and city 
officials say 
federal grand juries in denver last week indicted 12 men 
allegedly involved in two separate marijuana smuggling rings based 
in boulder 
one of the operations is believed to be the biggest ever to 
operate in colorado smuggling an estimated 100000 pounds of pot 
into this country from mexico from 1978 to 1988 
there obviously is an attraction to the area said police 
sgt joe pelle i think there are several reasons why boulder is 
popular it is secluded and affluent 
the feds tell me the majority of cases they have in colorado 
have boulder ties pelle said 
pelle noted that only a small fraction of the marijuana imported 
into boulder is actually distributed in the boulderdenver area 
boulder snuggled against the flatiron mountains is a city of 
about 80000 and is home of the university of colorado pelle and 
other officials said they do not believe boulder has any higher 
proportion of drug users than other college towns 
one indictment named six men who allegedly ran the states 
largest marijuana trafficking operation that indictment resulted 
from a twoyear investigation initiated when a maid discovered 
42000 while cleaning a motel room in boulder 
about 10 million worth of cash gold artworks rare coins and 
other valuables have been impounded from members of the group and 
federal authorities are seeking the forfeiture of a total of 50 
million in assets officials said 
four members of that group are in custody 
in the other boulder drug case that came to light last week six 
other men were accused of smuggling 10000 pounds of pot into the 
city from mexico from 1986 to 1989 all six were arrested 
the alleged ringleader of this group was nicknamed the champagne 
smuggler the group apparently marked dates and load sizes on 
champagne corks to record their ventures 
boulder mayor leslie durgin said she is not sure boulder has any 
more drug operations than other cities but cited many lifestyle 
characteristics of the community in explaining why it tends to be a 
base for smuggling operations 
there is a willingness of people in boulder to be tolerant we 
give people quite a bit of room in their own lives she said 
thats something were proud of in boulder the tolerance of 
diversity and the space given in individual lives 
robert pence head of the denver fbi office noted that the 
relative affluence of boulder allows drug traffickers to live a 
comfortable lifestyle without drawing attention to themselves 
its not that boulder has a corner on the market theyre all 
over but the city has been popular with what i would call the 
yuppietype drug traffickers he said 
pence said boulders geography also makes it hospitable to drug 
smugglers because it is near the mountains the operators can find 
relatively secluded houses and still be close to boulder and to 
denver 30 miles away 
boulder also has easy access to interstate highways and has 
three small airports nearby and its central location in the united 
states makes it an ideal distribution center said pence 
pence said boulders liberal politics and its reputation as a 
fun place to live also tend to attract drug operators 
it has a lifestyle theyre comfortable with he said

the baltic republics on saturday quietly marked 
what lithuania called a day of injury humiliation and tragedy 
the 50th anniversary of the declaration of soviet power over them 
flags flew at halfstaff in the lithuanian capital of vilnius 
and latvia announced its lawmakers had voted to nullify the 1940 
declaration of soviet power 
for decades july 21 had been celebrated officially as a holiday 
in estonia latvia and lithuania but the three baltic republics in 
the last year have expanded their sovereignty and announced their 
intention to break with the soviet union 
lithuanias prime minister was quoted saturday as saying that 
negotiations with soviet officials on the republics march 11 
declaration of independence could start next week 
latvia lithuania and estonia were independent of moscow briefly 
between the two world wars but under a secret agreement stalin and 
hitler signed in 1939 they fell into the soviet sphere of 
influence 
soviet soldiers moved in as nazi forces attacked poland and 
under soviet pressure the parliaments of the three republics voted 
to join the soviet union 
they were admitted as soviet republics in early august of 1940 
thousands of lithuanians latvians and estonians were killed sent 
into exile or prison 
the latvian supreme soviet parliament voted thursday to void the 
50yearold declaration of soviet power aris yansons an assistant 
to latvian president anatoly gorbunov said saturday the 
proclamation strengthened the parliaments condemnation of the act 
in february 
the official soviet news agency tass quoted a latvian government 
statement saturday as saying july 21 1940 marked the start of 
mass terror and genocide against the residents of latvia the 
consequences of which are still being felt 
lithuanias government said in a statement saturday that the 
21st of july remains a day of injury humiliation and tragedy in 
our memory 
aidas palubinskas a spokesman for the lithuanian supreme 
council parliament said flags were flying at halfmast at the 
parliament building and a few other locations in vilnius 
he said supporters of soviet power held a small rally in a city 
park but the day otherwise was quiet a small rally was also held 
friday in tallinn estonia but the anniversary itself was a 
typical saturday said an editor at official estonian radio 
the soviet unions main newspapers carried long articles 
saturday backing the kremlin position by depicting the baltics 
absorption into the country as voluntary they also published a 
call by national parliamentary leaders for responsibility and 
common sense 
the small communist party faction in lithuania that has remained 
loyal to moscow also issued a statement saying the republic joined 
the soviet union voluntarily the party daily pravda reported 
meanwhile lithuanian prime minister kazimeira prunskiene said 
in an interview published saturday that the republic could start 
negotiations next week with soviet officials and the soviet side 
is ready for this 
i would say that our dialogue now is taking place in a very 
calm tone she told the interfax news service which is 
affiliated with official radio moscow 
lithuania agreed on june 29 to put a 100day moratorium on its 
declaration of independence starting when negotiations formally 
begin with soviet officials 
the kremlin then halted an economic embargo that had shut off 
oil shipments most natural gas and many other goods and raw 
materials 
mrs prunskiene said she and another lithuanian official bronus 
kuzmickas had a short and concrete conversation with gorbachev 
on friday after a joint meeting of the presidential and federation 
councils to discuss economic reform and a new treaty between moscow 
and the soviet republics 
she said both sides expressed the desire to start 
negotiations and strive for a convergence of positions in order to 
sign an agreement

president bush took his campaign 
against big defense cuts to one of the nations few remaining 
shipyards saturday saying the united states must retain a strong 
military despite the apparent demise of the cold war 
while freedom has made great gains we have not entered an era 
of perpetual peace bush said at a christening ceremony for the 
nations newest aircraft carrier the george washington 
standing in a shadow of the carriers massive bow bush quoted 
the nations first president to be prepared for war is one of 
the most effective means of preserving the peace 
the message contrasted with bushs recent attempts to persuade 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev that the united states poses 
no military threat 
after the 40minute ceremony the president flew from nearby 
langley air force base to his mountain retreat at camp david md 
the visit to newport news was bushs second defenserelated trip 
in as many days on friday he traveled to warren air force base 
near cheyenne wyo where all 50 of the nations mx 
intercontinental ballistic missiles are stationed in silos 
the focus on defense coincides with growing debate in congress 
over how deeply and quickly military spending should be reduced as 
a result of the collapse of the soviet threat in europe and the 
spawning of democracies in the east bloc 
speaking at the newport news shipbuilding yard bush made no 
mention of the budget debate on capitol hill at warren on friday 
however the president said he was willing to accept a senate armed 
services committee proposal for a 289 billion defense budget for 
the coming fiscal year 
bush said congress must hold the line at the senate panels 
spending figure and that he needed greater flexibility in pruning 
the size of the armed forces the senate panel called for cutting 
100000 personnel from the total armed services of 21 million 
that is nearly three times the number bush has proposed dropping 
in his february budget request bush asked congress to hold 
defense spending to 307 billion as recently as last week defense 
secretary dick cheney said the administration was not ready to 
abandon its proposal 
with the navys top officers at his side during the carrier 
christening ceremony bush said the united states must sustain a 
superpower military strength 
we must maintain a policy of peacetime engagement and armed 
forces sufficient to sustain our vital national interest he 
said we are the pivotal factor of stability we will not 
shrink from this responsibility 
barbara bush with the president and their daughter dorothy 
leblond at her side performed the formal christening of the 
1040foot carrier she stood on a platform directly beneath the 
ships bow and smashed a bottle of champagne against the hull 
for the occasion bush a former navy pilot who flew combat 
missions from a pacificbased carrier during world war ii wore a 
navy blue tie adorned with aviator wings 
bush praised the newport news shipbuilders noting that the yard 
constructed the nations first carrier the ranger in 1934 and 
that it had produced 239 others since then 
few realize the magnitude of your task what it means to 
build a stateoftheart supercarrier a warship a floating city 
and an airport all rolled into one bush said 
the 31 billion george washington is due to enter service in 
1992 it is the sixth nimitzclass carrier to be built two more 
are in development in all the navy has 15 active carriers 
including one in overhaul

spectrum of opposition groups joined forces

a conservative research organization is trying 
to convince the nations press that it is biased 
the media research center has mailed out to newspapers and other 
opinionmakers 8000 copies of a report that uses hundreds of 
examples to make the case that the media serve as a cheerleader 
for liberal causes 
the booklength report and thats the way it isnt pictures 
a national press corps composed of liberals who surround themselves 
with likeminded friends and colleagues to the point they are 
oblivious to what mainstream american thinks 
and it says these journalists are blind to their own tendency 
to give a liberal spin to the news 
their friends are liberals their sources are liberals what 
they read and hear is written by liberals it says this helps 
explain why policies considered liberal by the public are seen as 
mainstream by reporters and editors 
the center describes itself as a conservative media 
foundation 
brent baker executive director and the books coeditor said 
copies have been mailed to college professors and libraries 
politicians think tanks and news bureaus in washington and to 
radio talk show hosts editorial writers and political editors 
across the country 
he said the conservative william h donner foundation is 
furnishing between 50000 and 100000 to help pay for the 
project the rest of the money comes from the centers own 
finances provided by gifts of 1000 to 25000 a year from 
several hundred supporters 
the book is a compilation of more than 40 studies that taken 
together says baker are hard to dismiss as an aberration 
most of the studies cite examples drawn from big media the 
new york times the washington post the wall street journal the 
papers of the gannett co which publishes usa today time the 
associated press united press international the american 
broadcasting co national broadcasting co columbia broadcasting 
system public broadcasting system and cable news network 
researcher stephen hess of the brookings institution author of 
three books about the washington press and of a study cited in the 
report takes issue with the report 
he said the press has become increasingly professional and 
lives up to a set of standards which work as a brake against 
their personal bias and inclination 
the nations agenda is set not by the press but by the 
politicians candidates and businessmen who hold the news 
conferences issue the reports and conduct the hearings that the 
media report on 
conceding that the media were unable to prevent the election or 
reelection of ronald reagan the report said no they dont win 
every time but they do win most of the time it says 
the report cites 
surveys of the political attitudes of journalists it says they 
consistently show theyre more liberal than the public 
studies of what journalists did in other careers it contends 
that most who move from the political world into journalism come 
from liberal quarters 
compilations of quotes from journalists in unguarded 
moments that show their true colors as an example the report 
cites a quote from abc newsman david brinkley in the washington 
post magazine if i had to pick the best presidents in my 
lifetime i would of course pick roosevelt and kennedy and i would 
also pick harry truman 
counts showing how often some terms such as 
ultraconservative and ultraliberal are used it says they 
show that conservatives were far more likely than liberals to be 
painted as ideologues and extremists

ive never been overseas it will be quite the adventure for 
me she said its kind of a mystery i can picture myself

hezbollah or party of god attacked and seized jarjou from the 
syrianbacked amal militia in an effort to expand its area of 
control toward the mediterranean and open up a badly needed route 
to iran its main supplier of arms 
plo fighters have been trying to stop the fighting between the 
two shiite groups apparently to halt the hezbollah advance toward 
sidon a southern port where plo guerrillas are based it is 10 
miles northwest of jarjou 
amal and palestine liberation organization guerrillas fought a 
threeyear war between 1985 and 1988 but joined together to storm 
the hezbollah positions 
police said saturday that about 300 amal fighters and 250 
palestinians were nibbling their way into jarjou on the 
southwestern tip of hezbollahs enclave 
but a police spokesman said hezbollah is not withdrawing 
despite the enormous pressure the hezbollahis are fighting tooth 
and nail fighting a battle to the last bullet and dying in place 
both sides were reported moving in reinforcements and security 
sources said the palestinians and amal were massing forces and 
hauling in ammunition for an expected night assault 
the lebanese red cross appealed for urgent blood donations to 
cope with the casualties 
the palestinians mainly men from yasser arafats fatah faction 
and amal militiamen launched their first attack on jarjou at 3am 
behind a curtain of fire from multibarrelled rocket launchers and 
howitzers 
they reached the villages main square by midday police said 
hezbollah sent reinforcements from hills overlooking the village 
and launched a counterattack around 1 pm but was beaten back 
the spokesman reported 
amal and palestinian gunners shelled jarjous northern and 
eastern edges in an apparent effort to try to cut it off from 
hezbollah reinforcements 
the fundamentalists hammered the palestinianheld southern part 
of the village with phosphorous shells the spokesman said 
reporters near the battle zone said the village was on fire 
with smoke billowing from almost every building 
hezbollahs radio station broadcast martial music an announcer 
declared o allah shatter the criminals who are attacking your 
men in jarjou o allah you will lead us to victory 
hezbollah and amal have been fighting off and on for three years 
for control of lebanons 12 million shiites the countrys largest 
sect 
more than 1100 people have been killed and some 3400 wounded 
in the inconclusive showdown between the shiite rivals 
the plo has roughly 5000 guerrillas in south lebanon amal has 
about 6500 frontline fighters hezbollah can muster up about 
2000 shiites but has often defeated amal in clashes

their policies are attacked from all 
sides they are losing cars and country homes and now they have to 
start paying their office telephone and electricity bills 
for communist officials in this ancient russian city these are 
not the best of times and they may be a sign of things to come for 
other areas 
just ask sergei goryachev the acting city party chief of tver 
a russian city 105 miles northwest of moscow on the volga river 
recently he took a vacation and had some time to think what 
he thought about was quitting the party 
of course there is worrying serious worrying said 
goryachev the 38yearold son of a soldier 
in his office in tver an ancient city once called kalinin a 
portrait of soviet founder vladimir lenin stares from the wall 
looking at it goryachev summed up the result of his soulsearching 
in this period to leave would be pure betrayal he said 
simply 
but dozens of party leaders have come to the opposite conclusion 
spurred by dissatisfaction with the outcome of this months 28th 
communist party congress loyalists are abandoning the party in 
droves 
the exodus began with maverick politician boris n yeltsin and 
has included other wellknown figures politicians lawmakers and 
the mayors of leningrad and moscow 
the party is under attack from the left for keeping a hand in 
the kgb and army and police and not sharing facilities including 
buildings and printing presses with wouldbe competitors 
the right is angry that the party loosened its grip on eastern 
european allies and is borrowing from capitalism in its economic 
reforms 
it is not known how many communists nationwide have turned in 
their party cards but in the tver region 3000 of the 150000 
members left the party in the first half of this year 
goryachev predicts more will quit the unhappiness with the 
party is apparent when he meets with workers he said 
they are cold in the very beginning when you walk in he 
said but then people see that you are the same as they have 
the same problems and that the problems concern me 
many complaints he said are about privileges accorded party 
officials goryachev and other officials say many summer cottages 
cars and medical facilities reserved for the party elite have been 
turned over to the public 
tvers 53yearold regional party chief alexander ilyenkov 
acknowledges that hearing criticism is unpleasant but nowadays he 
freely admits the party has made mistakes 
many of the misfortunes today were generated by me and i take 
the responsibility he tells the public 
the party is taking responsibility in other ways as well 
the phone and electricity bills of party offices at factories 
have traditionally been paid by the host organizations goryachev 
said but to head off claims by prospective competing parties such 
bills will now be paid out of the party budget he said 
the local partys four city committees are being consolidated 
into one half of its 112 staff employees are to laid off and its 
budget is to be cut by twothirds 
since the party has given up its constitutionally guaranteed 
monopoly of power tvers mayor sergei kisilev says hes ready to 
act in the spirit of the times although no opposition parties have 
officially registered in tver kisilev says that if they do he will 
guarantee everyone equal conditions 
the government he says will no longer pay for the partys use 
of the local tv station or nonparty newspapers and it will send a 
bill to the party for meetings in theaters and other public 
buildings 
in keeping with mikhail s gorbachevs reforms tvers party is 
also separating itself from the government goryachev says tvers 
police chief used to call him regularly to report on crimes in the 
city but no more party departments that supervised the local kgb 
and other agencies are being abolished he says 
ilyenkov believes the reforms will enable the party to win back 
the peoples hearts but he says the process wont be easy 
changing the party he says isnt like going to the tailor 
where you simply step out in a renewed suit discarding the old 
one

under the us system of separation of powers 
it is the presidents job to choose supreme court nominees and the 
senates role to confirm or reject them 
after the president announces his choice the appointment goes 
to the senate judiciary committee which conducts hearings on the 
nominee 
the committee has the power to block the nomination but given 
the importance of the supreme court nominees its likely the 
nomination will be forwarded to the full senate 
twentyseven high court nominees in the nations history have 
failed to win senate confirmation only seven in this century 
most recently the senate in 1987 blocked president ronald 
reagans appointment of robert bork to fill a vacancy created by 
the retirement of justice lewis f powell 
the senate vote was 5842 with six republicans joining 52 
democrats in opposing bork 
reagans second choice douglas ginsburg withdrew after 
revealing he had smoked marijuana the senate then confirmed 
reagans third pick anthony m kennedy

remaining justices of the supreme court 
william rehnquist 65 appointed to the court in 1971 by 
president richard nixon and appointed chief justice by president 
ronald reagan in 1986 once a frequent dissenter he now is 
generally acknowledged as the leader of the courts working 
conservative majority rehnquist is well liked by his colleagues 
who praise him for his informal genial style 
byron r white 73 appointed to the court in 1962 by president 
john kennedy white generally votes with the conservatives 
although his deference to federal power can produce some 
contrasting results he voted with the liberals last month to 
uphold a key federal affirmative action program he is among the 
courts most avid questioners of lawyers during oral arguments and 
can be abrasive 
thurgood marshall 82 appointed to the court in 1967 by 
president lyndon johnson brennans most consistent ally marshall 
is the only black ever named to the court and is a figure of 
historic importance in the civil rights movement but critics say 
his interest in court work has flagged in recent years marshall 
has been an outspoken critic of reagan and has vowed to remain on 
the court as long as he is alive 
harry a blackmun 81 appointed to the court in 1970 by nixon 
he is best known as the author of the 1973 ruling in roe vs wade 
that established a womans constitutional right to an abortion 
once labeled a conservative twin of former chief justice warren 
e burger he has cast generally liberal votes in recent years 
john paul stevens 70 appointed to the court in 1975 by

given to broad pronouncements or sweeping rulings she underwent a 
mastectomy last year and says her cancer has been cured 
antonin scalia 54 appointed to the court in 1986 by reagan a 
scholar and jurist of unquestioned brilliance he has tried to pull 
the court further to the right and has been outspoken in 
criticizing conservative colleagues who prefer incremental change 
scalia has a libertarian streak and strict adherence to 
constitutional principles that occasionally produce a surprise he 
cast a recent dissenting vote when the court refused to grant child 
abuse suspects the right to confront their young accusers in court 
anthony m kennedy 53 appointed to the court in 1988 by 
reagan the courts newest member solidified a conservative 
majority but says he has felt no special pressure in being a

lewis f powell kennedys major defections from the conservative 
camp were his votes to strike down laws against flag burning

singer diana ross is singing the blues 
over a truck weigh station being built near her home in this 
celebrity enclave 
i try to talk to people about the weigh station and nobody 
listens said ross ross said on friday that she did get a good 
reception from democratic gubernatorial candidate bruce morrison 
morrison a congressman from hamden agrees with ross and some 
of her neighbors in the belle haven section of greenwich that the 
truck weigh station being built on interstate 95 probably poses an 
environmental hazard they argue that exhaust from idling engines 
would pollute the air and that fuel spills could make their way 
into the nearby long island sound 
after having lunch with ross and 17 other greenwich residents 
morrison pledged to keep the 6 million weigh station from 
operating if elected governor 
he seems like a nittygritty type of guy ross said i 
want to have a voice and he listens 
the 46yearold former supremes greenwich estate was once the 
home of tobacco heiress nancy reynolds

the prospect of reviewing every single word of 
testimony in oliver norths irancontra trial is so daunting 
prosecutors may decide instead to appeal the courtordered 
examination 
they also could drop the case altogether but thats unlikely 
given the track record of the irancontra prosecutors office 
which has been aggressively pursuing the arms and money scandal for 
more than 3 years 
the demanding review called for by a federal appeals court 
suggests that prosecutors will fight tooth and nail not to have 
to go through this tremendously cumbersome hearing procedure 
said paul rothstein a criminal law professor at georgetown 
university 
gerald caplin a george washington university law professor 
said he would be surprised if the government doesnt appeal 
the appeals court friday vacated all three convictions and sent 
the case back to us district judge gerhard gesell for a hearing 
to determine whether the case was tainted by the former white house 
aides televised testimony to congress north testified before 
congress with a grant of immunity from prosecution 
in addition the court reversed one conviction outright that 
north altered and destroyed national security council documents 
that means the only way the conviction might be reinstated would be 
through a new trial 
the hearing process required by the appeals court may be 
unworkable acknowledged paul l friedman an attorney who 
formerly worked in the office of norths prosecutor lawrence walsh 
if you really have to proceed witness by witness thats a 
heavy procedural burden friedman said 
one way for the irancontra prosecutors office to proceed would 
be to seek supreme court review of the appeals court decision 
if walsh concludes the appeals court decision goes beyond what 
is required by the supreme court then i think there is a 
strong argument that walsh go directly and get them to reverse this 
opinion friedman said 
alternatively the prosecution could seek a review by all 12 
members of the court of appeals or it could attempt to proceed 
with the hearing process before gesell 
walsh could decide not to continue with the north case his 
office has said that it cost 209 million through may 31 to 
convict seven individuals and one corporation others have put the 
cost as high as 40 million 
walshs office said only that we are studying the opinions to 
determine the most appropriate next step 
a jury convicted north on may 4 1989 of three of the 12 
charges he faced they were aiding and abetting an obstruction of 
congress altering and destroying nsc documents and accepting an 
illegal gratuity 
north on july 5 1989 was sentenced to a suspended prison term 
was fined 150000 put on two years probation and ordered to 
perform 1200 hours of community service 
gesells inquiry must proceed witnessbywitness said the 
appeals court in a ruling supported by reagan administration 
appointees laurence silberman and david sentelle chief judge 
patricia wald a carter administration appointee dissented 
if necessary it will proceed linebyline and itembyitem 
the court added 
the majority on the court panel suggested that norths fifth 
amendment right against selfincrimination may have been violated 
north was compelled to testify to congress under a grant of 
immunity in that nationally televised testimony he admitted many 
of the activities for which he was later charged with crimes 
the ruling also could signify trouble ahead for the irancontra 
case against norths old boss former national security adviser 
john poindexter who was convicted of five felonies in the 
irancontra case last april 
like north poindexter had given immunized testimony to congress 
in 1987 the question of taint in regard to poindexters testimony 
will be a major issue on appeal said richard beckler one of his 
lawyers

nine more cubans sought refuge saturday in 
the spanish embassy in havana bringing the total of asylumseekers 
to 18 spanish officials said cuban police surrounded the embassy 
and spain said it was beefing up its guard 
diplomats wrangled meanwhile over whether to grant the cubans 
asylum and safe conduct out of the caribbean island nation 
according to officials and news reports 
fidel castros communist government has been insisting that all 
asylumseekers surrender to cuban authorities without condition 
the government has called all those who have gone into the spanish 
czechoslovak and italian embassies and diplomatic residences in 
recent days scum and habitual vagrants 
spain has been insisting they should all be given asylum 
in madrid the government announced it plans to send four or 
five more members of a tactical police squad to havana to reinforce 
security at the embassy 
a spanish official speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
police would leave as soon as possible to join four other 
members who arrived in havana thursday 
the official said four more cubans entered the embassy grounds 
early saturday and five more gained access two hours later nine 
cubans were already holed up in the embassy 
the spanish news agency efe said the first group entered the 
embassy by way of a terrace while the second group scaled one of 
the embassys outer walls and broke a balcony while trying to enter 
the building 
notimex the official mexican news agency said cuban police 
blocked several streets near the embassy and completely surrounded 
it 
another four cubans are at the residence of the italian 
ambassador 
five cubans spent a week in a czechoslovak diplomats apartment 
but gave up their bid for asylum thursday after the cuban 
government assured them they would not be prosecuted 
cuban officials have been accusing foreign diplomats of 
encouraging people to seek refuge at the embassies as part of a 
plot to destabilize the castro regime one of the few orthodox 
hardline communist administrations left 
foreign diplomats have rejected the accusations as unfounded 
accusing cuban police in turn of violating diplomatic territory to 
make arrests in one incident they said cuban police entered 
spanish embassy grounds to seize a refugee 
the us state department called the cuban accusations 
outrageous and a us statement accused cuban agents of trying 
several times to compromise us officials in havana in recent 
months 
in washington michael kozak a deputy assistant secretary of 
state called in a cuban diplomat friday to lodge a formal protest 
the united states cut diplomatic relations and imposed a trade 
embargo on cuba in 1960 but under a 1977 agreement the two 
countries maintain interest sections in other embassies in each 
others capitals 
in april 1980 thousands of cubans jammed the peruvian embassy 
in havana soon after that many joined what became the mariel boat 
lift which eventually took 125000 cubans to florida 
spain recalled its ambassador in havana for consultations on 
thursday after cuba a spanish colony for 406 years until 1898 
called spanish foreign minister francisco fernandez ordonez a 
frustrated colonial administrator and a victim of historical 
amnesia 
the cuban government rebuked fernandez for having publicly 
suggested that castro should be cautious about allowing cubans to 
leave since their departure would cause his regime to crumble

americans with loved ones dead or missing from 
the vietnam war are welcoming president bushs decision to hold 
cambodian peace talks with the heirs of ho chi minh 
richard cockrell of sandusky ohio moisteyed after viewing the 
names of friends and classmates on the vietnam memorial wall spoke 
for many 
somebodys got to start talking the veteran of navy service 
in vietnam said weve been to war with them and that didnt 
solve anything 
randy elmore a member of the vietnam veterans of america post 
in bellingham wash which has kept a chair vacant at its meetings 
for a local man who disappeared in the southeast asia fighting 
agreed 
the vietnamese hold all the cards on the prisoners of war 
elmore said in a telephone interview from bellingham opening the 
dialogue is a good idea 
except for limited contacts concerning servicemen still listed 
as prisoners of war or missing in action the united states has 
shunned talks with the vietnamese regime since ho chi minhs 
communist north vietnamese defeated usbacked south vietnam in 
1975 
secretary of state james a baker iii ended that era wednesday 
disclosing in paris that the administration will take up the 
question of peace in cambodia directly with the hanoi government 
which installed the current government in phnom penh a baker aide 
said the decision was approved by the president 
gareth porter who was in vietnam during the war as a journalist 
and now teaches international relations at american university 
found it not surprising that americans welcome the talks with the 
regime that nearly 60000 of them died fighting 
i think they have been ready for far longer than the 
administration said porter the administration has lagged 
behind public opinion on the question of letting bygones be 
bygones 
prior to bakers announcement members of congress had urged 
bush to change us policy in cambodia where a usbacked 
coalition that includes the communist khmer rouge is battling 
cambodian government forces 
representatives of organizations seeking the recovery of the 
estimated 2302 americans still missing in vietnam laos and 
cambodia said they welcome the administrations initiative 
if the us government feels that announced official cambodian 
discussions with the vietnamese will help bring a solution to the 
cambodian problem then i think all americans would have to applaud 
that said ann mills griffiths executive secretary of the 
national league of families of american prisoners and missing in 
southeast asia 
dolores alfond of seattle chairwoman of the national alliance 
of families for the return of americas missing servicemen said 
we are very anxious for dialogue but of course we feel that in 
the dialogue there should be negotiations for our prisoners of 
war 
ms alfond whose brother air force capt victor apodaca 
disappeared during a 1967 flight over north vietnam welcomed 
bakers statement that normalization is linked to hanois 
cooperation on the missing in action issue 
elmore was more skeptical saying i think the administration 
has to make some demands and they havent 
vice president dan quayle told the national league of families 
on july 13 that vietnamese cooperation in us efforts to track 
down reported pows and mias could remove the last vestige of the 
war and lay the groundwork for improved relations in the context of 
a comprehensive settlement in cambodia 
at the same meeting robert m kimmitt undersecretary of state 
for political affairs assured the families that we do not dwell 
on the past or harbor vindictiveness in our approach to vietnam and 
its neighbors 
officials were at pains to say the talks would not deal with the 
prospect of normalizing relations with hanoi 
from the time us ground troops were first sent to vietnam in 
1965 until the last of the troops were pulled out after the south 
vietnamese surrender 10 years later the southeast asian war 
increasingly convulsed american life some critics called it an 
immoral war others said the fighting men were being hamstrung by 
the politicians 
by the time it was over about 57000 us troops had died 
approximately 46600 of them in combat south vietnam had lost 
about 254300 men and north vietnam more than a million 
george a carver a former cia specialist on vietnam now with 
the center for strategic and international studies said the memory 
of the unpopular vietnam war is no reason for america to shun 
contact with hanoi 
a great power has to look after its interests carver said 
it cant be rendered catatonic by the fact that people might 
criticize it for something that happened 15 years ago

revolution that toppled communist dictator nicolae ceausescu turned 
into an anticommunist rally saturday 
demonstrators chanted down with communism and down with 
iliescu opponents have demanded the resignation of president ion 
iliescu a former communist who won free elections in may saying 
he condones totalitarianism 
meanwhile the trial of 24 former top communist party and 
government officials opened but was adjourned until monday

accused of having backed ceausescus orders to shoot at 
demonstrators last december as the revolution began 
the defendants who include a former foreign minister and former 
vice premier face maximum sentences of life in prison 
the adjournment came after the defense asked that court 
president be replaced because he was one of the five judges in the 
secret trial of ceausescu and his wife elena who were executed on 
christmas day 
more than 2000 people turned out for saturdays march which 
was organized by the 21 december association a leading opposition 
group 
demonstrators knelt prayed and lit candles for the victims of 
the revolution seven months ago that ended 45 years of communist 
rule in romania 
the march began in bucharests central university square the 
site of much of the fighting during the initial days of the 
revolution 
the square was also the site of a 53day antigovernment protest 
that was violently broken up by police last month setting off 
riots that the government put down with the help of clubwielding 
vigilante coal miners 
decembers popular uprising left at least 1038 dead and more 
than 2600 injured according to official figures 
referring to those who lost their lives in the revolution eugen 
botoc a 43yearold driver said they died happy because they 
thought they did it 
but like many other protesters he seemed unhappy with the 
results of the revolution 
there is no chance for us but to flee to flee from 
communism he said adrian chiriac a 19yearold student told a 
small crowd that old times have come back with the same old hope 
of running away to the west 
he carried a huge banner saying the only hope that is left is 
to defect 
before dispersing peacefully the demonstrators distributed 
leaflets announcing a studentorganized demonstration sunday to 
call for the release of jailed student activist marian munteanu 
similar demonstrations were planned in the transylvanian city of 
brasov and in the western city of timisoara the cradle of the 
revolution sources said 
munteanu was one of the leaders of the 53day university square 
demonstration students have organized demonstrations to protest 
his detention including one last week in downtown bucharest that 
drew about 20000 people 
iliescu was harshly criticized abroad for munteanus arrest and 
for calling in progovernment miners last month who 
indiscriminately beat demonstrators and passersby 
iliescu told a news conference friday that since munteanu is in 
pretrial detention prosecutors could release him with an 
appropriate motive 
as president iliescu maintained he only has the power to 
reprieve people from jail

a woman set on fire by her estranged husband 
just before she was to testify against him has won a 115 million 
judgment against prosecutors whom she charged failed to protect 
her 
however the woman will receive just 50000 the maxiumum for 
which the state could be held liable when she filed her suit since 
then the states liability has been raised to 100000 in such 
cases 
attorneys in the case said they believe it may set a national 
precedent for holding prosecutors accountable for the safety of 
witnesses they subpoena 
justice has been served ruby whylly powell said after the 
jury verdict in her favor friday but no kind of money can 
compensate me for what ive been through 
she suffered thirddegree burns over half of her body when 
jerome whylly talked her into leaving the hillsborough county 
courthouse doused her with gasoline and threw a lighted match at 
her in july 1981 
jurors deliberated more than four hours before returning a total 
judgment of 23 million but they also ruled ms powell and the 
state attorneys office shared negligence equally reducing the 
prosecutions liability to half of the award 
pamela luttonshields chief trial counsel for the state 
attorney generals office would say only that an appeal was being 
considered 
ms powell was 22 in 1981 when she was called to testify against 
her husband in a probation revocation case she was to testify that 
he burned their 6monthold son with cigarettes and beat and bit 
him 
the 1988 suit said ms powell went to prosecutors twice before 
the attack and asked for protection offering her husbands 
threatening letters as evidence in one letter he wrote best 
enjoy your time left on this earth 
the hillsborough county state attorneys office told her not to 
worry because he was safely behind bars however whylly had been 
let out of jail on his own recognizance because of an error by the 
prosecutors office ms powells attorneys contended 
the state attorney did nothing said ms powells attorney 
james d clark they could have provided her an escort the day of 
the court hearing or subpoenaed her husband at a different time 
whylly now 39 was convicted of attempted murder for the attack 
on ms powell and sentenced to 114 years in prison 
ms powell now a 31yearold divorced mother of two who works 
as a custodian has undergone dozens of operations over the past 
nine years to reduce scarring on her face arms and torso 
her oldest son now 12 refuses to live with her and moved in 
with her parents after the attack she said hes still scared of 
my face the scars and all 
but she said shes prepared to endure any more legal battles 
ive gotten this far im in it till the end

nearly thirty years ago dwight david 
eisenhower was asked by a television interviewer if he had made any 
serious mistakes during his presidency yes two said ike 
and they are both sitting on the supreme court 
earl warren is long gone but until late friday william joseph 
brennan 84 was still there staving off the conservative tilt 
that eisenhower and all republican presidents since have envisioned 
for the court 
what piqued eisenhower was that brennan like warren turned out 
to be a powerful judicial activist rather than a strict 
interpreter of the constitution even toward the end when he was 
outnumbered in the wake of ronald reagans three appointments to 
the court he still held great sway with his colleagues 
no individual has had a more profound and sustained impact 
upon public policy in the united states over the past three 
decades according to the grudging tribute of the national review 
several years ago 
his footprints are everywhere said us appeals judge abner 
j mikva his influence can be felt in nearly every area of the 
law 
in his 34 years on the bench brennan wrote more than 1200 
opinions second only to the late william o douglas among them 
are many landmark decisions on civil liberties including the one 
personone vote doctrine for apportioning state legislatures other 
decisions ordered school desegregation upheld affirmative action 
plans for minority groups struck down state aid to religious 
schools and established constitutional protections for libel 
defendants 
brennan also wrote several of the courts rulings on obscenity 
including a 1966 decision involving the 18thcentury novel fanny 
hill in which he added a new test for obscenity whether the 
material was utterly without redeeming social value 
along with justice thurgood marshall brennan believes that the 
death penalty violates the eighth amendment which bars cruel and 
unusual punishment and he consistently voted to protect condemned 
prisoners who came to the court appealing for their lives 
increasingly he was on the losing side the latest time just 
thursday night in a virginia case 
the right to dissent is one of the great and cherished 
freedoms that we enjoy by virtue of the excellent accident of our 
birth as americans he said in a speech earlier this year 
i do not mean to suggest that one has a duty or right simply 
to make noise brennan said what i am saying is that all of us 
judges lawyers students teachers factory workers bankers 
must recognize values which are so important to us that we cannot 
remain silent if and when we feel those values threatened 
while brennans service on the court has had a huge impact on 
american law his sudden retirement friday could well have a bigger 
one the courts 5 to 4 conservative majority has moved tentatively 
until now often tempering its decisions to win the swing votes of 
sandra day oconnor in some cases byron r white in others with 
president bush sure to appoint another solid conservative the 
court almost certainly will move further to the right in major 
cases including those involving abortion racial discrimination 
separation of church and state and freedom of speech 
in recent years the other side has pretty much carried the 
day brennan said in an interview in april that strikes me as 
nothing to be surprised about after all the president fills the 
vacancies 
he said then that when he did leave it would be for health 
reasons and until recently he showed little sign of slowing down 
he still arose at 5 am spent an hour on his exercycle and put in 
a full day at the court its exciting he said its 
thrilling to be here every day since the day i came 
but i think it would be so wrong to stay here unless youre 
fully able to do your job brennan said in the interview which 
was just before his 84th birthday too much rides on what we do 
around here 
brennan was a new jersey supreme court justice when he was 
appointed to the nations highest court he was confirmed by the 
senate in march 1957 with only one dissenting vote from sen 
joseph mccarthy rwis earlier brennan had compared mccarthys 
congressional hearings with the salem witchhunts 
brennan was born on april 25 1906 in newark nj the 
secondoldest of eight children his father brennan sr was an 
irish immigrant whose first job in the united states was as a coal 
shoveler in a brewery the elder brennan rose through the ranks to 
become a labor leader and served as newarks commissioner of public 
safety 
although he delivered milk in newark when he was a boy and 
handed out change in trolley cars brennan scoffed at suggestions 
his was a ragstoriches story 
im no horatio alger he once said my father paid all my 
expenses till he died then i was lucky enough to get a scholarship 
to finish harvard law 
in recent years brennan has worried most about what he 
perceives as the courts failure to uphold privacy rights in an 
interview with the new yorker he recited the fourth amendment 
verbatim the right of the people to be secure in their persons 
houses papers and effect against unreasonable searches and 
seizures shall not be violated and no warrants shall issue but 
upon probably cause supported by oath or affirmation and 
particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons 
or things to be searched 
brennan repeated the words probable cause then added 
its a high standard the framers wanted and it means that no 
search may be conducted unless the official knows of facts and 
circumstances warrant a prudent man to believe than an offense has 
been committed 
by his account the court has condoned several practices strip 
searches police dragnets random drug searches and tests that 
fail to meet that standard 
once a radio reporter playfully baited him with the question 
why do you let some of these creeps go they do such bad things 
and on some technicality you let them go 
honestly brennan said you in the media ought to be 
ashamed of your selves to call the provisions and the guarantees of 
the bill of rights technicalities theyre not theyre very 
basic to our very existence as the kind of society we are we are 
what we are because we have those guarantees and this court exists 
to see that those guarantees are faithfully enforced they are not 
technicalities 
in a speech he wrote to celebrate the 200th birthday of the 
constitution he declared that one thing the old parchment is not 
is a china doll that has to be protected from the regular world by 
a good layer of cotton wool it is a tough old soldier 
as is william joseph brennan

president bush reminisced about his 
days as a naval aviator at saturdays christening of the 
nuclearpowered aircraft carrier george washington 
things were quite different then said bush who flew as a 
carrier pilot in world war ii the planes were slower the ships 
were smaller 
and as i looked around at these admirals and some of the 
enlisted men and women i had the privilege to meet with they all 
seem younger today bush told a crowd of about 15000 at newport 
news shipbuilding 
the 357 billion george washington is the sixth nimitzclass 
carrier built at the only shipyard in the nation capable of 
building the huge warships 
the last ship named the george washington was the countrys 
first submarine capable of firing polaris missiles 
that was in 1960 we faced the dangers and uncertainities of a 
new kind of threat then the nuclear cold war defense secretary 
dick cheney said in introducing bush the submarine george 
washington helped provide the deterrence our freedom required 
calling the aircraft carriers the nations designated 
hitters cheney said the carrier george washington would help 
provide the same strength and security to maintain peace 
bush said the carriers are an indispensable element of our 
nations defense projecting power and preserving peace so 
today we must maintain a policy of peacetime engagement and armed 
forces sufficient to sustain our national interest 
we will not shrink from this responsibility bush said 
and let the george washington proclaim americas commitment to 
remain forever free 
the crowd cheered and waved flags as first lady barbara bush 
christened the ship with the traditional bottle of champagne as 
the bottle broke on the ships bow the ships sirens and horns 
sounded and four navy jets flew overhead 
construction of the 91487ton ship began in 1986 refinements 
in construction techniques have speeded the building of the nimitz 
carriers and the george washington was completed nearly two years 
faster than the first of its class 
two other nimitz carriers are under construction at the yard 
when the washington is commissioned in late 1991 the ship ill 
be home to 2800 officers and sailors another 2700 will be aboard 
when the ship adds it air wing of 85 aircraft 
the carrier measures 1040 feet from bow to stern and 1092 feet 
on its flight deck from its keel to the top of the its mast the 
ship is 244 feet high the equivalent of a 24story building 
the galley will serve 18150 meals a day the ship can travel 
more than 45 mph at full speed and its airconditioning plant can 
cool the equivalent of 2000 homes the ship has more than 900 
miles of electrical cable more than 1 million tubes transistors 
and diodes and more than 2000 telephones in its 3000 
compartments 
the ship will be able to travel 800000 miles to 1 million miles 
before its nuclear reactors need refueling 
the washington is the 26th carrier built at the yard

arab mediators contacted president saddam 
hussein on saturday in a bid to defuse his countrys dispute with 
kuwait and iraqs army newspaper hinted at military action against 
the persian gulf emirate 
the official baghdad radio said saudi arabias foreign minister 
prince saud handed saddam a letter from king fahd on 
developments in the region 
it gave no details but the saudi leader and other arab leaders 
have been making intense efforts to settle the crisis in the 
oilrich gulf region 
on tuesday saddam accused kuwait and the united arab emirates 
of flooding the oil market and driving prices down 
saddam claimed the move cost iraq 14 billion in lost oil 
revenue 
he also charged that arab states in the persian gulf were 
conspiring with the united states and israel to weaken iraqs 
economy and undermine its military buildup he warned he would 
retaliate with force if necessary 
egypts staterun middle east news agency said president hosni 
mubarak telephoned saddam on saturday in an effort to calm rising 
tensions in the region it also reported that iraqi foreign 
minister tareq aziz was expected to fly to cairo on sunday 
the iraq news agency reported that saddam also received calls 
from king hussein of jordan and president ali abdullah saleh of 
yemen 
another mediator arab league secretarygeneral chadli klibi 
met in kuwait with that countrys ruler sheik jaber alahmed 
alsabah saturday before flying to baghdad 
iraq with an army of nearly 1 million battleseasoned men has 
been amassing longrange missiles and chemical weapons since the 
ceasefire was declared in 1987 terminating hostilities in the 
eightyear persian gulf war 
iraqs official radio quoted an unidentified government 
spokesman as attacking kuwait for sending a memorandum to the un 
security council explaining its position in the dispute with iraq 
the spokesman said the move meant kuwaiti rulers have given up 
the arab option and insist on carrying out an imperialist plot 
against iraq 
kuwait and saudi arabia supported iraq during the war by 
providing interestfree loans totalling almost 35 billion 
iraq saddled with a war debt to nonarab states of 30 billion 
has demanded that arab countries write off the loans claiming that 
iraq saved the conservative gulf states from iranian fundamentalism 
saturday the army daily alqadissiya warned in a frontpage 
editorial that iraq will take action to protect its rights and 
interests 
it did not spell out what that action might be but it stressed 
iraq has emerged victorious from the fierce war and is now 
capable of standing up to this and other plots 
there were no reports from either side of any military buildup 
along the disputed frontier kuwait put its 20300member armed 
forces on alert wednesday but cancelled the alert thursday night

cloudy weather saturday threatened to 
mar the show for thousands of finnish and foreign skygazers hoping 
to glimpse a total solar eclipse in this land of the midnight sun 
the weather forecast took a turn for the worse in the evening 
when the finnish meteorological services predicted cloudy weather 
with a chance of showers for eastern finland on sunday 
in the eastern town of joensuu a television news broadcast late 
saturday showed it was already cloudy there with a light drizzle 
falling 
the solar eclipse in finland starts at 403 am sunday 903 
pm edt saturday at that time the moon will begin gradually 
moving between the earth and the sun 
the total eclipse begins at 452 am in helsinki and will last 
83 seconds after the total phase of the eclipse the moon will 
move away uncovering more and more of the sun the eclipse ends at 
545 am in helsinki 
about 10000 people including 3000 foreigners have 
converged on joensuu about 50 miles from the soviet border there 
conditions there are considered especially good for viewing the 
eclipse weather permitting 
in helsinki the total eclipse phase will occur 16 minutes after 
sunrise when the sun is only 1 degree above the horizon at 
joensuu 310 miles northeast of helsinki the sun will be 5 degrees 
above the horizon in the total phase at a better angle for watchers 
the sun rises unusually early during summer in the extreme 
northern latitudes where finland is located the sun comes up 
unusually late during winter 
ten months ago joensuu hired an eclipse secretary to handle 
arrangements for the expected influx of visitors 
but that official marjut cadia said she had underestimated the 
interest in the event 
we completely sold out the 10000 special eyeglasses we made 
for this event and our extra stock is finished too she said in 
a television interview saturday 
during the past week newspapers television and radio have been 
full of information about solar eclipses as well as advice for 
spectators not to stare directly into the sun 
some eclipse viewers wont have to worry about the clouds 
because they will be above them finnair the national airline has 
arranged a dozen special flights for eclipse watchers and private 
companies with small planes will provide more 
the eclipse will be total in an arc about 125 miles wide from 
the northern baltic sea and southeast finland across the kola 
peninsula and northeast soviet union to the aleutian islands near 
alaska 
scientists will conduct several experiments during the eclipse 
including gravity test measurements of the radius of the sun 
however scientific interest in this eclipse has been less than in 
longer eclipses such as the sevenminute eclipse seen from 
northern kenya on june 30 1973 
seppo linnaluoto of the ursa astronomical association said the 
best place for observations of this eclipse will be the northeast 
soviet union 
the last total eclipse to be seen in finland occurred in 1945

the heat is on in the henhouse but the 
flame is out 
chickens dont like to mate in high temperatures when they also 
become sluggish eaters says frank jones a poultry expert at north 
carolina state university 
that means layers arent laying as often as they do in lower 
temperatures and the birds that are supposed to gorge for slaughter 
are taking their time about it said jones and holly farms 
spokesman gordon miller 
theyre subject to a lot of the same stresses we are as 
humans jones said that means there will be less mating they 
dont really feel like eating 
turkeys react the same way to summer heat which has been in the 
90s in north carolina the nations top turkey producer and the no 
4 chicken producer the state is expected to sell more than 15 
billion worth of poultry this year 
miller said consumers may end up getting burned if the heat 
continues fewer birds could be on the market in time for 
thanksgiving and christmas and fewer eggs could drive up prices 
perdue farms inc spokesman steve mccauley doesnt believe that 
higher prices are a given 
he said friday that since the heat is an annual summer ailment 
most growers are prepared 
typically if a flock is affected its because something went 
wrong fans broke alarms didnt work mccauley said 
but one flock is a few thousand birds and perdue processes 16 
million a week and thats perdue alone so the loss of a flock or 
two would never have a significant impact on prices he said

sana yemen ap peace talks between eritrean rebels and the 
ethiopian government aimed at ending the 29yearold civil war 
failed to get off the ground saturday officials and diplomats 
reported 
foreign ministry officials speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the yemenisponsored talks were postponed until aug 15 
the officials said the talks failed because the eritreans wanted 
the united nations to organize a plebiscite in the north ethiopian 
province where they have been waging a secessionist war in the east 
african nation since 1961 
a spokesman for the ethiopian embassy in sana said the eritrean 
proposal was no problem from our side 
but he added its the united nations which rejects such 
participation because they consider the problem to be an internal 
problem as far as i know there are no relevant un 
resolutions on the issue 
earlier this year yemen played host to a first round of talks 
between the ethiopians and a group of rebel factions united under 
the banner of the eritrean liberation front 
the strongest rebel faction the eritrean peoples liberation 
front was involved in separate peace talks last year that were 
sponsored by former president jimmy carter those negotiations have 
also deadlocked 
the eritrean rebels have recently scored major successes on the 
battlefield they have captured all of eritrea except the 
provincial capital asmara which they are surrounding

the son of the late dictator benito 
mussolini asked officials saturday to remove the word fascist 
from two plaques recalling a 1980 terrorist bombing at the bologna 
train station 
the request was made after a court this week threw out the 
convictions of four people sentenced to life in prison for the 
bombing which killed 85 people 
prosecutors had described the attack as part of a neofascist 
plot to undermine italys democracy and the four were convicted of 
planting the bomb as rightwing terrorists 
in his petition to the city prefect or interior ministry 
representative vittorio mussolini asked for the removal of the 
word fascist from descriptions of the attack on plaques at the 
train station and the city hall of bologna 
the sentence pronounced in recent days by the court 
attests to the fact that the attribution on the plaques is 
unfounded and misleading and that therefore the offense is grave 
defamatory and provocative mussolini wrote in his petition 
presented by his lawyer 
he added that to fascists the bologna bombing was morally 
unacceptable and idealogically inconceivable 
there was no immediate response from the prefect bruno ciccone 
benito mussolini the first of europes fascist dictators ruled 
italy for 23 years

israel will likely launch within two weeks its 
first test of a usfunded antimissile missile the commander of 
the israeli air force said in an interview broadcast saturday 
the arrow missile is being developed with us strategic defense 
initiative funds to combat shortrange ballistic missiles the us 
program is better known as star wars 
in washington the us defense department announced friday that 
it would pay for the second phase of the arrow program 
washington provided 80 percent of the 158 million in the first 
phase of the project and israels defense ministry supplied the 
balance israel is seeking about 200 million from the united 
states for the second phase of development 
air force commander maj gen avihu bin nun speaking on israel 
radio said the arrow could be operational within five years 
when asked if the first test would be launched within two weeks 
he said this is a good assumption 
the arrow which has already undergone three simulated ground 
tests is designed to defend against ballistic missiles with a 
range of 600 miles or less 
bin nun said the arrow was needed in light of efforts by iraq 
and syria to develop chemical and nuclear warheads

about 200000 rock music fans cheered as a 
mock berlin wall came tumbling down midnight saturday at a benefit 
concert where the real divider once stood 
cyndi lauper sinead oconnor joni mitchell and other stars 
performed songs from pink floyds 1979 rock epic the wall on a 
stage flanked by the massive plasticfoam wall meant to mimic the 
dismantled berlin wall 
organizers sold 180000 tickets but finally ordered the removal 
of security fences to accommodate a huge crush of people they 
streamed onto the strip of land where trespassers during communist 
rule would have been shot instead of serenaded 
there was so many people a lot of people without tickets 
that in the end it was safer to just put the fences down said 
concert spokeswoman wendy laister she estimated the crowd at 
200000 
the 6hour concert was billed around the world as the biggest 
rock benefit ever proceeds were go to a fund for disaster victims 
but thousands of fans began streaming out before the concert 
reached its climax many complained about the poor sound system 
the difficulty most spectators had seeing the stage and the 
windwhipped cloud of dust and dirt that hovered over the 35acre 
concert site 
it wasnt good enough said corinna treitel 24 an american 
studying in berlin i can go home and turn on the tv 
the carnivallike event held on a dustchoked expanse of land 
that was once enclosed by the berlin wall began in late afternoon 
and climaxed at night with a spectacular performance of pink 
floyds 1979 rock epic the wall 
the concert was headlined by roger waters a founder of pink 
floyd who composed the wall but has since left the group 
the 600footlong and 60foot high mock wall made of 2500 
styrofoam bricks came crashing down at midnight at the concerts 
climax 
many young people east and west germans as well as foreigners 
pitched tents or sat under the stars near the concert site 
potsdamer platz a former main square of old berlin that was 
reduced to a desolate nomans land when the communists put up the 
berlin wall in 1961 
the wall around the plaza was torn down three months ago in 
anticipation of german unification 
when the concert began around 530 pm tens of thousands of 
people were crowded onto the former death strip on the east 
berlin side of the berlin wall 
i used to watch concerts like this on west german 
television said 30yearold east german angelika arnold adding 
that her countrys turn to democracy made the concert and her 
attendance possible 
there were many british and us tourists among the sprawling 
sea of relaxed fans who sat through the concert 
dave mccarthy said he rode 24 hours on a bus from manchester 
england to attend 
its pretty amazing that not too long ago they would have shot 
someone who was sitting where im sitting said the 31yearold 
banker as he sprawled on the dirt but im not sure how many 
people are into the politics its a pop concert 
tents and stands filled the grounds selling everything from 
jewelry to pepsi and wurst the day was bright and hot and 
concertgoers wore shorts and tshirts

chieftains accompanied by flutist james galway played opening 
sets before the performance of the wall began at night

the communist khmer rouge said saturday 
it is preparing to attack a major town 75 miles north of the 
cambodian capital 
the announcement came three days after the united states 
announced it was withdrawing recognition of the tripartite 
guerrilla coalition and would open talks with vietnam on ending the 
cambodian war the khmer rouge is the strongest member of the 
resistance forces 
khmer rouge radio said hundreds of civilian supporters 
including children were carrying supplies weapons and ammunition 
to guerrillas preparing to strike at kompong thom the capital of 
the central province of the same name the khmer rouge and 
noncommunist guerrillas loyal to prince norodom sihanouk have 
seized wide areas of the province in recent months in some of their 
largest gains of the 11yearold war 
the two groups are allied with son sanns khmer peoples 
national liberation front in a coalition fighting the 
vietnameseinstalled government the khmer rouge killed hundreds of 
thousands of people during its nearly fouryear rule before 
vietnams late 1978 invasion installed the current government in 
phnom penh 
in washington japanese officials said secretary of state james 
a baker iii has sought their help in trying to persuade china to 
restrain the khmer rouge a senior japanese delegation is scheduled 
to visit china next week 
us intelligence has reported that china annually gives the 
khmer rouge about 100 million in aid 
the phnom penh government on saturday urged the khmer rouge and 
china to return to peace talks 
we hope the khmer rouge and their patron in beijing will 
return to the negotiating table to resolve the cambodian problem by 
peaceful means the official spk news agency said 
as first steps it said they should cooperate with an agreement 
reached last month in tokyo to begin a ceasefire stop receiving 
foreign military aid and participate in free elections under un 
supervision 
the agreement was signed by phnom penhs prime minister hun sen 
and sihanouk the khmer rouge boycotted the tokyo talks and china 
later said it did not support the agreement 
the phnom penh government has been weakened by internal dissent 
and a drastic reduction in foreign aid from the soviet union and 
eastern europe 
the guerrillas have recently increased their attacks some khmer 
rouge officials said a truce without an overall political 
settlement would only benefit the beleaguered phnom penh government 
guerrilla leader son sann said saturday a fourparty coalition 
including prime minister hun sen should sit together in cambodias 
seat at the united nations 
he invited his guerrilla coalition partners and the prime 
minister to meet him to negotiate formation of a supreme national 
council he said the council could then occupy the un seat 
he described baker as a good friend of cambodia but said he 
had been pressured by congressmen who listen too much to 
vietnamese propaganda that the khmer rouge are bad people 
yes i know and i accept that but the vietnamese are 
worse he said in the live interview from paris on the channel 4 
tv program the world this week in britain 
under us pressure the united nations has awarded a seat to 
the cambodian resistance coalition and denied formal recognition to 
the sens government 
baker had said the united states was also changing its policy 
toward the cambodian un seat 
 
a senior administration official said the united states will no 
longer support seating a member of the resistance coalition as 
long as it includes the khmer rouge but would not support awarding 
the sen government the seat either

crews worked saturday to repair a 
helium leak that forced the postponement of the launch of an atlas 
rocket but a spokesman said the problem will be fixed in time for 
a sunday blastoff 
the rocket holds a government satellite designed to study 
earths invisible magnetic field 
the launch was scheduled for 328 pm sunday from cape 
canaveral air force station 
the leak was caused by a liquid helium vent duct used for engine 
chilldown that separated in the interstage adapter the area 
between the rocket booster and its upper stage said jack isabel a 
spokesman for rocket builder general dynamics the vent duct was 
removed and workers planned to replace it with a new one he said 
we dont know what made it separate isabel said 
we are looking forward to a launch attempt he said were 
very proud of whats out there 
the leak was not related to helium line damage in june that 
produced two small holes in the interstage adapter isabel said 
helium is needed to chill the rockets main engines and pressurize 
the main propulsion system 
the leak was detected less than an hour before liftoff friday 
afternoon as the commercial atlas 1 rocket was being fueled the 
escaping liquid helium was overchilling another chemical 
hydrazine which is used for steering the rockets upper stage 
the launch already was an hour late because of an unrelated 
problem with a compressor that furnishes gaseous nitrogen to the 
rocket to cool the combined release and radiation effects satellite 
the 189 million satellite a joint program of nasa and the 
defense department was to have been deployed in 1987 from space 
shuttle challenger the mission was put on hold after challenger 
exploded in 1986 
to ensure a quicker launch nasa and the air force had it 
redesigned to fit into the 65 million atlas 
the 2ton satellite contains 24 chemicalfilled canisters that 
will be ejected over the next year starting in september the 
released chemicals will be ionized by the suns ultraviolet rays 
and create large glowing clouds 
the clouds will spread along earths magnetic field lines 
making them visible to the naked eye

saudi arabia and china announced 
sunday that they have established full diplomatic relations it is 
the first time the islamic kingdom has recognized a communist 
nation 
in their joint statement in the saudi capital of riyadh the 
foreign ministers of both countries said that their countries will 
exchange ambassadors saudi arabia said it recognized the peoples 
republic of china as the exclusive representative of the chinese 
people 
taiwans foreign minister fredrick chien predicted the 
announcement on saturday and said the arab kingdom would end its 
relations with taipei simultaneously 
chien accused beijing of using silver bullet diplomacy to 
win saudi recognition claiming the communist government offered 
the saudis a discount of 710 million on a weapons sale worth 66 
billion that included intermediaterange ballistic missiles 
it marked the first time saudi arabia a theocratic islamic 
kingdom has recognized a communist government for years the 
saudi government has considered communism a form of atheism 
the upgrading of relations was delayed by the chinese 
prodemocracy uprising that was crushed by beijing in spring 1989 
the chinese crackdown prompted an international outcry that left 
china diplomatically isolated for many months afterward 
the communique announcing diplomatic ties was issued at 1218 
am sunday and distributed by the offical saudi news agency 
the official chinese news agency xinhua said chinese foreign 
minister qian qichen and his saudi counterpart prince saud 
alfaisal had jointly announced the decision 
the upgrading of relations is expected to smooth the way for the 
saudis to establish diplomatic relations with the soviet union 
saudi arabia has trade relations with the chinese and the 
soviets but relations with beijing improved dramatically in 1986 
when china sold the saudis longrange missiles capable of reaching 
both israel and iran 
the deal was disclosed in early 1988 both saudi arabia and 
china have said nuclear weaponry was not involved 
in taipei chien accused beijing of trying to isolate taiwan 
diplomatically and of threatening to use force against the island 
taipei newspapers reported saturday that riyadh had rejected a 
request by taipeis nationalist chinese government that the arab 
kingdom not end its formal relations with taiwan when it 
established ties with beijing 
the saudi decision drops to 27 the number of nations recognizing 
the nationalist government while 136 countries now have diplomatic 
ties with beijing 
the nationalists who lost the chinese civil war in 1949 say 
they are chinas legitimate rulers

the winner of the first william faulkner 
imitation contest gets feted here next week after besting such 
entries as as i lay dieting and the salt and the fury 
there are so many frustrated writers out there who read 
faulkner said dean faulkner wells niece of the late author who 
coordinated the first contest i think most of the people who 
entered just had a whale of a good time 
the winner saul rosenberg a new york graduate student 
penned his entry one day before the feb 1 deadline delta 
faulkner topped nearly 650 other entries in the contest 
i always do things at the last minute i just kind of sat down 
and wrote what came out rosenberg said in an interview i 
wrote it on a beatup typrewriter which faulkner would have liked 
the 26yearold london native will visit oxford miss during 
the university of mississippi faulkner and yoknapatawpha conference 
beginning july 29 and will be honored in a southern ceremony at 
faulkners home 
his winning entry was about the contest itself heres a part of 
it complete with punctuation or lack thereof 
they came that year as they had come the year before and would 
come again the year after the editors and publishers and critics 
good bad and indifferent but mostly indifferent and some just to 
say oh yes the faulkner conference i made one and even the 
representatives of an airline who had come to award a prize on the 
lawn of the stillupkept colonial mansion to that one who man woman 
or child could write as well as he could when he didnt and wise too 
not because it was easy it wasnt and not because it would do 
their airline any good it wouldnt but at least it was possible 
because heaven help anyone who thought he or she could write as 
well as he could when he did the mansion upkept still though the 
very bones of its erstwhile owner himself owner and proprietor too 
of that two thousand four hundred square miles of land more famous 
than any actual or apocryphal in the whole peopled continent which 
had held together long enough to support the spirit that produced 
the work in what agony what sweat had long since returned to the 
annealing immemorial dust 
rosenberg said the trip his first south of the masondixon 
line should be a great experience 
i think they liked mine because it was sort of a tribute to 
faulkner he said 
faulkner himself would have enjoyed the attempts of the 
contestants said his niece 
i think he would have laughed out loud its a gas she 
said its like they were just waiting for something like this to 
open up for them to play with 
among the offerings were as i lay dieting a walmart for 
jefferson and the salt and the fury 
there is such an innate compliment there that people all 
over the world would try to imitate him wells said 
faulkner winner of the nobel prize in literature died in 1962 
ive been reading faulkner for years i just thought it would 
be a shame if i didnt do to it rosenberg said he called his 
win all kind of astounding 
rosenberg who also wins a trip anywhere american airlines 
flies says he might go to hawaii but the mississippi trip isnt 
bad he says i dont know which one is the real prize 
the contest follows the nowdefunct ernest hemingway writealike 
competition the top 50 finalists which include several 
mississippians will have their work published

a woman who contends she didnt commit 
two bank holdups because another one of her seven personalities was 
in control will be allowed to present her unusual insanity defense 
a judge ruled 
juanita maxwell claims she had no way to prevent the 1988 
robberies because an alternate personality named wanda pulled 
them off and that she should be acquitted by reason of insanity 
mrs maxwell 34 used a similar defense to win acquittal in a 
1979 murder case 
circuit judge r grable stoutamires ruling friday came after 
pretrial arguments in april in which prosecutors blasted the 
defense the ruling sets the stage for a trial scheduled to begin 
july 31 
prosecutors had argued that it didnt matter whether mrs 
maxwell knew of the robberies they said what did matter was 
whether wanda knew right from wrong when she held up two first 
florida bank branches 
floridas insanity standard applies only to defendants whose 
mental problems cloud their ability to tell right from wrong if 
wanda did know right from wrong prosecutors reasoned mrs maxwell 
should not be allowed to present the insanity defense at her trial 
jurors will have to decide where criminal accountablity lies 
when seven distinct personalities claim one body experts will be 
called to explain the forces that cause a personality to fracture 
in mrs maxwells case her subconscious created numerous 
personalities in response to an abusive childhood her therapists 
have said the personalities range from the flirtatious and 
sophisticated jennifer to the protective but sometimes violent 
wanda 
mrs maxwell claims wanda turned to bank robbery so she could 
help support mrs maxwells three children in ohio 
it was wanda who bludgeoned a 73yearold fort myers woman to 
death during a squabble in 1979 over a ballpoint pen 
in that case a judge acquitted mrs maxwell of murder by reason 
of insanity and sent her to a state psychiatric hospital for 
treatment 
mrs maxwell was released in 1987 after state officials decided 
she was mentally competent

plo chairman yasser arafat came under sharp 
attack in stateowned newspapers saturday signaling a new chill in 
relations between the palestinian group and egypt 
the articles written by three of egypts top journalists 
appeared after the palestine liberation organization leader accused 
egypt of being subservient to the united states 
the criticism centers on remarks that arafat made in a speech to 
an arab league meeting last weekend in tunis tunisia 
meanwhile the plos representative in cairo told the associated 
press that arafat might call off a visit to egypt on sunday because 
of the dispute 
the visit is now being reconsidered in light of the latest 
developments said saeed kamal the plo representative referring 
to the newspaper attacks on arafat 
i do not know now if it will take place 
arafat had planned to attend a rally in cairo for the 38th 
anniversary of the coup in which the egyptian army overthrew the 
monarchy 
government sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
rift would not affect cairos support of the plo in future middle 
east peace moves 
in past regional peace efforts egypt has served as the 
principal conduit for exchanges between the plo on one hand and 
israel and the united states on the other 
the united states established its own direct dialogue with the 
plo in december 1988 after arafat renounced terrorism and 
recognized israels right to exist that dialogue was suspended by 
the bush administration last month after the plo failed to 
discipline the guerrilla group responsible for a foiled seaborne 
raid on israel 
egyptian government officials on thursday said cairo resented 
critical remarks made by arafat at the meeting of the arab league 
council in tunis 
accounts of arafats criticism of egypt at the tunis meeting 
were published in cairo newspapers thursday in what officials 
acknowledged was a government leak 
the reports said arafat lamented the absence of egyptian foreign 
minister esmat abdelmeguid at the ministeriallevel meeting 
abdelmeguid was busy in egypt at the time with a visit by syrian 
president hafez assad 
the newspaper reports said arafat suggested in his council 
speech that egypt was subservient to the united states even though 
washington was stingy in its aid to cairo while generously 
assisting israel 
on saturday columnist anis mansour wrote in the leading 
newspaper alahram that egyptians were not eager to see arafat 
and others return to cairo when the arab league moves its 
headquarters back to the egyptian capital 
mansour wrote that egyptians hate the fact that the former arab 
league building is 100 meters from the nile river because the 
distance makes it difficult for them to throw the building into 
the nile to avoid seeing your faces 
the league headquarters moved from cairo to tunis in 1979 after 
egypts membership was suspended for signing a peace treaty with 
israel last year the suspension was lifted and the headquarters 
is to move back to cairo this fall 
samir ragab board chairman of the newspaper algomhouria wrote 
a commentary accusing the plo of seeking to abort egypts 
panarab role

gov jim florio standing near new 
jerseys most polluted waterway saturday signed into law a package 
of bills designed to combat water pollution and which would 
penalize violators by up to 10 million 
the governor signed the six bills at the elizabeth marina on the 
arthur kill a shipping channel separating new jersey from new york 
city into which 40000 gallons of oil spilled wednesday 
more than 1 million gallons of oil have spilled into the kill 
and nearby kill van kull this year 
its not going to be business as usual any more said 
florio flanked by legislators who sponsored the measures these 
laws carry a very simple message you spill you pay 
assemblyman robert smith a sponsor of the one of the bills 
said there is an attitude among many corporate executives in the 
oil industry that it is cheaper to pollute than to take 
responsible preventative actions 
the executive director of the new jersey petroleum council an 
industry group issued a statement saying oil companies shared 
florios and the legislatures concern about oil spills 
many of the measures are already being implemented said 
james e benton however legislation that would impose a 10 
million fine for major spills could ultimately have a detrimental 
impact on energy supplies during periods of peak demand consumer 
prices and jobs in new jersey 
florio dismissed concerns about a loss of jobs 
the question is costs versus costs the status quo in this 
process is not cost free it costs each and every person florio 
said one of the spills resulted in parts of the jersey shore 
being closed anyone who thinks that is cost free they are 
misled 
the new laws which take effect over the next two years would 
require protective booms be placed in the water whenever there 
is a transfer of oil or hazardous liquid from ship to shore or ship 
to ship 
impose tougher standards on companies storing and transferring 
hazardous substances 
require all pipelines in new jersey to be mapped and 
registered 
mandate special lighting be in place whenever pipeline 
transfers are done at night 
the last two provisions grew out of the exxon pipeline rupture 
on jan 1 that spewed more 567000 gallons of home heating oil into 
the arthur kill a coast guard investigation concluded in part that 
the spill was so extensive because workers were pumping oil through 
the pipeline at night and could not tell it was leaking into the 
waterway 
if spills do occur the new laws also pose tougher penalties of 
up to 10 million for spills of 100000 gallons or more of a 
hazardous substance the penalties would apply to any spills that 
reach new jersey waters or lands regardless of where they 
originate 
companies would not be able to deduct the costs of cleanups or 
fines from state taxes under the new laws 
the state department of environmental protection would also be 
able to assess civil penalties directly rather than having to go 
to court to collect billable costs would be expanded to include 
the cost of restoring or replacing personal property lost income 
resulting from damage caused by a spill and the cost of repairing 
or replacing damaged and destroyed natural resources 
the previous law provided only for penalties of up to 50000 a 
day and did not take into account the size of the spill

other exhibits on the watergate investigation that led to 
nixons resignation take jabs at some nixon critics text 
accompanying part of the museums exhibit says the late sen sam 
ervin dnc who chaired the senate investigation of watergate 
suffered partisan bias 
in addition the display includes a quote accusing 
thenwashington post reporters bob woodward and carl bernstein of 
offering bribes illegally gaining access to telephone numbers 
and talking to members of the grand jury during their pulitzer 
prizewinning reporting of the story 
the display attributes the quote to an unidentified scholar 
the quote is contained in a book by stanley i kutler of the 
university of wisconsin who said friday he simply recounted what 
others had said at the time 
nixon is blaming the media and everyone else for his troubles 
while watergate was his own doing and that of his aides kutler 
told the los angeles times on friday the media simply reported 
the investigations of properly constituted legal authorities 
the library which opened to the public friday offers a 
cutdown version of the white house recording involving nixon and 
his chief of staff hr haldeman the library had said excerpts 
would be played for visitors 
nixon aide john taylor said saturday that the library isolated 
the most incriminating portions and did not edit within those 
incriminating portions 
on the june 23 1972 smoking gun tape nixon approved a 
plan to have the cia tell the fbi to drop its investigation of the 
breakin at the offices of democratic national chairman lawrence 
obrien at the watergate complex 
the librarys version of the tape offers portions of the talk 
punctuated with a narration of explanations for nixons comments 
it concludes with nixon reading a diary entry describing later 
events 
it is not a distortion taylor said the real distortion 
would be to include a transcript without narration we narrate as 
with every other exhibit he described the action as a 
documentary approach 
the full tape would have run too long taking up too much time 
for those touring the library taylor said 
an accompanying text display concedes that nixon himself has 
said he made inexcusable misjudgments during watergate 
in a museum film highlighting nixons career a narrator says 
nixon knew nothing about the watergate breakin the narrator 
concedes that some of his aides were involved in a coverup 
a grand jury named nixon an unindicted coconspirator in the 
affair and impeachment charges were filed by the house judiciary 
committee

vandals painted prochoice graffiti on a 
roman catholic church a state agency building and the capitol 
where legislators approved what could become the nations toughest 
state antiabortion law 
louisiana legislature hates women women fight back and 
women will decide their fate were among the slogans marring the 
walls of the art decostyle capitol the nearby offices of the 
department of transportation offices and st josephs cathedral 
shocked tour guides and visitors early saturday discovered the 
vandalism which was carried out overnight police said they had no 
suspects 
i nearly cried one guide said after seeing the capitol 
im very attached to this building 
church workers painted over the grafitti at st josephs the 
seat of baton rouges catholic diocese officials said workers 
would begin scrubbing the paint off the state buildings sunday 
the damage was the latest protest in louisianas abortion 
battle which has drawn thousands of people on both sides of the 
issue to the capitol for demonstrations 
the measure approved july 8 by the legislature would prohibit 
abortion except for pregnancies caused by rape or incest or to save 
the life of the mother abortionists would face fines of up to 
100000 and 10 years at hard labor 
gov buddy roemer has said he has problems with some of the 
bills provisions and will not sign it if he does not veto it 
however it would become law sept 7 
days before that bill was approved state lawmakers had sent 
roemer even tougher legislation without exceptions for pregnancies 
caused by rape or incest the governor who had demanded those 
exceptions vetoed that measure 
the current bill was rushed through both houses of the 
legislature the day before the session ended after antiabortion 
lawmakers failed to override the veto 
abortion opponents want to use the law to challenge the 1973 roe 
vs wade ruling by the us supreme court defining a womans right 
to abortion 
only the us territory of guam would have a stronger 
antiabortion measure the guam law which was passed in march 
only allows abortion to save the life of the woman and would 
penalize both the woman and the abortionist

gay and lesbian community leaders said 
saturday they have launched a letterwriting protest against 
abctvs refusal to rerun a controversialthirtysomething 
episode featuring two men in bed 
the networks entertainment president bob iger said his office 
has already received a substantial number of complaints since his 
decision to cut the provocative installment from summer repeats was 
reported in thursdays los angeles times 
iger said he pulled the show from the networks summer schedule 
solely for economic reasons 
fifty percent of thirtysomething advertisers pulled their 
commercials from the episodes first run last season iger said 
costing the network more than 1 million 
in my opinion i am not sending any kind of a signal he 
said saturday following a news conference with television critics 
it was a very very hard business decision that i made 
gay and lesbian activists called it cowardice 
this knuckling under says we should be made invisible again 
said michael shere a los angeles board member of the national gay 
amp lesbian alliance against defamation which gave abc an award last 
season for the program it now refuses to repeat 
there are far too few examples of gays and lesbians in films 
or television that shows them as something other than criminals or 
buffoons shere said 
the episode in question showed a homosexual couple in bed 
talking about friends who had died from aids the two men did not 
touch 
abc executives said saturday they did not know which advertisers 
had boycotted the program 
capital citiesabc inc president daniel burke said during 
saturdays news conference that abc could not afford another loss 
of that size its very difficult to run a network through the 
summer with a 600000 or 700000 deficit he said 
i guess our position is that weve already run it once said 
john sias executive vice president of capital cities abcs parent 
company 
los angeles county human relations commissioner morris kight 
called the networks position a peculiar form of cowardice 
its a fact that a significant number of men go to bed with 
men in this country said kight a longtime activist for 
homosexual rights were all very sorry that theyve made this 
decision 
kight and shere said homosexual rights advocates from several 
national organizations are sending letters and telegrams to abc 
parents and friends of gays and lesbians also will join the 
campaign said the groups los angeles chapter president adele 
starr 
this shows the small minority out there who are very 
homophobic and mean and hateful that they can control what goes on 
television at a time when people are becoming more enlightened 
starr said 
iger said the whole incident was unfortunate 
im not saying i will never repeat this episode again he 
added its only for this summer we have not once deterred our 
creative community from what could be a sensitive issue to 
advertisers

connecticut republicans convinced they 
can win the governors office for the first time in two decades 
nominated us rep john g rowland as their candidate saturday 
rowlands forces persuaded opponents of his choices for the rest 
of the slate to drop out allowing the gop to end its convention 
with one team and no september primaries pending unlike the 
democrats who have a primary for governor and possibly two other 
spots 
our party is united and that unity of spirit and that unity 
of purpose is vital this year rowland said in his acceptance 
speech 
we are at a turning point in our great state everyone in this 
room knows that its been 20 years since a republican last won the 
governors chair he said an entire generation has grown 
up knowing nothing but the ruinous rule of one arrogant dominant 
party 
the 33yearold congressman from waterbury who began his quest 
for the nomination in october and who at one point faced three 
rivals was unopposed at the convention and was nominated by 
acclamation 
in a state where democrats outnumber republicans 32 rowland 
needs democratic support if hes to have a chance at winning in 
november the democrats have had the governors office for 32 of 
the last 36 years the last time a republican won was in 1970 
rowland who for the past six years has represented a 
traditionally democratic bluecollar district in congress has 
moved to broaden his appeal among democrats by putting one on his 
ticket 
rowlands choice of former democratic state treasurer joan r 
kemler for treasurer was endorsed by the convention kemler changed 
her party affiliation to republican this week 
rowlands nomination touched off a long and loud demonstration 
on the convention floor with hundreds of delegates shaking cow 
bells rattling new years eve noisemakers and popping red white 
and blue balloons as they dropped from the ceiling of the hartford 
civic center 
in november rowland will face independent gubernatorial 
candidate lowell p weicker jr a former republican us senator 
and the winner of the democratic primary between us rep bruce a 
morrison the endorsed candidate and state rep william j cibes 
jr 
since weicker announced his candidacy in march he has 
maintained a commanding lead in the polls far ahead of rowland 
who is just slightly ahead of morrison a fourterm congressman 
from hamden 
but rowland shrugs off the polls attributing weickers lead 
only to his high name recognition after two decades as a statewide 
political figure 
most observers including weicker expect the race to tighten up 
as the election approaches rowland said he expects weicker and 
morrison to split the liberal vote while moderates and 
conservatives turn to him

about 1500 logging protesters 
closely watched by police in riot gear marched along main street 
to protest logging practices and were greeted by jeers obscene 
gestures and occasional cheers from onlookers 
on the other side of this small sawmill town 130 miles north of 
san francisco a more relaxed group of officers watched about 1000 
timber industry supporters hold a rival parade and rally against a 
forest protection measure on californias november ballot 
in the second major event of redwood summer a series of 
protests against logging practices modeled after the freedom 
summer civil rights protests in the south demonstrators rallied 
for nearly two hours at a main intersection while police kept away 
a crowd of some 200 angry opponents 
some onlookers shouted go home and made obscene gestures 
the marchers shouted back we are home we are home 
police said they arrested two onlookers for investigation of 
obstructing officers and resisting arrest 
after listening to folk songs and speakers the demonstrators 
marched six blocks back to a timber company field on the north side 
of town where theyd rallied saturday morning 
about 300 officers from various jurisdictions were in this 
mendocino county town of 6100 to maintain order but there was 
little trouble 
rally organizers said theyd gotten their message across to this 
community of 6100 and called off plans to stage acts of civil 
disobedience 
pam davis of the militant earth first environmental group one 
of redwood summers sponsors urged the crowd to remain nonviolent 
and avoid clashes with police and loggers 
among the protesters concerns are the cutting of ancient 
redwood forests overcutting of forests in general and the shipping 
of unprocessed logs overseas 
organizers invited opponents to address the marchers one man 
who identified himself as a timber industry worker said we are 
not ruining our community and our trees we are growing more 
trees than we are taking out 
but a mill worker from oregon and a former logger from fort 
bragg warned that the timber industry was using up the forests 
stop clear cutting and do selective cutting thats the 
reasonable way to do it said duane potter 36 who said he quit 
his job as a logger to protest timber company practices 
the morning rally was held by permission in a field owned by 
georgiapacific corp which operates two sawmills and two other 
woodprocessing plants here and has thousands of acres of 
timberland in the area 
on friday 17 people taking part in an earth first protest 
elsewhere in mendocino county were taken into custody for allegedly 
trespassing on property of the louisianapacific timber company 
bringing to 38 the number of arrests in three days of 
demonstrations 
fortytwo people were arrested at a rally last month near eureka 
george parsons who owns a machine shop in fort bragg said he 
attended saturdays redwood summer protest because they are 
cutting the forests away so fast something has to be done 
parsons said he used to work in the woods and is sympathetic to 
timber workers 
but the big timber companies are trying to polarize the 
community so they can go out and take as much as remains of our 
forests as they can he said 
if they companies were so concerned about the workers they 
would not be sending logs to mexico to be milled he added 
but on the other side of town hundreds of people most wearing 
yellow tshirts reading timber families an endangered 
species marched to the prologging rally 
marchers chanted families first and its ok to be a 
logger some carried signs reading save daddys job 
the proposition 130 ballot measure would authorize the sale of 
742 million worth of state bonds to buy and preserve certain old 
growth forests it also includes language that would restrict 
clearcutting limit logging near waterways and require 
sustainedyield logging practices 
supporters say the initiative would protect californias 
forests critics claim it would cost thousands of logging jobs 
the proindustry rally was intended to help kick off a campaign 
against proposition 130 said one of the organizers maribelle 
anderson of the community solidarity coalition

congress to study health insurance problems will recommend that 
the federal government pay basic medicare costs for the 35 million 
elderly people whose income is below the poverty line about 
6000 for an individual according to a published report 
the panel also will recommend that the government help pay 
medicare costs for an additional 82 million elderly people whose 
incomes are up to twice the poverty level the washington post 
reported in sundays editions 
those and other recommendations adopted by the panel friday 
would cost the government about 28 billion a year the paper said 
medicare is the health care program for the elderly and costs 
each recipient 343 a year in premiums if they are enrolled in the 
part of the program that pays a portion of outofhospital 
expenses in addition beneficiaries must pay the first 592 for 
each hospital stay and a portion of hospital stays that extend 
beyond 60 days 
the commission is headed by sen john d rockefeller iv 
dwva and named for the late rep claude pepper dfla

care for the elderly and suggested that all employers be required 
to provide policies to workers or contribute to a government backup 
plan for those not covered through their jobs 
an estimated 31 million americans have no health insurance 
the post said 12 of the 15 commission members have agreed to the 
medicare proposals for the poor elderly the paper said the panel 
did not hold a formal meeting but that the proposals were 
circulated to the members who responded with their approval or 
disapproval

peace talks in el salvadors 
decadelong civil war foundered saturday over rebel demands that 
the government pare down its military force and purge some 
rightwing officers 
little progress has been reported since the two sides reopened 
talks on friday the current round of talks are scheduled to end 
tuesday 
leftist rebels said the conservative government of president 
alfredo cristiani had so far failed to satisfy their demands for 
major reforms of the military 
un mediator alvaro desoto said he still hopes that this round 
of talks could still result in agreements on some political issues 
were waiting to see how the negotiations pan out desoto 
told a news conference 
but he cautioned that no action can be expected on the political 
topics unless the key issue of the military is settled 
we have been working on the subject of the armed forces but 
there will be no advances unless accords are reached in that 
regard he said 
representatives of the guerrilla farabundo marti national 
liberation front or fmln insist that the military should be 
reduced in size and purged of rightwing officers responsible for 
human rights violations the rebels also want a say in the 
appointment of the defense minister and commanderinchief 
fmln representative miguel saenz said the latest government 
proposal did not go far enough 
the government has made us a counter proposal but we feel it 
doesnt satisfy our aspirations because it only covers secondary 
themes saenz said 
this is the third round of negotiations since cristianis 
rightist government took office in june 1988 
in el salvador cristiani indicated he rejected some of the 
guerrilla demands because they challenged the existence of the 
armed forces and could be considered unconstitutional 
we can speak of their the armed forces qualitative and 
quantitative structure cristiani said but their existence is 
not on the negotiating table 
we cannot get away from our laws especially our fundamental 
law which is the constitution of the republic he added 
cristiani spoke briefly with reporters after opening a sports 
event in san salvador the capital 
the salvadoran armed forces with about 54000 members is the 
second largest in central america nicaragua has the largest armed 
forces but the new usbacked government in managua has announced 
it plans to cut the size of the military as part of a peace 
agreement to end that countrys civil war 
the current salvadoran talks are being held under the threat of 
a new guerrilla offensive if no progress is made 
the united states has been supporting a succession of 
governments during the decadeold salvadoran civil war in which 
more than 72000 people have been killed

weve got a little bit of hunt mania pate said we got 
somebody that just paid 150 for a tea kettle that had a kmart 
sticker for 1995 on the bottom it beats the hell out of me 
pate said a buyer paid 9000 for a persian rug that was 
probably 30 years old

with black and white cowhide on the seat and back went for 3000 
a bronze statue of a mare and foal by french artist pj mene

attention an elaborately carved chippendale hall table sold for 
4000 
its new owner jack kent of new orleans said it would remind 
him that wealth doesnt always last forever

hunt and brother william herbert hunt heirs to an oil fortune 
lost more than 15 billion in an alleged attempt to corner the 
silver market a decade ago and sought bankruptcy court 
reorganization protection 
the dallas businessmen were ordered to sell off their antique 
collections and some personal possessions to pay their creditors 
the biggest of which is the internal revenue service 
eighty percent of the money raised saturday will go to the irs

at least one hunt relative was at the auction saturday and he 
said he was disappointed the personal items were being sold 
this is really unpleasant its unfortunate said houston 
hunt nelson hunts son but there are a lot of nice things out 
here its nice that people are getting to take this stuff home 
rather than just having it sit someplace else

were horse nuts she said 
nearby sat a bronze bust of nelson hunt 
i suspect some family members will be after this one said 
jim gall chairman of the miamibased auction company of america 
which conducted the auction 
officials said some of the oilmans children and wealthy friends 
were expected to buy some of the items with the intention of 
returning them once the bankruptcy proceedings are finished 
but pate said later it did not appear that relatives or friends 
were doing much of the buying 
bebe sternberg of dallas came out to the auction out of 
curiosity this is all a part of history you hear so much about 
how the hunts lived and how the rich live 
i dont think they lived any different than the poor she 
said pointing to an old plaid green and white couch and other 
household items those will make good flea market items

about 500 supermarket workers in the 
portland area went on strike saturday over a pay dispute and their 
union encouraged 5500 fellow workers to stay on the job to avoid 
disrupting shopping 
grocery owners in the fivecounty area threatened to lock out 
all 6000 workers sunday and hire replacements 
members of the united food amp commercial union which represents 
about 4800 grocery clerks 600 meat cutters and 600 delicatessen 
and bakery workers voted overwhelmingly to take strike action 
said union spokesman rick sawyer 
the union targeted kienows 13 supermarkets where about 500 
employees walked out the union was giving the public the ability 
to continue shopping at other major stores and still not cross 
picket lines sawyer said 
steve erdmann a spokesman for the grocery stores said 
management will lock out all 6000 workers rather than put one 
chain at an economic disadvantage management also wants all union 
members to bear the burden of lost pay while the strike continues 
he said 
health care has been the major issue during contract talks with 
the union pressing for employers to continue paying the full cost 
of benefits and the employers pressing employees to pay part of the 
benefits 
the unions previous threeyear contract was expiring at 
midnight saturday 
the workers who have not had a pay increase since 1986 also 
are seeking higher wage increases 
erdmann said management offered a 115anhour raise for the 
clerks over a fouryear contract journeymen clerks now make 1105 
an hour 
the offer amounted to a 2 percent increase a year which is 
far below the projected rate of inflation sawyer said

the arrest of a woman who used the mens room at 
a concert when she couldnt get into the womens room has generated 
a groundswell of support 
its obviously hit a nerve with a lot of women around town 
denise wells said friday 
ms wells was arrested july 7 at a george strait concert she 
received a ticket that could cost her 200 for violating a city 
ordinance that forbids members of one sex from using restrooms 
reserved for the other the legal secretary also was kicked out of 
the concert which she paid 125 to attend 
a second woman was arrested at the same time 
the houston post published ms wells story thursday and the 
phone started ringing 
weve had people call that want to pay our fine ms wells 
said i had a call from a woman who wanted to know who she could 
call in city hall 
houston radio station kfmk told ms wells it would pay any fine 
the reason is because she is a listener and when youve got to 
go youve got to go said kfmk program director bob wood 
another radio station told ms wells it would pay for her trip 
to straits next area concert and provide her with a personal 
portable toilet to use during the show 
we just felt like she had gone through an awful lot of hassle 
to see george strait and we wanted to make it a little easier for 
her the next time he came to town said kikk general manager 
craig magee 
ms wells said she went to use the womens restroom during the 
opening act but the line was long and she decided to try later 
she did so about 20 minutes into straits performance only to find 
the line longer 
the mens room would never be my first choice she said 
but i just could not you know it became kind of urgent and i 
saw a guy take his girlfriend in in front of me i saw them go in 
and i thought hes gonna run interference for her so she 
followed them 
a police officer arrested both women as they emerged 
ms wells sister valerie davenport will represent her at the 
nov 1 hearing 
my lawyer says necessity should be all the defense i need but 
the way the city ordinance reads it says that its illegal to 
enter the restroom of the opposite sex with intent to cause a 
disturbance or something like that and obviously that was not my 
intent ms wells said

a state judge ruled that developer donald trump 
must answer questions under oath for his estranged wifes lawyers 
about his relationship with marla maples 
the ruling thursday by judge phyllis gangeljacob was the latest 
development in the fight between trump and his wife ivana over a 
prenuptial agreement the couple signed christmas eve 1987 
mrs trump wants the agreement nullified so she can try to get 
up to half her husbands assets in any possible divorce action 
trump says his wife is entitled only to 25 million and any 
other property specified in the agreement according to trumps 
attorney jay goldberg 
mrs trumps attorney michael kennedy charged that the 
prenuptial agreement was fraudulently obtained he said trump 
pledged his love to his wife while having an affair with another 
woman 
in 1986 donald had mentioned that he thought open marriage 
might be interesting but that he knew i was too oldfashioned a 
girl to ever tolerate any other sexual relationship or affair 
mrs trump said in an affidavit he did not tell me that he was 
seeing another woman and having an affair with her 
mrs trump also says in court papers that had she been aware of 
her husbands adultery and philandering she would not have 
entered into the prenuptial agreement and would have consulted a 
lawyer 
trump says love and affection were not material to the 1987 
agreement although those were mentioned in the first version 
signed in 1984 
i find that there are possible concealments by trump which 
should be determined at trial gangeljacob wrote in her decision 
if the court finds that trump updated the agreement without 
intending to live up to its terms then the court could nullify it 
gangeljacob also ruled that nothing trump did after the 1987 
agreement was signed is relevant to the case 
trump reportedly gave depositions in the case earlier this week

the radisson hotel people are shipping in the 
furniture computers and facsimile machines in preparation for the 
fall opening of the first americanmanaged hotel in the soviet 
union 
the radisson slavjanskaya a 430room enterprise connected to a 
165suite business center is a challenge like none other for 
radisson a unit of the 62 billion annual revenues carlson 
companies of minneapolis 
theres nothing like it in moscow where a modern hospitality 
industry just doesnt exist often to the dismay of american and 
other foreign business people services arent available even the 
concept of service is dead 
equipping the operation with american television communications 
modems laser printers phone lines video conferencing gear and 
the like tough as it will be isnt the real challenge radisson 
has done that all over the world 
the main challenge faced before only by mcdonalds is to find 
soviet workers and motivate them to say yes i can a radisson 
slogan when a more tradiitional soviet response has been to say 
no i cant 
radissons venture is a joint one with intourist the 
wellstaffed soviet foreign tourism ministry which built the 
structure but none of the workers will be hired from it 
we want young friendly people people inclined toward 
helping others said juergen bartels who heads the carlson 
hospitality group a 22 billion enterprise including radisson 
within the carlson companies 
we will look for nurses and teachers he continues we 
will not be hiring any of the hotel and restaurant people of 
moscow to do so would mean debriefing them teaching from 
scratch is tough enough he suggested 
the entire operation says bartels a perfectionist who worked 
his way up through european and north american hotels rises or 
falls with the quality of the people his staff he said will 
choose train motivate and rate them 
how do you do it can you find the type of workers you seek 
well mcdonalds did it bartels went straight to them with a list 
of 132 questions to which they had answers for all but four 
but selling burgers and fries is simpler than operating an 
internationalstandard hotel with services ranging from shoeshines 
and haircuts to banquets and secretarial services it means 
training doormen telephone operators maids reservations clerks 
waiters drivers cooks and kitchen help 
bartels and his crew plan to employ 30 fulltime foreigners 
americans included and bring in 20 others temporarily from 
radisson operations during the first weeks each foreigner will be 
understudied by one or two soviets 
the training begins with a clean slate which can be both 
opportunity and frustration trainees will have few bad habits to 
unlearn but they will have to be taught the most rudimentary 
technical skills of the trade 
unlike other radissons in which full services are offered from 
day one the slavjanskaya will develop gradually designed for four 
restaurants it will begin with a buffet operation and gradually 
work up to full banquet facilities the process will be both a 
learning and teaching experience 
as the novices theyll begin with little more than the right 
attitude learn the technical side of their jobs the hotel will 
become complete and efficient it is expected to reach 
international standards within a year 
when bartels sets a standard it is achieved partly because 
standards he sets for himself are higher his belief that what is 
best today can be improved tomorrow is almost spiritual people 
want to do better he says 
to achieve worldclass standards the slavjanskayas employees 
and services will be rated by guests on a scale of one to 10 we 
may have to discharge some workers bartels says if average is 
seven we expect nine 
based on their ratings employees will earn points toward 
rewards western goods says bartels jeans cigarettes

as marriages to family members become 
more common in the united states scientists are unprepared to 
offer counseling about the likelihood of genetic disorders a 
university of michigan researcher said 
id been brought up to believe that inbreeding was pretty 
nasty said alan bittles a geneticist who has spent 10 years 
researching interfamily marriages in pakistan and india we never 
consider that in other parts of the world its perfectly normal to 
marry a cousin 
bittles said he has determined that 500 million people worldwide 
are married to relatives typically uncles and nieces or first or 
second cousins he reached that total he said by combining his 
own research in pakistan and india with information compiled by 
other researchers 
all those have got to be rockbottom low estimates because 
were missing information from so many parts of the world he 
said 
such marriages are becoming more common in the united states 
because people from interfamily marriages are moving to this 
country and then continuing the custom bittles mentioned lebanese 
palestinians and north africans as being groups practicing 
interfamily marriage who are moving to the united states in 
substantial numbers 
although there are fewer genetic disorders among children born 
to married family members than westerners believe scientists have 
made few studies of those problems and have little information

debtfinanced takeover king henry kravis may 
have rejuvenated some respect from rjr nabisco co junk bondholders 
with his firms announcement it would buy back 3 billion worth of 
the highrisk securities 
kohlberg kravis roberts amp cos public announcement of the 
buyback plan immediately lifted the prices of rjr bonds and thereby 
made owners of those securities wealthier 
it also scuttled any chance for kohlberg kravis which bought 
the foodtobacco giant last year in a record 2453 billion 
leveraged buyout to repurchase the bonds cheaply and get a huge 
bargain in retiring some big debts its his way of making peace 
with the highyield community said paul getman a bond market 
analyst with regional financial associates inc in west chester 
pa it was a smart moral thing to do 
managers that handle large funds with investments in junk bonds 
have been losing confidence in kohlberg kravis which helped 
popularize the leveraged buyout in the 1980s and won recognition as 
the leader in the field 
if kravis general partner in the firm and mastermind of the rjr 
lbo had repurchased the bonds quietly behind the backs of 
investors he stood to further alienate money managers already 
skittish over several kkrarranged lbos that encountered trouble 
late last year he probably couldnt have gotten away with a quiet 
buyback anyway because of the size of the repurchase 
junkbond fund managers who arent confident in a dealmaker can 
make life difficult by pushing for higher interest rates on these 
securities or staying away from the bonds altogether 
if kravis plans to arrange another buyout using junk bonds hes 
going to need the support of those money managers 
another bond analyst agrees that kravis had his reputation in 
mind when deciding to go public with the rjr bond repurchase 
one of their marketing pitches is simple we dont mess 
around with bondholders give us 100 cents and well do everything 
in our power to give you 100 cents said dirk m van doren of 
mccarthy crisanti maffei in montpelier vt 
kkr wanted to maintain its reputation kkr may believe more 
deals are coming down the pike van doren said 
rjr announced last monday the details of a refinancing aimed at 
retiring more than 3 billion in bonds from two issues that totaled 
7 billion in the days following the announcement prices of the 
two bonds one due in 2007 and the other in 2009 rose about 10 
percent 
the bonds represented some of the most expensive debt in the rjr 
buyout they are known as reset bonds because their interest rates 
are periodically recalculated retiring these bonds would eliminate 
the cost of periodically promising higher rates to make up for 
price losses in the market 
a survey getman conducted in march during the depths of the 
junk bond markets slump showed people thought kkr was becoming 
less prominent he said 
the survey asked 100 largefund managers bond issuers and 
academics to list three firms and indicate whether they would 
decline in importance increase in importance or stay the same 
most of the 35 who responded to the survey listed kkr as the one in 
decline 
the respondents said kkr was losing luster because several of 
its buyouts were having trouble most notably hillsborough holdings 
inc which sought bankruptcy court protection from creditors late 
last year 
two other deals hit rough times in late 1989 seaman furniture 
co a retailer was not able to meet debt payments bondholders 
agreed to reschedule the debt payments sci television inc faced 
resistance from bondholders on a bond exchange offer 
now that kkr has made its repurchase public bondholders cant 
say they got a raw deal from the firm van doren said 
they kkr feel thats valuable to be honest in this 
business its very valuable he said

blue jeans for generations the uniform of rebels 
and conformists alike are fading from the fashion forefront as 
aging baby boomers opt for new and more flattering looks 
to put it bluntly as their pocketbooks have gotten thicker 
so have their waists said alan millstein publisher of the new 
yorkbased newsletter fashion network report 
jeans millstein says dont fit the lives of the 
thirtysomething generation which is starting to confront the flab 
of middle age and facing the fact that gravity is the reality 
the biggest fans of jeans traditionally tightfitting 
youthoriented fare are those between the ages of 14 and 24 a 
segment of the population that has been shrinking for the past 
decade said dan chew marketing manager for levi strauss amp co 
headquartered in san francisco 
jeanswear communications a new yorkbased fashion industry 
group said in a study released last month that total domestic 
jeans sales have dropped from a 1981 peak of 502 million pairs to 
387 million pairs in 1989 
deborah bronston an analyst at prudentialbache securities 
inc estimates the number of jeans sold declined by 6 percent 
during the first three months of this year alone 
the decline of jeans has forced manufacturers to scramble for 
ways to protect their domain often with products ranging from 
childrens sweat gear to sexy lingerie they have met with varying 
degrees of success some have been wounded because they responded 
to changing tastes too late 
vf corp a wyomissing pa jeans maker that markets lee and 
wrangler brands and holds about 25 percent of the us market 
recently announced it will close four jeans factories by september 
the costs of that cutback will be reflected in the companys 
secondquarter financial report and probably result in a 50 percent 
earnings decline from a year earlier vg chairman lawrence r pugh 
said he blamed a continuing shortfall in jeans orders resulting 
from weak consumer demand 
levi strauss on the other hand is riding high it has 
dramatically improved sales and profitability since becoming a 
private company five years ago in a debtfinanced takeover the 
improvement has come from much more than just sales of the 501 its 
classic 5pocketed blue jeans 
levis created dockers a cotton twill pant for maturing 
babyboom men as one of retailings brightest success stories 
sales of dockers went from 35 million in 1986 to a projected 500 
millionplus this year the product line has been expanded to 
include mens shirts and sweats as well as active wear for women 
and children 
dockers have helped offset the basic softness in mens 
jeans chew said 
levi strauss also has strengthened its jean business by offering 
a range of styles and fits for baby boomers who may have lost 
their physiques but not their desire for denim chew said that 
strategy has helped preserve the companys market for men over 25 
for vf however diversification has been far rockier the 
company purchased a north carolina maker of mens cotton twill 
pants in 1984 but closed the unit two years later to focus on its 
acquisition of blue bell holding co parent of wrangler jeans 
jantzen swimwear and jansport sports clothes 
the move shoved vf ahead of levi as the nations biggest jeans 
maker when jeans are booming every age group is wearing them 
said vf chief financial officer jerry johnson but these days he 
said theres a lack of fashionability attached to the product 
this year vf has introduced a line of tshirts and sweats under 
the lee label in an effort to exploit its best brand name so far 
sales are going very well johnson said and the sweatshirts 
have sold out 
still the company hopes to reduce dependence on jeans partly 
by strengthening its intimate apparel offerings vf which sells 
vanity fair and lollipop brands purchased the lingerie concern 
vassarette for 12 million earlier this year 
johnson said vf foresees growth of 10 percent annually in 
intimate apparel and is seeking to acquire additional brands or 
trademarks in that area 
analyst bronston predicted intimate apparel will account for 15 
percent of vfs estimated 1991 sales of 273 billion up from the 
current 13 percent while jeans will bring in 53 percent of annual 
revenue down from the current 55 percent 
many experts said jeans makers are hoping to strengthen their 
dungaree business by exporting while interest may be waning in the 
united states jeans still retain considerable allure in the soviet 
union parts of europe and in the far east 
levis chew said last year international sales accounted for 
roughly a third of the companys 36 billion in revenue up from 
about 20 percent from five years ago 
but levis strategists also say the us market cant be 
ignored the average american teenager still buys four to six 
pairs of jeans a year so levis is spending heavily on a fresh 
advertising campaign directed by and featuring spike lee acclaimed 
director of do the right thing 
designer jeans from calvin klein gloria vanderbilt and others 
are partly responsible for expanding the acceptance of blue jeans 
as appropriate dress for many occasions but even at their peak in 
1984 designer products accounted for less than 4 percent of the 
total blue jean market levis chew said 
nonetheless some designer labels have managed to adapt to a 
changing marketplace guess inc for example which sells a basic 
56 3zip jean one zipper on the fly one on each ankle because 
the pants are so tight continues to drum up interest in its 
broader array of clothes 
expensive skintight jeans were the cornerstone product when 
guess was founded in 1981 but the company now sells everything 
from miniskirts and suede cowboy shoes to fragrances and eyewear in 
an effort to capture the customer who has needs other than 
denim said spokeswoman leah levy 
the company is pushing its new georges marciano line of career 
clothes for women which appear in standalone boutiques in several 
major department stores 
still guess derives about 80 percent of its estimated 400 
million in annual sales from the denim collection rather than 
allow its fortunes to rest on a single jean design guess 
continues to push ahead 
this fall the silhouette of guess jeans change dramatically 
from excruciatingly tight to very baggy antifit pants levy 
said part of the reasoning behind the shift is that todays jeans 
dont have to fit

whether its antifat health consciousness or the popularity of 
fast food for some reason the blt seems to be losing stature as an 
icon of the american summer sandwich scene 
at least thats what theyre theorizing in the pork belly pits 
where futures prices have slumped from a slack demand for bacon 
bacon manufacturers rely on the blt effect an increased 
consumer appetite for baconlettuceandtomato sandwiches to 
boost sales during the summer to a seasonal peak 
bacon is made from pork bellies the supply of fresh pork 
bellies usually falls short of demand during the summer so slicers 
supplement their purchases of fresh bellies with frozen bellies 
that have been socked away in anticipation of the summertime demand 
surge 
demand has been so weak this month though that the supply of 
fresh supplies has been more than enough to keep the pipeline full 
analysts say the result has been a sharp drop in prices of both 
fresh and frozen bellies 
thomas morgan president of sterling research corp in arlington 
heights ill said fresh belly prices on the cash market have 
tumbled from 62 cents a pound on july 5 to as low as 435 cents 
last week a decline of about 30 percent 
during the same period the price of frozen bellies for july 
delivery on the chicago mercantile exchange dropped from 56 cents 
to 459 cents a pound an 18 percent decline 
for belly traders the plunge in freshbelly prices below the 
frozenbelly futures contract price was a particularly bearish 
signal 
frozen belly prices normally average about 5 cents less than 
fresh prices in midsummer which provides an incentive for slicers 
to use the frozen stocks 
you need the cash market to be anywhere from 3 cents to 4 
cents premium to futures to entice processers to draw out of the 
freezer said paul georgy president of allendale inc a futures 
brokerage in crystal lake ill 
this should be peak demand time for the bellies in general 
he said but the demand is slow enough that theyre barely using 
the fresh bellies so theres no incentive for them to pull bellies 
out of the freezer 
on friday the agriculture department released a monthly 
coldstorage report that was expected to prompt renewed selling of 
belly futures on monday 
the report showed 881 million pounds of frozen pork bellies on 
hand as of june 30 about 18 million pounds more than the market 
had expected the amount compares with 1055 million pounds a month 
earlier and 1267 million pounds a year ago 
the situation may be troublesome to pork producers but shouldnt 
last long 
georgy pointed out that a recent government report indicated the 
nations hog herd has shrunk since last year which should reduce 
the number of bellies going into cold storage in the second half of 
the year 
morgan said he expects a price rebound 
sooner or later the markets going to get cheap enough that 
some of the users will say hey im going to take those and the 
supermarkets will say say hey i can make money featuring bacon 
at these prices morgan said 
at the rate this market is dropping its not going to take 
too long to get there he said at least its going to bottom 
out and we might go soaring up for a couple of days

now that the federal reserve has changed its 
credit policy and the stock market has climbed to new record highs 
what do wall street analysts see in the economic outlook 
sluggish erratic growth the same as before 
amid all the headlines coming out of washington and the wall 
street markets of late most economic forecasters have found little 
reason to expect any big difference in the pattern of economic 
activity that has prevailed for months 
true stockmarket investors have reacted enthusiastically to 
the federal reserves actions at midjuly to relax its credit 
policy 
in a move tipped off in advance by alan greenspan the feds 
chairman the central bank took steps to lower the interest rate on 
federal funds or overnight loans between banks from 8 percent to 
8 percent 
but the stated intent of that shift was not to stimulate 
business activity but rather to offset a de facto tightening of 
credit brought about by increasingly stringent loan standards at 
many banks 
i doubt that investors will be able to build a case that the 
economy will respond very significantly to this move or even to 
further moves to lower interest rates said greg smith 
investment strategist at prudentialbache securities 
i think the feds moves would have to be much more dramatic or 
much more frequent than i anticipate to convince investors that 
much better economic times are ahead 
when the government reports this coming friday on the growth of 
the gross national product in the second quarter of the year 
analysts take it as a given that the figures will be anemic 
the us economy remains in a sluggish state says the 
merrill lynch market letter in its current issue 
we estimate growth the june quarter was a lackluster 13 
percent and we think increases of less than 2 percent are likely 
over the next few quarters 
such assessments helped blunt the stock markets rally in the 
past week the dow jones average of 30 industrials closed friday at 
296114 down 1906 from the week before 
the new york stock exchange composite index fell 268 to 19765 
the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market tumbled 
1317 to 45527 and the american stock exchange market value index 
was down 354 at 36045 
volume on the big board averaged 16696 million shares a day 
against 17127 million the week before 
whatever the fed is up to many analysts believe consumer 
spending a primary factor setting the course of the economy is 
likely to remain subdued at best 
looking beyond the erratic and often revised monthly changes 
in retail sales recent underlying trends have been disappointing 
and should remain so said maury harris economist at painewebber 
inc 
purchasing power is waning with softer labor markets consumer 
confidence a leading indicator also is waning 
the likely continued weakness in home sales will reduce 
purchases of home furniture and furnishings spending at 
restaurants and bars a key indicator of discretionary consumer 
spending has been down for four straight months 
nevertheless a good many analysts believe the strength of the 
stock market signals that the banking problems worrying the fed 
will not lead to a recession 
the outlook for the balance of 1990 looks simply to be more of 
the same said david resler economist at nomura securities 
international in new york the economy will continue to expand 
but at a lackluster pace that is well below its potential

the nations defense industry is struggling 
no surprise there but some of the reasons have little to do with 
the thaw in the cold war and cutbacks at the pentagon 
the bad news this past week from some of the nations largest 
defense contractors can be traced back to things that have been 
going on a lot longer than the dismantling of the berlin wall 
stock analysts said 
mcdonnell douglas corp announced a drastic costcutting 
campaign that will lay off thousands general dynamics corp 
announced a heavy secondquarter loss and grumman corps head 
resigned abruptly amid reports he was under investigation for 
possibly accepting improper loans from a subcontractor 
the austerity measures taken by mcdonnell douglas the nations 
biggest defense company are aimed at saving more than 700 million 
this year 
but that plan which some analysts said doesnt go far enough 
is primarily a result of management mistakes that have left the st 
louisbased company inefficient and unprofitable 
this is something they have to do to keep their head above 
water said michael rosen an aerospace analyst at smith barney 
harris upham amp co in new york the company has its back to the 
wall 
mcdonnell douglas has been plagued by production troubles at its 
douglas aircraft subsidiary in long beach calif where most of 
its commercial jet construction is done the company also has been 
hurt by losses on a range of military projects 
its production backlog has climbed to a record 54 billion 
while its nice to know there are plenty of customers mcdonnell 
chairman john f mcdonnell said he wants to ensure the company is 
making not losing money on its orders 
at this point in time we have more costs than we can have to 
be successful in our business mcdonnell said we made some 
mistakes and were in the process of correcting them 
meanwhile the nations second biggest contractor general 
dynamics corp also headquartered in st louis announced a 240 
million loss in the second quarter because of cost overruns on the 
navys a12 jet bomber 
the company said deducting 500 million from quarterly earnings 
the biggest quarterly charge against earnings in its history 
primarily because the development of a12 would cost more than 
expected 
industry analysts said this trouble was caused by what they 
called the dumb but popular idea in congress that advanced military 
equipment should be developed on a predetermined budget 
its like saying im going to do something adventurous 
without the adventure if you think you can pioneer something on a 
fixed budget youre basically lying to yourself said wolfgang 
demisch an analyst for ubs securities in new york 
fixedprice development contracts set a price for the 
development of a new piece of equipment if a contractor goes over 
the price the contractor has to file claims and ask for the 
additional money 
generally defense contractors havent listed cost overruns on 
the development of planes tanks or other equipment until after the 
project is completed and those various contract claims have been 
settled 
but whats happening here is the government is leaning very 
heavily on the contractors to take the charge and not say anything 
about the contract claims said paul nisbet an analyst for 
prudentialbache securities inc in new york 
the company is playing politics theyre looking to keep the 
customer happy even though they are paying dearly in the balance 
sheet 
general dynamics partner on the a12 program is mcdonnell 
douglas which didnt take any charges for the project and reported 
a profit of 57 million for the quarter but analysts said 
mcdonnell douglas it is assuming the pentagon will cough up the 
extra cost 
for grumman an important pentagon supplier based in bethpage 
long island the trouble this past week stemmed from a broad 
investigation by the justice department into defensecontracting 
corruption 
john obrien who resigned suddenly as head of the company was 
reported to be under grand jury investigation for possibly 
accepting nearly a half million dollars in loans from james kane a 
nowdeceased grumman subcontractor who was thought to be a central 
figure in a pentagon bribery scheme by weeks end neither 
grumman obrien or his lawyer had commented on the reports 
in other business and economic news this past week 
more troublesome economic signs emerged housing starts in june 
plunged to the worst level since the last recession consumer 
prices jumped and a number of leading companies reported 
disappointing secondquarter earnings 
federal reserve chairman alan greenspan suggested he wont move 
to ease interest rates further unless congress and the white house 
move decisively toward a deficit reduction but in one key sign 
that interest rates are coming down interest on fixedrate 
mortgages fell below 10 percent for the first time since the 
beginning of the year 
the united auto workers union opened contract negotiations with 
the big three automakers amid one of the deepest slumps the 
industry has faced in years health care and job security are the 
major issues in the talks
