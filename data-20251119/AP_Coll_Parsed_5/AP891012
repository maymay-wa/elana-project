the widow of the panamanian major who led an 
unsuccessful coup against gen manuel noriega says it failed 
because her husband was betrayed by another major who switched 
sides at the last minute according to a published report 
countering what us officials have been saying adela bonilla 
de giroldi is quoted by the new york times in its thursday editions 
as saying that the coup was very well organized and coldly 
calculated 
she said her husband maj moises giroldi vega had worked with 
maj francisco olechea commander of the elite battalion 2000 in 
planning the coup 
instead of being used to oust noriega however battalion 2000 
was airlifted 55 miles from the scene of the fighting and led 
noriegas troops in crushing the coup 
everything was ready but olechea was playing a winners game 
and he failed to come through because of his cowardice he 
committed treason she told the times in an interview conducted 
in miami 
in a television interview with wtvj of miami she said she 
warned her husband of the perils of the attempted coup 
i told him think of what youre doing i said if youre 
going to do that youre going to have to kill him 
he said i dont think that will be necessary if things get 
difficult well give him over to the americans if not well 
retire him under house arrest she said 
she says her husband had wanted help from the americans but 
military bureaucracy may have prevented that help from arriving in 
time she told the station she said the battle with noriega will 
continue and her husbands death could be a catalyst 
where giroldi is now he is ok she told wtvj hes with 
god noriega not even hell wants him panama doesnt want him 
hell doesnt want him so where will he go 
mrs giroldi airlifted from panama is staying with her 
children and invalid mother at a secret location in miami 
she was not at military headquarters during the coup attempt on 
oct 3 and her information came from officers who took part in the 
coup and fled to the united states the times said 
she said she believed the coup would have succeeded had it not 
been for olechea whose battalion would have provided the firepower 
to topple noriega she told the newspaper 
olechea turned sides at the last moment although olechea and 
her husband were good friends and had talked several times about 
this coup she said 
she also said that three captains who were supposed to persuade 
noriega to surrender didnt do it because they were cowards 
her lends credence to reports that officers held noriega for up 
to five hours as they argued whether to turn him over to us 
officials 
while the captains argued noriega slipped into a separate room 
and telephoned for help and the coup was crushed 
mrs giroldi said that noriega himself assassinated my 
husband 
my husband could have killed noriega but he would not do 
that he thought the commanders fate should be decided by the 
people not the united states she told the paper 
mrs giroldi did not have firsthand evidence that noriega killed 
her husband the paper said 
she confirmed that she had approached us officials and told 
them that a coup attempt was imminent and that the sealing of roads 
by us forces would help her husbands attempt 
she told the times that the coup attempt was hatched by junior 
officers who were fed up with noriega who she said always seemed 
drunk 
my husband told me that most of the time noriega was operative 
only an hour a day she said adding that it was widely believed 
that noriega drank heavily and used amphetamines 
noriega is very bright she told the times 
the next time he has to be the first to be killed she said

more than 150000 chicagoans voted to elect local 
school councils wednesday as part of sweeping reforms that will 
give parents more control of an education system labeled the worst 
in the nation 
at issue is the quality of learning in a system whose 410000 
students make it the nations third largest but whose low test 
scores and high dropout rates in 1987 caused theneducation 
secretary william bennett to brand it the nations worst 
the final tally is expected to show that more than 30 percent of 
the parents voted in the elections school officials said 
an early tally of votes cast showed that 150401 people voted 
officials said that included 70053 parents 55319 community 
residents and 25029 ballots cast by chicago public school staff 
members 
officials said there were a number of reports of irregularities 
in the balloting most caused by inexperienced election judges and 
ballots at some schools that had more than 20 candidates 
i want to be part of the reform i think this is one way of 
having a solution to the problems in the schools of chicago i feel 
its a responsibility of the parents said nacer boundaoui who 
voted at robert healey elementary school where his son attends 
first grade 
boundaoui led his 4yearold daughter assia into the school 
gymnasium and stood behind a wooden screen hiding a metal school 
desk where he marked his vote on a paper ballot 
the elections wednesday at the citys 469 elementary schools 
and thursday at 71 public high schools were part of a reform 
package passed last year by the illinois general assembly reform 
also included cutting administrative jobs and shifting money in the 
226billion school budget to educating lowincome students 
community activists spent weeks trying to mobilize residents to 
vote but predicted a 50 percent turnout among parents with 
children in school school board spokesman bob saigh said that 
turnout was low by late afternoon but was expected to improve by 
the time polls closed 
the 17256 candidates sought 5400 unpaid positions on the 540 
councils each of which will include six parents two teachers and 
two community residents without schoolchildren school staffs will 
elect the teacher members the 11th member of each council will be 
the principal of the school or schools the council oversees 
the councils scheduled to begin their monthly meetings within a 
week of the elections will have authority to hire and fire 
principals develop schoolimprovement plans and spend money 
the councils would receive much of the authority previously 
vested in the school systems central bureaucracy headed by a 
superintendent and the chicago board of education the old board of 
mayoral appointees was scrapped under the plan and a sevenmember 
interim board also appointed by the mayor is running the system 
ultimately a 15member permanent board will be named by the 
mayor following screenings by citizens panels 
at george b mcclellan school mayor richard m daley was one of 
about 60 people who had voted by 11 am 
id like to have them coming in but its slow said 
election judge alfreda mclain surveying the empty polling place at 
mcclellan maybe they dont understand that they should help the 
public schools 
a survey by designs for change an education research and 
advisory council that helped shape the reform package found that 
nearly equal numbers of candidates came from lowincome 
neighborhoods as middleclass sections of the city participation 
was as high at mostly black and hispanic schools as at integrated 
schools the survey found

the exwarden of the louisiana state 
penitentiary was fired for lax security not reporting escapes and 
operating a cockfighting business at the prison the states 
corrections chief said wednesday 
hilton butler who has been on leave since in august was fired 
tuesday for eight violations of department policy that alleged 
administrative malfeasance said bruce lynn secretary of the 
department of public safety and corrections 
i was going to give him the opportunity to retire he 
chose not to retire lynn said 
butler a career corrections employee stepped aside as warden 
after a courtappointed investigator former angola warden ross 
maggio issued a highly critical report on operations at the vast 
prison complex at angola 
butler later asked the civil service commission to reinstate 
him claiming that gov buddy roemer and lynn coerced him into 
retiring 
lynn has denied that butler was coerced roemer said he was not 
involved in the details but added that butler made the right 
decision to step aside the governor said wednesday that he 
backed lynns decision to dismiss butler 
butler can appeal his firing to an internal department panel and 
to the civil service commission 
butler refused comment and referred questions to his attorney 
floyd falcon falcon said he had not received a copy of the charges 
and declined comment 
according to the charges butler was raising fighting cocks for 
sale on prison grounds using inmate labor and prison utilities 
several hundred fighting cocks he owned have been removed from 
angola grounds on lynns orders 
the charges said he also failed to maintain searches of 
employees and visitors to the prison allowed inadequate and 
inoperable security equipment illtrained personnel and failed to 
report at least seven escapes for prosecution as required by 
agency policy 
lynn said the charges were referred to the district attorney who 
handles angola and a copy would be sent to us district judge 
frank polozola who is overseeing a longrunning federal suit 
involving the prison system

lyphomed inc has been distributing its drug 
pentamidine used to combat aidslinked pneumonia free to poor 
patients the company said wednesday 
the company announced its plans to give away the drug in 
february but the actual distribution was held up until after the 
drug won full government approval in june said spokeswoman melissa 
marsden 
community health organizations have been notified of the 
availablity of pentamidine for the poor and for those who lacked 
insurance to cover its costs 
ms marsden said there have been no recent talks within the 
company about reducing the cost of the drug to the paying public 
lyphomed based in suburban rosemont has been accused by aids 
activists and others of overcharging for the substance 
lyphomeds action represents the first time a company has 
distributed an approved drug to poor patients free of charge 
company officials and federal food and drug administration 
spokesman brad stone told the new york times 
since 1984 lyphomed has produced an injectable form of the drug 
for use in patients who already have contracted pneumocystis 
carinii pneumonia a lifethreatening form of pneumonia that is the 
leading cause of death among aids patients 
in june the company obtained approval for marketing an aerosol 
version to be taken once every four weeks as a preventive measure 
by people likely to contract that form of pneumonia 
lyphomed charges about 100 wholesale for a monthly dose 
patients pay up to 200 for the same dose through doctors and 
pharmacies 
last month the people with aids health group said it would 
import the drug from england where is it cheaper and sell it to 
aids patients in this country at a lower cost that the drug can be 
bought here 
lyphomed said its charge is appropriate given the research 
money it spent developing the drug

three us roman catholic archbishops said 
israel should negotiate directly with palestinians over territory 
and sovereignty and criticized israel for alleged human rights 
abuse 
the joint statement by archbishops roger mahony of los angeles 
and william keeler of baltimore and cardinal john oconnor of new 
york also called on syria to leave lebanon 
their statement to be presented to the nations 300 bishops 
asked the bush administration to take more action in negotiating a 
peace in the middle east that meets the security needs of israel 
and the longdenied rights of palestinians 
but it also called on palestinians to pursue sovereign 
coexistence with israel 
the key to successful political dialogue will be palestinians 
willing to discuss secure boundaries and stable political relations 
with israel and israelis willing to discuss territory and 
sovereignty with palestinians the statement said 
we feel as christian leaders in the catholic community that we 
have a responsibility to pull factions that have been in 
conflict together to be instruments of peace said mahony 
chairman of the committee that drew up the statement we see this 
as a moral challenge there is a better way to live 
the statement toward peace in the middle east problems and 
principles will be presented to the national conference of 
catholic bishops fall meeting nov 69 in baltimore 
rabbi a james rudin national interreligious affairs director 
of the american jewish committee and judith h banki his 
associate said they were troubled by the bishops premature 
support for palestinian sovereignty 
they also said that in criticizing israels handling of the 
palestinian uprising the prelates failed to give equal weight to 
israels very real problems and legitimate rights in maintaining 
order in the territories and a 40year history of terrorist 
attacks by palestinians 
an arabamerican leader praised the statement 
the addition of such a respected moral voice on the side of 
palestinian independence is an historic development at a critical 
juncture in the palestinianisraeli conflict said abdeen jabara 
president of the americanarab antidiscrimination committee 
history will record that the moral authority of the american 
catholic church was indisputably on the side of peace in the middle 
east 
the prelates cited israeli responsibility in the beating deaths 
of palestinians and people not involved in the uprising against 
israels occupation of the west bank and gaza strip the demolition 
of homes and arrest and detention without trial 
they said the statement was devised after consultations with the 
vatican religious leaders in the middle east us policymakers 
and major jewish arab and christian organizations 
it is our conviction that a truly open moment for peace exists 
in the middle east and that the united states has an indispensable 
role to play in the peace process which has moved us to write this 
statement said the committee 
the nearly 2yearold intefadeh or palestinian uprising is a 
cry for justice and personal and political identity that demands 
on both moral and political grounds a response by the united 
states government the prelates said 
they stopped short of calling directly for the creation of a 
palestinian state but they said the united states must go beyond 
the approach of the camp david accords of the late 1970s which 
gave palestinians a secondary role in the peace process and grant 
their right to participate as equals through representatives 
selected by palestinians in all negotiations affecting their 
destiny 
having opened political discussions with the palestine 
liberation organization in december 1988 the united states now 
has the opportunity to use its influence and relationships to 
foster a more extensive dialogue among israel palestinians and the 
arab states the prelates wrote 
they also called for a clear consistent us policy 
pressing syrian withdrawal from lebanon 
they called on the arab states and palestinians to recognize 
israels right to exist and asked the arab nations to establish 
full diplomatic relations with israel 
anything short of this leaves the legitimacy of israel 
undefined in the policy of the arab states and reinforces israels 
position that the only road to survival is one requiring superior 
military power

tens of thousands of armenians fed up with the 
ethnic conflict that has deprived them of food and fuel massed 
wednesday and called for creating selfdefense units activists 
said 
we consider it pointless to count on moscow any longer said 
karen shakhbazyan an armenian independence activist who described 
the rally by telephone from the caucasus republics capital of 
yerevan 
people called for a free independent armenia and there were 
appeals to the west and the european parliament for weapons 
support because armenia is turning to open selfdefense ms 
shakhbazyan said 
the 19monthold feud between armenians and neighboring 
azerbaijanis over control of the enclave of nagornokarabakh 
appeared to be only steps away from fullfledged civil war 
azerbaijan has put a stranglehold on the armenian economy the 
past two months by blocking much of the rail traffic intended for 
armenia including food fuel and building supplies for repairing 
areas ravaged by the earthquake that killed 25000 people in 
december 
the soviet legislature ordered the blockade lifted last week 
but a top transport official said wednesday trains still were 
having trouble getting through azerbaijan to armenia 
railways minister nikolai konarev said azerbaijani nationalists 
were still taking measures to prevent trains that carry food and 
fuel from getting through they sit down and lie down on the 
tracks and have women and children do the same he said on 
soviet television 
nagornokarabakh has a predominantly christian armenian 
population but was an enclave mostly of moslem azerbaijan until 
february when growing tensions prompted moscow to impose direct 
rule 
the move failed to ease tensions however nagornokarabakh is 
plagued with frequent armed clashes widespread work stoppages 
supply shortages and almost total blockage of its roads 
soviet troops have been stationed in nagornokarabakh to try to 
keep peace for the past year 
armenian speakers at wednesdays rally said the troops 
ineffective and there was an appeal to creat selfdefense 
units said activist mehat gabrillian 
gabrillian said the meeting was called by 12 organizations that 
consider themselves a type of preparliament in preparation for 
armenias independence 
in the lastest violence in nagornokarabakh firefighters shot 
at a crowd of attackers tuesday night and critically wounded at 
least eight people officials said 
interior ministry spokesman yuri m arshenevsky said the cadets 
were riding in 19 vehicles and crossing a bridge into stepanakert 
the enclaves capital when a mob began throwing stones and firing 
on the passing column he said the firefighters were forced to 
shoot in selfdefense 
however representatives of the group that has led the campaign 
for the annexation of nagornokarabakh said the crowd was not 
violent 
ashot manucharyan an armenian legislator from the region said 
in a telephone interview from the headquarters of the karabakh 
committee in yerevan that the civilians were attracted to the 
bridge by warning shots fired into the air by the cadets he said 
one civilian was killed 
meanwhile a soviet government commission investigating the use 
of military force to put down a peaceful nationalist demonstration 
in the nearby republic of georgia in april said the decision to 
send in the troops was made in the kremlin according to thursday 
editions of the washington post 
the kremlin has said local authorities made the decision to use 
troops and denied involvement but the commission appointed by 
georgias legislature disputed this according to the post 
in the resulting clash in the armenian capital of tbilisi 19 
demonstrators were killed and hundreds injured by soldiers who 
dispersed them with sharpened shovels clubs and poison gas 
the commission said moscow was in constant communication with 
communist party leaders in the area and was involved in an 
operation that was of a punishing nature having the appearance 
of a deliberately planned slaughter of innocent people carried out 
with extraordinary cruelty 
the principal blame is with the republic the report said 
but at the same time responsibility lies with officials of the 
central organs of power 
the report said the final decision to allow the use of troops 
was made by viktor chebrikov former head of the kgb and dimitri 
yazov the soviet defense minister it cast no direct blame on 
president mikhail s gorbachev

that extraterrestrial story from the soviet 
union may have been cleared up those 12foot tinyheaded guys 
who landed in the ussr were just trying to get back to new york 
city 
anythings possible says bill knell a local ufo researcher 
who firmly believes there was an alien presence in a park in the 
borough of queens seven months ago absolutely there was some 
type of ufo in kissena park 
knells assertions he also said there may have been a return 
visit two weeks ago came two days after the soviet news agency 
tass reported the presence of ets in the town of voronezh 
since then scientists have disparaged the report attributing 
it to rising sensationalism in the soviet press under glasnost 
or greater openness 
neither story seemed to impress local residents who were more 
concerned with knells presence in the park than any report of 
visiting ets 
this is my haunt ive been coming to this park for years and 
theres nothing going on here said julie ford shaking her head 
and laughing they say that tree there was burned by a ufo it 
was broken by kids swinging on the branches 
sure enough knell did offer the damaged willow as evidence that 
something had beamed down there but he also offered a 
mineralogists report that a burned oval on the ground contained 
particles of a type of feldspar quartz found on the island of 
aruba not in queens 
we find this amazing said knell who was joined by several 
other believers in ufos 
according to knell five people riding a bus on march 9 saw 
very bright lights hovering near a lake in the park since the 
park is located between kennedy and laguardia airports they 
initially thought it was a downed aircraft said knell 
based on their accounts and other evidence knell said ufo 
investigators determined this was a legitimate sighting 
knell thinks he knows why the people who spotted something in 
queens never saw aliens or spoke with them 
i believe they have their own agenda and at this time it 
doesnt include communication said knell who on wednesday 
addressed several skeptical reporters at the site where the ufo 
allegedly burned the ground 
unfortunately thats also the site where the remnants of a 
downed tree were piled killing off all the grass underneath said 
park maintenance man joe mackey 60 
if there was a spot around here burned out i woulda known 
about it said mackey who spends three days a week in the park 
its a figment of somebodys imagination 
perhaps but knells not alone some residents of mississippis 
delta region say the soviet description of a ufo is similar to a 
fastmoving metallic ball they spotted earlier this month 
lee abide jr said he first saw the object about three or four 
months ago he saw it again early wednesday while on his way to 
work at abide aero flying service about five miles south of 
greenville 
and it didnt come out of a bottle of vodka he said 
referring to some speculation about the soviet witnesses 
bill kimmel a pilot said he saw the object two days ago while 
flying to memphis tenn he said it was round metallic kept 
changing colors and was moving 800 to 900 mph at 3000 feet some 
distance off his left wingtip 
there was no way it was a weather balloon because no balloon 
can travel that fast he said

president bushs clean air bill is advancing 
through a house committee that once was a graveyard for air 
pollution legislation but the measure is saddled with a conflict 
between top administration officials 
wednesday was a day of political triumph and confusion for the 
bush legislation which was approved in modified form by the house 
energy and commerce environment subcommittee 210 
except for an acid rain bill passed by the panel in 1986 the 
subcommittee has been deadlocked over clean air measures for a 
decade while its two most powerful members fought over automobile 
and utility emissions 
this year subcommittee chairman henry a waxman dcalif 
champion of strict controls on autos and industry and rep john d 
dingell dmich a friend of the auto industry reached an 
historic agreement on auto emissions that ensured action on the 
legislation 
the bill intended to clear the skies of urban smog acid rain 
and toxic chemicals by the end of the century moves on to the full 
energy and commerce committee possibly stopping first at another 
subcommittee for a debate on acid rain 
but just before the subcommittee vote wednesday the panel was 
thrown into confusion by conflicting nearly simultaneous 
statements from administration officials on bushs plan for some 
cars to run on cleaner burning fuels than gasoline 
the bush clean fuels language was weakened by a 1210 vote with 
the bills chief sponsors and most panel republicans supporting the 
change backed by the oil and auto industries 
rep norman lent rny said white house chief of staff john 
sununu expressed the administrations neutrality on the clean fuels 
amendment which eliminated bushs requirement that automakers 
build a million cars a year to run on alternative fuels 
lent and dingell the chief cosponsors backed the change which 
environmentalists said would weaken the legislation 
but waxman said he too was called about the same time by 
environmental protection agency administrator william reilly 
according to waxman reilly urged rejection of the amendment 
i dont know where the administration is and it may be all 
over the lot on both sides waxman said it tells a lot 
about how theyre handling the bill 
a white house spokesman stephen hart said after the vote we 
support the presidents proposals on alternative fuels 
he said sununu told lent the administration wanted something 
close to bushs language and suggested changes in the amendment to 
that end lent never mentioned such changes during debate 
the bill that passed the subcommittee considerably toughened 
bushs original auto emissions standards thanks to the oct 3 
waxmandingell agreement to adopt nationwide californias 
toughestinthecountry auto tailpipe requirements 
but panel members all agreed that there will be more harsh words 
and vigorous debates as the bill advances through congress there 
is disagreement over sharing the cost of acid rain reduction a 
dispute over permitting expansion of coal burning utilities and 
argument over the severity of controls on chemical plants plus 
the clean fuels issue is certain to surface again 
the bush proposal would have required auto companies to build 1 
million cleanfuel cars a year from 1997 through 2004 in the 
nations smoggiest cities the new language introduced by reps 
ralph hall dtexas and jack fields rtexas would only require 
auto companies to certify they could build the cars but the 
government would not order them built 
ron sykes a lobbyist for general motors said the carmakers 
didnt like bushs language because there was no guarantee 
consumers would buy the alternativefuel vehicles 
the amendment also would define clean fuels as anything that 
achieves the same pollution reductions as a mixture of 85 percent 
methanol and 15 percent gasoline 
the oil industry contended the bush plan would give the epa 
strong authority to choose a fuel and that the agency favored 
methanol the oil industry argued that every cleanburning fuel 
should have an equal chance to power americas future cars

a fear of being sued is causing doctors to 
stop delivering babies leaving impoverished women with poor 
obstetrical care and contributing to an increase in infant 
mortality the institute of medicine says 
significant numbers of obstetricians family physicians and 
nursemidwives now are limiting their practices because of frequent 
malpractice lawsuits and sharply increasing insurance premiums the 
institute study committee reported wednesday 
the fear of being sued has caused many doctors and midwives to 
limit care especially for women with highrisk pregnancies said 
roger j bulger chairman of the committee and president of the 
association of academic health centers 
in urban areas this often means that lowincome women have 
been hurt the most by the lack of providers he said but noted 
that there is a serious shortage of obstetrical care in both 
rural and inner areas 
he said health providers tend to avoid patients with highrisk 
pregnancies these most often are the impoverished because they 
generally are more likely to smoke and have poor diets both of 
which increase the risks of having an imperfect child 
one result he said is that the united states ranks 19th in the 
world in infant mortality and by some measures the statistics f 
infant death are getting worse 
in 1985 infant mortality for blacks and other nonwhites 
actually increased for the first time in 20 years said bulger 
while the causes for this increase are many the inaccessibility 
of care for poor women a situation clearly made worse by liability 
concerns is an important factor 
the committee which includes doctors lawyers and educators 
suggested both shortterm and longterm solutions immediate 
actions recommended were 
state subsidies for medical liability premiums for obstetrical 
providers who treat women on medicaid 
reviving the national health service corps this would provide 
more loans for medical students who then would be obligated to 
serve in areas where physicians are in short supply 
for more permanent solutions the committee recommended 
state experiments with alternatives to the system of medical 
liability possible models could include a nofault compensation 
system for certain conditions such as neurological impairment of a 
newborn also suggested were negotiated contracts between doctor 
and patient and establishing in advance a system of binding 
arbitration to settle disputes 
consideration of a plan by the american medical association 
that calls for an administrative processing of claims that would 
determine fault fix awards and discipline offenders 
the committee found that legal claims against obstetricians run 
two to three times higher than for other medical specialties and 
that juries are twice as likely to find for the plaintiff in cases 
where an obstetrician is the defendant 
it is easy to understand this situation since most cases 
involve braindamaged infants whose parents generally are without 
the resources to provide for a lifetime of complex health care 
bulger said 
malpractice insurance premiums for obstetrics in some cities now 
exceed 100000 a year and sometimes the prorated cost per 
delivery is higher than the medicaid reimbursement for a normal 
delivery the committee found 
members of the committee said they found a number of 
misperceptions on the part of both patients and baby doctors 
dr arthur l herbst chairman of the department of obstetrics 
at the pritzker school of medicine university of chicago said 
many doctors mistakenly believe poor families are more apt to sue 
if there is a poor result from childbirth 
another misperception said dr donald n medearis jr 
professor of pediatrics at harvard medical school is that 
obstetricians are to blame for all of the mental retardation 
problems that occur in newborns 
we dont know what causes most mental retardation he said 
the committee said the number of obstetrical care providers in 
rural areas has fallen by 20 percent over the last five years in 
some states said bulger there are whole counties where there is 
no obstetrical care available 
doctors fear of liability is also contributing to an increase 
in the number of babies delivered by cesarean section herbst said 
the committee said that 20 years ago only one in 20 babies was 
delivered by the surgical procedure but the rate in some areas now 
is one in four babies 
the institute of medicine is chartered by the national academy 
of sciences it is a private organization that acts as an advisor 
to the federal government and initiates research of its own

the united states is asking italy to 
investigate allegations that an italian company violated western 
export control rules and sold the soviet union computer equipment 
used to manufacture a highly sophisticated jetfighter 
the us case regarding the italian olivetti company which 
officials say is based on intelligence information was brought up 
wednesday at a white house meeting between president bush and 
italian president francesco cossiga 
the president did mention the concern about the olivetti case 
and president cossiga stressed that this was being pursued in a 
highly cooperative manner said assistant secretary of state 
raymond seitz briefing reporters about cossigas talks with bush 
the united states notified italy earlier this month that 
olivetti one of europes largest computer companies was suspected 
of violating rules set by the 17nation coordinating committee of 
multilateral export controls cocom said italian foreign minister 
gianni de michelis 
he said italy was investigating the information and would inform 
the united states of the results at a meeting oct 22 in rome with 
reginald bartholomew assistant secretary of state for science and 
technology 
in rome premier giulio andreotti met for about an hour 
wednesday with olivettis carlo de benedetti neither made any 
statements at the end of the meeting although olivetti has issued 
a statement denying any violation of cocom rules and contending the 
products in question were shipped to the soviet union with cocom 
authorization 
us and italian officials have refused to publicly discuss 
details of the case which involves one of the most powerful 
companies in europe and sensitive intelligence information about 
soviet weaponry 
but an american official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said olivetti was suspected of selling the soviets machine tools 
and computer software which were used to manufacture components for 
the yak41 supersonic jetfighter the highly sophisticated plane is 
capable of taking off vertically 
another official said the sales had been going on for several 
years and involved less than 50 million 
members of cocom which regulates the sale of hightechnology to 
communist countries have differed in recent years regarding sales 
of socalled dual use technology which can be converted to 
manufacture weapons 
the most famous case of such a cocom rule violation involved the 
sale of computerized milling equipment by the japanese toshiba 
electronics firm and the norwegian stateowned kongsberg 
conglomerate to the soviets the equipment was used by the soviets 
to make silent propellers for submarines making them harder for 
the west to detect 
as a result congress passed legislation last year empowering 
the administration to impose sanctions including import bans 
against companies found in violation of cocom 
de michelis sought to play down the olivetti case saying he had 
only discussed the matter for 25 seconds with bartholomew 
wednesday 
de michelis stressed that the main thrust of the cossiga talks 
with bush was prospects for peace in the middle east the upcoming 
elections in nicaragua and above all the reforms in eastern 
europe 
seitz told reporters bush and cossiga waxed philosophical 
about eastwest issues and the importance of defense throughout 
this period of change in europe 
bush stressed how in these times of transition and uncertainty 
and in some instances unrest that the hope not precede the deed 
and that the importance of a strong defense a continuing defense 
a steady approach a longterm approach cannot be understated 
later at a state dinner bush hosted in cossigas honor at the 
white house the american president lauded the friendship between 
italy and the united states saying the ties have never been 
stronger

looking for a different worship experience 
consider our lady of exxon a local methodist church where you 
can drive in for gasoline and a lube job then walk upstairs for 
some fire and brimstone 
and if you dont think god is watching be forewarned that cia 
spooks might be peering down from their shuttered office windows 
next door 
for 17 years the white steeple of arlington temple methodist 
church has towered over a busy intersection in the heart of this 
highrise hotel and office building suburb just across the potomac 
river from washington 
thousands of neighboring office workers have given the arlington 
temple its irreverent nickname because of the red white and blue 
exxon signs that beckon motorists to the gas pumps on the openair 
ground floor beneath the church 
as far as anyone knows arlington temple is the only combination 
church and filling station in the country the result of a deal 
between a local businessman and a minister searching for a place to 
house his congregation 
in the early 1960s when developers began razing rosslyns 
taverns pawn shops and decaying homes william p ames decided to 
build a hotel on part of his lumber yard and donate another parcel 
for a church in his fathers memory 
but first ames had to relocate a gas station sitting on a 
corner of his property along came the rev james l robertson 
whose flock had been worshiping in hotels a school and a 
carpenters shop 
the pastor wanted to build a church of the marketplace in the 
concrete jungle of rosslyn a place where bishop or bum rich 
or pauper influential or nameless could find a spiritual home 
under their deal ames donated the land for the new church and 
robertson agreed to rent the ground floorto the gas station 
arlington temple was completed in 1972 at a cost of 750000 the 
mortgage was paid off last year thanks partly to the 18000 in 
annual rent from exxon 
today the rev jack sawyer and station operator larry hamblett 
are close pals and partners of sorts as hamblett puts a tiger in 
his customers tanks and sawyer pumps his message of salvation for 
the soul the cia recruiting office in the 12story building next 
door keeps its business to itself 
during the gasoline crunch in the 1970s hamblett opened his 
station for an hour after sunday services so elderly parishioners 
could fill up without waiting in long lines sawyer exchanged his 
black robes for a pair of overalls to help hamblett pump gas 
sawyer says he can always borrow a few dollars from hamblett to 
help a family in distress and hamblett volunteers as santa claus 
for church christmas festivities after years of standing at the 
churchs rear door observing sunday services in greasestained 
denims hamblett recently became a formal member of arlington 
temple with his family 
jacks a really great guy hamblett says i wouldnt be in 
business without him 
hamblett explains that some of his customers have gotten nasty 
since the exxon oil spill in alaska theyve spit in his face and 
threatened to pour motor oil in his fish tank 
i can go upstairs and talk to jack for five minutes and feel 
all is right with the world again he said 
hamblett unwittingly provided the sound effects for a saturday 
wedding ceremony that sawyer conducted a few years ago 
just as sawyer uttered the words let them speak now or 
forever hold their peace hamblett revved his drag racing cars 
3000horsepower engine in the garage below a deafening roar 
filled the sanctuary penetrating 18inch walls and floors of 
reinforced steel and concrete that are designed to shut out noise 
it actually vibrated the whole building sawyer recalled 
the groom sort of went into mild shock i sent a minister friend 
downstairs to tell larry to turn it off and told the congregation 
that was not an objection 
hamblett says he learned his lesson if i hear organ music i 
try to keep the noise down he says

a 3 billion us arms purchase by saudi 
arabia faces little apparent opposition from israels supporters on 
capitol hill 
the bush administration on wednesday informally notified 
congress of the intended sale that touched off a 50day period in 
which congress either kills the deal by majority votes in the 
senate and house or lets it go through 
the key items are 315 modern tanks but twothirds of the price 
tag which is equivalent to a years us aid to israel is the 
cost of equipment and ammunition including huge trucks to 
transport any tanks that break down 
rep larry smith dfla said more than two dozen members of 
congress had written to secretary of state james a baker iii 
requesting additional consultation 
but before notifying congress of the plan baker and other 
administration officials held several sessions designed to gauge 
congressional sentiment 
we intend to have a full hearing smith said 
yet the congressman added in an interview i dont think 
anyone is inclined yet to file a resolution of disapproval we want 
to be sure these tanks are not used by anyone else in the region 
political maneuvering in recent weeks managed to diffuse the 
concerns that customarily touch off strong opposition on capitol 
hill to us deals with arab countries technically at war with 
israel 
the saudis would receive the m1a2 tanks beginning in the middle 
of the 1990s at about the same time the us army would field 
them israel has a comparable tank the merkava 
to smooth congressional approval the bush administration agreed 
not to equip the saudi tanks with plates of uranium armor a much 
denser metal than steel 
it was not immediately clear where the tanks would be based 
if some are deployed at the tabuk military base the tanks would 
be only 120 miles from israel others may be based near kuwait and 
still others at an armored training school near mecca 
in a separate deal israel is to receive 100 million in us 
payments for the prepositioning of american military equipment 
the arms presumably would be used in the event of a mideast war 
that threatened us security 
next year saudi arabia is expected to try to purchase american 
jet fighter planes the purchase of us tanks to replace 
15yearold and largely inoperable french tanks is considered a 
warmup test of congressional sentiment 
asked why israels supporters had not launched a fight against 
the sale a local military expert said the administration consulted 
in advance with members of congress and an effort is under way to 
avoid a confrontation 
besides the tanks are a ground system having a marginal 
effect on israels security said the nongovernmental expert 
who spoke on condition of anonymity 
administration officials have stressed in recent weeks the us 
commitment to make sure israel maintains a qualitative edge over 
arab armed forces 
the saudi tanks will be equipped with special viewers for the 
commanders and with nightfighting capability also they will have 
no electronics it is the most advanced version of the tank that 
has been put out to date the expert said 
last year the reagan administration signed a deal with egypt 
for the manufacture of 555 tanks for the egyptian army 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler declined to 
discuss the purchase except to say congress had been informally 
notified of the administrations intention 
the purchase was designed initially as a goodwill gesture for a 
visit by king fahd but twice this summer the saudi monarch 
canceled trips to washington with the explanation his government 
was engaged in trying to arrange a ceasefire in lebanon between 
warring christian and moslem factions 
congress over the years has turned back several us arms sales 
to arab countries out of concern for israels security

four out of five americans know why zsa zsa 
gabor has been in the news lately but only about one in 10 can 
identify samuel pierce or barney frank without help according to a 
news industry survey 
the survey released wednesday by the times mirror center for 
the people amp the press showed that washington news gets a low 
rating when people are asked what stories they are following very 
closely 
stories about frank a democratic congressman from massachusetts 
who has admitted having sex with a male prostitute and then hiring 
him as a personal aide and driver were followed by only 6 percent 
of those surveyed 
this made the frank affair one of the lowestinterest stories 
since the surveys began in 1986 equaled only by the 
influencepeddling scandal that drove former japanese prime 
minister noboru takeshita from office in may 
only 12 percent of the 1234 adults interviewed by telephone 
correctly identified frank 
ten percent knew that pierce was the former housing secretary 
whose administration of rental subsidy programs for the poor is 
under investigation by congress 
but 80 percent knew that ms gabor was tried in beverly hills 
calif on charges of slapping a policeman the survey was 
conducted oct 58 a week after the actress was convicted 
the most closely followed story in the survey was hurricane 
hugo with 60 percent saying they kept up with developments closely 
this made it the thirdranking story in public interest since 
the surveys began exceeded only by the 1986 challenger space craft 
explosion at 80 percent and the rescue of young jessica mcclure 
from a texas well in 1987 which 69 percent said they kept up on 
times mirror said in a news release that the difference in 
public response to the frank and hugo stories is in keeping with 
a pattern that has become clear from the monthly findings of the 
times mirror news interest index public attentiveness to coverage 
of news events is high while public attentiveness to news about 
most personal scandals is usually low 
times mirror also said its october findings dramatically 
reinforced previous indications that news from washington even 
when it has farreaching consequences often gets little attention 
no major washington story in the latest survey was followed 
closely by as many as 25 percent of americans the most closely 
followed washington story in the history of the surveys was the 
supreme court decision in july upholding a texas law against 
burning the american flag it was followed closely by 51 percent of 
those surveyed 
overseas stories often get a low rating also the elevation of 
the onceoutlawed solidarity union to a role in governing poland 
for instance was followed closely by only 12 percent of those 
surveyed in july 
in the latest count even interest in overseas events such as 
the flight of east german refugees to west germany at 31 percent 
and the failed coup attempt in panama at 29 percent outdrew 
washington stories 
only 19 percent paid close attention to attempts in congress to 
repeal the new catastrophic illness insurance plan among persons 
over age 50 this rose to 36 
house approval of a cut in the capital gains tax drew close 
attention from 14 percent among people with family incomes of 
50000 or more this increased to 26 percent 
the study was conducted by the times mirror center for the 
people amp the press a division of the times mirror company which 
publishes the los angeles times newsday the baltimore sun the 
hartford courant and other newspapers and owns broadcast stations 
the center said the study was subject to a 3 percent sampling

a year ago saturday members of a 
religious group brought the body of an 8yearold girl to a rural 
fire station the death of dayna broussard set off a child abuse 
investigation that is far from over 
the next night 53 ecclesia athletic association children were 
taken into state custody today 40 remain in foster homes because 
their parents wont agree to conditions set by the state childrens 
services division 
i think this is the only time in america that so many children 
have been taken into care on such a crisis basis under such 
horrible circumstances said bill thomas the agency 
administrator 
parents of the children live at a farmhouse near sandy east of 
portland where the youngsters were rounded up by state officials 
12 months ago state officials want the adults to admit their 
children were victims of abuse and to promise that they wont be 
abused again 
were still working with their parents thomas said we 
would like very much to make the kind of commitment that we in 
oregon need to hear so their children can be safe 
one parent they havent worked with is daynas father eldridge 
broussard jr the founder of ecclesia state officials believe he 
is in oregon but his whereabouts could not be determined this week 
a telephone call to ecclesia officials for comment was not 
returned 
on wednesday the state officials held a news conference at the 
juvenile detention center where the children were taken on oct 14 
1988 
why we are here today is to remember dayna broussard and 
to remember that dayna did not die accidentally dayna was 
brutally ceaselessly needlessly beaten to death thomas said 
four adult ecclesia members were convicted of manslaughter a 
fifth member was convicted of criminal mistreatment in connection 
with other beatings of children 
several children testified at the trial that they were 
systematically beaten as part of the groups tough discipline 
they said that dayna was beaten with an electrical cord rubber 
hose piece of plastic pipe and weightlifting belt as the other 
children were forced to watch and count the blows 
eldridge broussard jr appeared on the oprah winfrey show 
after the arrests of ecclesia members and blamed the medias 
negative publicity about the group for his daughters death 
broussard a former college basketball player founded ecclesia 
in 1975 at the watts christian center in los angeles to steer 
children away from drugs and crime he motivated them through 
discipline and athletics saying once he wanted to prepare them to 
compete in the olympics 
the group came to oregon in the summer of 1987 and announced 
plans to cultivate crops and train children for athletic 
competition 
since the manslaughter convictions of his associates broussard 
who was not charged has kept a low profile 
hes not had any contact with the caseworker for his family 
he hasnt had any contact with me he hasnt appeared in court 
hearings he hasnt been involved in any of the meetings or 
contacts that weve had said bart wilson clackamas county 
branch manager for the childrens services agency 
broussards four surviving children are in state custody he 
hasnt seen them his wife has wilson said 
the state has spent 545000 on the case as of july and 
continues to spend about 10000 per month for foster care 
of the 53 children taken by the state two were returned to the 
custody of their parents while 11 others remain under state 
jurisdiction but live with relatives 
the 40 in foster homes are impatient to reunite with their 
parents 
a year to you and i is 10 years to a kid said caseworker 
jerry huntley no one can tell them what will happen tomorrow and 
thats really difficult for them

panamanian officers who led last weeks 
abortive coup were recruited and paid more than 1 million by the 
us government gen manuel noriega charged in an interview 
the panamanian leader also alleged that panamanian businessmen 
and nicaraguan contras served as messengers for us officials 
relaying messages between the united states and the plotters the 
los angeles times reported in thursdays editions 
the united states was involved before during and after the 
coup noriega said they had to make the contacts woo them 
convince them its a lot of work before youve hooked the fish 
but they were the hook and the useful fools were the fish 
the contras put them the coup plotters in contact with the 
united states noriega said 
noriega said that an investigation following the uprising 
revealed the existence of a bank account in the name of capt erick 
a murillo one of the alleged coup leaders containing more than 
1 million 
there was a lot of money there for a normal panamanian six 
zeroes it was a milliondollar account noriega said 
he charged that us officials gave murillo the money for 
bribes but would not identify the bank that held the account 
murillo a member of the elite battalion 2000 was one of 10 
officers the panamanian government said was killed during the coup 
attempt 
while government reports have said 37 soldiers were detained 
following the attempt noriega said 77 have been 
noriega also said that one of the detained rebels had 700000 
in cash that he had been using to bribe the troops he refused to 
identify the soldier but said he is still in custody 
the coup was masterminded by 17 members of the panama defense 
forces noriega said 
noriega also accused national security council member everett e 
briggs of involvement in the conspiracy because briggs visited the 
country shortly before the uprising briggs served as ambassador to 
panama and then as ambassador to honduras where the nicaraguan 
rebels were based 
there was no immediate comment from briggs or an nsc spokesman

gen manuel antonio noriega changed 
the rules of the barracks when he snuffed out the second military 
attempt to topple him in 18 months now its kill or be killed 
i think the law of the jungle is now the rule within the 
military opposition leader ricardo arias calderon said in an 
interview 
when rebellious officers tried to overthrow noriega in march 
1988 the coup attempt was played by the old rules of defense 
forces power struggles it was bloodless 
but the oct 3 barracks uprising which showed noriegas hold on 
power was more precarious than previously thought may have ended 
with the summary execution of several mutineers top members of his 
general staff were arrested and their whereabouts or condition is 
unknown 
in military life he who takes up arms in rebellion has his 
answer in arms too col arnulfo castrejon a member of the 
general staff said wednesday 
noriega is accused of personally shooting the coup leader maj 
moises giroldi who was credited with putting down the march 1988 
revolt 
the defense forces say giroldi was killed by an artillery blast 
however the family said three bullet wounds were found in his body 
at least seven other officers and two sergeants also died 
possibly after surrendering 
capt leon tejada was shot once in the right temple his mother 
said 
another officer capt nicasio lorenzo died in custody several 
days after the uprising the defense forces has offered no 
explanation for what the coroner called death by asphyxiation 
neither the whereabouts or condition of 36 other rebel soldiers 
on the defense forces list of detainees is known 
i am afraid other prisoners are dead roman catholic rev 
francisco guardia said as he prepared to say a funeral mass for 
lorenzo earlier this week 
president carlos andres perez of venezuela on tuesday accused 
the defense forces of murder and called for latin america to take 
strong action against noriega 
the rebels stopped short of killing noriega when he was a 
hostage us officials say the rebels wouldnt even agree to turn 
noriega over to the united states for prosecution on drug charges 
instead giroldi and his men surrendered 
the oct 3 rebels hesitated and died for it now that noriega 
has rewritten the rules few expect to see the mistake repeated 
i think hes bringing upon himself greater opposition and more 
violent opposition arias calderon said noriega is much weaker 
because he has brought violence and death into the center of his 
power 
panama has lived with military strongmen for 21 years but even 
the 1968 coup in which the late gen omar torrijos took power was 
bloodless the country had not experienced the kind of 
politicalmilitary violence that has traumatized neighbors such as 
colombia or el salvador 
until now 
noriega a torrijos protege without the torrijos charisma has 
become increasingly volatile since his february 1988 indictment in 
the united states on drugtrafficking charges noriega denies guilt 
once admired for the sheer force of his personality the general 
now commands through fear 
he is a beast one coup participant said after reaching the 
united states 
he has established a new rule of the game said arias 
calderon kill or be killed 
the oct 3 uprising not only exposed deep discontent at the 
highest levels of the 15000person defense forces its bloody 
ending also left noriega isolated 
three members of noriegas general staff including the head of 
military intelligence were among those arrested after the mutiny 
key units such as the one responsible for security at defense 
forces headquarters were involved 
three colonels two majors three captains and nineteen 
lieutenants are on the defense forces list of detainees and another 
captain and 41 other people fled to the united states after the 
coup failed 
the revolt has sparked the largest shuffling of commanders in 
defense forces history the internal purges leave noriega with an 
officer corps stripped of many of its most professional leaders 
sources say 
the defense forces denies noriega personally killed any 
mutineers they say all the victims died during the fighting 
at the same time some clear even clumsy messages are being 
sent 
several days after the uprising the pronoriega newspaper 
critica ran a story about a 1987 coup attempt in distant sierra 
leone on its front page under a thick red headline 
six people executed for a coup attempt it said

former president leopoldo 
galtieri who led argentina into the 1982 falklands war and was 
imprisoned for negligence in its defeat has been freed by 
presidential pardon 
galtieri said nothing to reporters on his release wednesday from 
campo de mayo army base on the outskirts of buenos aires 
galtieri 63 was one of 39 retired generals and admirals 
pardoned saturday by president carlos menem along with dozens of 
people accused of being leftist terrorists and 174 soldiers who 
rebelled against the former government 
galtieris pardon also voids pending charges against him in 
civilian court of human rights abuses 
menem who took office july 8 said the pardon was needed to 
close and stitch the wounds of the past so the south american 
country of 32 million people might concentrate on its economic 
problems 
he said a second pardon is pending that will free mario 
firmenich cofounder of the montonero urban guerrillas and six 
officers convicted of kidnap torture and murder during the 
military dictatorships 197683 crackdown on leftist subversion 
the officers include jorge videla and roberto viola both former 
presidents and former army commandersinchief 
galtieri was president from december 1981 to june 1982 the 
supreme council of the armed forces convicted him of negligence in 
may 1986 for his handling of the 74day falklands war against 
britain which argentina lost a loss that led to the end of the 
military junta and 1983 election of a civilian goverment 
galtieri began the war on april 2 1982 to recover the south 
atlantic islands held by britain and claimed by argentina since the 
early 19th century 
the militarys highest tribunal ruled that he did not anticipate 
or prepare for a british counterattack nor was argentinas defense 
of the islands properly coordinated 
galtieri also had faced federal court charges in the shooting 
deaths of 13 political prisoners in december 1976 nine months 
after president isabel peron was ousted in a coup and the new 
military regime stepped up its crackdown on subversion 
rights groups oppose menems pardon and plan to challenge its 
constitutionality in court 
the roman catholic church major newspapers two of the three 
largest political parties and influential business and farm 
organizations endorsed the pardon and indicated they would support 
its extension to videla viola and firmenich 
at least 8960 purported leftists were arrested and never seen 
again presumed executed during the dirty war against 
subversion a presidential commission found some rights groups put 
the total closer to 30000 
the armed forces insists it quelled an armed insurrection by 
using the same tactics as guerrillas

large bulges in the main blood vessel in the 
abdomen should be repaired because they are likely to burst but 
most small ones do not require routine surgery a study published 
today concludes 
these balloonlike bulges known as abdominal aortic aneurysms 
are being increasingly spotted as people undergo ultrasound tests 
to check for other problems such as gallstones and cancer 
about 40000 americans have surgery to repair these aneurysms 
each year but some doubt lingers about whether smaller aneuryisms 
can be safely ignored when the aneurysms break massive bleeding 
may result and about half of all such victims die 
the latest study conducted at the mayo clinic found that most 
abdominal aortic aneurysms expand slowly and small ones pose 
little risk of rupture 
our data indicate that all small aneurysms do not need to be 
routinely repaired said dr john w hallett jr senior author 
of the study their repair should be individualized 
he said that in some cases repair of small aneurysms may be 
considered reasonable such as when patients suffer painful 
symptoms or have other blood vessel disease overall he estimated 
that surgery is appropriate for about onethird of patients with 
small abdominal aneurysms under 5 centimeters in size 
for the rest he recommended that doctors follow patients with 
exams every three to six months 
the latest study based on a survey 370 aneurysm patients in 
rochester minn was published in the new england journal of 
medicine 
hallett said some surgeons recommend fixing all aneurysms 
because of the belief that they will eventually expand and rupture 
however several vascular surgeons said they are very selective and 
limit routine surgery to patients with aneurysms larger than 4 or 5 
centimeters 
i dont think anybody has evidence that aneurysm surgery is 
overused said dr william abbott of massachusetts general 
hospital i do exactly as they say i am quite aggressive with 
aneurysms over 5 centimeters and very selective on something thats 
smaller i dont think this will blow the medical profession away 
in an accompanying editorial in the journal dr e stanley 
crawford of baylor college of medicine in houston recommended 
surgery for aneurysms larger than 4 centimeters he questioned the 
selection and diagnosis of patients in the study and said he does 
not believe it accurately reflects the natural course of aneurysms 
in the study doctors concluded that the risk of rupture after 
eight years was 25 percent in people with aneurysms larger than 5 
centimeters 5 percent in those with aneurysms between 35 and 5 
centimeters and zero in people with aneurysms smaller than 35 
centimeters

police filed in for roll call as usual but this 
day they were told the neighborhood stakes had gone up a street 
gang had put a 1000 bounty on their heads 
it might just be talk police spokesman jim jordan said but the 
talks been persistent so much so that commanding officers felt 
they had to warn patrol units before they went out on the streets 
tuesday evening 
we happen to think a police officers life is priceless so we 
reject any street criminal trying to put some value on it jordan 
said wednesday 
word of the franklin hill giants gangs bounty has spread 
quickly through the streets of the roxbury mattapan and dorchester 
sections jordan said and people in the community feel a 
repugnance at the notion 
but residents become equally alarmed when one of their own is 
shot under murky circumstances which is what happened several 
hours after tuesdays roll call 
orlando carr 30 was stopped for a search by two officers one 
of whom opened fire when he mistook a set of keys for a gun he was 
listed as stable wednesday at boston city hospital 
deputy superintendent william celester said the officer saw 
something shiny and feared for his life some residents see 
things differently 
im just as concerned about criminal elements as anyone in the 
community said juanita wade a boston school committee member 
and roxbury resident but its a doubleedged sword 
you want to make sure that gang members participating in 
violent activity are stopped or removed from the streets but you 
also want to make sure theres no abuse of that power 
carrs cousin marva carr said tuesday nights shooting was an 
example of abuse she said carr had perhaps become a victim of 
rumor 
maybe someone on the street said something about a bounty 
but its the first time ive heard of it she said im on the 
street every day i hang on the street and i dont know why i 
wouldnt have heard of this 
nonetheless violence against police officers has increased a 
motorcycle officer was the target of a group throwing stones the 
night carr was shot and at least three police cruisers have come 
under gunfire during the last 1 weeks jordan said 
were putting reports of a bounty together with other things 
that have been taking place he said 
ralph agee assistant executive director at the roxbury 
multiservice center said he hadnt noticed a huge increase in 
tension on the streets but it may be that people have just begun 
to accept the tension 
charles c yancey a city councilor who represents mattapan and 
dorchester said officers live with daily dangers and word of a 
bounty could heighten their fears to the peril of all 
if they feel there are people out to kill them then theyre 
going to act in a manner that would consider selfpreservation 
first yancey said and if these rumors have no basis in fact 
then a great disservice is being done not only to the police 
officers but to the community itself

three weeks after hurricane hugo ripped 
ashore this inland city remains a silent victim so littered 
with downed magnolias and willow oaks that officials are urging 
parents to keep children at home on halloween 
from an airplane it looks like a forest that got hit by a 
hurricane said don steger an assistant city manager who was in 
charge of emergency operations after hugo hit in the predawn hours 
of sept 22 
residents like to brag about charlottes picturesque treelined 
streets hundredfoottall willow oaks form a canopy over 
residential areas surrounding the business district pine magnolia 
and hickory trees also were popular 
but hugos blast changed the landscape sending trees crashing 
down through power lines and against homes and leaving many 
streets blocked today debris is piled so high that some houses 
are virtually hidden and stumps the size of pickup trucks offer a 
formidible challenge 
city officials worried at the thought of trickortreaters 
strolling through the streets to avoid debris want parents to keep 
their children at home on halloween 
im scared to death a kid is going to get killed mayor sue 
myrick said 
city arborist don mcsween said charlotte lost only 1 or 2 
percent of its trees although in older residential areas near the 
heart of the city it was closer to 100 percent 
the toll is likely to grow as damaged but stillstanding trees 
begin to suffer 
a lot of the trees have had their lives shortened as a result 
of the storm mcsween said many will die over the next few 
years from decay and disease 
charlotte was the silent victim steger said referring to 
the national coverage of the devastation in charleston sc one 
certainly didnt expect a city 200 miles from the ocean to suffer 
this kind of damage 
unlike the charleston area where the hurricane made landfall 
with 135 mph winds hardly anyone in charlotte was left homeless 
by the time hugos eye passed just west of downtown it had been 
downgraded to a tropical storm with sustained winds of 70 mph and 
gusts up to 90 mph 
still the storm has been blamed for three deaths and caused 
more than 300 million in damage in the charlotte area 
by the end of the month contracts will be awarded to remove 
200000 truckloads of debris left by the storm enough to fill a 
60story skyscraper three or four times city crews which already 
have carted away 15000 truckloads have been instructed to stop so 
the federal government will pick up most of the 10 million cleanup 
tab 
officials say it will take until march to haul away all the 
debris 
you cant walk on the sidewalk to catch the bus said mike 
gardner who is waiting for estimates on damage to his house from 
four downed pines 
his wife susan was concerned about the safety of their two 
young children 
you cant very well send them out to play she said they 
would have to ride their bikes in the middle of the road thats 
too hazardous 
the storm also disrupted political life forcing the city to 
postpone its mayoral primary by two weeks myrick easily won 
tuesdays republican primary but only about 7 percent of 
registered voters turned out 
still life is beginning to return to normal as of wednesday 
only about 50 homes remained without power 
that compares with the morning of the storm when duke power co 
said nearly 100 percent of its 235000 customers lost power about 
one of every two homes remained dark for a week or more 
homeowners are concentrating on repairing broken roofs porches 
and fences although in some cases it takes a week or more just to 
get estimates 
one fence company said it has received 900 calls allstate 
insurance co anticipating 15000 to 20000 claims in charlotte 
alone dispatched dozens of adjusters to the area 
one family left a note of thanks on one of the few trees 
remaining on their yard

the pentagons inspector general says the navy 
properly investigated allegations of homosexuality involving uss 
iowa sailors clayton hartwig and kendall truitt during its criminal 
probe of the explosion on the battleship 
the naval investigative service did not malign the character 
of hartwig or truitt inspector general june gibbs brown said in 
a report released wednesday 
ms brown reviewed the investigation after allegations from 
truitt and hartwigs family that the naval investigative service 
mishandled their duties and leaked damaging allegations to the news 
media but ms brown concluded that the navy conducted a thorough 
criminal probe of the april 19 explosion that killed 47 crewmen 
including hartwig 
her conclusions were sharply disputed by ellis rubin the 
attorney for truitt who called the report a perfect example of 
one branch of the government covering up and whitewashing another 
branch of the government this whole iowa investigation has been 
one watergate piled on top of another 
nis investigators were brought in to assist rear adm richard 
milligan after suspicions of possible suicide or homicide arose 
milligan cited hartwig as the most likely person to have caused 
the explosion saying he apparently placed some type of detonator 
between gun powder bags he concluded truitt who survived the 
blast in the lowest level of the gun turret had no link to its 
cause 
ms brown review found the nis investigation was thorough 
complete and expeditious and that it was proper for special 
agents to investigate allegations of possible homosexuality in the 
case even though no such activity was ever proven 
hartwigs family has charged the navy with using the sailor as a 
scapegoat and has sought a congressional investigation into the 
navys report 
kathleen kubicina hartwigs sister said shortly after 
milligans report was released that the family planned to file a 
defamation of character lawsuit against the navy for alleging 
hartwig may have caused the explosion 
truitt said the navy slurred his reputation and his lawyer has 
said the service apologized to him for leaking false information 
but ms brown said nis agents did not apologize to truitt 
all logical investigative leads were covered including those 
that required examining the backgrounds of persons closest to the 
explosion said ms brown 
rubin said one good thing has come out of the inspector 
generals report for the first time an officer of the us 
government has admitted that ken truitt had nothing to do with the 
explosion 
were also going to file extensive lawsuits against those 
media outlets that initially carried the defamatory accusations 
that truitt was a homosexual involved in a murdersuicide plot

president bush is disturbed by pakistans 
continued nuclear program without outside safeguards but says that 
nation does not have a nuclear weapon according to a congressional 
aide 
the president must make such a certification every year for 
pakistan to continue receiving us aid 
bush sent a letter to congress saying continuation of aid would 
significantly reduce the chances of pakistan acquiring such a 
weapon the legal formula he is required to use for aid to continue 
but according to the aides description of the letter bush said 
he continued to be disturbed by the fact that pakistan is 
continuing its unsafeguarded nuclear program 
pakistans nuclear program has posed the spectre of a nuclear 
arms race with neighboring india for years india exploded what it 
called a nuclear device in 1974 a device it insisted was not a 
weapon 
in february pakistans ambassador to the united states said his 
country had deliberately refrained from taking the final step of 
assembling a weapon 
during her visit in june prime minister benazir bhutto told a 
joint session of congress that pakistan had no nuclear weapons 
would not build them and would not provoke a nuclear arms race with 
india 
the congressional aide who discussed bushs letter is on the 
staff of rep stephen j solarz dny chairman of the asia 
subcommittee of the house foreign affairs committee he spoke on 
condition that his name not be used 
he said solarz expressed mixed feelings about the 
presidents letter glad that bush was able to make the report he 
did but still worried about the pakistani program and expects to 
hold hearings on the matter

house and senate negotiators will decide 
whether illegal aliens will be excluded from next years census 
following the houses refusal to take up the issue on its own 
the house voted wednesday not to take up the measure which has 
pitted sunbelt states whose populations have been swollen by 
illegal aliens against frostbelt states that stand to lose house 
seats after the census 
by a 232184 vote the house used a parliamentary maneuver 
steered by rep silvio o conte rmass to keep the census 
measure off the floor 
that vote instructed house negotiators to accept a provision in 
the senate version of the state justice and commerce 
appropriations bill to condemn the continuation in power of gen 
manuel antonio noriega in panama the rules permit only one set of 
instructions to a conference committee 
the move blocked rep thomas ridge rpa from offering his own 
set of instructions on the census question to the house members of 
the same committee 
ridges provisions would have ordered the house negotiators to 
accept another senatepassed provision this one to barring the use 
of any money for the census bureau to count illegal aliens in its 
1990 head count 
the census bureau has always counted residents regardless of 
citizenship past efforts to exclude illegal aliens from the count 
have always died in committee 
under current census rules california florida and texas with 
many illegal aliens expect to gain house seats and new york 
pennsylvania ohio michigan and illinois are among those expected 
to lose seats 
the question is simple ridge said are people who have 
entered our country illegally entitled to representation in the 
united states congress i say no 
even though it was apparent they would not have a chance to get 
a vote on the ridge proposal backers of the census change used the 
hour devoted to the noriega censure to debate the census issue 
ridge and others characterized it as a matter of political 
fairness i want equal representation for american citizens 
argued rep william goodling rpa 
opponents argued that any change in census rules at this point 
would cost 1 billion including the cost of reprinting forms and 
retraining the censustakers they said it was not clear counters 
could even get accurate information on citizenship 
opponents have said the senate provision is clearly 
unconstitutional since the constitution requires a census of 
persons when the constitution wants something to apply only to 
citizens it clearly says citizens according to this argument

the us dollar edged higher against the japanese 
yen thursday while share prices dove on the tokyo stock exchange 
the dollar closed at 14460 yen up 070 yen from wednesdays 
14390yen finish it opened at 14425 yen and moved between 
14370 yen and 14465 yen 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues lost 44473 
points or 126 percent to 3479534 it was this years 
secondlargest oneday loss following a 48990point decline june 
15 dealers said 
many stock players sold issues in fear of another discount rate 
increase since wednesdays increase seemed to have failed to 
support the yen said masaya hashizume a dealer with nikko 
securities 
the most discouraging factor was the dollars strength despite 
the rate hike not the hike itself he said 
investors sold issues such as constructions that they had 
bought because of the yens strength 
the bank of japan raised its official discount rate the key 
lending rate charged commercial banks by 05 percent to 375 
percent the discount rate also affects other domestic interest 
rates and discourages stock investment 
satoshi sumita bank of japans governor told a news conference 
wednesday the central bank made the hike in consideration of recent 
flucutuations in exchange markets domestic economic trends 
consumer prices and the money supply 
in currency dealings market players were still inclined to 
buy the dollar because of the greenspan comment tuesday which had 
a much stronger impact on the market than the bank of japans 
discount rate hike minori takeuchi a trader with chemical bank 
in tokyo said 
us federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan hinted to 
us and soviet officials in moscow on tuesday that the fed would 
not ease us interest rates in the near term regardless of the 
currencys movements 
citing the yens weakness despite the discount rate hike 
takeuchi blamed the greenspan comments for the worsening foreign 
exchange fluctuations 
a trader with the bank of tokyo said wednesday there is good 
demand for the dollar though the market remains a bit nervous 
stock players were concerned whether the federal reserve board 
would lower its official interest rates based on the us wholesale 
price index for september which is due friday the bank of tokyo 
trader said speaking on condition of anonymity 
market analysts say a discount rate cut by the us central bank 
would be the best remedy to halt the dollars excessive rise after 
a series of discount rate hikes in europe and japan in addition to 
concerted central bank interventions 
interest rate reductions tend to weaken the value of a currency

the coast guard should tighten control over 
the safety of cruise ships that carry 7 million passengers a year 
the national transportation safety board says 
the board on wednesday approved a series of recommendations for 
the coast guard cruise ship lines operators of other passenger 
ships and states for improving the safety of small and large 
passenger vessels 
board member jim burnett said 264 people have died in passenger 
ship accidents in the united states in the last 25 years 
he acknowledged that is not many fatalities compared to the more 
than 1000 annual deaths in small boating accidents but the 
potential is there for a disaster that could double that figure in 
one incident said burnett 
major foreignflagged cruise vessels regularly carry hundreds of 
americans out of us ports while remaining largely free of us 
regulation he said 
the fivemember board which oversees safety for all modes of 
transportation cited untrained crews that speak no english a lack 
of life vests inadequate safety equipment unsafe ship designs and 
other problems on the foreignflagged pleasure ships operating out 
of us ports 
burnett said solving the problems could be costly for some ship 
operators but could save hundreds of lives 
the panel also called for far more coast guard vigilance over 
domestic passenger vessels and recommended that states also more 
closely regulate the safety of boats operating on their waterways 
the recommendations were accompanied by a study of passenger 
ship safety which covered 36 passenger vessel accidents or 
incidents that killed 176 people and injured another 364 in the 
last 15 years 
although only five of the fatalities were in foreignflagged 
cruise ship accidents board members said the potential for a major 
catastrophe is high the ships regularly carry several hundred 
passengers but often have no plans for handling a major emergency 
investigators said 
were seeing a lot of vessels 10 years old with a brand new 
coat of paint but lacking any of the safety equipment were seeing 
on newer vessels said james kolstad acting board chairman 
the board can only recommend actions and has no rulemaking 
powers its final report which is to be edited and revised before 
release will be sent to congress the coast guard passenger ship 
companies and other interested parties 
the board asked the coast guard to seek authority to investigate 
accidents in international waters involving passenger vessels that 
regularly operate out of us ports regardless of the flag they 
fly 
investigations now usually are conducted by the country where 
the ship is registered and board officials say the inquiries often 
do little to protect the safety interests of us citizens nearly 
all us cruise companies register their ships in countries where 
requirements are less strict than those for usregistered ships 
the board urged that all passenger vessels operating out of us 
ports be required to meet international safety regulations as well 
as additional requirements 
the report called for centralized fire control systems heat and 
smoke detectors with automatic fire door releases sprinkler 
systems fire doors with holes for hoses to pass through and an 
englishspeaking crew that can communicate with each other and 
passengers in an emergency 
john lauber another board member said passenger ship companies 
have been driving through loopholes in the law that allow them 
to escape safety regulations applying to larger vessels

new agriculture department estimates of 1989 
crop production based on oct 1 field conditions have a good chance 
of being close to the final figures when the harvest is all in 
in the case of corn production for example the new estimate to 
be released later today will have a confidence level of about 
90 percent meaning that chances are nine out of 10 that the 
october estimate will be close to the final mark 
but sometimes those heavy odds arent quite enough to be on the 
money according to usda statisticians take last years drought 
riddled corn harvest 
the oct 12 1988 report by usda put corn output at 455 
billion bushels down 36 percent from about 707 billion bushels in 
1987 
statistically the report said chances were two out of three 
that the october corn estimate of 455 billion bushels would not be 
above or below the final estimate by more than 38 percent or 
approximately 173 million bushels 
further the 1988 report said chances were nine out of 10 the 
difference would not be more than 66 percent or about 300 million 
bushels 
as it turned out the us corn crop was about 492 billion 
bushels according to current estimates for 1988 that meant the 
october forecast was about 75 percent or 370 million bushels 
below the final corn output 
james davies head of statistical methods in the departments 
national agricultural statistics service said wednesday that 
although a forecast may be within a certain leeway 90 percent of 
the time one out of 10 times you expect it to be out of that 
range 
davies added in a telephone interview that many variables may 
account for the giveortake statistical cushion including the 
possibility of early snow storms in northern states lateplanted 
crops and changes in figures for the number of acres to be 
harvested 
in the last 10 years the october forecast has been below the 
final corn production figures in seven years and above it in three 
years 
the new oct 1 crop estimates for 1989 production including 
corn soybeans and cotton will be revised in november all crops 
will be subject to finetuning in later reports 
right now the crop situation for 1989 looks vastly improved 
from 1988s droughtshriveled output 
don seaborg of the departments economic research service 
writing in his agencys agricultural outlook magazine before the 
october estimates were made noted the index of all us crop 
production dropped 16 percent last year because of drought 
production this year is rebounding to just below 1987s 
levels but will still fall short of the production in the early 
and mid1980s seaborg said cotton production an exception to 
the rebound is declining because of reduced acreage 
although 1989 weather has been less than ideal it has helped 
boost overall crop outlook also farmers boosted plantings for 
some key commodities 
farmers increased acreage because crop prices were the highest 
in several years and because government acreagereduction 
provisions were relaxed allowing operators to expanding plantings 
and still be eligible for benefits he said 
again cotton was the exception as the government tightened 
acreage restrictions because of market conditions 
seaborg said crop yields per acre are a better measure than 
production of the impact of mixed weather patterns on the 
nations agriculture 
citing september figures seaborg noted 1989 corn and oats 
yields may be up by onethird from last years low levels while 
barley soybean and hay yields are up about onefifth 
but the yield of all wheat is down about 4 percent from last 
year with marked increases in spring wheat yields are being more 
than offset by an approximately 11 percent drop in winter wheat 
yields he said 
the us stockpile of most crops will again be whittled down but 
will remain above pipeline needs during the 198990 season 
seaborg said the drawdown in stocks will also occur in other 
countries but the rate of decline will be much less 
meanwhile he said the farm prices of most crops will remain 
sensitive to weather developments this winter both here and 
abroad and that wont be the end of it 
farmers could well expand crop acreage again this winter and 
next year responding to similar factors that boosted planted 
acreage this season seaborg added thus 1990 weather 
conditions will again be the focal point of the crop outlook

the government says most of the countrys 
schools are complying with federal asbestos regulations but more 
than 3000 schools still have not submitted asbestos management 
plans required a year ago 
the environmental protection agency acknowledged many schools 
have been slow in complying with a 1986 law that required 
inspections for asbestos in school buildings and established 
deadlines for developing asbestos management plans and remedial 
work if necessary 
asbestos is a cancercausing substance once widely use for 
insulation it is particularly dangerous in exposed fiber form 
where tiny particles are easily spread in the air 
the epa said wednesday that as of late september about 94 
percent of the 50544 local school agencies or individual schools 
subject to the federal requirements have submitted management plans 
to state officials 
the plans were due in october 1988 but many schools received 
extensions to last may even then some schools did not submit 
their complete action plans until just recently officials said 
the epa statistics on how fast the schools are dealing with the 
health matter represented reporting by both public and private 
schools 
epa spokesman sean mcelheny said as of late september about 6 
percent or 3094 of the school entities had not submitted the 
required asbestos management plans to state agencies he said the 
epa had no statistics on how many school had actually begun work to 
remedy asbestos problems 
agency officials nevertheless were pleased with the 94 percent 
rate of compliance to the reporting requirement 
we are greatly pleased with the high rate of compliance 
said epa assistant administrator linda fisher our nations 
schools are serious about tackling the asbestos problem 
it was unclear from the epa statistics how many school buildings 
were represented by the reporting requirements mcelheny said in 
some cases states reported actions by individual schools while in 
other cases reports were submitted on the basis of local 
education agencies which could include anywhere from a single 
school to a large metropolitan school district 
also there was no breakdown available on the performance of 
private schools vs public school systems 
we dont know how many of the reports were private and how 
many were public schools mcelheny said 
officials said schools in california were not included in the 
compliance figure because the state not yet completed processing 
the latest submissions due to budget constraints 
the 1986 law required school officials to begin implementing the 
action plans by july 9 1989 but many schools had yet to submit 
the management plans by that date 
according to epa requirements schools have several options for 
dealing with asbestos in buildings from removing it altogether to 
keeping it in place and sealing it off from school occupants 
ms fisher said often the best approach may be to seal the 
asbestos because attempts to remove it might throw small asbestos 
particles might be thrown into the air

a woman whose skeleton was found near 
seattletacoma international airport is the 41st confirmed victim 
of the green river killer investigators said 
the remains of andrea marion childers who was 19 when she 
disappeared in 1983 were found wednesday just 50 yards from where 
three other victims had been uncovered six years ago authorities 
said 
capt robert evans who heads the green river task force said 
late wednesday he had no doubt she was the 41st victim eight other 
young women are missing and believed slain by the killer 
the time of disappearance what little we know now about the 
background of the victim is similar to a lot of our victims he 
said the location the circumstances of the found victim 
those kinds of things are certainly indicative of a green river 
victim 
she was known to associate with prostitution said cecil 
ray a king county police spokesman 
many prostitutes were among the victims in the killings which 
occurred from the summer of 1982 to early 1984 the killer operated 
primarily in the puget sound area the bodies of the first five 
victims were found near the green river giving the case its name 
no arrests have been made but william j stevens ii 38 of 
spokane has been described by task force investigators as a 
viable suspect he has been jailed in spokane on federal 
weapons charges 
ray said it was not known what impact the discovery of the 
skeleton might have on the 7yearold investigation the 
identification was made through dental records 
we always hope well find someone who maybe can give us some 
information and other leads to follow he said 
ray said the task force has always believed there may be more 
victims 
ray said ms childers was last seen by her boyfriend in april 
1983 when police in suburban edmmonds received a missing person 
report about her she was on her way to a shopping area frequented 
by prostitutes near the airport 
green river investigators were called to a site south of the 
airport on wednesday after a worker who was cutting brush found a 
skull 
ray said a complete skeleton was recovered and given to the 
medical examiners office 
evans said the skeleton was less than 50 yards from where 
searchers found the remains of victims in june and november 1983 
records indicate the bodies of three victims were found in the area 
in late 1983 
evans said it was not known how long ms childers remains had 
been at the site

the bush administration is meeting stiff 
resistance to its plan to spread plutoniumcontaminated wastes from 
the rocky flats nuclear weapons plant among seven states in order 
to avert a plant shutdown early next year 
white house chief of staff john sununu and energy department 
officials urged the seven governors and members of the states 
congressional delegations wednesday to temporarily handle equal 
amounts of waste from the rocky flats plant next year 
my answer is absolutely not said rep butler derrick 
dsc whose district includes the savannah river weapons plant 
that is among the sites targeted by the energy department for 
interim storage of the radioactive waste 
the energy department doesnt know the definition of the word 
temporary derrick said in an interview he noted 35 million 
gallons of radioactive waste have been stored temporarily at 
savannah river near aiken sc for decades 
most of the seven states idaho colorado new mexico nevada 
south carolina tennessee and washington had indicated earlier 
this week they would not accept any of the waste which contains 
plutonium that remains radioactive for 240000 years 
the answer is still no washington gov booth gardner said 
after receiving a call from sununu he added that although the 
federal government probably had the legal authority to force any 
state to take the waste he did not intend to relent 
the administration says closing rocky flats would amount to 
unilateral nuclear disarmament since it is the sole maker of 
plutonium triggers for warheads 
rep david skaggs dcolo whose district includes rocky flats 
said he saw little chance that other states would be persuaded to 
voluntarily take the surplus waste 
this has no more possibility of flying than a lead 
dirigible skaggs said in an interview its an enormous 
political hurdle for any governor to get over 
colorado gov roy romer citing a public health hazards from 
continued accumulations of waste at rocky flats has vowed to close 
the plant if the waste exceeds 1600 cubic yards the energy 
department estimates that limit will be topped by march 
rocky flats is about 16 miles from denver 
the department had expected to have a permanent repository near 
carlsbad nm ready by this fall to store the rocky flats waste 
but a series of technical and regulatory setbacks has delayed the 
repositorys opening until at least july 
in briefings for congressional delegations from the seven 
states energy department officials identified eight sites in seven 
states that watkins wants to put the excess rocky flats wastes for 
two years and possible longer they are 
the idaho national engineering laboratory near idaho falls 
idaho the hanford reservation near richland wash the los alamos 
national laboratory near los alamos nm the waste isolation 
pilot plant near carlsbad nm the nevada test site near las 
vegas nev the oak ridge reservation near oak ridge tenn the 
rocky flats plant and the savannah river site 
the sites were chosen because they already hold vast amounts of 
defense nuclear waste 
leo duffy watkinss chief adviser on nuclear waste issues 
toured nevada idaho and colorado on wednesday to brief those 
states governors on a new timetable for completing the permanent 
waste dump in new mexico watkins told congress last week the dump 
would not be ready to open before next july 1 at the earliest 
idaho gov cecil andrus said after a onehour meeting with duffy 
that he was not asked to accept any of the rocky flats waste but 
indicated he would have turned down any request 
idaho had been storing the waste at the energy departments 
idaho national engineering laboratory but andrus halted shipments 
sept 1 that was the date watkins had promised hed have the 800 
million waste isolation pilot plant in new mexico ready to 
permanently entomb all waste generated at rocky flats 
new mexico while not opposed to the permanent waste repository 
has battled the energy department over environmental and technical 
aspects of the project and voiced concern that it not open 
prematurely just to fix the rocky flats problem

east germanys communist leaders have little 
choice but to make reforms like those in the soviet union under 
president mikhail s gorbachev say two top west german military 
officials 
its inconceivable that east germany will stay as it is in 
view of changes in the soviet union poland and hungary west 
german defense minister gerhard stoltenberg told reporters after 
meeting with president bush 
stoltenberg who met with bush on tuesday and nato 
secretarygeneral manfred woerner a former west german defense 
minister who visited bush on wednesday held separate news 
conferences on wednesday 
they both said east germany and other east european countries 
will face mounting problems if they continue to resist reforms 
the major disagreeable thing for them is that if they continue 
their tough repression they will not be able to manage the 
change they will not be able to peacefully develop their 
countries woerner said 
stoltenberg added if they do not move there could be even 
further growing tensions and you could imagine some very dangerous 
developments we all should want to avoid 
but stoltenberg said east german reforms wont lead to 
reunification of east and west germany anytime soon reunification 
would have to wait until democracy spreads through the rest of 
eastern europe and could be accomplished within german 
confederation in the larger european community he said 
west german officials understood from soviet authorities that 
gorbachevs public calls for greater flexibility by east germany 
were repeated in his private meetings with east german leader erich 
honecker said stoltenberg 
indications give us the impression that he said you must go 
on and move ahead otherwise the situation gets dangerous 
stoltenberg said 
honecker indicated on saturday that he planned to stick to his 
hardline approach as his country tries to stem the flow of its 
citizens to the west more than 100000 east germans have fled this 
year some of them by climbing over walls into the embassies of 
western nations 
the east german communist partys politburo issued a statement 
wednesday indicating far more flexibility all expressions of 
opinion and suggestions for attractive socialism in the gdr east 
germany are important it said we are open to discussions 
gorbachev is working to keep the warsaw pact together while 
revitalizing comecon the soviet bloc economic counterpart to the 
european economic community said stoltenberg 
gorbachev may not like all attitudes and decisions of the 
communist leadership in east berlin but he wants to keep them in 
the camp and work with them he said 
the defense minister said gorbachev appears ready to tolerate 
remarkable special movements in different east european 
countries but that the warsaw pact stays together even if in a 
new form 
stoltenberg arrived in washington monday and has met us 
officials including vice president dan quayle defense secretary 
dick cheney and secretary of state james a baker iii he is due to 
visit us and german forces at military bases in norfolk va and 
texas before returning to west germany friday 
woerner has been holding similar meetings

the justice department paid the fbi 730 to 
fly attorney general dick thornburgh to pittsburgh may 15 and spent 
5260 for the return trip the next day on a marshals service jet 
government records show 
the twinengine marshals service jet flew from oklahoma city to 
take thornburgh back to washington after the attorney general voted 
in the pennsylvania primary met with fbi agents and was 
interviewed by a hometown radio station 
the may 16 return flight was one of three trips thornburgh took 
aboard marshals service aircraft in the last five months at a total 
cost of 80181 according to travel records released by justice 
department spokesman david runkel 
the figures show thornburgh spent 154618 for 47 flights on 
government aircraft between oct 7 1988 and sept 4 1989 that 
was more than twice the travel expenses incurred by his predecessor 
during a comparable time period 
trips by former attorney general edwin meese iii cost the 
government 74247 between oct 1 1987 and when he left office 
aug 8 1988 runkel said 
runkel acknowledged thornburgh has traveled more frequently than 
meese but attributed much of the greater cost to the incredible 
charges of the marshals service for their planes 
the attorney general told me when he saw those charges for the 
first time he ordered those charges reviewed to determine if 
the department is being ripped off said runkel 
he said thornburgh told him the charges appear to be 
outrageous and that he wants them looked at again 
us marshals service spokesman stephen t boyle said the 
justice departments accountants went over the bills in some 
detail before they reimbursed us to determine if they were indeed 
valid and justifiable and apparently felt they were because they 
paid the bill for all three flights 
boyle said the bills reflected the costs of fuel the marshals 
service used to fly the planes 
a letter boyle wrote last week to two news organizations 
detailing the travel expenses said the twinengine jet thornburgh 
took for the pittsburghtowashington flight was requested may 12 
three days before the attorney general left washington on the fbi 
turboprop 
runkel made boyles letter and a similar response by fbi 
spokesman milt ahlerich available to reporters the letters were 
written in response to questions from the new york times and the 
los angeles times 
the marshals service also listed a 46792 bill for thornburghs 
aug 69 trip to mexico city for meetings with mexican officials 
and to honolulu where the attorney general addressed the american 
bar association 
following the mexico city meetings thornburgh and several aides 
flew from san francisco to honolulu aboard a boeing 727 normally 
used by the marshals service to transport prisoners 
in addition to the expenses it billed the justice department 
the marshals service estimated that it cost 32232 to divert the 
boeing 727 from carrying federal prisoners 
thornburgh and his aides also flew a twinengine marshals 
service jet on a june 1214 trip to texas at a cost of 28118 
runkel said thornburgh has been flying aboard government 
aircraft because of fbi concerns about his personal security and 
the secrecy of his communications while in flight

some democrats are already claiming 
that gov bob martinez losing bid to place further restrictions on 
abortion will hurt his reelection chances next year 
the legislature defeated a series of antiabortion proposals by 
the governor then adjourned its special session wednesday florida 
taxpayers spent more than 100000 for the fruitless session the 
third called by the governor this year 
even the firstterm republican governors glib campaign manager 
jm mac stipanovich wasnt his usual talkative self im 
not going to spin it he said its an issue he feels strongly 
about im going to let him do it 
martinez said he was unconcerned about taking a political risk 
on abortion i stood for my convictions he said i dont 
think the people in any state have an adverse feeling for someone 
who stands up for his convictions 
with me it was a matter of value a matter of conviction not 
a matter of politics 
house republican leader dale patchett and sen richard langley 
said they thought the session may have helped the governor slightly 
by solidifying his support among antiabortionists 
i think the governor will have a net gain langley said 
people have got to respect him he knew it was not a popular 
thing to do but it was a genuine conviction of his 
state republican chairman van poole also was busy wednesday 
trying to repair any damage done to the gops lead candidate for 
next year he had a lot of courage to call this session said 
poole 
many democrats said martinez would pay the price at the polls 
next year for his antiabortion stance 
the governors profile as a blundering manager as a 
blundering political strategist who cannot read the sentiment of 
the people of florida is now carved in stone said party chairman 
simon ferro theres nothing he can do to chisel away at it and 
make it better that is the profile floridians are going to be 
voting for or against next year 
state sen george stuart who is seeking the democratic 
gubernatorial nomination said martinez wasted taxpayers money by 
insisting on the session 
and the chairman of the house health care committee rep elaine 
gordon said martinez has awakened a sleeping giant and they will 
be there to help him be defeated 
on tuesday republican state sen marlene woodsonhoward decided 
she would challenge martinez for the gop nomination come september 
this is costing the governor a great deal said eleanor 
smeal president of the fund for the feminist majority if 
nothing else hes seeing a primary he might not otherwise have 
although the abortion issue itself wasnt the key reason for her 
candidacy woodsonhoward said the governors insistence on the 
unpopular session was another example of ignoring lawmakers wishes 
he didnt build consensus and he didnt count his votes and i 
think thats crucial she said

un investigators have found no 
evidence to support charges the swapo guerrilla movement still 
holds political prisoners but also failed to determine the 
whereabouts of 315 alleged detainees a un official says 
martti ahtisaari head of the un contingent monitoring 
namibias transition to independence said wednesday that the 
search for the missing people would nevertheless continue 
under the uns independence plan both the southwest africa 
peoples organization and the south africanled security forces 
were required to release all prisoners 
many of the more than 200 people freed by swapo alleged that 
hundreds of others had been held along with them and either were 
dead or still in custody 
ahtisaari sent an eightmember investigating team last month to 
angola and zambia where swapo maintained camps during its 23year 
bush war against south african rule of namibia 
the teams report released wednesday said 448 of 1100 
allegedly missing people were alive and free 71 were found to have 
never been detained and 115 were believed to have died in 
circumstances that were not specified others could not be 
identified and 315 were unaccounted for 
the un investigators said they visited 30 locations in angola 
and zambia during their threeweek trip including six sites where 
prisons definitely operated they said the prisons had been 
dismantled and vacated 
ahtisaari said the team found no evidence that the alleged 
detainees had been moved from any of the locations 
many of the former swapo detainees have alleged they were kept 
in underground pits and tortured persistently into making false 
confessions that they were south african spies swapo officials 
have acknowledged torture did take place 
south africa has ruled namibia since world war i but agreed 
last year to grant independence as part of a regional treaty that 
also calls for withdrawal of cuban troops from angola namibias 
northern neighbor 
swapo is favored to win the most votes in unsupervised 
elections nov 711 for an assembly that will draft a constitution 
for an independent namibia it must win twothirds of the votes to 
have total control over the assembly

former white house press secretary james brady 
cannot recover damages from the maker of the handgun used by john 
hinckley in a 1981 assassination attempt on president reagan an 
appeals court has ruled 
the district of columbia court of appeals ruled wednesday that 
rg industries inc and its german parent company roehm cannot 
be held responsible for injuries received by brady and washington 
dc police officer thomas delahanty 
the appeals court rejected an argument by attorneys for brady 
and delahanty that the 22caliber pistol hinckley used in the 
shooting was inherently dangerous 
the marketing of a handgun is not dangerous in and of itself 
but rather the result of actions taken by a third party the 
court said 
brady told the washington post he was disappointed by the 
decision and that he hoped state legislatures would consider 
enacting laws to establish the right to sue gun manufacturers 
theyre the ones that make them in the first place and thats 
what bothers me brady said 
brady delahanty and secret service agent timothy mccarthy were 
wounded along with reagan in hinckleys assassination attempt a

court

bannerwaving youths opposed to 
indonesian rule of east timor fought batonwielding police in the 
territory today before the altar where pope john paul ii was 
finishing his benediction to about 60000 people 
at least four people were injured 
hurling chairs and shouting viva independence and viva 
papa about 20 youths unfurled a banner in front of the the altar 
as the pope looked on plainclothes police hit the youths with 
canes much of the crowd scattered but about 100 people came to 
the aid of the youths hurling chairs at the police 
the protesters were supporters of fretilin the proindependence 
movement that has been fighting indonesian troops since the 
portuguese left the former colony in 1975 and it was annexed by 
indonesia 
they got to within 100 feet of the steps to the high altar where 
the pope stood watching the pope did not seem directly threatened 
in his homily the pontiff had urged indonesia to respect the 
human rights of the people of predominantly catholic east timor 
which comprises half of timor island in the southeastern reaches of 
the indonesian archipelago 
as whitecassocked priests and seminarians moved quickly to calm 
the crowd the pope surrounded by vatican and indonesian 
bodyguards moved toward his car 
from there he went directly to the airport as scheduled and flew 
off to jakarta capital of indonesia the worlds most populous 
moslem country after he left youths began to chant viva 
fretilin 
dili general hospital reported four women admitted after the 
incident all of whom had been battered by the surging crowd 
there was no immediate report of arrests 
girl scouts who had been serving as ushers in front of the 
altar wept as they were caught up in the clash the incident 
lasted about 15 minutes the crowd then left the dusty arena 
peacefully 
security at the mass was light and provided by unarmed police 
and militia the indonesian army which has a garrison of 13000 in 
east timor was apparently not deployed 
indonesia admits to having suffered thousands of casualties 
in the guerrilla war over the territory portual ruled for 450 
years indonesia had dismissed the strength of the separatist 
guerrillas saying only 200 remain in the hinterland 
in his homily the pope made no direct mention of indonesian 
rule which is not recognized by the vatican but referred instead 
to those who are responsible for life in east timor 
addressing the crowd the pope urged indonesia to act with 
wisdom and good will towards all in the search for a peaceful 
solution to east timors problems 
referring to the antiindonesian guerrilla war the pope said 
east timorese had experienced destruction and death as a result 
of conflict 
you have known what it means to be victims of hatred and 
struggle he said many innocent people have died while others 
have been prey to retaliation and revenge 
for too long you have been suffering a lack of stability which 
has rendered your future uncertain this distressing situation 
has prevented the economic development needed to prevent hunger and 
unemployment 
the pope urged indonesia to bring about a speedy improvement 
of conditions of life in east timor 
the visit came on the fourth day of his pilgrimage to indonesia 
the pope was met by defense minister benny murdani the former 
army commander who planned the takeover of east timor murdani is 
the highest placed roman catholic in the government of indonesia 
which has 157 million moslems and 5 million catholics 
indonesia has been anxious for the visit to be seen to lend 
respectability if not official recognition to its rule of east 
timor which has a population of 590000 of whom almost 80 percent 
are catholic according to the vatican 
the pope had justified his visit by saying it would be an 
offense to timorse catholics if he did not visit the former 
portuguese colony while on a state visit to indonesia

the widow of the leader of an unsuccessful coup 
against panama gen manuel antonio noriega said the military 
uprising failed because a second military leader pulled a 
lastminute doublecross 
adela bonilla de giroldi said in interviews published today that 
the switch helped doom efforts by her husband maj moises giroldi 
vega to overthrow noriega last week 
giroldi his widow said planned the coup with a longtime 
friend maj francisco oleochea commander of the elite battalion 
2000 
battalion 2000 a crack antiriot unit was airlifted to the 
scene of the fighting and instead of helping oust noriega went 
on to lead troops loyal to noriega in crushing the coup 
everything was ready mrs giroldi told the new york times 
but oleochea was playing a winners game and he failed to come 
through because of his cowardice he committed treason 
in an interview with the miami herald she countered us 
officials assertions that leaders of the failed coup were divided 
over what to do with the panamanian leader 
everything was perfectly coordinated mrs giroldi said i 
dont think there ever was a dispute 
she told the times the coup was very well organized and coldly 
calculated 
mrs giroldi 36 told both newspapers the us military in 
panama had been informed in advance of the coup and the coup had 
been plotted by junior officers in the panamanian defense forces 
fed up with noriegas alleged corruption and drunkenness 
but the herald termed mrs giroldis responses evasive when 
she was asked to what extent the us military had promised to help 
the rebels 
my husband was convinced that the americans and his own 
companions within the defense forces would support him she said 
mrs giroldi is staying with her three sons her brother and her 
father at a secret location in miami she was not at military 
headquarters during the oct 3 coup attempt 
she told the times her information came from officers who took 
part in the coup and fled to the united states 
mrs giroldi also told the herald that her husband may have lost 
the last chance for a successful coup by not killing noriega 
my husband may have had a moment of weakness she said

the fired warden of the louisiana state 
penitentiary operated a cockfighting business at the prison and 
failed to maintain security and report escapes the states 
corrections chief said 
hilton butler who has been on leave since august was fired 
tuesday for eight violations of department policy that alleged 
administrative malfeasance said bruce lynn secretary of the 
department of public safety and corrections 
i was going to give him the opportunity to retire he 
chose not to retire lynn told reporters wednesday 
butler stepped aside as warden after a courtappointed official 
issued a highly critical report of the prisons operations but he 
later filed an appeal with the civil service commission claiming 
that gov buddy roemer and lynn coerced him into retiring butler 
asked the commission to reinstate him 
lynn denied butler was coerced roemer said he was not involved 
in the details but added that butler made the right decision 
in stepping aside the governor said wednesday he backed lynns 
decision to dismiss him 
according to lynn the charges against butler stemmed from an 
agency probe that followed allegations leveled by the 
courtappointed investigator former warden ross maggio 
butler was replaced after us district judge frank polozola 
received maggios report which said the prison suffered from lax 
management and had failed to properly search inmates and visitors 
for contraband 
polozola ordered maggio to investigate after a rash of escapes 
assaults and suicides at the giant prison at angola 
among maggios report butler was raising fighting cocks for 
sale on the prison grounds using inmate labor and prison 
facilities lynn said he had told all wardens to refrain from any 
personal business activity on june 20 but butler ignored the 
order several hundred fighting cocks owned by butler recently were 
removed from the angola grounds on lynns orders 
butler also failed to maintain searches of employees and 
visitors to the prison which resulted in a serious breakdown of 
security the report said drug and other contraband problems in 
the prison were well known to the warden the report said 
annette viator an agency attorney said butler could appeal the 
decision to an internal department panel and the civil service 
commission under state regulations butler could still decide to 
retire before the appeals process she said 
butler refused to comment and referred questions to his 
attorney floyd falcon falcon said he had not received a copy of 
the charges and declined comment

israel launched a toplevel probe today into 
reports a syrian major flew a mig23 fighter jet undetected across 
one of israels most sophisticated defense lines before landing at 
a civilian airfield 
the seven minutes that the syrian pilot spent in israeli air 
space before landing and defecting caused an uproar over possible 
flaws in the air defense system 
the daily yediot ahronots main headline questioned how a mig 
flew for seven minutes without interference the 
englishlanguage jerusalem post ran a frontpage analysis about 
upgraded syrian air attack capabilities 
defense minister yitzhak rabin was angered that he did not even 
know about the flight until after it landed the hadashot daily 
reported 
the investigation was launched by chief of staff lt gen dan 
shomron at the urging of rabin israel radio said it said a 
brigadier general was heading the probe 
both israel radio stations and most newspapers reported the air 
force failed to scramble inteceptors before the syrian 
fighterbomber landed near haifa a city of 250000 
syria is israels most implacable foe in the middle east the 
golan heights over which the sovietbuilt plane swooped into 
israel were annexed by israel after being seized from syria in the 
1967 middle east war 
the davar newspaper said the plane came across the golan at a 
level of just 100 feet at a speed of 745 mph 
witnesses said the plane buzzed houses in the northern town of 
afula flying at 165 feet and town council leaders demanded to know 
why civil defense officials were not warned israel radio reported 
members of the leftwing citizens rights movement and the 
rightwing tehiyia party called for a paraliamentary debate on the 
flight 
rabin said the plane was detected by israeli radar officers and 
patrol aircraft but refused to confirm or deny reports that the 
air force failed to scramble fighters to intercept the syrian 
warplane 
all this will be clarified after a full inquiry into the 
matter he said 
the radio said the mig23 was carrying two 23mm cannons and 200 
rounds of ammunition but its bomb racks were empty 
the plane flown by maj adel basem 34 landed before noon at 
an airfield used by cropdusting planes at megiddo 60 miles north 
of jerusalem an army communique said israel radio said basem 
asked for asylum 
workers at the airstrip said they were stunned by the planes 
arrival 
the plane turned around on the runway and the pilot got out 
and said i am asking for asylum i have no intentions of war 
the haaretz newspaper quoted one as saying 
the radio and major dailies said basem sat in a supply building 
at a corner in the airfield for 20 minutes before air force 
officials arrived other witnesses said they saw no israeli escort 
planes 
davar quotes basem as telling an airstrip worker that he 
defected because of poor treatement in the army including one 
incident in which secret police broke his arm and hit him in the 
ribs after he requested better housing 
in damascus a syrian official said the pilot did not defect but 
was forced to make an emergency landing an israeli army spokesman 
denied the plane had technical problems 
the craft had no visible signs of an engine fire reported by 
syria 
rabin indicated israel could tell that the syrian plane had no 
hostile intentions but refused to provide details saying 
its difficult to explain the difference between an airplane 
coming to carry out an operation and a pilot deciding to cross 
the border during a training flight 
he defended israels handling of the affair saying 
in this case its good we did not shoot it down we got an 
advanced mig23 of the mld version its one of the most advanced 
versions of mig23 supplied to the syrians after 1982 
of course it will serve as a source of information for us and 
the others including the united states rabin said

a judge sentenced a former nursing 
home aide to 20 to 40 years in prison for helping her former lover 
smother patients and he agreed to her request that the two be kept 
in separate prisons 
without you im sure this matter never would have been 
cleared up kent county circuit judge robert benson said 
wednesday in sentencing catherine wood im convinced that you 
truly show remorse im also convinced that you are in fact a 
follower and not a leader 
wood 27 admitted she sometimes served as a lookout or diverted 
supervisors attention while another aide gwendolyn graham 
suffocated five patients at alpine manor nursing home in walker a 
northwest suburb of grand rapids 
wood testified the murder was part of a pact the two hoped would 
bind their love she said graham told her the killings helped her 
relieve tension 
wood originally was charged with two counts of firstdegree 
murder those charges were dropped after she agreed to plead guilty 
to one count each of seconddegree murder and conspiracy to commit 
seconddegree murder wood also agreed to testify against graham 
who was convicted last month of five counts of firstdegree murder 
graham 26 of tyler texas faces a mandatory sentence of life 
imprisonment without parole wood had faced a maximum sentence of 
life imprisonment 
wood remained silent during sentencing but her attorney read a 
statement from her 
saying im sorry is not enough mere words cannot express 
the remorse and guilt ill have to live with for the rest of my 
life wood wrote i was caught up in a mess but do not excuse 
my action or try to blame anyone for my part of this 
she also expressed sadness at being unable to watch her 
9yearold daughter grow up the girl now lives with her father in 
grand rapids police began investigating the deaths last year after 
woods exhusband said she confessed to him 
benson ordered 20 to 40 years on each count for wood but said 
the sentences would be served concurrently in a prison other than 
where graham will be lodged when she is sentenced 
benson recommended that wood be sent to a federal prison she 
would become eligible for parole in 16 years two months 
jan hunderman daughter of 60yearold victim marguerite 
chambers said she was pleased with the sentence wood testified 
she stood guard outside the room of chambers who suffered from 
alzheimers disease while graham suffocated her with a washcloth 
she should have come forward and told people this was 
happening mrs hunderman said but now that i know that this 
act did happen to mom it seems to settle everything 
assistant kent county prosecutor david schieber said he was 
satisfied with the sentence 
because of cathys cooperation we were able to bring the full 
story out he said

sexy clothes with lots of bare skin have 
become a symbol of the moda milanese 
a year ago gianni versace introduced his bandaid mini skirt no 
more than 12 inches from top to bottom there were few who dared to 
don the skimpy garment but the message caught on quickly 
above the knee hemlines became a way of life 
for the springsummer 1990 the trend to hike the hemline 
continues with midthigh the preferred length in the wake of the 
mini designers are also showing a myriad of shortpetticoated 
party dresses and short shorts 
for those who prefer to keep their knees to themselves the 
milan runway offers lots of pants either super loose or skin tight 
and airy chiffon dresses and skirts which flow softly down to the 
ankle 
but the real novelty in the sexy department is the above the 
waist nude look 
models with bare backs bare midriffs even bare breasts paraded 
down the runway in a myriad of bra tops bustiers lowback dresses 
and seethrough blouses to emphasize the look giorgio armani in 
his emporio collection sent a model down the runway in nothing but 
a pair of armani jeans 
this accent on the female torso spells good news for beauty 
farms and fitness centers no one will want to be caught with the 
proverbial midriff bulge 
in general the 40 italian designers showing their warm weather 
wears in milan this week including armani versace ferre krizia 
and fendi have each gone their individual way with less of a 
common thread to the collections than in past seasons 
however they have all agreed to promote one item the fringe 
usually long and silky it appears on shawls and scarves as well as 
decoration on any type of clothing often it makes up the hemline 
of a skirt or dress 
in the color department the news is that bright shades are back 
on the milan runway after many a season of drab grays and browns 
designers draw inspiration for their cheerful palette from the 
rich colors of tropical fruit or the many fruit flavors of italian 
ice cream mango banana papaya coconut kiwi raspberry 
apricot peach watermelon orange lemon lime and many more 
footwear for next spring and summer will be mostly flat by day 
and sometimes even by night 
the newest shoe is the krizia ankle strap platform shoe taken 
right out of the 1940s 
gold and beads are back in a big way appearing in large 
bracelets necklaces and earrings as well as decoration and 
sequining in the more eleborate evening wear 
the fiveday semiannual italian ready to wear shows end 
thursday night with a gala performance by moscows bolshoi theater 
at milans famed la scala opera house followed by a buffet dinner

the maker of a drug used to combat aidslinked 
pneumonia is giving it free to poor patients but those who can 
afford to pay for treatment will continue to do so company 
officials said 
lyphomed inc in february announced plans to give away the drug 
pentamidine but actual distribution was held up until june pending 
full government approval of the drug spokeswoman melissa marsden 
said wednesday 
the company based in suburban rosemont charges about 100 
wholesale for a monthly dose patients pay up to 200 for the same 
dose through doctors and pharmacies 
aids activists and others have accused lyphomed of overcharging 
for the substance but the company maintains its charge is 
appropriate given the research money it spent developing the drug 
community health organizations have been notified of the 
availablity of pentamidine for the poor and for those who lack 
insurance to cover its costs 
the company said it will send supplies of the drug several times 
a year to groups of doctors who have large aids practices in new 
york san francisco los angeles houston dallas chicago and 
miami the groups are filling out questionnaires that ask them how 
much pentamidine they think they will need the company said it 
also may send the drug to other groups 
lyphomeds action represents the first time a company has 
distributed an approved drug to poor patients free of charge 
company officials and federal food and drug administration 
spokesman brad stone told the new york times 
since 1984 lyphomed has produced an injectable form of the drug 
for use in patients who already have contracted pneumocystis 
carinii pneumonia a lifethreatening form of pneumonia that is the 
leading cause of death among aids patients 
in june the company obtained approval for marketing an aerosol 
version to be taken once every four weeks as a preventive measure 
by people likely to contract that form of pneumonia 
last month the people with aids health group said it would 
import the drug from england where is it cheaper and sell it to 
aids patients in this country at a lower cost than the drug can be 
bought here

many of those who attended a second annual national coming out 
day around the country acknowledged that they were veterans of 
homosexualpride events and they said the real coming out 
process is done privately 
my coming out was when i opened the dictionary at age 14 and 
looked up the word homosexual and realized that applies to me 
said john blakeslee 34 of providence ri 
blakeslee was among some 50 people who attended a rowdy rhode 
island statehouse rally and said they hoped it would encourage 
others to seek out the states homosexual community rather than 
isolating themselves in despair 
gay youth has three times the risk for suicide as straight 
teens said jon winkleman 22 of warwick ri when i was a 
teen i was afraid that my parents would stop loving me 
elsewhere hundreds of homosexual men and women celebrated their 
sexuality with rallies films and discussions wednesday 
national coming out day is great its like a holiday said 
tony cheek executive assistant at the los angeles gay and lesbian 
community services center where about 500 people gathered 
the celebration at the center included discussion of such films 
as the life and times of harvey milk about san franciscos 
murdered homosexual city supervisor 
cheek said the days highlight was an open microphone at which 
people could tell their own stories of coming out slang for 
publicly acknowledging ones homosexuality 
some were funny but there were a lot of tearjerkers he 
said we had a lot of firsttimers 
at the university of massachusetts in amherst students were 
asked to wear black or pink to support the celebration black 
always a popular choice of students proliferated on campus by 
midmorning 
this campus is so diverse civility and being aware of social 
issues is really important said max mitchell a senior and 
president of the schools lesbian bisexual and gay alliance 
in boston the massachusetts senate gave all but final approval 
wednesday to a bill banning discrimination against homosexuals in 
housing credit and employment 
the bill which has died in the senate for each of the last 17 
years moved along after senate president william bulger ruled that 
amendments offered by several opponents were merely delaying 
tactics 
this really is the peoples victory david lafontaine of the 
coalition for lesbian and gay civil rights we are going to 
herald this as a major step forward in the civil rights movement 
the atlanta gay center sponsored a helpline and bought local 
advertising to commemorate a homosexual rights march in washington 
two years ago homosexual residents had their names printed in the 
ads as part of the commemoration 
north of san francisco bay the marin county board of 
supervisors voted 40 to proclaim wednesday marin coming out 
day despite protests by evangelical ministers that the county 
should not be endorsing homosexual lifestyles 
ken searle pastor at marin christian life church in novato 
said he was very disappointed because the boards action will 
be perceived by the community as an endorsement of the lifestyle 
supervisor al aramburu one of two who wore coming out 
buttons said the proclamation reflects a spirit of respect 
i think we respect one another as human beings he said 
cheek said holding the annual day helps end homophobia by 
letting the heterosexual world know that there are homosexuals all 
around them 
if you find out your next door neighbor that youve known all 
along is gay then how can you hate him cheek said

will be parading through the halls of frederick county schools this 
halloween because of some parents complaints that the holiday is 
linked to devil worship 
several schools have canceled traditional halloween costume 
parties opting to hold fall and harvest celebrations instead 
other schools are bypassing halloween altogether asking children 
to dress up as storybook characters in conjunction with national 
childrens book week in midnovember 
i personally have trouble defending ghosts and goblins in our 
instructional curriculum john thompson a county school 
superintendent said wednesday 
other parents believe school officials have overreacted to the 
15 to 20 parents who complained thompson said but he said school 
officials thought the parents had a legitimate concern 
larry chamblin a spokesman for the maryland department of 
education said that although satanic activities have been brought 
to the attention of school officials across the state he had never 
heard of halloween parties being canceled in any other maryland 
schools 
in texas similar parental complaints have prompted a school 
district to considering limiting observance of the holiday too 
i asked the school board to ban halloween because its a 
religious holiday janet magee director of childrens education 
at the 800member nondenominational christian fellowship church 
said wednesday 
tuesday night the harlingen consolidated independent school 
district appointed a committee to examine halloweens role in the 
schools about 200 members of area churches showed up some wearing 
orange antihalloween buttons 
committee members said they were not ready to decide on whether 
to ban halloween 
harlingen school superintendent t carl mcmillan said at a 
wednesday morning meeting he advised principals that in 
situations where they were coming on strong with witches and 
witches brews and all that kind of stuff perhaps they might want 
to tone it down a bit and concentrate on pumpkins and that sort of 
thing 
he agreed to take the yucky stuff out mrs magee said 
wednesday man thats a major step 
but she wants all halloween witches witches brews ghosts and 
goblins and what she calls the dark side out of the schools 
and hopes the school board makes the decision at its next meeting 
the christian religion is not allowed the same privilege in 
the schools she said 
mcmillan however said halloween always has been seen as a 
spoof of an old superstition 
and kids have always looked on it as a fun time and a spoof 
rather than anything serious like this mcmillan said 
frederick county school superintendent noel farmer has not 
issued a policy on halloween but at least three elementary schools 
north frederick walkersville and hillcrest have discontinued 
halloween events others have changed the focus of the parties 
middletown elementary school principal roy clever said some 
parents keep their children home from school to prevent them from 
participating in halloween parties to keep the children in class 
the school decided to hold a fall celebration instead 
weve requested that the students not come as witches and 
goblins and ghoulish characters he said

all three of them have developed exact methods of measurement 
which has made it possible to conduct experiments that might force 
us to reconsider some basic physical laws especially regarding 
time and space said ingvar lindgren chairman of the awarding 
committee 
ramseys invention yielding the cesium atomic clock is the basis 
for the present standard of time with an accuracy of about one 
part in ten thousand billion or 10 followed by 13 zeros 
he also introduced the hydrogenmaser technique the most stable 
source of electromagnetic radiation and a method for studying the 
hyperfine structure of hydrogen with extreme precision the 
academy said it also is used to measure short lengths of time and 
shifts in frequency 
dehmelt and paul were cited for developing ways of trapping 
atoms to study a single electron or ion with extreme precision 
the methods have been used in testing fundamental physical 
principles such as quantum electrodynamics and in space 
communication for measuring continental drift the academy said

two black activists accused of making 
antisemitic comments have resigned from the mayoral campaign of 
democrat david dinkins 
jitu weusi who had headed african americans for david dinkins 
and robert sonny carson a dinkins volunteer resigned 
wednesday 
dinkins said weusi was leaving the campaign of his own volition 
the antidefamation league of bnai brith accused weusi of 
writing scores of antisemitic articles and of having referred 
to jews as vile moneychangers and shylocks 
dinkins spokesman david fishlow said weusi denied the substance 
of the charges 
in a letter to dinkins campaign manager bill lynch weusi said 
i harbor no antisemitic views now nor have i in the past 
weusi said he was stepping down so he would not deflect new 
yorkers from the real issues 
the adl said weusi also read an antisemitic poem reportedly by 
a high school student on the radio 21 years ago according to 
dinkins weusi has repudiated that poem many times 
in a letter written last friday the adl complained to dinkins 
that weusi wrote in 1971 that jews had to be eliminated by any 
means necessary 
it also said that in 1968 weusi under his former name of 
leslie campbell recited a poem on radio station wbai which began 
hey jew boy with that yarmulke on your head you palefaced jew 
boy i wish you were dead 
weusi said the poem did not reflect his views but the adl said 
the activist had described the poem as beautiful and true 
the adl said weusi used the pen name big black and wrote 
several antijewish articles for a publication called black news 
weusi denied using such a name 
the adl said carson made antisemitic remarks in 1967 
dinkins said wednesday that carson had no official role in his 
organization

the navajos suspended chairman has been 
charged with taking more than 400000 in bribes and kickbacks 
while leader of the nations biggest indian tribe he promised to 
stand up and fight the allegations 
the criminal complaints filed wednesday in navajo tribal court 
also included charges of fraud conspiracy and elections violations 
against the suspended chairman peter macdonald who is under 
investigation by a special us senate committee 
special prosecutors hired by the tribal council also filed 
charges against macdonalds son and the tribes suspended vice 
chairman 
macdonald was charged with more than 100 offenses one complaint 
charges him with bribery fraud ethics violations and conspiracy 
in the tribes purchase of the big boquillas ranch in arizona in 
1987 
a second complaint alleges violations of the navajo election 
law including charges that macdonald accepted 115500 in 
undocumented cash and services from nonindians and corporations 
a third charges him with bribery extortion and other counts in 
connection with consulting contracts macdonald purportedly entered 
into with outside businesses in 1986 through 1989 prosecutors 
allege he pocketed more than 300000 
macdonalds son peter rocky macdonald jr is charged with 
conspiracy in the ranch purchase in a fourth complaint and 
suspended vice chairman johnny r thompson is accused of ethics 
violations in a fifth 
the elder macdonald said the charges were only a rehash of 
allegations that surfaced during last winters us senate hearings 
those lazy goodfornothing lawyers spent thousands of 
dollars to come up with nothing more than allegations using the 
testimony of the senate hearings he said the 60yearold 
macdonald who was put on paid administrative leave in february 
said he had no plans to resign 
theres no reason to give up as long as im alive and im 
breathing he said the cause is valid in terms of these people 
supporters and knowing what is happening to indian nations 
what has happened to the navajo it affects my children and my 
grandchildren and ill continue to stand up and fight 
tribal interim chairman leonard haskie meanwhile said he asked 
the federal government to speed up its investigation of allegations 
that macdonald shared in the 72 million profit turned by tracey 
oil and gas co of scottsdale which bought the big boquillas from 
tenneco west for 262 million and sold it to the navajos less than 
24 hours later for 334 million 
the complaint filed wednesday alleges that macdonald used his 
position to talk the council into allocating the money 
the tribe is suing macdonald and others for 24 million in 
damages in the ranch purchase 
in january the senate select committee on indian affairs began 
an investigation of the us bureau of indian affairs but became 
embroiled in probing corruption of various tribal leaders 
the most prominent target was macdonald who was in his fourth 
term at the helm of the 225000member tribe 
among witnesses who testified under immunity of macdonalds 
taking kickbacks from contractors were rocky macdonald who said 
underthetable payments were referred to as golf balls 
the elder macdonald has maintained that taking gifts is a 
prerogative of indian leaders 
he repeated his claim that the federal government wants to oust 
him and other tribal leaders so it can plunder the natural 
resources on reservations 
macdonald made his comments wednesday in this northcentral 
arizona community about 150 miles northwest of the tribal capital 
and 250 miles north of phoenix 
appearance summonses will be mailed to macdonald his son and 
thompson they have 14 days to respond and no attempt will be made 
to arrest the defendants until then officials said 
special prosecutor robert rothstein said in window rock that he 
and his santa fe nm law firm investigated up to 100 past or 
present tribal officials and did not focus only on macdonald 
if convicted on all counts macdonald could be sentenced to 15 
years in prison fined up to 59500 and prevented from holding 
public office on the reservation for 114 years 
im glad they think i will live that long he said

executives of usa today gannett cos 
national newspaper say the 7yearold publication continues to 
post losses and is experiencing a decline in advertising pages 
according to a published report 
the washington post in todays editions quoted the officials as 
saying gannetts flagship paper probably would not be profitable 
this year but they were hopeful for its first fullyear profit in 
1990 
not making money this year is somewhat painful because its 
something weve been driving for said tom curley president and 
chief operating officer of arlington vabased usa today 
curley estimated that usa today in which gannett has invested 
800 million will end the year with about 2 million in losses 
down from a loss of 26 million in 1988 
nevertheless he said we consider it a hugely successful 
year for the newspaper overall 
the newspaper is being affected by an industry slowdown in 
advertising and the opening of five new printing sites in the past 
two years curley said 
usa today carried 785 pages of advertising in the third quarter 
gannett reported wednesday in its quarterly report that was the 
lowest total in almost three years for the first nine months of 
1989 the papers ad pages were off 4 percent but its ad revenue 
was up 13 percent due to higher rates 
curley said usa todays total revenues would increase to 320 
million this year up 7 percent from last year he also told the 
post that circulation between april and september was 175 million 
an increase of about 100000 from the same period last year 
gannett on wednesday reported thirdquarter earnings were up 11 
percent to 831 million or 52 cents per share from 751 million 
or 47 cents per share last year 
newspaper industry analyst john morton told the post that usa 
todays chances of getting into the black next year depend on the 
strength of the us economy 
if things continue to soften and national advertising is weak 
they could have another year like this one morton said if 
theres a recession profitability would be hopeless

a federal appeals court called bodycavity 
searches dehumanizing and humiliating and ruled 
unconstitutional a los angeles police policy of conducting such 
searches on anyone arrested for a felony 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals in a 30 ruling 
wednesday said the practice violates the constitutional ban on 
unreasonable searches 
the intrusiveness of a bodycavity search cannot be 
overstated judge cynthia holcomb hall said in upholding 25000 
in damages to a woman searched after her arrest on her roommates 
accusation of grand theft 
noting that felonies in california include willful tax evasion 
and securities fraud the court said the felony designation has 
little to do with the likelihood of a suspects concealing drugs 
weapons or other contraband 
police offered no evidence that people arrested on suspicion of 
a felony were more likely than other inmates to smuggle illegal 
items into jail the court said 
a hamhanded approach to policymaking runs the serious risk 
of infringing upon detainees constitutional rights said hall a 
conservative appointed to the court by president reagan 
strip searches involving the visual exploration of body 
cavities are dehumanizing and humiliating hall said 
the court however said it was not deciding if strip searches 
in all felony cases without inspection of body cavities were 
constitutional 
no decision has been made on an appeal said los angeles 
assistant city attorney richard helgeson who said he was 
disappointed by the ruling 
but alva cooper lobbyist for the california peace officers 
association said the ruling would have to be appealed to the 
supreme court 
the general rule in california is that those arrested and 
confined for more than a few hours are searched for drugs cooper 
said 
if someone can tell us how we keep narcotics out of jail 
without a bodycavity search wed be only too glad to do that 
no one likes cavity searches but at the present time theres no 
other way cooper said

state police defended their 100000 hunt 
for two inmates who left false clues suggesting they had escaped 
when they actually were hiding for a week inside the worlds 
largest walled prison 
im not embarrassed in the least bit said detective sgt 
jerry boyer we had information to believe these guys were 
outside and we followed up on it 
prosecuting attorney joseph filip said wednesday he will let 
prison authorities discipline convicted murderer david bellah 42 
and robber steven mikko 27 rather than filing any new charges 
the prisoners were found tuesday hiding inside a stack of 
corrugated boxes in a furniture factory at the 57acre state prison 
of southern michigan 
a homemade grappling hook and 84 feet of rope fashioned from 
nylon laundry bags found with them led authorities to believe the 
two planned to escape over the 28foot prison wall after the search 
for them died down 
boyer said the two left phony clues suggesting they had 
disguised themselves as guards and escaped during a shift change on 
oct 4 
negatives left in their cells indicated they had made false 
guard badges and a note indicated they had bought guard uniforms 
for 250 he said 
mikko also arranged to have a cousin call a probation officer to 
say she had been asked to pick up the two on the day of the 
reported escape 
it certainly leads a reasonable person to believe they had 
escaped from prison boyer said adding the size of the 
institution made it difficult to determine if they still were 
inside 
boyer estimated state police spent more than 100000 searching 
for the men within michigan the search also extended to indiana 
and nevada where bellah and mikko had friends and relatives 
prison spokeswoman marcia bailey said prison officials also 
never stopped searching inside the prison 
the evidence left in the cell was so obvious we had some 
doubts whether it was legitimate evidence or whether they were 
trying to distract us said department of corrections spokeswoman 
gail light 
before the escape the men were held at a level below maximum 
security and could leave their cells during the day depending on 
the outcome of disciplinary hearings they could be placed under 
tigher security and lose privileges 
filip said the county usually prosecutes inmates for new 
offenses only if aggravated circumstances are involved such as 
injury to a prison employee or private citizen a conviction for 
attempted escape would add only two to five years to their already 
long sentences he said

in the gethsemane lutheran church in east berlin 
thousands of prodemocracy activists find sanctuary as security 
police roam the streets outside 
at sister churches in leipzig and dresden east germans who have 
been refused permission to emigrate to the west gather weekly for 
candlelight vigils to protest the governments decision to make 
them stay 
thousands of east germans have recently spilled out of the 
churches and into the streets as protests against the aging 
communist leaderships hardline policies have swelled to record 
proportions 
suddenly the church has been plunged into the middle of efforts 
to achieve political reforms in one of eastern europes most 
tightlycontrolled societies 
the church has long sought an uneasy coexistence with the 
40yearold officially atheist state 
the most recent figures available from east germany say that 
between 45 and 48 percent of the population belonged to religious 
communities in 1987 about 39 percent of the population are 
lutherans martin luther leader of the protestant reformation was 
born in eisleben now in east germany 
while it has championed human rights causes and increasingly 
pressured the government for more openness and dialogue in society 
the lutheran church has largely steered clear of open confrontation 
with the state 
east german officials have tolerated the church as long as it 
confines itself to activities on its property although its 
publications are routinely censored 
after years of relative tranquility church leaders have found 
themselves in tense mediations with police to prevent protests from 
escalating into violence their rundown churches have increasingly 
become forums for disparate opposition groups and prodemocracy 
supporters 
church leaders are also speaking out more boldly for democratic 
change 
hans otto furian a church provost in east berlin has called on 
the ruling communist party to give up its grip on total power 
church sources inform western media of dissident developments 
and act as mediators between opposition groups and government 
officials 
opposition groups have flocked to the churches because they are 
the only haven of free speech in the strictly regulated country 
church property is also offlimits to state security officials 
under terms of a law separating church and state 
while there are similarities to the catholic churchs support of 
the solidarity movement in poland the german lutheran church has 
never had the same influence on daily life as the catholic church 
in poland 
western diplomatic observers and east german church leaders say 
there are clear limits to the churchs new role many say its 
current role has been assumed reluctantly 
the church has not deliberately chosen this role said a 
western diplomat who tracks east german religious affairs it was 
forced upon it 
east berlin pastor rainer eppelmann said the church in seeking 
to help many east germans disillusioned by their society has found 
that people were trying to reach out to are being torn apart 
you have to deal with these problems said eppelmann who 
was among the first east berlin pastors to give sanctuary to 
fledgling ecology and human rights groups 
johannes hempel the lutheran bishop of dresden said he does 
not believe the church is actively seeking the forefront of the 
movement for changes in east german society 
what is happening now is not really an activity of the 
churches he said it comes from a large part of the 
population and only a small part are christians 
hempel said the churchs role is to help avoid escalation and 
violence and to build bridges between the opposition and the 
state 
that role will be challenged as opposition leaders continue to 
demand more dialogue with the government 
so far only communist officials in leipzig and dresden have 
agreed to talk to opposition representatives church leaders there 
played key roles in setting up those talks 
church leaders in east berlin say working groups also exist 
between the church and officials in the capital to discuss 
solutions to the current unrest 
several church leaders are known to have good contacts with 
highranking party officials 
church officials say they expect their mediation role to 
continue to be a difficult one because many in the government led 
by 77yearold erich honecker have been unwilling to discuss the 
need for changes

east germanys communist party will consider 
social reforms but will stick to a strict socialist ideology and 
maintain its grip on power a highranking party official said 
today 
but there were indications of differences within the party 
hierarchy over how to deal with an increasingly agitated populace 
demanding more freedoms from the hardline government 
west german media speculated today that 77yearold erich 
honecker may be forced to step down as east german leader 
some communist party leaders warned honecker in a politburo 
meeting on wednesday that unless calls for democratic reforms are 
urgently addressed he could face labor unrest party sources said 
after the twoday meeting ended the politburo maintained a 
public unity that offered firm support for the policies of the past 
but offered an olive branch to a growing movement for reform 
the politburo said in a statement all expressions of opinion 
and suggestions for attractive socialism in east germany are 
important we are open to discussions 
but any reforms will serve the further development of 
socialism said otto reinhold a party central committee member 
and head of the governments academy for the social sciences 
there is a need for clear positions from the party as to how 
the socialist system can be further shaped reinhold said in a 
commentary carried today by the official news agency adn and the 
state newspaper berliner zeitung 
adn said he wanted to distinguish the role of the party in east 
germany from that in some other socialist countries the government 
in east berlin has long emphasized it rejects the democratic 
reforms taking place in poland and hungary 
baerbel bohley a cofounder of the opposition group new forum 
described the politburo statement as a verbal shift that does not 
take into account real life 
in an interview with the rias radio in west berlin ms bohley 
said in dialogue there must be also confrontations and those 
who are trying to avoid confrontations are not for real dialogue 
meanwhile the mayor of dresden wolfgang berghofer promised to 
continue talks with the reformminded lutheran church and other 
groups in the city but flatly ruled out accepting any demands made 
by new forum 
we are continuing to talk with one another berghofer told 
the east german newspaper junge welt but i said that i am not 
ready to accept any demands from the new forum 
new forum has been seeking greater openness in east german 
society and meaningful elections any changes in those areas would 
have to come from the central government not the local level 
the european parliament meanwhile called on east germany today 
to release those who have been arbitrarily arrested in 
nationwide demonstrations and to end police actions against 
citizens trying to flee the nation 
the european parliamentarians approved the criticism of east 
germany in a resolution unanimously adopted in strasbourg france 
in west germany the zdf television network the hessische 
rundfunk radio in frankfurt and the masscirculation bild newspaper 
speculated honecker will soon step down 
as of wednesday evening a resignation could no longer be 
discounted added the conservative frankfurter allgemeine zeitung 
today 
the east german sources said highranking communist officials 
had demanded honecker deliver a report on the critical 
situation of the nation by friday in the past month nearly 
50000 people have fled to the west and the country has seen its 
largest street protests since 1953 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity reported 
resistance within the security forces and the statecontrolled news 
media to the governments harsh weekend crackdown on nationwide 
prodemocracy protests 
the politburo in its statement reaffirmed its commitment to 
socialism saying the answers to current problems are not to be 
found in the capitalist past 
the politburo hinted at possible changes including more free 
expression in the rigidly controlled news media and greater freedom 
to travel 
party sources said another politburo member egon krenz was 
responsible for the decision to order security forces who beat 
and arrested hundreds of protesters over the weekend to show 
restraint during demonstrations monday in leipzig east berlin and 
dresden

a magistrate today said white 
riot police had acted despicably and unlawfully in an attack on 
mixedrace demonstrators but he acquitted their two commanding 
officers of assault charges 
a mixedrace policeman who had accused the riot squad of acting 
like wild dogs called the verdict unbelievable 
magistrate as mccarthy said there was no evidence the major 
and lieutenant on the scene outside cape town on sept 5 witnessed 
the assaults and they could thus not be held responsible for the 
actions of their men 
but mccarthy said the assaults in mitchells plain township 
described by witnesses at the trial and shown in a subpoenaed 
videotape from cbs news were illegal and despicable 
in particular he criticized the whipping of women on their 
breasts 
the videotape was shown on government television wednesday and 
today but edited to omit scenes showing police hitting people as 
they lay on the ground 
the court is astonished that these members cannot be 
identified by the police or if they can be identified that they 
are not in court mccarthy said 
the trial was prompted by allegations of mixedrace mitchells 
plain police officer lt gregory rockman who said the squad 
charged peaceful antielection protesters with whips and clubs 
it is ridiculous what the outcome was rockman told 
reporters after learning the verdict this means they can go 
around beating people i dont accept it 
he said he would press for a meeting with president fw de 
klerk to discuss his concerns about police violence 
the demonstration ocurred the day before parliamentary 
elections from which members of the countrys 28 million black 
majority were excluded 
rockman testified that as he tried to get one riot squad away 
from the area to decrease tension another one charged and attacked 
bystanders with glee 
rockman testified that maj charles brazelle in charge of the 
riot squad threatened to arrest him when he asked him to stop the 
attack 
brazelle was acquitted along with lt david roos 
the magistrate said national emergency regulations allow police 
to use violence to end illegal demonstrations and give immunity to 
the police if they act in good faith 
the prosecution argued that the riot squad officers were not 
protected by the emergency regulations in this case because it was 
clear the demonstration although illegal posed no threat to 
public safety or the police

restrictive provisions limiting federal abortion aid to women

proposal and instead adopt senate language extending eligibility 
to women who have been victims of rape or incest and reported the 
incidents quickly to authorities 
the senate language that the house agreed to wednesday included 
an unrelated provision restricting federal financing for programs 
that provide hypodermic needles to intravenous drug users this 
provision received little mention in the house debate but could 
have influenced some votes 
in all 27 members voted for liberalized rules wednesday who 
were recorded as voting against them in september 1988 while two 
voted against the eased limitations wednesday who voted for them 13 
months ago 
the two voting for easing the limitations last year but switched

voters are focusing more on the abortion issue 
this year and some house members say that is leading them to 
rethink the political wisdom of their past opinions 
this year were all listening said rep arthur ravenel jr 
rsc as the house voted 216206 on wednesday to liberalize 
medicaid abortion funding rules 
he was one of 27 lawmakers who voted to allow more 
medicaidfunded abortions on wednesday but had voted the opposite 
last year ravenel attributed the change to increasing public 
awareness following the supreme courts july decision giving the 
states more power to restrict abortions 
theres been no time that the public awareness of this matter 
has been as high as it is now since ive been in public office 
added rep richard baker rla another lawmaker who switched his 
vote over the last year 
theyre perceiving their constituencies as prochoice 
obviously a majority of them are rep henry hyde rill leader 
of the houses antiabortion forces said of his colleagues after 
the vote over the years prolifers have been replaced by 
prochoicers 
rep barbara boxer dcalif who led the house fight for the 
eased rules was another who credited the climate created in the 
aftermath of the high courts july 3 ruling in the missouri case 
webster vs reproductive health services case 
the supreme court case made the issue real she said 
before it was hypothetical because they always had the courts to 
rely on 
in rejecting restrictions in place since 1981 the house agreed 
to allow federal aid for abortions for poor women who are victims 
of rape or incest conservatives lost an effort to reverse the 
vote 212207 
wednesdays votes reversed the chambers 216166 vote of sept 
9 1988 by which it decided to limit federal aid to cases where 
the womans life was in danger 
the bill now moves to the senate which has already passed the 
eased limitations however president bush has threatened to veto 
the measure 
there has been one other significant congressional victory for 
abortion rights forces since the webster decision the houses vote 
aug 2 to expand eligibility for government abortion aid in 
washington dc 
but that vote was considered easier for lawmakers because it 
affected only abortions in the capital and not their constituents 
back home wednesdays vote has sparked strong statements from both 
sides 
the politicians who flipflop on the abortion issue may find 
themselves in a political nomans land perceived as lacking 
principle and trusted by neither side warned darla st martin 
associate executive director of the national right to life 
rep les aucoin dore who backs abortion rights said he 
believed bush would veto the bill but predicted it would backfire 
i would tell him by doing it youre going to bring injury 
upon yourself politically but more important hes going to bring 
injury upon his allies in the house he said he wins in the 
short term the veto will stand obviously but in the long term 
politically hes going to lose

a north korean defector claimed today 
that his country planned a series of bombing attacks at the 1988 
summer olympics in seoul but that the plan was canceled because of 
fear of retaliation 
suh yongchul 26 who defected from north korea last month 
told a news conference that six members of his north korean 
commando unit were trained to bomb olympic facilities in seoul 
including the 10000capacity main stadium 
he said the plan was scrapped at the last moment because north 
korean leaders feared it could invite a retaliatory attack on a 
world youth festival scheduled in july 
both the summer olympics in seoul and the 13th world youth 
festival in pyongyang north korea were held without disruption 
six members of our unit received special training to 
infiltrate during the olympics but the plan was canceled i later 
knew that it was because the north feared that the south korean 
side would retaliate against the youth festival suh said 
he also said a 1983 explosion in the southeastern city of taegu 
that killed four people was caused by a bomb planted by a north 
korean agent who was not captured 
the north korean agent lee chul was awarded a top government 
medal for the taegu mission he said 
four south korean civilians were killed and two others wounded 
in an explosion in front of the us cultural center in taegu in

korean agents

river that flows along the demilitarized zone separating the two 
koreas

a west german political party is asking to 
join in legal actions to delay the launch of atlantis hoping to 
gain time to get the issue of the space shuttles nuclear cargo 
before the world court 
because of the shortness of time they asked that we represent 
them said lanny sinkin a lawyer for the christic institute 
one of three environmental groups that on tuesday lost an attempt 
to get a temporary restraining order against the launch 
atlantis is to be launched next week with the nuclearpowered 
galileo space probe in its cargo bay after release from the 
shuttle galileo is to embark on a sixyear journey to the planet 
jupiter 
the us environmental groups had asked that the launch be 
halted on grounds that nasa had not fulfilled its environmental 
requirements and that an accident could poison the atmosphere with 
deadly plutonium238 the petition by the green party delivered to 
sinkin in the midst of the hearing cites possible violation of an 
international treaty 
they were asking for a 10day temporary restraining order so 
they could determine whether to go to the world court or whether 
to approach the german government to intervene formally sinkin 
said he said it is his understanding that only a government can 
enforce a treaty 
the green party is a political party focused on environmental 
issues and has some seats in the west german parliament 
their claim is a violation of the outer space treaty signed in 
1967 that both germany and the united states have ratified 
sinkin said one provision says activities in space exploration 
by one country will not harm activities of another country they 
are concerned about the potential for plutonium contamination of 
germany 
the signatories to the treaty also agreed not to introduce 
harmful contaminants into space and there is concern about the 
potential of introducing both plutonium and biological life into 
jupiters atmosphere because galileo is not sterilized sinkin 
said 
the us environmental groups have said they intend to carry 
their fight against the launch to higher courts but no further 
legal actions had been filed 
the newspaper florida today first reported the germans attempt 
to intervene the motion to join in the suit was filed on behalf of 
the green party by helmut lippelt secretary to the lower house of 
west germanys parliament 
as graphically demonstrated to the people of germany by the 
chernobyl accident such releases of plutonium can drastically 
affect people situated far from the site of the accident the 
greens court motion says 
the amount of plutonium on the galileo mission exceeds the 
inventory of radioactivity in the chernobyl reactor at the time of 
the accident it said 
nasa attorney edward frankle said the government will counter 
additional legal maneuvers 
any further attempts to get an injunction or change the 
current status we will object to he said

the senior republican member of the house 
armed services committee says he sees nothing wrong in accepting a 
onethird interest in an investment venture funded by a businessman 
whose companies have done 50 million in government defense work 
since 1987 
rep william l dickinson rala said wednesday he approached 
montgomery ala industrialist ben collier in 1986 with what i 
thought was a good business opportunity and collier agreed to put 
up 300000 
dickinson said he supplied the contacts for the montgomery 
investment club and the two men agreed that any profits or losses 
would be shared onethird by dickinson and twothirds by collier 
but the business opportunity soured when the 300000 was turned 
over to steven a streit of huntsville ala whose claims of 
unusually high investment earnings had attracted some 300 
investors streit eventually pleaded guilty to securities fraud and 
was sentenced to 10 years in prison 
streits assets were frozen in early 1987 and dickinson said 
the investment club has received about 90 percent of the 300000 
from a bankruptcy clerk that is serving streits creditors 
dickinson said he does not think his onethird interest in the 
investment club violates a house ethics rule that prohibits members 
from accepting gifts of more than 100 from any individual who has 
a direct interest in legislation before congress 
if hes got a direct interest in legislation i dont know what 
it is dickinson said of collier hes never asked me to vote 
any way i dont know of any legislation hes interested in and 
thats as far as it goes 
he said he saw nothing illegal immoral or unethical in the 
deal 
collier owns 45 percent of american apparel co which was 
formed in 1987 after collier and several associates purchased the 
assets of the bankrupt selma apparel co 
the firm now has three plants in alabama and according to rick 
cippele a part owner of the company has received 486 million in 
uniform contracts awarded by the defense logistics agency after 
competitive bidding 
collier also owns half interest in national microsystems a 
montgomery company that manufactures electronics components and 
test equipment for the aerospace automobile and appliance 
industries 
mark chesnutt director of public affairs for national 
microsystems said 3 million of the companys 9 million in total 
revenue this year came from subcontracts with two major defense 
contractors united technologies corp and gte government systems 
dickinson said he has promoted national microsystems among 
defense contractors just as he has promoted other businesses in 
his district that are interested in pentagon work 
but he said he had nothing to do with colliers purchase of the 
assets of selma apparel or with the new companys subsequent 
approval by the pentagon as an acceptable bidder on defense 
contracts 
before collier began negotiating to buy the bankrupt firm 
dickinson said he signed a letter along with other members of the 
alabama delegation urging the pentagon to save 600 alabama jobs by 
permiting selma apparel to resume bidding on defense contracts 
the company had been barred from bidding after its owner james 
utsey of philadelphia was convicted of federal bidrigging charges 
after collier submitted his bid to bankruptcy court lawmakers 
again urged the pentagon to allow american apparel to bid on 
government contracts dickinson was the only member of the alabama 
delegation who did not sign the letter according to walter 
braswell an aide to rep claude harris who initiated the letter

a federal judge threw out a subpoena 
ordering gov guy hunt to testify at a hearing for a lawmaker 
accused of influence peddling 
rep lewis spratt and two other black democrats are charged with 
extortion stemming from efforts by a former legislator to open a 
dog track 
spratt had subpoenaed the republican governor us attorney jim 
wilson and wilsons predecessor john bell to testify oct 20 
spratts attorney said he would show that black democrats were 
singled out by white gop prosecutors 
but on wednesday us district judge truman hobbs granted a 
motion by hunts attorneys to quash the subpoena the hearing was 
scheduled to consider spratts request for dismissal of the charges 
based on racial discrimination 
hunt press secretary terry abbott said the governor is just 
not involved in the case against spratt 
spratt and reps bobbie mcdowell and eb mcclain were indicted 
in connection with effort by former state rep hugh boles to open a 
parimutuel dog track at bessemer spratt is accused of agreeing to 
support boles measure in the legislature in return for a promise 
of stock options in the track 
boles was convicted in august of conspiracy and extortion 
spratts lawyer carlos williams had claimed that prosecutors 
ignored evidence of exortion and perjury by hunt during his tenure 
as state director of the us agricultural stabilization and 
conservation service 
hunt denied any wrongdoing while he held the federal job he 
resigned the post in 1985 amid allegations he tried to use his 
office for political purposes and tried to impede the 
investigation the investigation was later dropped

the house foreign affairs committee is 
pressing an 8375 million aid plan for poland and hungary nearly 
double the assistance proposed by president bush to encourage 
those nations as they move toward democracy and freemarket change 
the committee endorsed the package 350 on wednesday choosing a 
middle road between bushs 4555 million proposal and the 12 
billion urged by senate democrats 
the full house is expected to act on the threeyear aid 
authorization measure next week 
success with our help is uncertain but failure without our 
assistance is guaranteed said rep lee hamilton dind moments 
before the bill was approved 
some republican members said they were concerned the house bill 
proposes too much spending and rep william broomfield rmich 
said a smaller amount is likely to emerge from the congressional 
appropriations process 
but most members said the legislation is an appropriate and 
urgently needed response to democratic and freemarket movements in 
both poland and hungary 
the house bill includes the 200 million to help poland 
stabilize its currency which bush proposed last week a move many 
democrats said was caused by congressional pressure to do more 
the bush administration took no position on the overall measure 
which builds on and expands us assistance originally proposed by 
the president 
the legislation would authorize spending 8375 million to aid 
poland and hungary over the next three years including 284 
million in the 1990 fiscal year which began on oct 1 
the largest share of the money is earmarked for polands new 
noncommunist government which is beset with galloping inflation 
and other serious economic problems 
the house bill would authorize 200 million to operate 
enterprise funds to speed economic change in the two countries 
bush has proposed spending 125 million for that purpose 
the bill would boost the 100 million proposed by bush for food 
and livestock feed to a minimum of 125 million 
hamilton said the bill addresses an extraordinarily unique 
opportunity to wean eastern europe away from communism 
this is an opportunity that may not come again for a long 
long time and i think we should grab it and run said rep robert 
j lagomarsino rcalif 
committee chairman dante fascell dfla said the aid will 
lessen the impact of the instability which must take place when 
you think of the enormity of the changes poland and hungary will 
have to make to transform their staterun economies 
i can only say that after four decades in which we spent 
literally trillions of dollars to prevent the communization of 
western europe this is a relatively modest amount to spend to 
promote the unravelling of communism in eastern europe said rep 
stephen solarz dny

federal safety officials say small school 
buses lack standards that apply to larger buses and some have been 
modified in ways that increase the chance of injury in a crash 
the national transportation safety board meeting late 
wednesday called for improved front door latches on all small 
school buses and government tests to further improve the safety of 
vehicles they say are already among the safest on the road 
the board rejected earlier staff recommendations for fullscale 
crash tests but called for tests using computer simulation and 
crash sleds to determine the best design for barriers and seat 
belts in school buses that carry from 10 to 24 passengers 
the nations 41000 small school buses do not have to meet 
federal standards set for larger buses the ntsb staff noted 
the board voted to call for installation of door latches that 
would prevent a buss front door from popping open in a crash it 
also urged federal testing of several possible improvements 
including lap and shoulder belts in front seats uniform barriers 
in front of the first seats and strengthened roofs and joints 
in multivehicle crashes and other crash scenarios small 
school buses lack the builtin crash advantage of superior size and 
weight provided by large school buses the board concluded 
but it also said investigation of 24 accidents involving the 
smaller buses showed that they generally provided good crash 
protection to both restrained and unrestrained passengers 
safety belts are required for passengers in small buses but the 
ntsb staff said many students do not use them and laponly belts in 
the front seat may add to the danger of injury in some crashes 
the board two years ago recommended against seat belts in larger 
buses since seats must be designed to form a padded compartment 
around youthful riders 
it said roofs in the smaller buses are less able to withstand 
rollover forces and body joints are exempt from federal joint 
strength standards that apply to larger buses 
the board in august sent back the staff study for revisions 
after failing to resolve questions over frontseat barriers and use 
of seat belts in the buses 
the staff proposed fullscale crash tests but the four board 
members present at the meeting refused to adopt that 
recommendation sledtests involve dummies on sliding devices that 
simulate conditions of a crash rather than the destruction of an 
actual school bus

avram brody had sought an airlift from palmdale calif to his 
family home in norwood mass so he could be with family members 
when he died the air force refused saying brody did not meet 
criteria for such help because he was not a uniformed officer the 
flight was not needed to save his life and his illness was not 
caused by his work 
dr abdallah farrukh who attended brody over the past several 
weeks said in a telephone interview from antelope valley calif 
that brody 25 died wednesday night of a brain tumor in his 
palmdale home

amy and a nurse have been attending him for the past several weeks 
the brody family enlisted the help of several us 
representatives along with sen john kerry dmass and white 
house aide andrew card a massachusetts native but the air force 
position remained unchanged 
another who worked on the case was brad pearson of the 
massachusetts office of handicapped affairs 
this ones a real sadness for the family its a heartbreaking 
time pearson said today im going to wonder probably for the

abortion rights leaders claim an 
unprecedented turnaround is putting antiabortion forces on the 
political run following defeats in the us house and a special 
legislative session in florida 
and in virginia democratic candidate for governor douglas 
wilder is challenging political wisdom on abortion by airing 
prochoice television ads aimed at winning support among 
conservative voters 
this is evidence that the antichoice minority no longer 
inspires fear in elected officials said kate michelman 
executive director of the national abortion rights action league 
leaders of the national abortion rights group today unveiled new 
tv and newspaper ads they are airing in the virginia governors 
race attacking the antiabortion republican nominee and said they 
planned extensive campaigns next year in races nationwide 
we are building a strength in the states that if we need one 
we can pass a constitutional amendment to protect abortion 
rights michelman said 
the house voted 216206 on wednesday to allow federal aid for 
abortions for poor women who are victims of rape or incest 
rejecting medicaid restrictions it has kept in the law since 1981 
it instead backed more liberal provisions already passed by the 
senate 
the vote was a defeat for conservatives and put congress in 
opposition to president bush who has promised to veto medicaid 
abortions 
rep patricia schroeder dcolo attributed the vote to an 
abortion rights movement galvanized by the supreme courts decision 
in july giving the states more power to restrict abortions 
the webster decision was a wakeup call she said 
rep henry hyde rill for years the leader of antiabortion 
forces in the house said house members are increasingly 
perceiving their constituencies as prochoice 
darla st martin leader of the national right to life 
committee said the vote opens the door to the use of tax funds 
to destroy innocent unborn babies and vowed that members who 
switched on the issue will now hear from constituents 
in tallahassee fla a special session of the state legislature 
called by gov bob martinez rejected a series of proposed 
restrictions on abortions that the republican governor sought 
a right having been established is not easily removed 
said tom gustafson floridas speaker of the house 
martinez appearing on abctvs good morning america 
program insisted today that most floridians wanted certain 
restrictions on abortions but that a handful of state legislators 
kept colleagues from voting on measures he had proposed 
they were rejected by killer committees they didnt get to 
the floor unlike the action taken by congress martinez said 
the florida session was the first in the nation since the july 3 
supreme court ruling gave the longstanding debate over abortion a 
fresh and relevant political focus 
florida was closely watched as a bellwether for the nation and 
more than 10000 demonstrators had descended upon its capital 
in virginia idependent polls show democratic gubernatorial 
candidate wilder overtaking his antiabortion opponent since he 
began airing a tough ad accusing republican marshall coleman of 
trying to take away womens right to a legal abortion even in 
cases of rape and incest 
coleman accused wilder of trying to spread fear fear from a 
single divisive issue the election is in four weeks 
michelman head of the national abortion rights group said the 
votes in florida and in congress are overwhelming evidence of the 
dramatic and unprecedented turnaround among elected officials on 
this issue 
she credited abortion rights demonstrators and dismissed the 
antiabortion forces as a small minority whose electoral bite 
does not match their bark 
supporters of expanded abortion rights argued the supreme 
courts ruling in the webster case mobilized their side by making 
the possibility of new abortion restrictions seem more likely and 
in the process prompted some abortion supporters to become 
singleissue voters just as some abortion opponents have been 
the provision adopted by the house would allow medicaid payments 
for abortions when the mothers life is in jeopardy or when the 
pregnancy resulted from rape or incest and was promptly 
reported to authorities 
since 1981 the house has voted for language allowing federal aid 
for abortions only in cases in which the womans life was in 
danger medicaid financing for poor womens abortions has been 
restricted in one way or another since 1977 
the abortion provision is part of a 1567 billion measure to 
finance labor health and education programs for fiscal 1990 which 
began oct 1 the spending bill which was approved 36456 now 
moves to the senate 
bush threatened in august to veto the bill if it contains the 
more liberal abortion language and administration officials 
reiterated that threat this week 
though the house vote was too narrow to override a veto 
supporters of broader abortion rights said changing public views in 
the wake of the supreme court ruling have given their side the 
momentum 
the political momentum on this issue is so strong now that if 
president bush vetoes this hed be making a big mistake said 
rep barbara boxer dcalif 
webster has changed the entire political equation said rep 
les aucoin dore who voted to broaden the abortion funding 
webster sent a signal to the country particularly women that 
the courts arent there that theyll have to rely on the political 
arena

panamanian officers who led last weeks 
abortive coup were recruited and paid more than 1 million by the 
us government gen manuel noriega charged in an interview 
published today 
noriega also claimed that nicaraguan contras and panamanian 
businessmen delivered money and relayed messages between us 
officials and coup plotters the los angeles times and the boston 
globe reported 
the united states was involved before during and after the 
coup noriega said in a joint interview they had to make the 
contacts woo them convince them its a lot of work before youve 
hooked the fish but they were the hook and the useful fools were 
the fish 
the contras put them in contact with the united states 
noriega said of the coup leaders 
the military ruler said that forces loyal to him detained 77 
rebel soldiers after the attempted coup previous reports said 37 
soldiers were arrested 
the two reporters conducting the interview received stern 
warnings from a noriega aide to avoid questioning noriega about 
allegations that 10 of those arrested have been executed the times 
said 
noriega according to the globe said that he had crushed two 
plots from within the defense forces the second being planned 
under the direction of col guillermo wong chief of intelligence 
and a member of noriegas general staff he said that on the day of 
the coup wong received several longdistance calls from an 
unidentified us military officer in washington he said wong is 
under arrest 
he also there was no truth to reports he had been detained 
during the coup attempt i dominated the situation totally he 
said when i started to talk with them it was all over 
noriega speaking in panama city panama accused everett e 
briggs the us national security councils senior director of 
latin american affairs of involvement in the failed coup 
briggs who has served as us ambassador to panama and 
honduras where the contras were based was linked to the coup 
because he visited panama shortly before the uprising noriega said 
there was no comment from briggs or any nsc official in the 
newspaper reports 
noriega said his investigators discovered the existence of a 
bank account containing more than 1 million in the name of capt 
erick a murillo one of the alleged coup leaders 
there was a lot of money there for a normal panamanian six 
zeroes it was a milliondollar account noriega said 
he claimed us officials gave murillo the money for bribes but 
would not identify the bank holding the alleged account 
murillo a member of the panama defense forces elite battalion 
2000 was one of 10 officers the government said was killed during 
the uprising 
noriega said one of the detained soldiers was found with 
700000 in cash allegedly used to bribe rankandfile soldiers 
he said the soldier remained in custody but refused to identify him 
he claimed the attempted coup was organized by 17 members of the 
panama defense forces noriega said 
he said several coup leaders had ties with contras established 
during attendance at the nicaraguan military academy before the 
leftist sandinistas overthrew nicaraguan leader anastasio somoza in 
1979 
noriega named panamanian maj moises giroldi vega the reputed 
leader of this months coup attempt and capt edgardo sandoval as 
onetime students of the nicaraguan military school 
he said sandoval was a classmate of luis alfonso moreno payan a 
member of the nicaraguan national guard who later joined the 
usbacked contras and operated under the name mike lima 
he said other contras and panamanian businessmen were involved 
but declined to name them 
asked how he could protect himself against any future coups 
noriega said 
the world was created with good men and bad abel didnt know 
cain was going to kill him the significance of this is that 
the defense forces now wears the long pants 
how do you consolidate an armed force on the basis of your 
errors

a lawyers organization and two consumer 
groups want the government to investigate a household drain cleaner 
they contend poses a risk of explosions that can cause serious 
injury 
but the manufacturer says the product is safe and effective 
when used in accordance with label instructions and accused the 
attorneys of trying to drum up business 
on any given occasion using the product is akin to playing 
russian roulette wrote russ herman president of the association 
of american trial lawyers in an oct 5 letter to the consumer 
product safety commission 
even by explicitly following the product instructions 
consumers may experience the risk of sudden violent explosion with 
tragic consequences to their health and safety herman said 
the name of the product is blacked out in a copy of the letter 
obtained by the associated press a source familiar with the 
letter speaking on condition of anonymity identified the product 
as red devil lye 
rhonda askew a denver woman who is disfigured and partially 
blind told a news conference today she was injured when a 
tablespoon of the drain cleaner blew back on me as she used it 
to clear a clogged bathroom sink 
i could see it coming but i couldnt get away from it said 
askew 
i dont know what it feels like to be happy i dont know 
joy she said describing how she has had 10 operations since the 
incident 
the lawyers association first contacted the commission about 
potential dangers associated with the product in august two 
consumer advocacy groups the consumer federation of america and 
public citizen also are seeking an investigation 
red devil lye is a crsytalline drain cleaner manufactured and 
distributed by a new yorkbased company boyle midway household 
products inc 
we have made repeated attempts to produce the explosive 
effect described by atla using the product according to label 
directions and have never seen such results said theodore host 
president of boyle midway in a written statement released 
wednesday 
atla is engaged in a transparent effort to promote the 
economic interests of its members by this blatant clientsoliciting 
effort said host 
atla is a 65000member organization of attorneys who frequently 
represent plaintiffs in personal injury cases 
atla said it found 21 instances when the lye exploded from 
drain pipes and injured users or bystanders in addition there 
were reported incidents of ingestion by small children with 
catastrophic results the letter said 
the risk of blindness or permanent eye impairment is high 
severe alkaline burns to the face arms and hands also are 
likely herman said 
we are convinced that this product which is intended to deal 
with a difficult household problem is safe and effective when used 
in accordance with label instructions said host 
any assertion that the product cannot be used safely by the 
consumer is wholly unwarranted host added noting the company 
warns on the label that lye is a dangerous product on the label 
david smeltzer head of the safety commissions compliance 
division said the commission had done preliminary investigations 
of two companies that make crystalline lye he said it revealed 
more instances of explosions with liquid sulfuric acid drain 
cleaners than with sodium hydroxide cleaners such as red devil lye 
if appropriate well try to take some other action he 
said the company said it was cooperating with the commission 
red devil sales reached about 6 million in 1988 for a 6 percent 
share of the drain cleaner market the company said

panama will not be allowed back into the group 
of eight organization of latin american nations until democracy is 
restored there president carlos menem of argentina said today 
his announcement came a day after the presidents of venezuela 
and peru broke with tradition at the regional summit and denounced 
panamas government which gen manuel antonio noriega effectively 
heads as a dictatorship 
the summit ends tonight 
menem told a news conference that a document released at the end 
of the meeting will outline the decision to continue panamas 
exclusion from the organization 
the central american country was suspended last year after 
noriega engineered the removal of civilian president eric delvalle 
after delvalle tried to fire him 
the final document also will include full backing for the 
struggle of the cocaproducing andean nations against the regions 
cocaine traffickers menem said 
one of the principal points the presidents agreed on was an 
allout war against drug trafficking and terrorism until they are 
liquidated he told reporters 
the leaders met under heavy security at the plush hotel las 
dunas on the outskirts of ica a city of 350000 people in the 
desert 180 miles southeast of lima 
in opening statements wednesday president carlos andres perez 
of venezuela said panamas military government is a masked 
dictatorship the comment came one day after he accused noriegas 
panama defense forces of murder in snuffing out a coup attempt oct 
3 
perus alan garcia host of the meeting used his opening 
remarks to express publicly the peruvian peoples and the 
peruvian governments repudiation and condemnation of the military 
dictatorship in panama 
their condemnations broke with the traditional reluctance of 
group of eight nations to publicly denounce a member at such 
meetings 
the summit began a day after garcia colombias virgilio barco 
and bolivias jaime paz zamora agreed to invite president bush to a 
drug summit in latin america that would take place within 90 days 
bush accepted immediately 
the three andean nations are the source of nearly all of the 
worlds cocaine 
perez and the other presidents made clear wednesday they did not 
share bushs focus on police action as the best way to fight the 
drug trade 
the more demand grows in the north the more production will 
grow in the south police actions will be useless unless demand is 
reduced perez said 
the problem is not only in medellin said president julio 
sanguinetti of uruguay referring to the colombian city that is 
home to the worlds largest cocaine cartel it is also in the 
streets of new york city 
the medellin cartel has virtually been at war with the colombian 
government since suspected drug assassins killed the countrys 
leading presidential candidate aug 18 
perez sanguinetti garcia barco and presidents jose sarney of 
brazil menem and carlos salinas de gortari of mexico took part in 
the third summit of the group of eight which was founded in 1987 
other topics on the summit agenda were central americas 
conflicts the regional foreign debt burden and environmental 
damage to the amazon

the city opera new yorks no 2 company behind 
the metropolitan canceled its fall season today and threatened to 
scratch its spring program unless its striking musicians agree to a 
contract by next month 
the 69member musicians union has been without a contract since 
june 1 and struck on sept 13 opening night of the fall season on 
saturday the union voted 564 to reject a pact and the opera said 
at the time that the season scheduled to end nov 19 would be 
canceled if the orchestra members did not return 
obviously we are extremely saddened by this development 
because it puts out of work hundreds of innocent people who rely on 
these jobs for their livelihood and whose representatives have 
urgently requested these parties to avoid this result martin 
oppenheimer the companys vice chairman and lead negotiator said 
today 
john glasel president of the union local said that the 
cancellation is regrettable and that the opera managements 
deadline for reaching a contract exemplifies the neanderthal 
negotiating style of the company 
the opera and its musicians have been divided over wages and the 
number of work weeks that orchestra members are guaranteed 
annually musicians earned 755 a week under the old contract 
established in 1943 the nonprofit city opera stages a broadway 
musical revival in the spring and begins its summer opera season in 
july

the memoirs of the man who marched beside the 
rev martin luther king jr depict him as a leader of outstanding 
moral character but who had a weakness for women even on the night 
before his assassination 
and the walls came tumbling down published this month by 
harper amp row chronicles the rev ralph david abernathys life as a 
preacher and civil rights activist including his many years as 
kings closest friend and confidant 
abernathy reveals that king had encounters with various women on 
the night before his april 4 1968 assassination at a memphis 
tenn hotel 
the revelation corroborates longstanding reports that king had 
extramarital affairs 
but in an advance copy of the book abernathy staunchly defends 
his friends morality without condoning his activities he 
explains that he felt compelled to write of my friends weakness 
for women and devotes part of one chapter in the 610page book 
to kings private affairs 
king believed in the biblical prohibition against sex outside 
of marriage it was just that he had a particularly difficult time 
with that temptation abernathy wrote we all fall short of the 
mark sexual sins are by no means the worst hatred and a cold 
disregard for others are the besetting sins of our time 
abernathy said he might have avoided the matter had others not 
dealt with it in detail 
he said he wanted to make some attempt to render justice to 
the dead without causing too much unnecessary pain to the living 
abernathy names none of the women with whom king allegedly was 
involved he said extended travels during the civil rights movement 
were one reason but not the main one for kings extramarital 
liaisons 
he was a man who attracted women even when he didnt 
intend to and attracted them in droves abernathy said he was 
a hero the greatest hero of his age and women are always 
attracted to a hero 
abernathy praised his friend for courage saying had king been 
a coward rather than a truly brave man we might still be riding 
in the back of buses and eating in segregated restaurants 
he also said he felt other king aides saw him as no more than 
an appendage to martin someone who served as a part companion 
part bodyguard but who never played an important role in the 
decisions that affected the direction of the movement 
abernathy said those people did not realize how much king 
depended on him for advice and counsel outside the limelight 
detailing the night before kings assassination abernathy wrote 
that after kings i have been to the mountaintop address king 
abernathy and a colleague went to the home of a friend of 
martins 
abernathy saw king and the friend come out of the bedroom after 
1 am according to the books advance copy 
later that night back at the lorraine motel king got together 
with a black woman a member of the kentucky legislature 
with whom he shared a close relationship abernathy wrote he 
added that king did not return to the room he shared with abernathy 
until after 7 am 
that morning king asked abernathy to mediate a dispute between 
king and a third woman another young woman martin knew well 
who apparently had come looking for king in the middle of the night 
and couldnt find him in an ensuing argument king shouted at the 
woman and knocked her across the bed abernathy wrote 
the kentucky legislature had two black women members in 1968 
sen georgia powers and rep mae street kidd democrats from 
louisville 
powers who participated in civil rights demonstrations with 
king was at the lorraine motel the night of his assassination on 
wednesday she said she had not read the book and was advised by her 
lawyer not to comment until she had 
she did not immediately return a call to her home today 
kidd who also is no longer in the legislature said king was 
a great man but he was not a personal friend of mine i did 
not participate in any of the marches nor was i in memphis 
tennessee at the time he was there 
abernathy also wrote he saw no evidence that king was disturbed 
by fbi audio tapes of one of his sexual encounters or the knowledge 
that fbi agents were spreading tales about his activity 
in fact he seemed less concerned about public exposure than i 
was abernathy wrote at that particular time he was bearing a 
lions share of the burden and he felt he couldnt do so without 
this source of strength 
stoney johnson a spokesman at the martin luther king jr center 
for nonviolent social change in atlanta said he believed kings 
widow coretta scott king and other family members had not yet 
read abernathys book 
a call to mrs kings office at the center was not immediately 
returned

the legislatures flatout rejection of 
new abortion curbs may give women their best political springboard 
since the 60s feminists say but antiabortion activists say 
they too will be galvanized 
it has fanned the fire said florida right to life president 
ken connor its one thing to disappoint people its another 
thing to slap them in the face thats what the legislature has 
done 
in the nations first major attempt to take advantage of a us 
supreme court ruling in july allowing new curbs on abortion the 
legislature adjourned wednesday without passing any of the measures 
pushed by gov bob martinez 
florida has just sent a message to the nation said eleanor 
smeal president of the fund for a feminist majority and a former 
president of the national organization for women 
more than 10000 demonstrators descended upon floridas capital 
as the democraticcontrolled legislature shot down 14 proposals to 
curb abortion 
martinez appearing on abctvs good morning america 
insisted today that most floridians wanted certain restrictions on 
abortions but that a handful of legislators kept colleagues from 
voting on measures he had proposed 
they were rejected by killer committees they didnt get to 
the floor unlike the action taken by congress he said 
the proposals would have banned use of public funds for 
abortions required a husbands consent made women wait a week and 
undergo counseling before the operation created a statewide center 
to promote adoption and required viability tests of the fetus if a 
woman was believed to be 20 weeks pregnant 
other measures killed would have toughened clinic regulations 
an idea lawmakers had given the best chance of approval after three 
south florida clinics were closed by the state for unsanitary and 
unsafe conditions 
the defeat had been predicted by democratic leaders who said the 
firstterm republican governor knew it would happen 
he wasted taxpayers money to make a political statement that 
he felt was going to help him said democratic state chairman 
simon ferro we ought to be embarrassed that the governor put us 
through this whole fiasco 
opponents said the special session which began tuesday cost 
more than 145000 
martinez who faces reelection in 1990 conceded his initiative 
had faltered badly 
i dont think its a moment for rejoicing said martinez 
if anything its a moment of sadness 
but arthur j kropp president of people for the american way 
action fund a liberal political group said the legislatures 
actions would make politicians across the country pay attention to 
their constituents 
todays victory will be a rude wakeup call for politicians 
hoping to score points at the polls by rolling back reproductive 
freedom kropp said legislators in other states should take 
heed prochoice politics is winning politics even in conservative 
states 
patricia ireland vice president of now said the whole exercise 
had the possibly unintended result of energizing younger 
previously apathetic women to fight for their rights 
this is creating a new wave of feminism that we have not had 
since the 1960s ireland said this is one of those junctures 
where the political climate has clearly changed 
smeal said abortion rights organizations hoped to turn the new 
interest into political gains by recruiting more women to run for 
national state and local office 
state rep elaine gordon a leader of the abortionrights forces 
in the legislature said the florida experience can serve as a

the hardline communist party chief of beijing 
intensified the assault on political reforms with a call for direct 
party decisionmaking in universities and local government reports 
said thursday 
political principles should be the key factor in making 
decisions the beijing daily quoted the citys party secretary li 
ximing as telling a local committee meeting 
party branches also should be involved in all decisions in 
factories even such small matters as firing and allocating staff 
li said 
it was the second attack in as many days in the beijing daily on 
the political reform program endorsed by the party in 1987 that 
called for separating the functions of the ruling party and 
government and reducing interference of party officials in 
business and other nonparty matters 
a major commentary in the paper wednesday charged that such 
separation weakened the party and blamed the reform program on 
ousted party general secretary zhao ziyang even though it 
originally was backed by senior leader deng xiaoping 
the communist party long has maintained a shadow bureaucracy in 
government and business with party officials supervising and 
frequently taking charge of all decisions 
in the reform atmosphere of the past decade however excessive 
party inteference was condemned and the power of party branches 
were weakened in many units 
in a major speech endorsed by the party in 1987 zhao said 
separating party and government roles and letting factory managers 
take charge of production was essential for chinas development 
but since zhaos ouster in june for allegedly supporting massive 
prodemocracy protests strengthening the party has become the 
leaderships no 1 goal 
the beijing daily quoted li as saying the party must bring 
into full play the powerful fighting force of the party branches 
in universities street party committees that function as 
district organs and party committees at village level and below 
the party will not participate in decision making but make the 
decisions he said 
street committees and village committees are the most basic 
level of local government and have wide powers over job and 
housing assignments 
enterprise managers should get agreement of party officials 
before hiring or firing personnel li added in dismissing 
enterprise officials the party organization should act based on 
political ideology but should fully respect the administrative 
leaders views regarding ability 
organizations at all levels of a ruling party must shoulder 
the responsibility of managing nonparty officials he said 
he also called for closer party involvement in the work of 
chinas many mass organizations including labor unions and 
womens assocations so that they can follow the right political 
direction

jiang zemin a technocrat plucked from relative 
obscurity to head the worlds largest communist party is being 
remolded by party propagandists into a brilliant leader and man of 
the masses 
the glorification of the 63yearold former mayor and party boss 
of shanghai follows deng xiaopings decision to make jiang his 
successor as chinas top leader 
some chinese and foreign observers compare the laurels being 
heaped on jiang to the treatment given hua guofeng after a dying 
mao tsetung purportedly told him in 1976 with you in charge 
im at ease 
hua like jiang a local administrator untested in national 
politics was hailed as chinas wise leader until deng 
consolidated power in the late 1970s and hua was unceremoniously 
consigned to political oblivion 
jiang was the surprise choice to head the 48 millionmember 
communist party after the factionriven party on june 24 ousted 
zhao ziyang a relative reformist accused of aiding the 
prodemocracy student movement crushed earlier that month 
deng was believed to have picked jiang because he supported 
dengs opendoor policies while being ready to comply with the 
party hardliners tough crackdown on domestic dissent 
despite the nature of his rise to power the party has worked 
hard to dispel the impression of dissension in the ranks by 
declaring national unity behind jiangs astute leadership 
the party propaganda department on sept 30 called on all 
chinese to study jiangs address to mark the 40th anniversary of 
communist rule on oct 1 saying it will have an important 
bearing on the unity of the whole party the whole army and people 
of all nationalities 
the turgid 80minute address summed up the partys stance on the 
correctness of crushing the prodemocracy movement or 
counterrevolutionary rebellion the supremacy of socialism and 
the inviolability of communist party rule 
since then official newspapers and television news programs 
have been filled with reports of schools factories and local party 
groups meeting to read and discuss jiangs speech the words of 
praise are universal and remarkably similar 
yang baibing head of the general political department in the 
peoples liberation army said the speech is the crystallization 
of the collective wisdom of the party central committee party 
members in hubei province said jiangs words embody the firmness 
clarity and continuity of the partys theory and line 
deng 85 and reportedly in failing health is said to have 
anointed jiang in a closeddoor speech this june by referring to 
him as the core of the new leadership 
premier li peng a likely rival in any future power struggle 
chimed in last week by telling foreign businessmen that jiang had 
rich experience in political and economic work and we support 
him as the core of our leadership 
government spokesman yuan mu in a commentary in the partys 
official peoples daily this week also confirmed the third 
generation of communist party leadership was firmly in control 
with jiang as the core 
jiang a cosmopolitan man who speaks varying degrees of english 
japanese and russian and appears at ease in western attire with 
western businessmen is also being remade into a folksy maosuited 
man of the masses 
on national day oct 1 jiang made a surprise stop at the 
fuxingmen intersection scene of many deaths during the june 34 
military attack on dissidents in the city to chat with the people 
much like soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs fleshpressing 
tours jiang chatted with soldiers and children congratulated 
newlyweds posed for pictures and as he left shouted comrades 
see you again let us work with one heart to build up the country 
the peoples daily in august pictured jiang in shirtsleeves 
sharing a factory cafeteria meal with a worker and reported that 
while touring a shanghai steel factory he led the workers in the 
song we workers have strength 
when a worker at a textile factory showed reluctance to shake 
with his oilcovered hand jiang grabbed his hand and said never 
mind from now on we must rely on you workers 
since taking office jiang has traveled to yenan the red armys 
former revolutionary base in dusty northwestern china and talked 
with farmers in rural hubei and shaanxi provinces 
jiangs square blackrimmed glasses gray hair and ready smile 
have helped convey an avuncular image and when the occasion calls 
for it he has shown a knack for appearing broadminded 
in a meeting with students who had returned from abroad jiang 
said it was understandable that some chinese students overseas were 
misled by the western press and engaged in prodemocracy protests 
those who correct their mistakes will be welcomed back he said 
men are not saints so how can they be free from faults 
yet when asked at a recent news conference about the crackdown 
on the protesters which followed weeks of protests in beijings 
tiananmen square smiles were quickly replaced with a sharply 
worded recitation of the partys uncompromising stance 
the military suppression of the student movement during which 
hundreds perhaps thousands were killed was not a tragedy 
jiang said 
tiananmen was a counterrevolutionary rebellion opposing the 
communist party leaders and seeking to overthrow the socialist 
system he said

a melee of flying chairs and swinging 
sticks broke out in front of the altar thursday as pope john paul 
ii was finishing his blessing to a crowd of 100000 in dili 
capital of east timor 
four women were reported hospitalized with injuries suffered 
after being crushed in the surging crowd during the battle between 
plainclothes police and chanting youths who oppose indonesian 
control of the former portuguese colony 
no arrests were reported and the pope did not appear to be in 
danger at any time 
the trouble began when about 20 young men shouting viva 
independence and viva il papa unfurled a banner in front of 
the altar and hurled chairs at policemen 
plainclothesmen flogged the youths and seized their banner the 
crowd scattered and about 100 more young man joined the fray 
police confiscated the film of some photographers after the 
fighting ended about 15 minutes later 
one banners read in portuguese fretilin welcomes you 
another said john paul savior of east timor fretilin is the 
independence movement that has fought indonesian rule since 
annexation in 1976 
a nonindonesian priest said it was clear the protesters 
respected the pope because they did not act until the mass was over 
in a similar incident in april 1987 leftists opposed to the 
chilean government threw rocks at police during a papal mass in 
santiago security forces responded with tear gas some of which 
wafted toward the alter 
on thursday whitecassocked priests and seminarians moved 
quickly to calm the crowd and the pope was escorted to his car 
surrounded by vatican and indonesian security men john paul is on 
a 10day tour of south korea indonesia and mauritius 
during four days in indonesia the pontiff has urged the 
government of the worlds most populous moslem nation to protect 
human rights in east timor the local roman catholic church and the 
human rights group amnesty international say violations include 
mass arrests torture and disappearances 
the protesters supporters of fretilin got to within 100 feet 
of the steps of the altar where the pope watched in sweltering 
heat that reached 100 degrees 
girl scouts who had acted as ushers in front of the altar wept 
as they were caught up in the melee 
in his homily john paul made no direct mention of indonesian 
rule over east timor which neither the vatican nor united nations 
recognizes but referred instead to those who have responsibility 
for life in east timor 
respect for the rights which render life more human must be 
firmly ensured the rights of individuals and the rights of 
families he declared 
john paul urged indonesia to act with wisdom and good will 
toward all in the search for a peaceful solution to east timors 
problems 
on his arrival from the island of flores the pope did not kiss 
the ground a gesture that would have been viewed as acknowledging 
east timor was a separate country 
he did kneel and kiss a crucifix lying on a pillow on the ground 
beneath the altar however and the crowd applauded a vatican 
spokesman called that a purely pastoral gesture meaning it had 
no political significance 
monsignor carlos belo bishop of dili told reporters the mass 
site had been the scene of killings by the indonesian military 
which used it as an interrogation center at the height of the 
rebellion after annexation 
belo an outspoken prelate who has proposed a referendum to 
determine the islands political future said the ground would be 
sanctified by the papal mass 
the pontiff said the east timorese had experienced destruction 
and death as a result of conflict 
you have known what it means to be victims of hatred and 
struggle he said many innocent people have died while others 
have been prey to retaliation and revenge for too long you have 
been suffering a lack of stability which had rendered your future 
uncertain 
a military garrison officially estimated at 13000 is stationed 
in east timor the army admits to thousands of casualties in 
guerrilla warfare since annexation but claims only about 200 
guerrillas now operate in the hinterland 
indonesia has 157 moslems and only 5 million catholics but 80 
percent of east timors 590000 people are catholic 
navy landing craft transported thousands of catholic villagers 
to dili but the turnout was far lower than expected foreign 
priests said people feared the roadblocks set up for identity 
checks about every 12 miles

lebanese lawmakers reached preliminary 
agreement today on a peace plan for their country but christian 
leader gen michel aoun rejected the plan and vowed to continue his 
war with syrian troops 
radio stations said the plan calls for at least a partial 
withdrawal of syrian troops from lebanon and a limit on the powers 
of the christian president 
conference sources said a parliamentary committee led by house 
speaker hussein husseini agreed on the phrasing of the plan after a 
roundtheclock debate attended by the foreign ministers of saudi 
arabia morocco and algeria 
the committee broke up in the morning and was scheduled to meet 
again later to present its draft agreement to the 63 legislators 
meeting in taif 
the sources speaking on condition of anonymity would not 
elaborate on the tentative accord but najah wakim an orthodox 
christian and hassan rifai a moslem told reporters they were 
optimistic after the overnight session 
but aoun said later we cannot rebuild our country under the 
shadow of an occupying force 
let those deputies understand that our lebanons sovereignty 
and independence are not a matter for bargaining and negotiation 
he said in a speech carried on voice of lebanon radio he vowed to 
pursue his war of liberation against syria which has 40000 
troops stationed in lebanon 
lebanese radio stations earlier quoted deputies as saying 
differences over presidential powers and the issue of syrias 
military presence in lebanon had been resolved 
the radio stations attributed the progress to the mediation of 
the three foreign ministers supervising the talks prince saud 
alfaisal of saudi arabia moroccos abdellatif alfilali and 
algerias ahmed ghozaly 
the three countries are grouped in an arab league committee 
entrusted with finding a settlement to lebanons 14yearold civil 
war 
the voice of people a prosyrian station in beirut and the 
voice of lebanon said the committee today approved a timetable for 
a limited and phased syrian withdrawal from lebanon they gave 
no details 
voice of the people said that although the president will 
continue to be a maronite catholic his powers will be curtailed 
he will no longer have the power to issue general amnesties or 
dissolve parliament at will a head of state will be able to 
dissolve the 99seat parliament only once during his sixyear term 
it said 
he also will no longer be the commander in chief of the armed 
forces instead the military command will report directly to the 
cabinet traditionally headed by a sunni moslem 
once a new head of state is elected a committee grouping the 
president prime minister and parliament speaker usually a shiite 
moslem will be formed to work on abolishing the sectarian system 
of government the radio said 
lebanon has been without a head of state since former president 
amin gemayels term ended sept 22 1988 
under the sectarian system in force since independence from 
france in 1943 christians mainly the maronites have dominated 
lebanons parliament government army and judiciary 
christians were once considered the majority in lebanon now 
moslems make up 55 percent of the 4 million people 
the meeting in taif began sept 30 
the arab committee had first proposed that syria complete a 
phased withdrawal from the beirut area within two years 
it offered no timetable or guarantees for a complete withdrawal 
of the syrian contingent in lebanon under a 1976 arab league 
mandate it linked it to an israeli pullout from south lebanon and 
the conclusion of a lebanesesyrian security pact 
the christians who fought the syrians this year for six months 
until an arab league ceasefire halted the bloodshed sept 22 
rejected the proposal 
they conceded a quick pullout would leave a security vacuum and 
allow unruly militias to take over but insisted two years was too 
long for a withdrawal from beirut they demanded a timetable for 
withdrawal from northern and eastern lebanon 
moslems rejected any pullout of their syrian protectors until 
political reforms curtailing the domination of christians in 
lebanon have been enforced

an appeals court today threw out the 
conviction of a career criminal accused of fatally shooting prime 
minister olof palme three years ago hours later the defendant was 
freed from prison 
judge birgitta blom of the svea court of appeals said the court 
ruled there was not enough evidence to show that christer 
pettersson stalked and killed palme as the swedish leader left a 
movie theater with his wife feb 28 1986 
pettersson was sentenced to life in prison and had been jailed 
in isolation since december 
im surprised i never really believed i would be acquitted 
although i am innocent pettersson 42 told the national tt news 
agency after leaving the kronoberg prison with his lawyer and a 
police escort 
ms blom the president of the appellate court told swedish 
radio the decision to overturn the conviction was unanimous 
the decision is the culmination of a sensational case that 
authorities have been accused of bungling since its inception 
police for a year pursued a series of vastly different conspiracy 
theories before prosecuting pettersson a drug and alcohol abuser 
with a long and varied criminal record 
pettersson was convicted in july even though no motive was 
established no weapon was found and no witnesses testified to 
seeing the swede fire five shots at the dynamic leader on a 
darkened street 
the appellate court judgment may be referred to the swedish 
supreme court but because the high court usually agrees only to 
hear cases that could form legal precedent legal experts have said 
it probably would not hear petterssons case 
in addition experts had said if the conviction were overturned 
it would be virtually impossible to find palmes killer since all 
the witnesses police could find pointed to pettersson as the man 
they saw at the crime scene 
petterssons threeweek appeal hearing was presided over by a 
jury of three laymen and four professional jurors the hearing 
ended monday 
the court had set nov 2 for announcing its verdict but the 
national news agency tt said the jury concluded in only three days 
that the investigation into the case was insufficient for a 
conviction 
the written verdict will be released nov 2 
palme was a fourterm prime minister and a dominant figure in 
the international socialist and disarmament movements he also was 
a un mediator in the iraniraq war 
the conviction by a tribunal of six laymen and two professional 
judges was based largely on the identification of pettersson by 
palmes widow lisbeth palme who was walking home with her husband 
when he was shot from behind at close range 
mrs palme said she saw pettersson standing a few feet away 
after her husband was shot she was grazed by a bullet and slightly 
wounded 
several other witnesses said they saw pettersson apparently 
waiting for the palmes to emerge from the theater 
but no one saw pettersson with a gun and police failed to 
produce any forensic evidence to link him to the shooting 
pettersson denied shooting palme and said he was not in central 
stockholm when the killing took place at 1121 pm 
one witness testified to seeing pettersson at a train station 
far from the shooting scene at the time of the slaying 
the two judges in the trial voted for acquittal but the six 
laymen voted to convict 
the initial investigation into the slaying focused on a series 
of conspiracy theories most centered on kurdish militants others 
centered on iranian or iraqi government assassins and still another 
focused on a secret cadre of rightwing police officers upset with 
palmes leftist politics all were dismissed as essentially 
groundless 
four hours before palme was shot the files of a tax 
investigation against him disappeared in a breakin at the county 
administrative appeals court all computer files were obliterated 
and all documents were stolen no connection with the killing was 
ever established 
the botched probe resulted in a series of resignations and 
firings the befuddling case has developed an aura of mystery that 
has been likened to the doubts that still haunt the assassination 
of former president john f kennedy 
several top police officials and justice minister annagreta 
leijon eventually were forced to resign because of their 
involvement in an unauthorized privately led investigation into 
the case

president bush took time out today from 
affairs of state to boost a republican candidate involved in a 
tough battle to keep a mississippi congressional seat held by the 
gop for 16 years 
in his return to the campaign trail bush echoed themes that 
served him well in the 1988 presidential election citing 
republican tom andersons devotion to traditional values 
the president also emphasized andersons long experience as a 
congressional aide and his service as ambassador to barbados which 
bush said made him a point man in the drug interdiction effort 
bush also noted that he has accepted the invitation of the 
presidents of colombia bolivia and peru the source countries for 
cocaine sold in the united states to attend a drug summit within 
90 days 
ive instructed my administration to prepare for a summit that 
will bring us to a new level of international cooperation in this 
war we must win bush told an audience of several thousand as 
long as i am president i will give as much support as he needs to 
president virgilio barco of colombia who is waging an allout 
fight against drug lords 
later bush was attending a reception and dinner for gop mayoral 
candidate rudolph giuliani in new york 
he also was flying to the newark nj airport to meet briefly 
with rep james courter the republican gubernatorial nominee and 
then attend a new york reception for rep guy molinari who is 
running for borough president of staten island 
bush told an outdoor rally in gulfport that as a longtime aide 
to former congressman and nowsen trent lott rmiss anderson 
knows the back roads of the fifth district just as he knows 
the corridors of capitol hill 
anderson 43 is running against democratic state sen gene 
taylor for the seat left vacant by the death of rep larkin smith 
rmiss in an august plane crash taylor bested anderson in the 
oct 3 open primary and is the favorite in tuesdays special 
election 
you know tom and all of you know what makes southern 
mississippi what it is mississippi values traditional values tom 
andersons values bush told the hometown crowd 
bush also used the event to echo what aides said tuesday he 
will attend a drug summit with leaders of the andean nations of 
colombia bolivia and peru 
he praised the citizens of gulfport themselves hit by hurricane 
camille 20 years ago for their relief efforts in the wake of 
hurricane hugo 
the mississippi race is seen as a tough one for anderson a 
longtime aide to trent lott the states republican senator who 
served in the house before his 1988 election to the senate 
the runoff election between anderson and taylor is a highstakes 
contest for both democrats and republicans who have held the seat 
for 16 years it is the latest in a handful of special elections 
around the country this year that serve as opening skirmishes for 
the 1990 national elections and the gops perpetual battle to wrest 
control of congress away from the democrats 
anderson has spent heavily reporting 447700 in spending by 
the end of september not including large television advertising 
buys just prior to the oct 3 primary election in the 5th 
congressional district 
but taylor who spent 88606 through sept 27 outpolled 
anderson and a third candidate in the primary election indicating 
what democrats say is a shift away from the republican habit 
anderson has touted his longtime experience in the district as 
lotts aide and taylor is relying on his legislative experience 
in new jersey white house advance aides said they were setting 
up todays planned meeting with courter at the airport recent 
polls showed courter lagging 14 to 23 points behind rep james 
florio the democratic candidate for governor 
in new york bush appears tonight for giuliani whose bid to 
beat democrat david dinkins the manhattan borough president in 
the mayoral contest is lagging 
democrats outnumber republicans 51 in the city and dinkins is 
widely considered a shooin although giuliani began the race well 
ahead of both incumbent mayor ed koch and dinkins in the polls 
a series of missteps and revelations have led to his slide 
including disclosure that his law firm was on retainer for the 
government of panama and incidents that agitated the jewish 
community most recently comedian jackie mason a key supporter 
was accused of making ethnic slurs against dinkins and stereotyping 
jews 
dinkins also ran into ethnic criticism leading to his 
announcement wednesday in washington that campaign aide jitu weusi 
would leave in the wake of criticism by the antidefamation league 
of bnai brith 
the bnai brith said weusi once referred to jews as vile 
moneychangers and shylocks and also wrote scores of 
antisemitic articles 
dinkins toured capitol hill on wednesday receiving a warm 
welcome from congressional leaders and meeting also with bushs 
secretary of housing and urban development jack kemp on housing

the writing was on the wall but not the 
bathroom wall and now arthur hill high schools openstall policy 
is history 
the saginaw board of education agreed last week to add doors to 
the schools toilet stalls after pleas from two students 
the doors were removed in 1974 because of vandalism but 
superintendent foster b gibbs said malicious damage is no longer a 
problem 
student council president randon d morford cited a 1987 case at 
another school in which state department of civil rights lawyers 
threatened to go to court 
we are prepared to do whatever it takes to get doors on those 
stalls and to protect our rights of privacy he said 
senior martin schreader said students have been known to fake 
illness so they can leave the building and find a restroom with 
doors on the stalls 
the board agreed to have a plan in place within three weeks 
if there is not a safety or security factor i recommend that 
the doors be put on in all haste said trustee michael l kiefer 
there is a matter of personal dignity and privacy

prime minister yitzhak shamir said thursday a 
meeting of the israeli and egyptian foreign ministers to revive 
middle east peace efforts proposed by the united states was an 
inflated and unnecessary idea 
it was his first response to the suggestion last week by 
secretary of state james a baker iii in connection with the 
egyptian proposal for a meeting in cairo between israel and a 
palestinian delegation 
in baghdad iraq plo sources said chairman yasser arafat would 
be under pressure from other palestinian leaders at a meeting next 
week to take a tough line on palestinianisraeli talks 
shamir said in a speech in the raanana suburb of tel aviv that 
israel wants to meet with palestinians to discuss procedures for 
elections in the occupied west bank and gaza strip a key element 
of an israeli peace plan set forth in april 
he added however we dont need to involve ministers 
foreign ministers or heads of state it should be a technical 
discussion this has been turned into inflated into something 
politically big into some big event 
his remarks were broadcast on israel radio 
shamir who leads the rightwing likud bloc repeated israels 
refusal to involve the palestine liberation organization a serious 
obstacle to starting negotiations israel defines the plo as a 
terrorist group 
israeli media quoting sources in washington said american 
leaders were growing impatient with israels failure to respond to 
the latest peace proposals 
the daily haaretz said state department officials sent sharp 
messages citing the latest pronouncements of hardliners in 
shamirs party who oppose meeting with palestinians in cairo 
foreign minister moshe arens told israeli reporters thursday 
however that he does not have the impression baker has run out 
of patience israel radio reported 
egypt proposed an israelipalestinian meeting as a way of 
bridging differences between israel and the plo over israels plan 
for elections to choose palestinians to negotiate with the israelis 
the plo objected that the israeli plan did not guarantee 
palestinians an independent state after a proposed fiveyear period 
of palestinian selfrule in the territories which israel has 
occupied since the 1967 war 
israels cabinet leadership rejected egypts proposals oct 6 on 
a tie vote of six likud members and six from the labor party which 
is the other partner in the coalition government and supports the 
egyptian approach 
baker subsequently telephoned arens and esmat abdelmeguid the 
egyptian foreign minister and proposed they meet in washington to 
find a compromise way of choosing a palestinian delegation 
the sources in the iraqi capital said the palestinian central 
council to begin meeting on sunday will put pressure on arafat to 
reject any attempt to exclude the plo from peace talks with israel 
a senior council member told the associated press privately that 
radical factions called the meeting to stop arafat from accepting 
egyptian and us efforts toward a middle east peace effort that 
might not include the plo 
we havent endorsed the socalled mubarak plan and we will 
never accept a plan short of full plo participation in any peace 
process he said 
the marxist democratic front for the liberation of palestine and 
the popular front for the liberation of palestine the largest plo 
factions after arafats own fatah have denounced the egyptian 
proposals

themselves they filled plastic bags with bottles but surfaced 
right into the arms of police birger monsen of the state liquor 
monopoly vinmonopolet as told the dagbladet daily

britains chancellor of the exchequer 
said thursday he will continue a policy of increasing interest 
rates to curb inflation and he brushed aside fears the economy is 
heading into recession 
addressing the annual conference of prime minister margaret 
thatchers conservative party chancellor of the exchequer nigel 
lawson ignored pressure to link the pound to other major european 
currencies through the european monetary system 
inevitably people ask whether there is an alternative to high 
interest rates at the present time said lawson bluntly the 
answer is that there is no alternative and the policy will work 
the fourday conference which ends friday has been 
overshadowed by lawsons decision last week to raise interests 
rates to an eightyear high of 15 percent hitting businesses and 
millions of home buyers 
lawsons tactic of using high interest rates to curb inflation 
and to try to keep the pound steady against the west german mark 
has prompted renewed demands to put the british currency into the 
exchange rate mechanism of the european monetary system 
the european monetary system links the currencies of eight of 
the 12 common market nations in order to prevent wide swings in 
exchange rate movements 
lawson made no mention of the issue in his speech but later in 
broadcast interviews he repeated the conservative governments 
position that it would join the mechanism when it felt the time is 
right he wouldnt be drawn on what the timetable might be 
mrs thatcher who was seated alongside lawson as he addressed 
the 9000 delegates has set stringent conditions for british entry 
to the european currencystabilizing system they include a 
lowering in britains 73 inflation rate and that other member 
countries must like britain allow totally free movement of 
capital 
the financial markets were soothed by lawsons speech the 
markets were watching it closely because of a recent sharp drop in 
the pound despite last weeks interest rate hike 
the pound rose to 15520 from 15425 late wednesday and 
dipped slightly to 29597 west german marks from 29632 marks 
the financial timesstock exchange 100share index finished 19 
points or 09 percent higher at 22378 
lawson who was loudly applauded said he has no easy 
answers 
but i give you this pledge i will continue to take whatever 
action is needed however unpopular it may be to keep our economy 
sound and strong he added 
the confederation of british industry britains main business 
group said lawsons approach was exactly what the situation 
demanded 
the opposition labor party jibed that lawson merely rehashed 
failed policies and the trades union congress the national labor 
federation accused him of complacency 
general secretary norman willis urged british membership in the 
exchange rate mechanism 
foreign secretary john major said britain should not be 
defensive about its common sense approach to the 12nation 
european economic community 
for it is we who have breathed new life into it the 
community major said it is our show the community is 
carrying out our program 
in another development transport secretary cecil parkinson said 
britain will build a 310 million air traffic control center he 
said the facility to be completed in the 1990s will enable 
britain to handle 50 percent more flights

about 45 law officers were assigned to 
keep the peace at racially tense minor high school today after a 
melee in which the principal and a teenager were stabbed and six 
students arrested 
students had to pass through a metal detector and go directly to 
class bypassing their usual gathering places including the 
lunchroom that white and black students turned into a battleground 
wednesday 
during the brawl a teacher fired shots into the air to restore 
order teenagers sprayed mace on schoolmates and some teachers 
and coaches fought students authorities and witnesses said 
there was mass confusion running and screaming everywhere 
said police sgt ronald benson who was knocked down and sprayed 
with mace 
officers today arrested two teenagers outside and confiscated 
beer a bb gun crowbars and spiked gloves and wristbands 
sheriffs lt earl patterson said the two did not appear to be 
students at minor 
principal judson jones who suffered a twoinch knife cut to his 
abdomen said a biracial committee of parents will look for 
solutions to the problems 
we want to address them and get back to the real job of being 
here thats to educate the kids we seem to have lost that he 
said 
some students and police said conflict among the schools 967 
students stemmed partly from black gang activity and what blacks 
viewed as taunting by whites the school northwest of birmingham is 
about 25 percent black 
william james a 17yearold black senior said the fight broke 
out when a white dressed like the black rock guitarist jimmy 
hendrix with dirt on his hands to make them look black 
he said blacks were sent to the lunchroom and whites to the gym 
but as many as 50 whites entered the lunchroom in a straight line 
with all these wepaons mace and forks it just went off they 
jumped all these black people who were eating 
theres always been racial trouble here he said they 
didnt want us here anyway 
david doren a 16yearold white said when the whites went into 
the lunchroom blacks started hollering and started walking 
around us we stood up and everybody started fighting 
doren said that when a white student walks down a hall alone 
four or five blacks will jump on him they will find a person 
walking down the hall and run and jump on him 
its going to keep on going he said weve got to get rid 
of the gangs to stop it 
a black senior 17yearold bellamy johnson said blacks had 
objected to the suspension of blacks for cutting their names into 
their hair 
johnny drummonds a 17yearold white was stabbed in the 
shoulder he received stitches at a hospital and returned to school 
six students were arrested said frank rogers chief sheriffs 
deputy he said five were to be charged with rioting and the sixth 
was to be charged with assault with intent to murder 
a teacher who fired shots into the air in an attempt to quell 
the disturbance was sent home and faces disciplinary action said 
nez calhoun spokeswoman for the school board the teacher had 
carried the gun because of earlier problems an unidentified 
witness told the birmingham postherald

the state department urged un officials 
thursday to continue as aggressively as possible their 
investigation into allegations that namibian guerrillas have 
committed human rights abuses against fellow rebels for more than a 
decade 
department spokesman margaret tutwiler said the united states is 
pleased that martti ahtisaari the un special representative in 
namibia has pursued the allegations made against the rebels of the 
southwest africa peoples organization known as swapo 
ahtisaari said at a news conference in windhoek namibia on 
wednesday that he has been unable so far to verify reports that 
swapo members imprisoned tortured and killed hundreds from their 
own ranks since 1977 
in visits to swapo camps in angola and zambia the un team 
said it could not find a single detainee among the 1100 cases it 
is investigating 
but tutwiler said 315 people of the 1100 have not yet been 
found 
we note that his report states categorically that the 
investigation will continue tutwiler said we are concerned at 
this large number of persons unaccounted for and encourage untag 
the united nations transition assistance group to pursue their 
cases and any others that may come to its attention as aggressively 
as possible she said 
swapo leaders she said have admitted their organization 
detained certain persons it regards as spies sent by south 
africa swapo must provide a full accounting for those persons 
immediately tutwiler said 
swapo is expected to win a majority in the nov 7 elections in 
which namibians are to elect an assembly to draft a constitution 
for the independence of their country a former un trust 
territory governed by south africa 
swapo waged a guerrilla war against south africa for 23 years 
that ended last april when the parties agreed to a unsponsored 
plan that spells out steps that are to lead to independence for the 
mineralrich country

members of the world psychiatric 
association gathered thursday at a conference to decide whether to 
readmit colleagues from the soviet union 
the international professional body for psychiatrists meeting 
for the first time in six years is taking up the soviet question 
during its weeklong congress amid allegations that political 
dissidents are still being punished in soviet psychiatric hospitals 
in a preliminary meeting wednesday the groups executive 
committee led by its president kostas stefanis recommended 
reentry for the soviets known officially as the allunion society 
of psychiatrists and narcologists 
the soviet statesanctioned society was forced to withdraw from 
the world body in 1983 after allegations surfaced that dissidents 
were being certified as insane 
the soviets admit that some excesses took place in their 
country in the past and say that these will not be repeated in the 
future stefanis said 
three dissident soviet psychiatrists who have been interned in 
psychiatric hospitals and now live in the west said before the 
congress opened that admitting the official soviet group would be 
tantamount to condoning abuse 
one of the men anatoly koryagin said the soviet psychiatric 
establishment has admitted individual instances of wrong diagnosis 
but continues to deny the systematic abuse of psychiatry 
the congress opened in a tense atmosphere after the 
associations general assembly clashed in the preliminary session 
over voting procedures that will affect the ballot on the soviet 
issue 
delegates from the united states britain west germany canada 
and australia alleged that changes to voting statutes proposed by 
the associations executive committee were aimed at facilitating 
reentry for the soviets according to sources at the meeting 
the associations general assembly is scheduled to vote on the 
soviet question tuesday 
the associations executive committee executive came under fire 
from some of its members in march when it gave provisional 
membership to the official soviet group pending a final decision 
at the athens congress 
a us delegation led by a state department official went to the 
soviet union in february to check claims that psychiatry was no 
longer being used as a political weapon the us psychiatrists 
said that despite some progress more legal safeguards were needed 
to prevent the hospitalization of dissidents 
on the basis of the us report the american psychiatric 
association a member of the international body decided to vote 
against full membership for the soviet society at the athens 
congress 
robert van voren the leader of a netherlandsbased human rights 
group that is campaigning against reentry of the soviets said the 
use of psychiatry for politcal reasons is still common in the 
soviet union 
we have evidence of 40 dissidents who are being held in soviet 
psychiatric institutions for political reasons van voren said in 
an interview 
van vorens pressure group the international association on the 
political use of psychiatry will brief delegates on allegations of 
psychiatric abuse in the soviet union before the vote 
the main group will also decide on whether to admit a second 
soviet society of psychiatrists the independent psychiatric 
association that association which does not have the backing of 
the soviet government also maintains that the political use of 
psychiatry is still continuing in the soviet union the 
international group can admit both soviet associations 
the congress also will discuss about 3400 research papers on 
psychiatry written by members of the world organization

labor secretary elizabeth dole will visit 
striking coal miners friday in southwest virginia for a firsthand 
look at the sixmonth walkout involving pittston co mines in three 
states a department official said thursday 
shes frustrated and wants something to happen obviously she 
wants to see the strike resolved said spokeswoman dale tate 
adding that mrs dole isnt taking sides in the dispute 
mrs dole met earlier in washington with pittston chief paul 
douglas and richard trumka president of the united mine workers 
we think thats a tremendous step in the right direction 
trumka said thursday about mrs doles trip 
the umw official spoke at a news conference during which several 
international labor leaders expressed strong concern over the coal 
strike 
lets not beat around the bush this is a unionbusting 
dispute said john vanderveken general secretary of the 
international confederation of free trade unions 
vanderveken said his brussels belgiumbased organization which 
represents unions with 88 million members around the world was 
preparing to file a formal complaint with the international labor 
organization citing flagrant worker abuses involved with the 
pittston strike 
we have no double standards he said if something is 
wrong in poland in the soviet union we say so and if something 
is wrong in the united states we say so also 
vanderveken said the handling of the coal miners strike by 
state and federal authorities demonstrated that the enforcement of 
labor law in the united states is heavily stacked in favor of 
management 
the delegation of foreign labor leaders met earlier thursday 
with virginia gov gerald baliles and spent wednesday in the 
southwest virginia coalfields after meeting with pittston chairman 
douglas 
contract talks resumed thursday in suburban washington after a 
sixweek break but neither the company nor the union expected any 
breakthroughs they cannot even agree to meet in the same room and 
have been using a federal mediator to relay messages 
the strike involving pittstons 1695 union employees in 
virginia west virginia and kentucky began april 5 and has become a 
rallying point for the us labor movement 
peter michalzik general secretary of the miners international 
federation also based in brussels told striking miners at a rally 
wednesday the pittston strike is the no 1 priority in our 
organization 
jacek merkel an official of polands solidarity union who 
directed shipyard strikes in gdansk said solidarity won its 
eightyear battle for recognition with support from labor around 
the world now he said he wants to stand with the umw 
my boss lech walesa appealed to our government lets start 
negotiating i wish that here pittston would start negotiating

ten years ago giorgio armani introduced his 
liningless jacket and the moda milanese was born 
now at the start of a new decade it looks like milans favorite 
son will continue to be the mainstay of italian readytowear 
after the success of his new springsummer 1990 collection 
presented wednesday night 
hes simply the best said kal ruttenstein vicepresident 
of fashion for bloomingdales 
the italian fashion industry breathed a sigh of relief this 
month when armani whose annual sales are valued at 350 million 
turned down a tempting offer to become artistic director at lanvin 
in paris 
the onceunited front of the milanese designers has suffered 
some major upsets in the past year 
the rising star of italian readytowear romeo gigli whose 
waiflike styles received mixed reviews in march took his show to 
paris where he was hailed as the greatest thing to hit the runway 
since christian lacroix 
at the beginning of the summer gianfranco ferre accepted the 
post of designate designer at the famed house of dior and his 
first couture collection in july was a success 
ferre still designs his own label out of milan but whereas 
optimists see the dior job as a feather in italian fashions cap 
others including armani view it as a french victory in the 
eternal fashion battle between the two countries 
in a recent interview in italys weekly lespresso magazine 
armani commented wryly does anyone really think the french are 
stupid enough to promote an italian name 
for the moment armani is satisfied to launch his fashion 
fantasy from milan and his new collection is proof that things are 
calm in the armani empire which includes more than 100 emporio 
shops in europe and the united states 200 stores in japan that 
carry his line and his own stores in such major capitals as rome 
paris london and new york 
the new armani style for the springsummer 1990 presented to a 
select crowd of 1000 fashion followers in milans elegant palazzo 
senato is long and languid airy fabrics and loose styles which 
often draw their inspiration from morocco give the collection a 
soft serene look 
his new jacket is extra long either doublebreasted with three 
buttons or no buttons at all sleeves are often overlong and the 
newest jacket is closed over the front to button at the shoulder 
although the look is of natural simplicity almost too simple 
for its 1000 price tag the workmanship is armani perfection and 
the fabrics are luxuriously light raw silks and featherweight 
wools 
these jackets are worn over short seemingly hemless skirts or 
baggy trousers 
from morocco armani brought back the harem pant which he puts 
under sporty jackets by day under tunics and lavish evening gowns 
by night 
his favorite harem pant lightly sweeps the floor in silk chiffon 
or georgette often worn with an indian embroidered strapless top 
for that special evening armani embroiders his softly draped 
gowns with myriads of crystals and pearls his new evening look is 
a short embroidered gown with a puffedout skating skirt over airy 
harem pants 
colors match the soft warmth of a mediterranean summer night 
twilight blue sunset red dusk white pine green burnt yellow and 
terracotta orange prints copied the designs of delicate oriental 
porcelain and middle eastern pottery 
armani is not one for ornate accessories in keeping with the 
simplicity of the collection he displayed only large drop 
earrings footwear is soft and flat allowing his models to steal 
down the runway like thieves in an arabian night

a house panel thursday authorized federal 
communications commission spending of 2313 million for fiscal 
years 1990 and 1991 
on a voice vote the house energy and commerce 
telecommunications and finance subcommittee approved the 1098 
million the fcc had sought for fiscal 1990 which began oct 1 and 
1215 million for 1991 
the house panel earlier had proposed the agency receive 1178 
million for fiscal 1991 but in thursdays hearing reps edward 
markey dmass and matthew rinaldo rnj offered an amendment 
to provide nearly 4 million more 
they said the extra money was to cover the costs of moving and 
consolidating fcc offices in late 1991 and to add staff and 
facilities to help the fcc regulate an increasingly complex 
telecommunications industry 
the increase also will help the agency regain the strength 
that has been sapped in recent years rinaldo said 
the fccs 1989 budget was 996 million the same amount it 
received in 1988 
former fcc chairman dennis patrick told the panel earlier this 
year the agencys backlog of licensing applications was soaring 
because of budget restraints 
the senate commerce science and transportation committee last 
week authorized 1098 million in 1990 but only 1198 million in 
fiscal 1991 
in other action the house subcommittee on voice votes 
approved a section of the 1989 americans with disabilities act 
that would require telephone companies to provide twoway 
communications at no additional charge to individual users to 
speech or hearing impaired people who utilize telecommunications 
devices for the deaf tdds 
tdds are typewriterlike devices that permit written messages to 
be sent by telephone a telephone operator then relays either a 
spoken or written message to another person 
authorized national telecommunications and information 
administration spending of 146 million in fiscal 1990 and 147 
million for fiscal 1991 the ntia a commerce department agency 
advises the white house on telecommunications policy and 
administers the public telecommunications facilities program which 
makes matching capital grants to aid nonprofit communications

four american scientists reacted with delight thursday at being 
named nobel prize winners for their work in physics and chemistry 
and one said it was time to go back to the lab and do more work 
the physics award was given to norman f ramsey of harvard 
university for measurement techniques that led to the cesium atomic 
clock and to hans g dehmelt of the university of washington and 
wolfgang paul of west germany for a method to isolate single atoms 
and make exacting measurements of them 
the nobel prize in chemistry is shared by thomas cech 41 of 
the university of colorado and sidney altman 50 of yale 
university they showed independently in the 1970s and early 1980s 
that rna then thought to be merely a genetic messenger inside the 
cell could rearrange itself and produce chemical reactions 
half the physics prize will go to ramsey 74 the other half 
will be shared by the germanborn dehmelt 67 of the university of 
washington in seattle and paul 76 of the university of bonn 
each nobel prize is worth 469000 
i am obviously excited about it said cech who was visiting 
boston to receive a prize for genetic work from massachusetts 
general hospital it was something that everybody has been 
telling me would happen but i had no way of knowing when 
while nobel prize celebrations may be relatively common in the 
boston area cech pointed out they are rarer elsewhere 
my main emotion is that this is a great thing for the 
university of colorado and the state of colorado he said this 
is not the sort of thing that happens annually in the mountains the 
way it does in boston that gives me a really good feeling 
asked about his plans for the money he said i have two young 
daughters who are very good at spending money 
dehmelt said he didnt mind being awakened at 4 am by a caller 
from the royal swedish academy of sciences to be told of the award 
im elated dehmelt said from his seattle apartment 
overlooking lake washington the prize and its prestige should make 
his work easier he said 
one of the applications of his research is to make an atomic 
clock thousands of times more accurate than any before 
the clocks are very universally useful they can be used in 
navigation and missiles and of course the military loves them 
they didnt give me any money though dehmelt said 
ramsey said he was pleased and delighted and surprised to 
learn he was awarded half the prize for inventing a precise method 
for measuring time by measuring the frequency of radiation from 
atoms 
basically im interested in all the laws of nature said 
ramsey who attributed his long interest in science to the fact 
that its fun 
ramsey said he may use his prize money to defray the cost of 
traveling to grenoble france where he conducts research but he 
mentioned his wife would like him to buy a new car 
altman at a news conference in new haven conn thanked us 
taxpayers who he said provided the funds that the government 
appropriated for research the native of canada held up a yale 
pennant that contained a small replica of the canadian flag 
ill just go back to the lab and do more work he said 
and just try to understand the things im trying to understand 
altman a member of the yale faculty since 1971 is now a 
professor of biology he was dean of yale college from july 1986 
through june 1989

four american scientists and a west 
german won the nobel prizes in physics and chemistry thursday for 
discoveries that have given the world exact measurement of time and 
could help explain the origins of life 
canadianborn sidney altman 50 of yale university and thomas 
cech 41 of the university of colorado in boulder won the 
chemistry prize for their discovery of catalytic properties of 
rna the citation said 
bertil andersson of the nobel committee of the royal swedish 
academy of sciences said their work has forced the rewrite of 
whole chapters in chemistry textbooks and could help reveal how 
life began 
it changed dogmas from the turn of the century on how living 
cells function he said 
the discovery also will probably provide a new tool for gene 
technology with potential to create a new defense against viral 
infections and virusresistant plants the academy said 
norman f ramsey 74 of harvard university was given half the 
physics prize for inventing a method for measuring time on which 
the current standard of time is based 
since 1967 because of ramseys discovery time has been 
measured by the movement within the smallest particle of matter 
rather than the rotation of earth ingvar lindgren chairman of the 
awards committee said the atomic clock deviates by just 1000th of 
a second in 300 years 
germanborn hans g dehmelt 67 of the university of washington 
in seattle and wolfgang paul 76 of the university of bonn west 
germany shared the other half of the 469000 prize for developing 
ways of trapping particles to study a them with extreme precision 
they realized a longfelt dream of scientists in the field 
the academy declared 
lindgren said the three laureates have developed exact methods 
of measurement which has made it possible to conduct experiments 
that might force us to reconsider some basic physical laws 
especially regarding time and space 
paul heard the news on his car radio and joked later that his 
ion trap was an invention to measure every speck of dust 
this is a surprise for me he said i never saw myself 
the practical relevance of it 
ramsey said at his home in massechusetts it feels great im 
just delighted and im delighted with the people with whom im 
sharing the prize 
cech was reached in boston and said i am obviously excited 
about it it was something that everyone has been telling me would 
happen but i had no way of knowing when 
asked about plans for his half of the chemistry prize money he 
replied i have two young daughters who are very good at spending 
money 
altman said from new haven conn im very happy im very 
grateful to all my colleagues and coworkers teachers and family 
ramsey developed a way to study the structure of atoms by 
exciting them to different energy levels using two oscillating 
electromagnetic fields 
that led to development of the hydrogen maser a laserlike 
device that excites hydrogen atoms and provided the most detailed 
determination of their internal structure 
it has been used to test albert einsteins general theory of 
relativity and in measuring the continental drift the academy said 
another application was the cesium atomic clock in which cesium 
atoms are excited to higher levels 
i was really studying the fundamental properties of atoms and 
nuclei and it was apparent this was a very very stable 
clock ramsey said it gets used in radio astronomy 
navigation satellite navigation many other purposes 
dehmelt and paul were recognized for developing the technique 
for trapping single ions electrically charged atoms according to 
weight lindgren said ion traps could provide even more exact 
time measurement in the future 
cech and altman showed independently that rna or ribonucleic 
acid could be a catalyst or trigger for chemical reactions in 
the cell 
their discoveries disproved a 75yearold dogma that enzymes or 
the triggers of reactions inside cells are always proteins they 
proved rna also can be a catalyst not just the messenger of 
genetic codes from dna said andersson the nobel committee member 
when altman discovered in 1978 that rna could produce catalytic 
reactions in the cell the discovery was met with disbelief and 
he could hardly believe it himself andersson said 
four years later cech demonstrated that the rna molecule was 
not only necessary to the reaction but could trigger the reaction 
by itself without associated proteins previously thought essential 
andersson said cech and altman worked independently but like 
a ping pong match the ball went from one to the other 
their discoveries may provide a method to destroy harmful rna 
molecules that cause infections such as the common cold and 
eventually also provide cures for hereditary diseases the academy 
said 
cech born in chicago has been at boulder since 1983 he 
received his doctorate from the university of california berkeley 
altman born in montreal earned his doctorate at the university 
of colorado studied at harvard and cambridge and moved to yale in 
1971 
ramsey has been at harvard in cambridge mass since 1947 
dehmelt a us citizen was born in goerlitz now in east germany 
went to duke university in north carolina as a student in 1952 and 
has been at the university of washington in seattle since 1955 
paul was born in lorenzkirch germany and became professor of 
experimental physics at bonn in 1952

summary 
this years nobel prize in chemistry has been awarded to sidney 
altman usa and thomas cech usa for their discovery that rna 
ribonucleic acid in living cells is not only a molecule of 
heredity but also can function as a biocatalyst this discovery 
which came as a complete surprise to scientists concerns 
fundamental aspects of the molecular basis of life many chapters 
in our textbooks have to be revised 
many chemical reactions cannot occur without a catalyst a 
catalyst is a molecule which can facilitate a chemical reaction 
without being consumed or changed virtually all chemical reactions 
taking place in a living cell require catalysts such biocatalysts 
are called enzymes for example in saliva there is an enzyme which 
converts starch to glucose in the liver there is another enzyme 
which breaks down alcohol there are also enzymes that enable 
plants to convert the carbon dioxide in the air to sugar and 
starch until the results of altman and cech became known all 
enzymes were considered to be proteins 
the specific properties and functions of a protein are 
determined by hereditary characters or genes genes are composed 
of deoxyribonucleic acid better known as dna the genetic 
information in dna is arranged as a string of codes which determine 
the design of the proteins however before this information can be 
used for protein synthesis the code must be transcribed into 
another type of nucleic acid rna altman and cech have now 
independently discovered that rna is not only a molecule of 
heredity but can also serve as a biocatalyst in addition to this 
conceptual influence on basic natural sciences the discovery of 
catalytic rna will probably provide a new tool for gene technology 
with potential to create a new defense against viral infections

the bush administration declared its 
unqualified support thursday for senatepassed civil rights 
legislation to protect the estimated 43 million disabled americans 
the americans with disabilities act is fair balanced 
legislation that does not place undue burdens on americans who 
comply attorney general richard thornburgh told the house 
judiciary committee 
the senate passed the legislation sept 7 by a vote of 768 the 
bill was the result of negotiations between senators and the white 
house to soften some of the impact on business 
during testimony last june before the senate labor and human 
resources committee thornburgh had expressed administration 
support but with some reservations he said thursday those concerns 
had been resolved in negotiations 
the bill guarantees the disabled equal access to public 
accommodations restaurants shops movie theaters and doctors 
offices for example and to employment opportunities as a result 
of the compromise the requirements will be phased in and punitive 
damages will be disallowed 
thornburgh defended the bill against claims by the business 
community that its provisions are vague thornburgh cited previous 
laws including civil rights requirements for companies that 
receive government grants or contracts 
thornburgh declined to support a request by the business 
community that it be allowed tax credits for architectural 
modifications needed to meet the requirements of the law existing 
law allows for tax deductions for those alterations 
that has been suggested and examined thornburgh said it 
has an equitable appeal but because of the fiscal situation and 
restraints the administration does not support such a credit 
thornburgh also defended the administrations support of the 
measure against challenges by rep william e dannemeyer rcalif 
who suggested that most people infected with the aids virus should 
be excluded from protection 
referring to people who acquired the virus through homosexual 
contact or drug use dannemeyer asked whether someone should be 
covered who had a communicable disease as a result of 
misconduct 
thornburgh replied that bush has pledged to support legislation 
forbidding discrimination against hivinfected people a 
recommendation made by the aids commission headed by now energy 
secretary james watkins 
its not always easy to prove how the aids was acquired 
thornburgh added 
aids is also acquired through heterosexual contact and blood 
transfusions 
also thursday the house energy and commerce telecommunications 
and finance subcommittee approved a portion of the act that 
requires telephone companies to provide a special relay service to 
the speech or hearing impaired 
the service would be available at no additional charge 
the service involves use of typewriterlike devices that permit 
written messages to be sent by telephone a telephone operator then 
relays either a spoken or written message to another person 
the bill is before seven subcommittees of four house committees 
supporters including thornburgh have said they hope to have a 
bill passed and ready for bushs signature before the end of the 
year

the house approved legislation thursday that 
authorizes 73 million for the arms control and disarmament agency 
and in a concession to the white house softens language on treaty 
verification and inspection 
by a vote of 40011 the house adopted a bill suggesting that 
president bush form a working group to study verification for a 
strategic arms reduction agreement and to assess the pacts effect 
on the ussoviet treaty banning intermediaterange nuclear 
missiles 
the bill earmarks 73 million for the arms control agency in 
fiscal 1990 which began oct 1 and fiscal 1991 the agency 
implements arms control agreements studies questions of arms 
control compliance and oversees the onsite inspection agency 
the legislation also includes 95 million for the onsite 
inspection agency in fiscal 1990 and fiscal 1991 
the bill requests that the director of the arms control and 
disarmament agency report on whether to establish an arms control 
implementation and compliance resolution bureau 
the bureau would manage the implementation of existing and 
future arms control agreements and provide analyses and policy 
reports on resolution of arms control compliance questions 
last month the house failed to get the twothirds vote required 
for a similar arms control bill that included the stronger 
language the vote was 247170 
rep dante fascell dfla chairman of the house foreign 
affairs committee cited the bush administrations objections to 
some of the provisions as the reason for the vote 
on thursday fascell introduced an amendment that revised those 
provisions and had the backing of the administration the measure 
was approved by voice vote 
the final bill now goes to the senate for consideration

nato secretary general manfred woerner said 
thursday that the sovietled warsaw pact assures a certain form 
of military stability in europe 
woerner also predicted both military alliances would survive the 
1990s even amid political change in the east and west nato 
according to the former west german defense minister guarantees 
peace and peaceful change 
i have no doubt if you were an east european you would see it 
as the main source of stability woerner said at a news 
conference 
similarily he said the warsaw pact serves a useful purpose 
it guarantees a certain form of military stability woerner 
said as you can see it does not prevent change in poland 
hungary and in a mild form in east germany 
its not our role to make a settlement guaranteeing the 
existence of both or one pact woerner said that would be a 
major mistake that is not the question 
but he said of the warsaw pact i only think that being 
interested in military stability for the foreseeable future the 
next decade where we have to ensure a peaceful change i think it 
can and might play a useful role 
woerner said the two alliances would operate in the future with 
fewer weapons and in a posture of defense however he stressed 
nato should not be dissolved 
even in a landscape of political change we need the solid and 
sound defense he said turmoil is in the air every time there 
is change 
besides he said if soviet president mikhail gorbachev failed 
in his program to restructure the soviet union someone could look 
for a military solution to their problems 
woerner appeared before a session of the atlantic council of the 
united states a private research group that promotes us ties 
with western europe 
he was in washington for meetings with president bush 
administration officials and members of congress

the status of press freedom in the 
americas is grim because of the danger journalists face in such 
countries as colombia and panama the interamerican press 
association concluded thursday 
the iapa is an organization of 1300 newspapers from the united 
states canada latin america and the caribbean whose main goal is 
to guarantee press freedom throughout the western hemisphere 
about 400 iapa members attended the fourday assembly in this 
industrial center in northeastern mexico 150 miles from the texas 
border 
even as representatives of the western hemispheres free press 
met in monterrey mexico the sound of gunshots fired by enemies of 
that free press echoed off the assemblys wall the report said 
three colombian newspaper employees and the wife of a salvadoran 
journalist were gunned down tuesday 
while some advances are being made in nations throughout the 
hemisphere the state of press freedom in the americas still must 
be regarded as grim as long as journalists and their families are 
subject to the crudest form of censorship death by 
assassination the organization said in a report issued on the 
final day of its 45th general assembly 
nowhere is the struggle between the forces of darkness and the 
forces of light more clearly drawn than in colombia the iapa 
said 
there at least 10 journalists have been murdered this year by 
henchmen of the cocaine cartel at least 40 in the past 12 years 
the report said 
although the colombian government is attempting to fight the 
drug cartels panamas leader gen manuel noriega is in league 
with the traffickers the iapa charged 
noriega who heads panamas defense forces has closed every 
independent newspaper radio and televion station and arrested 
tortured or forced into exile a long list of reporters according 
to the association 
in cuba public enemy no 1 of press freedoms in the 
hemisphere repression of journalists both cuban and foreign is 
worse than ever the organization concluded 
meanwhile promises of press reform by nicaraguas sandinista 
government have not materialized the iapa said

yugoslav prime minister ante markovic said 
thursday that he wants 1 billion for his communist countrys 
banking system to cushion the anticipated blows of economic and 
political reforms 
markovic whose plan to institute a marketoriented economy has 
been blocked by communist party conservatives said he would meet 
with us bankers and world bank officials to promote his request 
yugoslavia is asking the 152member world bank for a loan of 
300 million to 350 million and has reached an agreement in 
principle with one european country for a large loan he said 
markovic declined to name the country but sources said it is 
believed to be italy 
speaking to reporters at the national press club the yugoslav 
leader said he had discussed his countrys banking needs with 
american bankers and would bring up the problem in talks with 
administration officials he meets friday with president bush 
markovic an engineer named to his post in march is urging the 
development of private enterprise and an end to government 
interference in the running of businesses including a halt to 
subsidies of moneylosing ventures 
he also wants to reshape the banking system along western lines 
and to introduce a stocks and bonds market 
the proposed changes are designed to stem the countrys 
staggering inflation rate which has reached 1200 percent 
annually to lower the 19 billion foreign debt and the 17 percent 
unemployment rate and to ease ethnic tensions among provinces 
markovic advocates a multiparty system to help solve 
yugoslavias economic problems but the communist party has blocked 
the democratic reforms being embraced by poland and hungary 
unlike poland and hungary yugoslavia is not seeking direct us 
aid markovic said rather it wants to promote joint ventures with 
american businesses and to encourage foreign ownership in 
yugoslavia 
markovic said his meetings here are designed to explain new 
yugoslav legislation that enables foreign investment and to attract 
the same kind of interest in yugoslavia shown by european 
businesses 
he warned however that changes are bound to bring social 
problems including an increase in unemployment to about 20 
percent 
to reduce social tensions we have to act as fast as 
possible to develop the private sector and the banking system he 
said

depletion of ozone in the stratosphere over 
the south pole has equalled the record level that scientists found 
in 1987 nasa reported thursday 
scientists at the goddard space flight center in greenbelt md 
said that satellite measurements show that ozone density over the 
antarctic has declined by about 45 percent since early august a 
drop of about 15 percent a day 
arlin krueger richard stolarski and mark schoeberl scientists 
monitoring the south polar ozone levels said the ozone depletion 
recorded oct 5 matched the record low measured in 1987 
the depletion occurs in what scientists call a hole that is 
formed by a high altitude formation of clouds extreme cold and 
certain wind patterns over the south polar area such a hole can 
remain undisturbed for months the the ozone depletion appears to 
correct itself in the polar summer but then reappears in the cold 
months 
its becoming clear that the ozone hole is not going away in 
the near future although the depth will vary from year to year 
krueger is quoted as saying in a news release from the national 
aeronautics and space administration 
nasa scientists have been monitoring ozone levels over the 
southern hemisphere using an instrument on board the nimbus7 
satellite for more than 10 years 
last year ozone concentrations over antarctica dropped by about 
15 percent in september about a third of the current depletion 
other studies have found some seasonal thinning of the ozone 
layer above the north polar region 
ozone in the stratosphere can block much of the ultraviolet 
radiation from the sun when intact the ozone layer in effect 
prevents damaging levels of uv radiation from reaching earth an 
excess exposure to uv radiation is thought to be a major cause of 
skin cancer and some studies have shown that an increase in the 
radiation also can harm plants and the human immune system 
depletion of the concentration of ozone is thought to be 
increased by the interaction of certain manmade chemicals 
principally cholorfluorocarbons or cfcs a chemical used for 
refrigerants and in the manufacture of some plastic products 
some us manufacturers and users of cfcs have announced plans 
to stop making the chemical compound or to guard against releasing 
the chemicals into the atmosphere 
though it is a major component of smog and an atmospheric 
pollutant at ground level ozone forms an important part of the 
radiation protection belt surrounding the earth in the 
stratosphere which begins about 9 miles above the earth and 
extends upward to about 39 miles 
ozone is a substance composed of three atoms of oxygen it is 
created naturally during thunderstorms common atmospheric oxygen 
is composed of two atoms

the rate of smoking among americans continues to 
decline slowly but steadly but the nation isnt likely to reach a 
federal goal of 75 percent nonsmokers by next year federal health 
officials said thursday 
a facetoface survey of adult americans conducted in 1987 
shows that 288 percent are cigarette smokers the national centers 
for disease control reported 
thats down from 301 percent in a similar 1985 survey but the 
decline is apparently not enough for government researchers to 
project meeting the official federal goal of less than 25 percent 
by 1990 
were getting pretty close said dr ron davis director of 
the cdcs office of smoking and health were making progress 
and were heading in the right direction 
cdc officials believed two years ago that the 1990 goal one of 
several federal health targets set as this decade began could be 
reached partly because of a 1986 survey showing a national smoking 
rate of 265 percent 
but that survey conducted by telephone probably wasnt as 
precise as the facetoface survey reported thursday davis said 
the cdc said thursday that smoking rates continue to fall by a 
steady half percentage point a year as theyve done since 1964 
the year of the surgeon generals landmark warning that smoking 
causes cancer and heart disease at that time 40 percent of the 
countrys adults smoked 
the number of americans who smoke will continue to drop 
possibly until just a small hardcore band of smokers is left 
davis predicted 
so far we havent seen any evidence of a leveling off in 
smokings decline he said 
we need to intensify our efforts smokers tomorrow may be 
more resistant to our message than smokers today davis said 
we still have almost 400000 americans dying every year because 
of smokingrelated disease we cant be complacent about smoking 
rates going down 
the cdcs report based on a survey of about 44000 people 
showed that one in three adult americans 39 percent of men and 27 
percent of women uses tobacco of some sort including cigarettes 
pipes cigars and chewing tobacco among men 31 percent smoke 
cigarettes compared to 27 percent of women 
the report said young people are more likely to smoke cigarettes 
than are older people 33 percent of americans age 2544 smoke 
compared with 19 percent age 6574 and 9 percent 75 and older 
five percent of us adult men smoke cigars while 3 percent 
smoke pipes four percent use chewing tobacco and 3 percent use 
snuff the percentage of women using such alternate forms of 
tobacco was well below 1 percent 
the margin of error in the survey is 1 percent for all adults 
somewhat higher for subgroups

the farmer who found the 400pound engine part 
suspected of causing a jet crash that killed 112 people learned 
today she will get a reward of more than 100000 from general 
electric co 
its just a shock said janice sorenson who found the piece 
while harvesting corn tuesday with a combine 
ge had offered a 50000 reward for the titanium fan disk from 
the rear engine of united airlines flight 232 which crashed july 
19 in sioux city killing 112 people of 296 people on board ge 
manufactured the engine 
investigators suspect the fan disk came apart causing the 
engine to disintegrate and spew shrapnel that severed the jets 
hydraulic system and made the plane virtually impossible to control 
ge spokesman david lane said the company would not give the 
amount of the reward but a source close to the matter said it 
would be about 130000 and mrs sorenson today said ge told her 
it would be more than 100000 
im just in shock i can manage 20000 but this she said 
the amount being given is more than 50000 because of all the 
fan blades and other parts still attached to the disk and because 
some other small parts found in the ground with the disk 
mrs sorenson said she had no immediate plans for the money she 
and her husband dale have lived on the farm since 1953 
ge established a reward fund totaling 271000 to pay for parts 
recovered from the crash lane said less than half that amount has 
been paid 
the disk which looks like a windmill was flown to a ge plant 
near cincinnati for analysis 
we dont know yet whether this is the golden nugget were 
looking for said jim burnett a member of the national 
transportation safety board but were glad we found it 
mrs sorenson found about twothirds of the fan disk assembly 
and 100 searchers hired by ge will look for the rest of the disk 
and its hardware over the weekend

torn between humanitarianism and trying 
not to offend east germany the noncommunist government of premier 
tadeusz mazowiecki has sent conflicting signals on its policy 
toward illegal east german refugees 
a foreign ministry statement thursday and a televised interview 
with a government spokeswoman stressed that poland has not 
abandoned its treaty obligations to east germany to send back to 
its communist neighbor any east german citizens caught trying to 
enter poland illegally 
but in practice the policy appears to apply only to those east 
germans apprehended while trying to cross the border not east 
germans who make it deeper into poland 
foreign minister krysztof skubiszewski said in an interview 
published thursday that he opposes deportations whether the east 
germans are legal or illegal while a border commander said earlier 
that if east germans make it to the interior of poland then that 
is their luck 
nevertheless the government reacted quickly to an article in 
the prosolidarity newspaper gazeta wyborcza suggesting that poland 
will no longer oppose east germans entering the country illegally 
both government spokeswoman malgorzata niezabitowska and the 
foreign ministry said poland still opposes illegal entries ms 
niezabitowska made the statement in a television appearance 
wednesday night while the foreign ministry published its statement 
thursday 
according to the foreign ministry statement troops guarding 
polands frontiers have the duty of counteracting illegal border 
crossings 
it added that repeated and widely publicized promises by 
skubiszewski that no refugees would be deported against their will 
concern people who find themselves in poland legally 
the foreign ministry statement apparently designed to assuage 
east german concerns was conveyed to the east german public by 
east germanys state news agency adn 
for practical purposes however east germans who successfully 
cross the border area by swimming the oder and neisse rivers or 
walking across the frontier are not being interfered with by polish 
officials one border commander said 
obviously if someone succeeds in crossing the border and gets 
deeper into polish territory then it is his luck and we do not 
care about him said gen feliks stramik of the military border 
guard interviewed by the associated press on wednesday 
skubiszewski in an interview thursday in gazeta wyborcza noted 
that all over the world people who enter a country illegally are 
liable to deportation 
but that is not the point the foreign minister said i 
still believe that deportations should not be taking place i have 
tried hard to prevent them 
without specifying his efforts he said his aim was to solve the 
problem in accordance with polands duties in the field of human 
rights but also in accordance with the interests of the state 
he said state interests should be handled so as to avoid 
harming the individual 
mazowieckis government has several reasons to be sensitive to 
the concerns of east germany 
when it took power as the first noncommunist government in the 
east bloc it gave assurances that poland would continue to respect 
foreign policy commitments within the warsaw pact 
also east germany spans the direct roads between poland and 
western europe and east german authorities could easily play havoc 
with polish tourism and commerce 
skubiszewski pointed to the fact that many poles are employed in 
east germany and we must also take their interests into account 
poland has taken a tolerant view to the 600 east germans who 
have made their way to the west german embassy in warsaw in the 
past week unlike their counterparts in czechoslovakia the 
refugees have not been forced to reside on the embassy grounds but 
instead in vacation hotels 
both the roman catholic church and the polish red cross have 
been active in caring for the refugees 
two trainloads carrying more than 1400 refugees were allowed to 
leave poland for west germany last week with the agreement of the 
east german government

federal safety investigators said today they 
had found an apparently preexisting crack in the engine disk 
discovered in an iowa corn field nearly three months after the 
crash of an airliner that killed 112 people 
james kolstad acting chairman of the national transportation 
safety board said the precise size nature and reason for the 
crack has yet to be determined 
there has been no determination on whether this crack was 
detectable before the accident nor has there been a determination 
whether this crack is the point of origin of engine failure said 
board spokesman ted lopatkiewicz he said it had not been 
determined whether the crack should have been caught in the last 
engine inspection before the crash 
he and kolstad said however that preliminary evidence indicates 
the crack existed prior to the july 19 united airlines crash at 
sioux city iowa 
the middle engine in the dc10 disintegrated in flight severing 
hydraulic lines and making the plane almost impossible to steer 
the craft cartwheeled out of control as the pilots were trying to

the light illuminating the huge red 
star atop parliament was switched off thursday and will be removed 
the state news agency mti reported 
the announcement was preceded by a decision to gradually remove 
the red star emblem from all public buildings and replace it with 
national symbols 
the removal of the red star from parliament would take place in 
the first half of 1990 and will cost a considerable sum of money 
since safe removal will be a complicated technical operation 
requiring specific arrangements mti said it did not elaborate 
the decision followed a last weekends vote to disband the 
communist party and form a westernstyle socialist party advocating

a short circuit lasting about 1 12 seconds 
caused some sparks and smoke on the middeck of the space shuttle 
columbia on its flight in august nasa said thursday 
there is no ndication the astronauts were ever in any 
danger said nasa spokeswoman sarah keegan 
the space agency confirmed a report broadcast by cable news 
network that the crew handled the short circuit by unplugging a 
teleprinter the cause nasa said appeared to be damage to 
insulation on a cable that connected the printer to the spaceships 
electrical system 
a redesigned cable has been installed aboard atlantis for the 
galileo space probe mission next week the covering has been 
changed to teflon to make it more flexible miss keegan said 
the shuttle with five astronauts aboard was on a military 
mission on the aug 813 flight and the crew maintained radio 
silence throughout 
the crew reported seeing some sparks and some smoke was 
recorded by one of the cabin smoke detectors nasa said in a 
response prepared for questions that were raised about the incident 
in late august 
while the detector recorded the smoke twice it was not enough 
to sound the alarm aboard the orbiter nasa said there is no 
evidence that the short was caused by the teleprinter in any way 
the most likely cause is physical damage to the cable conductor 
insulation material

in his meetings with vice president dan quayle and top state 
department officials moshoeshoe said he would ask that pressure 
be brought to bear on south africa to allow safe passage into 
lesotho of the exiled anc leadership from neighboring african 
states 
south africa blockaded lesotho in 1986 saying it was trying to 
prevent the smuggling of anc guerrillas and weapons into the 
kingdom the strained relations with south africa resulted in a 
military coup that overthrew the leftleaning prime minister leabua 
jonathan later that year 
moshoeshoe governs in consultation with the military council 
which holds most of the power and is on better terms with south 
africa than he is 
our opposition to apartheid is without compromise he said 
while recent steps announced by newly elected president fw de 
klerk to release political prisoners and allow blacks more freedom 
are welcome he said apartheid cannot be reformed the 
government must free all political prisoners legalize opposition 
movements and allow banned black leaders to return from exile he 
said 
moshoeshoe also said international pressure on south africa must 
be kept up but he cautioned that economic sanctions are also 
damaging to the economies of lesotho and other socalled frontline 
states that border south africa 
lesotho is completely surrounded by south africa and totally 
dependent on it for its survival the britisheducated monarch said 
he was seeking foreign investment in the kingdom so that its 15 
million people could shake off their dependence on south africa

the soviet union apparently approved and may 
be orchestrating delivery of soviet bloc weapons and equipment to 
nicaragua despite pledges to halt its own shipments of weapons 
pentagon officials said thursday 
if present trends continue 1989 could exceed 1988 in total 
tonnage and dollar value of sovet bloc military shipments to 
nicaragua the pentagon said in a report 
soviet president mikhail gorbachev told president bush in may 
that the soviet union had suspended weapons shipments to nicaragua 
at the end of 1988 
however the soviet union has sent the leftist government in 
managua some 500 million in various other forms of military aid 
this year us officials have said 
evidence is circumstantial but we believe the soviets have 
approved and may be orchestrating the delivery of soviet block 
lethal aid to the sandinistas through cuba the pentagon said 
it is unlikely that either the eastern bloc nations or cuba 
would act on their own in contravention of clearly articulated 
soviet policy to boost military shipments to nicaragua 
the pentagon said that during the first nine months of this 
year soviet military deliveries are down by about 50 percent 
but eastern bloc deliveries have increased by about 35 percent 
essentially offsetting the decrease 
in addition deliveries from cuba to nicaragua primarily of 
small arms and ammunition are almost double the amount 
delivered in the same period in 1988 the report said 
the pentagon said it doesnt believe cuba has the capability of 
producing the quantities of weapons being shipped to nicaragua 
while some could be from cuban stocks the report said we judge 
that for the most part these arms and ammunition are being 
transshipped from the soviet union through cuba 
since the central american peace accords were signed in august 
1987 the report said the sandinistas have received some 36500 
metric tons of soviet bloc military aid valued at 1045 billion 
allowing managua to field the largest and most powerful armed 
force in central america 
the eastern bloc shipments include surfacetoair missiles 
armed transport helicopters a mi25 hind attack helicopter north 
korean patrol boats and a record number of vehicles including 
radar and communications trucks the report said 
the study strikes a discordant note amid the thaw in ussoviet 
relations which appeared particularly upbeat after the wyoming 
meeting last month between secretary of state james a baker iii 
and soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
our problem has to do with an increase in soviet bloc weapons 
and military equipment going into central america going into 
nicaragua quite frankly and from nicaragua to the fmln 
guerrillas in el salvador baker said after the meeting 
most of that is coming from cuba and we would simply like to 
see the soviet union do as much as it possibly could with cuba to 
stop that flow 
shevardnadze went to nicaragua and cuba after the wyoming 
session and us officials said they understood he tried to use 
his influence to reduce the flow of weapons and equipment 
the pentagon report reflects a review of shipments from 1979 
until oct 1 and would therefore not reflect any change since 
shevardnadzes visit 
nicaragua continues to arm far in excess of its legitimate 
defensive needs and apparently intends to beef up its military 
stores and use the supplies against contra forces as well as to 
support rebels in el salvador and panamanian leader gen manuel 
antonio noriega the report said 
the united states halted its shipments to the contras in 
february 
in 1988 the report said there were 68 soviet bloc and cuban 
arms shipments to nicaragua amounting to 19 metric tons at an 
estimated cost of 515 million in the first nine months of this 
year there were 55 such shipments amounting 14 metric tons valued 
at 414 million 
since 1979 the soviet bloc cuba and north korea have provided 
nicaragua with some 152500 metric tons of military equipment at an 
estimated value of 316 billion the report said

beneath a parking lot under a mulch of hazelnuts 
perhaps left by snacking drama patrons archaeologists believe they 
have found the remains of william shakespeares globe theater 
certainty is a scarce commodity in archaeology but the 
probability is very high said harvey sheldon a senior 
archaeologist at the museum of london essentially this is the 
site where the globe ought to lie 
a plaque put up nearby in 1909 by the shakespeare reading 
society of london identified the likely site of the most famous 
elizabethan theater on the south bank of the river thames the site 
is by southwark bridge and twothirds of a mile east of the 
national theater 
on thursday the hopes of shakespeare lovers were rewarded with 
the first glimpses of three chalk and brick foundation walls that 
sheldon said were part of the back of the theater 
finding the theater as a marker is very important he said 
clearly the importance in terms of scholarship can only come 
from investigation 
the globe was built in 1599 by cuthbert and richard burbage and 
a company of actors including shakespeare little was known about 
the shape except that it was described as this wooden o in the 
prologue to shakespeares henry v 
sheldon said if you look at the outline of the remains from 
the top youll see it is actually beginning to make the o shape or 
the polygonal shape 
a second piece of evidence was the discovery of a large quantity 
of crushed hazelnut shells near one wall he said 
hazelnuts were the elizabethan equivalent of popcorn and 
sheldon said the shells appear to have been used as a building 
material possibly to level the theaters floors 
the globe became one of the most popular theaters of its day and 
saw the first performances of shakespeares great tragedies 
hamlet othello king lear and macbeth 
during the first performance of shakespeares henry viii on 
june 29 1613 a cannon that discharged set fire to the theater and 
it was destroyed the only injury according to a contemporary 
account by sir henry wotten was to a man whose breeches caught 
fire but had the provident wit to put it out with bottle ale 
the globe was rebuilt the following year on the old foundations 
and again was a hit with audiences who paid 1 pence for the pit 2 
pence for the gallery and 3 pence for a seat the most privileged 
members of the audience sat on stools on the stage 
but the puritans who were against public displays helped push 
an ordinance through parliament in 1642 banning stage plays and 
the globe was closed along with other theaters it was demolished 
two years later 
archaeologists knew the general location of the globe but it was 
the sale three years ago of the courage brewery by owners imperial 
plc to the british conglomerate hanson plc that led to the 
excavation of the brewerys parking lot this summer 
sheldon said the remains were discovered in the northwest corner 
of the lot the last section on the 21500squarefoot site to be 
cleared of concrete reinforced with metal 
to the untrained eye the corner site near the south end of 
southwark bridge looks like a deep hole with the remains of 
concrete pillars and rows of bricks 
with help from sheldon one can spot an outer brick wall a 
middle wall 3 yards long and made of graywhite chalk blocks is 
believed to be part of the first globe theater while an inner 
brick wall 1 yard long and with a layer of crushed hazelnuts may 
be part of the second globe he said 
the three surviving wall foundations cover an area 10 yards by 6 
yards and form the eastern part of the theater but archaeologists 
say most of the theater lies beyond the edge of the parking lot 
excavation under early 19th century row houses also owned by 
hanson which are under historic preservation orders 
earlier this year archaeologists excavated a sister elizabethan 
theater the rose less than 100 yards away actors and historians 
campaigned against a developers plans to cover it up and it is 
being partially preserved 
lord hanson whose company contributed 390000 to support the 
latest dig said the globes remains would be preserved for public 
display 
asked whether the row houses might be torn down to excavate the 
rest of the globe hanson spokesman michael shea said i think 
thats very much for the conservationists to argue over and i think 
well stand back and watch them decide 
american film actordirector sam wanamaker who is building a 
31 million reconstruction of the globe about 200 yards away 
watched the archaeologists work and said were absolutely 
thrilled 
he said the reconstruction was suspended in hopes that 
discoveries by the archaeologists will help him build a more 
faithful replica of the bards playhouse

a bar fight exploded into a brawling 
rampage involving hundreds of american and british seamen that left 
cars overturned windows smashed and more than 100 people injured 
police said thursday 
police said they arrested 121 us and british sailors after an 
estimated 500 seamen and scores of police brawled wednesday night 
along lisbons seedy bardotted dockside 
the sailors were released to their ships thursday morning and a 
british aircraft carrier cut short a courtesy call and left for 
home because of the fighting 
us embassy officials insisted that most if not all injuries 
were caused by police portuguese police said sailors fought among 
themselves then turned on officers trying to break up the melees 
in washington pentagon spokesman pete williams said 142 us 
sailors were treated for injuries he said 40 sailors had to be 
hospitalized for injuries such as damaged spleens or possible 
concussions 
williams said the brawl was being investigated but that there 
were several versions of what he called a very confused 
situation 
portuguese police said four police officers and three civilians 
were among the injured 
paulino cardoso duty officer at lisbons security police said 
the melee broke out after three black american seamen attacked a 
white us sailor at the passport bar in the gaudy neonlighted 
cais do sodre area that account could not be confirmed 
a pentagon official who asked not to be identified said the 
injured included officers a chaplain and intelligence officers who 
were trying to calm a confrontation that arose when police tried to 
clear an area of sailors following some type of disturbance 
the official said there were reports that indicated police were 
responsible for severe indiscriminate beatings 
us embassy information officer arthur liefkowitz said all 
the 142 injuries treated seem to have resulted from clashes with 
the police 
a lisbon public security police force spokesman lt pereira 
chumbinho did not deny force was used but he said sailors 
maltreated the first two police crews to arrive on the scene 
then surrounded a third vehicle 
then we had to send in three more cars and more forces but it 
is sure that the sailors were fighting among themselves and then 
turned on the police he said 
fighting spread from bar to nightclub along the narrow cobbled 
streets of the riverside area about 9 pm cardoso said 
he said british seamen from the aircraft carrier ark royal 
which arrived in lisbon on wednesday on a fiveday goodwill visit 
joined in the brawling 
ark royal commander christopher thomas said only a few british 
sailors had been caught up in the fighting 
there is no evidence of fighting between american and british 
sailors and i am confident my men were not involved in any 
drunkenness damage or trouble of any kind ark royal capt john 
brigstocke later told reporters 
cardoso said british sailors had been arrested with the 
americans 
shore leave was canceled from the ark royal and aboard the us 
assault craft nassau barnstable county and shreveport 
the us ships were in lisbon during a break from nato exercises 
off the portuguese coast and slated to leave oct 20 
brigstocke said the ark royal was cutting short its courtesy 
call to lisbon and departed today for portsmouth england 
it was very confused there were police cars driving one way 
and sailors running the other but we had no trouble said an 
employee at the nearby hatari bar who asked not to be identified 
it was just like hill street blues said a shopkeeper 
cars were turned over windows were smashed and about 40 sailors 
were arrested when they stormed the local police station portugese 
police said

the federal government lacks an overall 
strategy for handling the huge amounts of scientific and technical 
information generated by government agencies the congressional 
office of technology assessment said thursday 
an ota study observed that in the earth and space sciences 
alone it is estimated that federal agencies are managing a data 
archive of roughly 100000 gigabytes the equivalent of about 45 
billion pages of text 
developing an overall strategy for scientific and technical 
information is needed the congressional office said if the 
potential of new electronic technologies is to be fully realized 
it said technologies such as online electronic databases or 
highdensity optical disks and magnetic cartridges offer great 
promise for timely costeffective storage and dissemination of 
the federal governments information 
electronic technologies offer the only real hope for managing 
the already massive federal archives of scientific data and 
documents the ota report said 
it noted that federal science agencies and interagency 
coordinating groups have made some progress in a variety of areas 
related to handling scientific and technical information 
while these modest achievements were adequate for the earlier 
stages of the transition to a competitive electronic environment 
bolder initiatives are now necessary the congressional agency 
said 
it recommended expanding the role of the white house office of 
science and technology policy in dealing with scientific and 
technical information as well as improving coordination between 
that office and the presidential office of management and budget

the house voted final overwhelming approval 
thursday for a federal ban on flag burning just four months after 
a supreme court decision allowing destruction of an american flag 
as political protest 
this is the least we can do to protect the sanctity of the 
flag rep butler derrick dsc said before the house voted 
37143 to approve the bill 
however president bush and many republicans say congress must 
do more than pass a mere statute and they have been pressing for a 
constitutional amendment to outlaw flag destruction or desecration 
the senate will take up that issue next week 
still 154 republicans joined 217 democrats in supporting the 
statutory ban on thursday while only 18 republicans and 25 
democrats opposed it the bill passed the senate 919 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said the white 
house had not yet received the bill but when it arrives well 
have to have a legal review take place 
fitzwater declined to say whether bush would veto it or sign it 
however administration sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the president was expected to let it go into effect without 
his signature 
the president obviously agrees with its general purpose but 
feels a constitutional amendment is required to survive legal 
challenges fitzwater said of the bill 
bush said last week that a new statute would not be adequate to 
get around the supreme court decision which threw out the 
conviction of a texas flag burner 
bush backed earlier congressional proposals for a constitutional 
amendment but congress scrapped them in favor of the legislative 
approach 
the bill on its way to bush would revise existing federal law 
and provide up to a year in a jail and a 1000 fine for anyone who 
knowingly mutilates defaces physically defiles burns 
maintains on the floor or ground or tramples upon any flag of the 
united states 
the onesided votes in congress reflected the power of the flag 
as a political symbol as demonstrated by a public outcry following 
the supreme court decision in june 
derrick told the house that the courts decision throwing out 
the conviction of texas flag burner gregory lee johnson on grounds 
that his right to free speech was violated hit americans like a 
slap in the face 
bush joined the call for a constitutional amendment but 
democratic leaders said changing the constitution would be too 
drastic an action in response to an isolated case 
amending the constitution as some would advance should be a 
last resort and not a first resort said rep william j hughes 
dnj he said the issue should be addressed in a much less 
dramatic manner 
however house minority leader bob michel rill said to 
those who believe we can overturn a supreme court decision at this 
time by statute i can only repeat the immortal words of the farmer 
who asked directions said you cant get there from here 
supporters of the bill approved thursday said the wording had 
been carefully fashioned to withstand court challenges banning 
flag defacement regardless of whether it involved political protest 
it is the act of harming the physical integrity of the flag 
rather than any message that the action might convey that is to be 
punished judiciary committee chairman jack brooks dtexas told 
the house 
brooks said the bill has been framed in a content neutral 
manner 
but that idea drew scoffing from some republicans who said that 
any bill to ban flag burning by simple statute would be overturned 
for the same reasons as the texas case 
approval of this bill will send a fatally flawed statute 
to the president of the united states said rep james 
sensenbrenner rwis 
sensenbrenner pointed in particular to an amendment attached by 
the senate last week at the urging of sen pete wilson rcalif it 
added the words physically defiles to the list of prohibited 
acts 
critics said anyone who physically defiled the flag would 
obviously have an attitude toward it and thus the measure would end 
up punishing political protest no matter how carefully sponsors 
may have sought to avoid it 
as in the senate many house lawmakers clearly planned to vote 
for both the bill and the constitutional amendment a strategy 
considered politically safe 
a number of republicans who voted against the bill calling it 
inadequate were joined by a smattering of democrats who said that 
neither the amendment nor the bill should be approved

a north dakota lawmaker and foodsupply 
experts said thursday that the bush administrations depletion of 
grain reserves has artificially held down prices and taken away the 
nations buffer against shortages 
it appears to me that the usda has intentionally used our 
reserve programs to soften the price of wheat rep byron dorgan 
dnd told the house agriculture subcommittee on wheat soybeans 
and feed grains 
prices he said are shaped by supply and supply is determined 
by the amount of grain in the fields granaries and the pipeline 
usda used the reserve grain to keep the pipeline full so even 
though the supply in the granaries is dwindling the pipeline 
remains full and millers and exporters dont have to look far for 
wheat dorgan said 
but with reserves dwindling the pricestabilizing buffer is 
nearly gone said rodney leonard executive director of community 
nutrition institute a consumer group 
grain and food prices in the us and the world have been 
relatively stable over the past three years only because the us 
had unintentionally built an enormous stockpile of wheat corn and 
feed grain leonard said 
the united states emergency grain reserve of 4 million tons of 
wheat or about 170 million bushels will be gone by next spring 
he said 
secretary of agriculture clayton yeutter who is guardian of 
this reserve released it last month but under circumstances that 
hardly qualify as an emergency for which the reserve was 
designed leonard told the subcommittee 
on sept 13 yeutter gave wheat farmers permission to increase 
production for 1990 to allow the government to replenish wheat 
reserves the next day president bush announced yeutter would have 
the authority to take grain out of reserve for food aid 
leonard said that in the past foodaid needs have been supplied 
by the open market and benefited farmers by causing prices to go 
up the administrations action however kept prices from rising 
it is our judgment that the flexibility in the management of 
reserves has been overdone said don reeves a nebraska farmer 
and policy analyst for bread for the world a 40000 member 
christian organization that wants to help alleviate world hunger 
we are distressed at the more recent drawdown of reserve 
stocks to levels we regard as risky if not dangerous he said 
dorgan leonard and reeves were among witnesses called by 
subcommittee chairman rep dan glickman dkan in his effort to 
formulate a policy for use of grain reserves that could become part 
of the 1990 farm bill 
neither congress nor the white house has determined the specific 
purpose of withholding grain leading the reserves to be used for a 
variety of things such as emergency aid to foreign countries feed 
for livestock in time of drought export subsidies or manipulation 
of market prices

the house thursday asserted a right to delve 
into cia classified investigation reports as part of its 
responsibility to oversee the agency 
the action came in a bill authorizing activities of the nations 
intelligence agencies for fiscal 1990 which began oct 1 the 
overall bill most of which is classified was approved on a vote 
of 36931 
while the total amount the united states spends on intelligence 
activities is secret reports put the figure at somewhat more than 
25 billion most of the money is tucked away in various pentagon 
accounts and covers everything from personnel and spy hardware 
such as satellites to covert operations overseas 
language in the bill would require the cia to submit to the 
house and senate intelligence committees twice a year a list of all 
investigation and audit reports prepared by the agencys inspector 
general and to turn over any report requested by either committee 
the bush administration contends the requirement is an 
unconstitutional intrusion on its authority and could jeopardize 
the confidentiality of investigative reports administration 
officials say the provision would be cause for a veto 
the provision is the result of a longrunning dispute between 
the spy agency and the house intelligence committee rep dave 
mccurdy dokla said the committee voted unanimously to slap the 
new requirements on the cia not so we can mount a fishing 
expedition but to assess the adequacy of the agencys own 
internal controls 
house access to cia investigative reports has been a matter of 
some sensitivity to director of central intelligence william 
webster mccurdy said 
the senate intelligence committee is at work on its own version 
of the bill which would make the agencys inspector general more 
like the independent auditors at other federal agencies including 
a requirement that the person be confirmed by the senate that 
version of the bill is expected to be sent to the full senate next 
week and differences in the two bills will ultimately have to be 
worked out in housesenate negotiations 
the senate panel has not had the same difficulties as its house 
counterpart in gaining access to investigation reports according 
to a committee aide 
dealing with another issue that has been contentious the 
committee built safeguards into the bill to prevent the bush 
administration from funneling any covert aid to political opponents 
of nicaraguas leftist sandinista government 
no money could be used for such an effort unless the cia first 
seeks permission from the intelligence and appropriations 
committees in the house and senate the administration is 
separately seeking 9 million in aboveboard aid to strengthen the 
election process and enhance the oppositions chances in next 
februarys elections 
rep howard wolpe dmich also used the occasion to question 
continued us support for the angolas unita rebels which now 
amounts to 40 million 
wolpe alleged that unita leader jonas savimbi has sought to 
torpedo efforts to foster peace between his forces and the marxist 
angolan government and said the united states has failed to adopt 
a new policy that recognizes shifting conditions in southern africa 
the african heads of state involved are showing less and less 
confidence in american intentions wolpe said

farmers are harvesting a corn crop estimated 
at 745 billion bushels up 51 percent from last years 
droughtplagued harvest of 492 billion bushels the agriculture 
department said thursday 
moreover the latest estimate based on oct 1 field surveys 
was almost 2 percent more than the 732 billion bushels forecast a 
month ago 
at 745 billion bushels the harvest would be the largest since 
the 825 billion bushels of 1986 the record was the 1985 crop of 
nearly 89 billion bushels 
the crop is being harvested at a slower rate than normal due 
to the lateness of the crop in some states the departments 
national agricultural statistics service reported by oct 1 16 
percent of the crop had been harvested in the 19 major producing 
states compared with 34 percent last year and the average of 22 
percent 
corn yields were estimated at 1144 bushels per acre harvested 
up from 1124 forecast in september and 846 bushels in 1988 but 
still below the record of 1194 bushels per acre in 1987 
as livestock feed corn is the largest and most important us 
farm crop it is an essential ingredient for the production of 
meat poultry and dairy products 
consumer food prices which rose an average of 41 percent in 
1988 are expected to go up 5 percent to 7 percent this year 
according to department economists 
soybean production a source of highprotein meal and vegetable 
oil was estimated at 193 billion bushels up 24 percent from last 
years harvest of 154 billion bushels and 2 percent above the 
september estimate of 189 billion bushels 
yields were estimated at an average of 326 bushels per acre 
this year compared with 268 bushels in 1988 and the september 
forecast of 32 bushels the record was 341 bushels per acre in 
1985 
despite the greatly improved yields of major crops parts of the 
country still suffer from longterm effects of the 1988 drought 
and that raises questions about future harvests 
we always start looking ahead to next year and were not out 
of the woods yet in the sense that in lots of places the subsoil 
moisture is not normal said private analyst william c motes of 
sparks commodities inc 
but he added that the only thing that it really means at this 
point is that the risk is a little higher than in a normal year 
the risk of a shortfall in 1990 
the revised estimates showed total wheat production at 204 
billion bushels up 13 percent from last year but 1 percent below 
the september forecast of 206 billion bushels 
wheat yields were estimated to average 329 bushels per 
harvested acre compared with 341 bushels in 1988 the october 
yield was unchanged from september but the acreage for harvest was 
reduced 1 percent the record yield was 394 bushels in 1983 
winter wheat production which accounts for about threefourths 
of the total was estimated at 145 billion bushels 1 percent less 
than the previous forecast made in august and repeated in 
september that was down 7 percent from 1988 yields averaged 351 
bushels per acre up from 35 bushels indicated previously but down 
from 392 last year 
production of durum wheat which is planted in the spring was 
indicated at 929 million bushels up 107 percent from last years 
droughtravaged harvest but down 1 percent from the september 
estimate 
other spring wheat was shown at 497 million bushels up 142 
percent from the 1988 harvest but down 1 percent from september 
cotton production was indicated at 12 million bales down 22 
percent from last years output and 2 percent below the september 
estimate of 123 million bales the yield was estimated at 603 
pounds per acre down 16 pounds from 1988 and 15 pounds below the 
september forecast 
in a related report on supply and demand for major commodities 
analysts said total corn use in the 198990 marketing year that 
began on sept 1 is still expected to be around 75 billion 
bushels including domestic and export requirements 
with demand exceeding 1989 corn production that will mean a 
further drawdown of us stockpiles to about 188 billion bushels 
left over by next sept 1 down from inventories estimated at 193 
billion bushels at the beginning of the marketing year 
even so that represents only a slight dip in the us corn 
stockpile compared with last seasons decline when it plummeted 
from 426 billion bushels on sept 1 1988 to the 193 billion 
bushels on hand this sept 1 
the report said corn prices may average in the range of 185 to 
225 per bushel in the 198990 marketing year down from 254 
last season unchanged from the september report 
other 1989 crop estimates based on oct 1 indications compared

more safety features are needed on the 
nations 41000 small school buses to protect children in 
accidents the head of the national transportation safety board 
said thursday 
james kolstad acting board chairman said an 18month 
investigation into the buses that make up 10 percent to 15 percent 
of the total school bus fleet shows that injuries to students in 
accidents generally have been minor 
but the board believes that improvements can be made 
kolstad said in discussing the report adopted by the board 
wednesday night 
crashsled tests and federal standards are needed to increase 
protection of children in frontrow seats of smaller school buses 
the board concluded 
the report found small buses to be generally safe but called for 
improved frontdoor latches and windshield retention and several 
tests to determine whether tough standards for larger buses should 
be extended to those built to carry between 10 and 24 children 
the board said that although school buses remain one of the 
safest of all forms of transportation some smaller buses have been 
modified in ways that increase the chance of injury in a crash 
particularly to children sitting in the front row 
in some cases passenger lapbelts and other restraints had 
been installed in a manner inconsistent with federal standards 
for seatbelts diminishing crash protection and increasing the 
potential to induce injury the board said in its findings 
in multivehicle crashes and other crash scenarios small 
school buses lack the builtin crash advantage of superior size and 
weight provided by large school buses the board concluded 
but it said investigation of 24 accidents involving the smaller 
buses showed that they generally provided good crash protection 
to both restrained and unrestrained passengers 
safety belts are customarily provided for passengers in small 
buses but the ntsb staff said not all students are using them and 
laponly belts in the front seat may add to the danger of injury in 
some crashes 
the board two years ago recommended against seat belts in larger 
buses preferring that seats be designed so they in effect form 
padded compartments around youthful riders 
the board rejected earlier staff recommendations for fullscale 
crash tests on small school buses some officials argued that the 
low level of injuries and relatively small number of deaths about 
two a year in small bus crashes does not require such a complex 
study 
the tests proposed would be conducted by the national highway 
traffic safety administration and include computer simulation and 
crash sleds 
the sled tests involve seats barriers and dummies attached to a 
sled that approximates conditions in a crash 
board spokeswoman drucella andersen said the tests could not 
duplicate conditions in an entire bus but would show the effects on 
children in the front seat and test the effectiveness of various 
seatbelt and barrier designs 
the board also voted to call for testing to determine the need 
for stronger roofs and joints it said roofs in the smaller buses 
are less able to withstand rollover forces and body joints are 
exempt from federal joint strength standards that pply to larger 
buses 
the board in august sent back the staff study for revisions 
after failing to resolve questions over testing of frontseat 
barriers and seatbelt use in the buses

nynex corp and union officials agreed thursday to 
have mediators intervene in a 10weekold strike involving 60000 
telephone workers 
were looking optimistically on this since weve been asking 
for months and months to have a mediator said adele stacy a 
spokeswoman for the international brotherhood of electrical workers 
she said unions first requested an independent mediator aug 3 
but telephone company officials had resisted the idea until 
reversing their stance thursday 
all parties acknowledge that it is in the best interest of 
employees and customers to bring the strike to a conclusion as 
quickly as possible the company and unions said in a joint 
statment 
officials for both sides said further details regarding 
scheduled meetings and progress in the mediation process would be 
jointly announced it was not immediately clear whether discussions 
would be conducted on a state or federal level officials said 
negotiators had arrived at a standoff wednesday after talks 
abruptly broke off under conditions each side blamed on the other 
ibew spokesman robert silva said union officials were developing 
a counterproposal to the latest offer by new england telephone co 
a nynex subsidiary when they were told the company would not 
consider an alternative 
but peter cronin a spokesman for new england telephone offered 
a different version he said union officials had been 
unresponsive to the needs of its striking members and failed to 
show up for talks wednesday on the improved proposal offered by 
the company 
that proposal was laid on the table tuesday in the first 
bargaining session held this month 
workers walked off the job aug 6 after contract discussions 
broke down over salary and health care issues the communications 
workers of america which represents 40000 workers at nynexs new 
york telephone subsidiary and the ibew whose 20000 workers are 
at new england telephone struck over nynexs insistence that the 
workers pay up to 1500 a year in health care costs 
negotiations have progressed slowly or not at all since 
employees walked off the job leaving customers throughout new 
england and new york with delays in directory assistance repairs 
and installation 
strikes that broke out in several other regional telephone 
companies were settled in relatively quick order the regional 
companies were created in 1984 by the breakup of american telephone

president bushs nominee to head the 
governments nuclear weapons program acknowledged thursday he had 
mishandled an allegation of illegal drug use at a new york atomic 
power plant during his tenure as a nuclear regulator 
victor stello defended his record as chief of staff at the 
nuclear regulatory commission and denied allegations that he was 
more interested in carrying out personal vendettas than ensuring 
safety at nuclear plants 
i am convinced that i acted in the best interest of safety and 
responsible management he told the house interior subcommittee 
on oversight and investigations 
under intense questioning by rep peter kostmayer dpa the 
panel chairman stello said he now believed he had waited too long 
to act on an august 1988 allegation by a former worker at the nine 
mile point nuclear station near oswego ny of illegal drug use 
there 
stello admitted he did not order an investigation of the charge 
which eventually was dismissed until late march 1989 despite the 
serious safety issues it raised 
we should have pursued that earlier stello said adding 
that he kept the allegation secret because he feared the disclosure 
would compromise an internal nrc investigation based on other 
allegations from the same informant douglas ellison 
some of those other allegations were targeted at roger fortuna 
a former nrc criminal investigator whom ellison accused of failing 
to fully investigate his earlier allegations of criminal violations 
at nine mile point 
kostmayer claimed stellos goal in the internal investigation 
was to press the allegations against fortuna as a way of 
discrediting him and curbing the independence of fortunas office 
of investigations at the same time kostmayer said stello was 
hindering the separate probe of safety conditions at the plant 
you are so wrong stello said i stand by what i did and 
accept full responsibility for it 
stello acknowledged however that he should have acted on the 
drug charge more quickly because one of the two reactors at nine 
mile point was operating at the time the allegation was of drug 
use at the idled reactor but stello acknowledged that many 
employees at the station perform work in both reactor buildings 
stello said he was willing to accept kostmayers accusation that 
he had acted stupidly 
some environmental groups are vigorously campaigning on capitol 
hill to block stellos senate confirmation as assistant energy 
secretary for defense programs whose main responsibility is to 
manage the troubled nuclear arms program 
the senate has not yet scheduled a committee hearing to consider 
stellos nomination which was announced by the white house july 
24 stello is now on loan from the nrc to energy secretary james d 
watkins as a special adviser and has been heading up efforts to 
restart the savannah river sc nuclear reactors which make a 
gas vital to production of nuclear warheads 
kostmayer did not mention stellos nomination to the energy 
department post during thursdays hearing but the ranking 
republican on the panel rep barbara f vucanovich of nevada said 
later she believed the main purpose of holding the hearing was to 
attempt to discredit stello and block his senate confirmation 
instead of inquiring about whether stello was carrying out 
personal vendettas at the nrc it seems to me its more of a 
vendetta on mr kostmayers part mrs vucanovich said in an 
interview its certainly against mr stello 
stello said in an interview during a break in his testimony that 
he too suspected that kostmayers committee was mainly interested 
in derailing his nomination 
it looks that way he said noting that committees in both 
the house and the senate have already held extensive hearings on 
his role in the allegations involving nine mile point

the us roman catholic church should drop its 
qualified support for teaching about condoms in public schools as a 
way of preventing aids and should urge that youngsters be taught 
chastity instead a committee of bishops said thursday 
there is no such thing as safe or safer sex thats an 
illusion said archbishop roger mahony of los angeles chairman 
of the ad hoc committee on the hiv statement hiv is the virus that 
causes aids 
the committees draft statement which was criticized by an aids 
activist who said keeping information from children would be 
abandoning them to death revises an earlier document released 
by the churchs 50member administrative board in december 1987 
the 1987 document said the church could tolerate public schools 
providing information about condoms as long as sexual abstinence 
outside of marriage was presented as the only morally correct and 
medically sure way to prevent aids 
after it was released it was criticized by some conservative 
us bishops who said it would be misinterpreted as condoning sex 
outside marriage and artificial birth control cardinal joseph 
ratzinger head of the vatican congregation for the doctrine of the 
faith also chastised the administrative board for not consulting 
with the vatican 
in spring 1988 the national conference of catholic bishops 
decided to draw up a new statement 
the revised statement called to compassion a response to 
the hivaids crisis will be presented to the conference at its 
fall meeting nov 69 in baltimore the committee drafting the 
statement was made up of mahony cardinal joseph l bernardin of 
chicago cardinal bernard f law of boston archbishop william h 
keeler of baltimore and bishop raymod w lessard of savannah ga 
the wideranging statement also opposes universal mandatory aids 
testing calls for increasing federal funds for aids research and 
denounces violence and discrimination against aids victims as 
immoral 
we are called to be a people of compassion after the 
teachings of jesus mahony said 
where the new statement differs from the earlier document 
titled the many faces of aids a gospel response is mainly in 
its stand on condom education in public schools and in a larger 
sense the role of catholic bishops in public policy debates 
the first document approached condom education as the lesser of 
two evils in reducing the risk of aids in students who are unlikely 
to remain chaste it said the bishops did not approve of condom use 
but were willing to join with others in a society of diverse 
religious beliefs in a dialogue on how sexuality might be 
communicated in our public schools and elsewhere 
bishop william a hughes of covington ky chairman of the task 
force that drew up the original statement said at the time 
were offering to work with members of other faiths and people of 
good will on moral values that we can make part of the presentation 
on aids 
hughes was not available thursday afternoon to respond to the 
new report his office said 
mahony said many bishops believed that when the church indicated 
a willingness to compromise on catholic teaching to become more 
influential in public policy it was terribly confusing to 
catholics 
thats never been our role mahony said even to start 
down that road is fraught with difficulties 
jay blotcher a spokesman for the aids coalition to unleash 
power criticized the proposal saying to deny these children 
this information is abandoning them to death i dont see anything 
moral about that if the church intends to save its kids theyre 
going about it entirely the wrong way 
richard mccormick a professor of christian ethics at notre dame 
university said the new document may well be an attempt to 
achieve some kind of political peace within the bishops 
conference 
mccormick said telling students who refuse to be sexually 
inactive to use condoms to try to save lives is not an invitation 
to immoral behavior any more than telling students not to drive 
drunk is an invitation to insobriety 
but the bishops revised document said condom education is a 
quickfix solution to the aids crisis 
the safesex approach to preventing hivaids though 
frequently advocated compromises human sexuality and can lead to 
promiscuous sexual behavior the bishops said not only is the 
use of prophylactics in an attempt to halt the spread of hiv 
technically unreliable promoting this approach means in effect 
promoting behavior which is morally unacceptable 
on similar grounds the bishops said it was wrong to supply 
clean needles to drug addicts to prevent them from acquiring aids 
by sharing contaminated needles the committee said that approach 
could encourage more drug abuse and discourage abusers from seeking 
treatment 
but the bishops rejected the idea that aids is a direct 
punishment from god 
recall that unborn children can be infected in the womb and 
that people can acquire hiv from transfusions with contaminated 
blood to suppose that hiv is gods punishment implies that god is 
vindictive and capricious the bishops said 
within the church the bishops called on dioceses to develop 
pastoral programs to care for people with aids and to be an 
advocate for ensuring their civil liberties while also 
promulgating its own nondiscrimination policies in employment 
housing delivery of medical and dental care access to public 
accomodations schools nursing homes and emergency services

zimbabwes chief delegate to a 
world conclave concerned with protecting africas elephant 
population said thursday if they trample on your fields and on 
your crops you dont feel sentimental about them 
the 103nation meeting of the convention on international trade 
in endangered species or cites was deeply divided over how to 
tighten control of ivory sales worldwide 
statements from supporters and foes of a total ban suggested 
both sides were standing firm despite strong behindthescenes 
efforts to reach a compromise solution 
conference sources said a decision was not likely to come before 
the windup phase of the meeting which ends oct 20 
the conference is to act on proposals concerning more than 200 
species but discussions focused on the proposal by seven states 
including the united states kenya and tanzania amounting to a 
worldwide ban of trade in ivory 
it formally calls for cites to transfer the elephant from 
appendix ii of the convention where limited trade of products is 
allowed to appendix i which would prohibit all commerce in ivory 
tusks skin or elephant meat 
zimbabwe south africa and botswana are opposed they argue they 
have maintained their elephant populations by careful management 
and that sales of elephant products finance conservation efforts 
victoria chitepo zimbabwes chief delegate told a news 
conference thursday that any worldwide ban would guarantee the 
extinction of the elephant because there would be no more 
economic interest in protecting them 
she gave her countrys elephant population as 52000 
estimates of the global herd vary from 700000 to 400000 
compared with a reported 13 million a decade ago but zimbabwe 
says its numbers are on the rise 
us chief delegate constance harriman reaffirmed she will press 
for a sweeping prohibition she criticized a proposal by cites 
secretarygeneral eugene lapointe of canada that the three southern 
african nations be allowed limited trade under appendix ii termed 
split listing 
i think he has exceeded his authority and showed poor 
judgment she said of lapointe 
private comments by several delegates indicated growing support 
for a similar compromise formula advanced by martin holdgate 
british director general of the international union for 
conservation of nature 
holdgate also favors split listing in addition he proposed 
that southern african countries benefiting from it commit 
themselves to a new tight control mechanism and accept a voluntary 
moratorium on the sale of ivory until that system is in place and 
promises to be effective 
we have not fully discussed it yet but i think it is a 
reasonable approach said delegate pieter mulder of south africa 
which estimates its elephant population at 9300 delegates from 
smaller african nations also voiced sympathy for holdgates 
proposal 
delegates clamoring for a total ban said they were confident 
they would get the twothirds vote required to have the elephants 
listed under appendix i 
some african countries with large elephant populations have kept 
a low profile so far including zaire with almost half of the 
estimated african total 
disclosure that cites activities are partially financed by ivory 
traders have not created much of a stir at the lausanne meeting 
the issue has not been formally raised in the plenary meetings 
of about 800 delegates

the prosecution in the lengthy mcmartin 
preschool molestation trial began his closing argument thursday 
telling jurors the schools young students were snared in a web of 
gradually escalating abuse 
the chief defendant raymond buckey 31 appeared calm and 
relaxed when deputy district attorney roger gunson began his 
summation of the case which at 2 years is the nations longest 
criminal trial 
buckey said in the courthouse hallway he felt ok and added 
im relieved its now down to just weeks and were finally 
getting to a jury 
buckey and his mother peggy mcmartin buckey 62 are charged 
with a total of 64 counts of molestation and a shared count of 
conspiracy involving 11 children at the familyowned manhattan 
beach preschool 
superior court judge william pounders who has worried aloud 
about completing the trial because no alternate jurors are left 
said each side would have 6 days for arguments and he expects a 
lengthy deliberation 
gunson sought to explain how crimes were committed by people who 
have been portrayed in court as not being like molesters and how 
they went unreported 
although parents would expect their child to tell them if they 
were abused they dont gunson said 
referring to expert testimony gunson said this was because it 
was not a case of a stranger molesting and injuring a child but 
rather a gradual entrapment and web of secrecy growing up around 
the defendants actions 
the web tightened by means of gifts and games and benefited 
from childrens fears of being blamed and not being believed 
according to the theory 
expert testimony also showed that molesters often feel genuine 
affection toward children who return that affection the prosecutor 
said 
we have mr buckey saying he loved children he said 
gunson told jurors they should not assume that some stories 
changed because children had talked with prosecutors and therapists 
from childrens institute international a childabuse detection 
and treatment center 
the defense has argued that the children were in effect 
brainwashed 
gunson launched into a detailed summary of events focusing 
first on a girl who testified she was molested and made to play a 
naked movie star game 
the girl was 2 years 8 months old when she entered the school 
in september 1977 and was 5 years old when she left in 1980 she 
was 9 years old when she first talked to therapists at childrens 
institute international and was 12 by the time she testified at the 
trial 
more than 1000 pieces of evidence have been entered 15 
million has been spent 124 witnesses have testified and every one 
of the six alternate jurors has been used because of illness and 
employment problems court proceedings have produced 60000 pages 
of record 
the case began in 1983 as the largest child molestation 
prosecution ever authorities said hundreds of children were 
molested over five years seven teachers were arrested and charged 
with 207 counts 
prosecutors said children were molested during rituals with 
satanic overtones then terrified into silence by teachers who 
mutilated animals and threatened to harm the pupils parents 
after an 18month preliminary hearing district attorney ira 
reiner dismissed charges against five defendants saying there was 
too little evidence to try them the hearing alone cost the 
government 6 million 
the trial became the longest criminal trial in us history in 
april surpassing the twoyear record of californias hillside 
strangler case

democratic leaders in congress pressed 
president bush on thursday not to veto legislation that would end a 
ban on federally financed abortions for the most vulnerable 
american women the poor who are victims of rape or incest 
they acknowledged that supporters of the relaxed medicaid 
abortion limits do not have enough votes to override bushs 
threatened veto but urged him to reconsider 
house republican leader bob michel said he had not heard from 
bush on the possible abortion veto but told reporters ive 
never known him to go back on his word 
but senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine in a joint 
statement with house speaker thomas foley said the presidents 
position is wrong it is harsh terribly harsh on the poorest 
most vulnerable american women 
not only is this a reflection of the majority position of the 
house of representatives democrat and republican and the united 
states senate but the american people as well said foley 
dwash 
the president has the power to deny an opportunity for poor 
women to make a choice in their tragic circumstances he said 
bush threatened in august to veto the bill our signals out 
there and he believes in it strongly but will review the bill when 
it gets here white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said 
thursday 
in an outcome that surprised even the victors the house voted 
216206 on wednesday to reverse a decade of restrictions on 
medicaid abortions the vote was in favor of permitting federal 
money to be used to terminate pregnancies for poor women who are 
victims of rape or incest and who report it promptly to authorities 
the provision would extend current law permitting medicaid 
abortions only in cases where a womans life was endangered by 
pregnancy and she could not afford to pay for an abortion 
it is part of a 1567 billion measure to finance labor health 
and education programs for fiscal 1990 that has already been 
approved by the senate but remains subject to final agreement on 
unrelated issues 
although many abortionrights lawmakers said they expected a 
veto bush has been been dogged by controversy on the abortion 
issue for a decade and some antiabortion groups have questioned 
his commitment 
as recently as tuesday the white houses office of management 
and budget said in a policy statement sent to congress that it 
would recommend the president reject legislation permitting those 
relaxed regulations on medicaid abortion 
but bush had supported the broader language as a presidential 
candidate in 1980 and although he altered them as vice president 
he has made seemingly conflicting statements on the issue in an 
appearance oct 7 1987 at an iowa high school while campaigning 
for president bush told a student who questioned him that while he 
opposes abortion i would make the exception rape incest 
and the life of the mother 
the new provision is narrowly drawn permitting abortion when 
the victims report the rape or incest promptly and officials 
said the change might affect only a small number of cases 
but it was widely viewed as a symbolic victory for supporters of 
abortion rights and came as prochoice forces were benefiting from 
an apparently changed political climate on abortion since the 
supreme courts ruling in july that ruling opened the way for 
increased state regulation of abortions and according to 
prochoice forces politically energized those who oppose limits on 
the right to an abortion 
michel suggested there might be room for a compromise if both 
sides could agree to a provision permitting medicaid abortions when 
the rape or incest victim reported that act within 48 hours of its 
occurance 
the house vote came on the same day abortion rights groups 
enjoyed another symbolic victory this time in florida the state 
legislature in a special session called by republican gov bob 
martinez rejected all the governors proposed abortion 
restrictions 
certainly florida and the vote yesterday in congress are 
reflective of a new political movement said kate michelman 
executive director of the national abortion rights action league 
the climate is changing 
the league the political arm of the prochoice movement 
announced its plans for a nationwide effort to oppose antiabortion 
political candidates around the country in 1990 in races ranging 
from the senate to the statehouses 
the group also unveiled television and newspaper advertising it 
is running in virginia aimed at defeating the antiabortion 
republican marshall coleman and electing the democratic nominee 
douglas wilder who supports continuing legal abortions

most people realize the chances of getting aids 
from an infected doctor are remote but nearly 45 percent believe 
physicians with the disease should not be allowed to practice 
medicine according to a survey 
more than half 557 percent said if they learned their 
doctor had aids theyd change doctors according to survey results 
published in fridays journal of the american medical association 
there have been no documented cases in the united states of a 
patient contracting aids from his physician a spokesman for the 
federal centers for disease control in atlanta said thursday 
the ama said the survey results indicate americans need to be 
better educated about aids and it cautioned that doctors must be 
afforded the same civil liberties as other citizens 
education alone is not enough said ama board member dr 
nancy dickey while education is necessary we must reaffirm the 
rights of physicians 
the survey of 2000 people was conducted by telephone during the 
summer of 1988 half of the respondents who were selected at 
random lived in areas with a high number of aids cases while the 
other half were chosen from all areas of the united states the 
authors said there was no significant difference in the two groups 
responses 
twothirds of those polled said they believe the chance of 
contracting aids from an infected doctor is unlikely or 
nonexistent while 11 percent said they consider the chance of 
infection very likely and 22 percent considered it somewhat likely 
eighty percent of the respondents said a physician with aids 
should be obligated to tell his patients and 32 percent felt they 
should be told if their doctors were even treating patients with 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
there is a generalized fear of aids thats not just related to 
concern about getting infected said bryan maguire coauthor of 
the article 
i think it shows that aids education is not the solution to 
the whole problem said maguire a research associate at the 
university of california san franciscos dentistry school 
thats why we need antidiscrimination legislation just 
having the knowledge isnt enough to counteract fears maguire 
said 
in an editorial accompanying the study dickey said physicians 
have the right to confidentiality in matters that are not pertinent 
to their practice 
there is no ethical obligation for a doctor to tell his 
patients he has aids the editorial said 
it is imperative that physicians be extended at least the 
simplest of civil liberties that are extended to all other citizens 
the right to privacy and the right to work so long as others are 
not at risk 
the editorial reiterated the amas ethical position that 
physicians who run even a minimal risk of infecting their patients 
must refrain from practicing doctors who carry the aids virus must 
consult with their own physicians to establish any limits necessary 
to ensure the disease is not passed on the editorial said 
the cdc however recommends that aidsinfected surgeons with 
open lesions who run the risk of direct contact with patients 
refrain from work said cdc spokesman charles fallis 
thats the only case in which the cdc recommends that any 
healthcare worker refrain from practice 
aids cripples the bodys defenses against disease leaving a 
person prey to lifethreatening infections and certain cancers the 
fatal incurable disease is caused by a virus that is spread mainly 
through sexual intercourse sharing of contaminated hypodermic 
needles and from infected mothers to their infants before or during 
birth

the associated press erroneously reported on 
wednesday that rep lynn martin rill was among a group of house 
members who voted in favor of looser restrictions for federally 
funded abortions for poor women after voting against a similar 
provision a year ago 
the error resulted from a mistake in the congressional record 
listing of votes from sept 8 1988 
ms martin was listed on a roll call vote from sept 8 1988 as 
being paired against a proposal to expand medicaid abortion 
coverage to women who are victims of rape or incest 
but in the congressional record of sept 13 1988 martin said 
her vote of four days earlier had been paired incorrectly and she 
should have been recorded as favoring the broader coverage 
a paired vote means a member was not in the chamber but was 
matched with another lawmaker who voted the opposite and both were 
recorded as voting accordingly

housing and urban development secretary jack 
kemp ran into opposition thursday from members of congress to some 
of the measures he is recommending for cleaning up his 
scandalridden department 
both republicans and democrats on the house banking committee 
sharply criticized kemps proposal to target more of the 
politically popular community development block grant cdbg 
program to strict antipoverty efforts 
that was not the original intent of that program a targeted 
war on poverty said rep chalmers wylie of ohio the ranking 
republican on the banking panel which has oversight 
responsibilities for hud 
to stifle the certain degree of flexibility that cdbg has with 
its intentions would be absolutely outrageous to me echoed rep 
mary rose oakar a democrat from cleveland i dont want to see 
some guidelines changed to inhibit my citys opportunity to use 
that money 
under current regulations only 60 percent of the 3 billion 
that hud funnels annually to state and local governments through 
cdbg grants for downtown revitalization projects must directly 
benefit poor people 
as part of a 58point plan to address widescale fraud 
mismanagement and influencepeddling at hud during the reagan 
administration kemp last week proposed raising povertyrelated 
targets for cdbg grants and housing subsidy programs to 75 percent 
to avoid both the appearance and reality of favoritism kemp 
also proposed eliminating as political slush funds the 
discretionary programs that allow hud to ignore merit and 
competition requirements in awarding community development and 
housing grants 
i want to kick politics out of those decisions he said 
thursday there would be no decision at hud by kemp staff 
assistants or anyone based on who you know what political party 
you belong to how many consultants you hire or how much you pay 
them 
while generally praising the thrust of kemps proposed reform 
measures members of congress as well as several mayors have 
fidgeted the last week over the prospect of removing politics 
entirely from the process 
since the loss of revenue sharing many mayors have used this 
as revenue sharing wylie told kemp the implication that if a 
congressman calls about a project in his district theres something 
wrong is most unfortunate 
citing a litany of wellpublicized past abuses kemp said the 
discretionary funds and community development grants had often gone 
toward financing golf courses swimming pools highrise hotels and 
scores of other projects with little or no benefit to the poor 
if i dont have criteria youre going to haul me before this 
committee and have my head for doing things that are not figthing 
poverty building houses taking care of the poor kemp said 
however ms oakar and other members of the panel expressed 
fears that past abuses will be cited as a reason to allow an 
erosion in many of the programs 
im not responsible because somebody in new york got a 
swimming pool she said my city operates that program well i 
get the impression what were going to do now is have this fortress 
built up as an overreaction and as a substitute for programing 
just two weeks ago hud rejected clevelands application for a 
69 million urban development action grant for a 48 million rock 
n roll museum ms oakar said then she still hoped to get the 
federal aid through one of the socalled discretionary accounts 
that kemp wants abolished 
at thursdays hearing she repeatedly voice irritation 
if i want housing for downtown cleveland and i have some 
phoney baloney regulations put up as a smokescreen so that our area 
does not get housing you better believe im going to fight you on 
that she told kemp 
good im a fighter kemp retorted i want to be a 
successful hud secretary but i have to call them as i see them 
and we dont think a udag grant for a rock n roll museum was 
necessary it did not fit the criteria

physicists trying to mimic the birth of the 
universe inside an atom smasher said thursday they found strong 
evidence that the building blocks of matter belong to only three 
families a discovery that puts a lid on the complexity of 
nature 
this brings us closer to really understanding the physical 
universe and how its put together said burton richter a 1976 
nobel laureate in physics and director of the stanford linear 
accelerator center 30 miles southeast of san francisco 
experiments on the 3milelong 125 million stanford linear 
collider showed the odds are 25to1 that there are only three 
families or generations of fundamental particles that make up 
matter physicist michael riordan said by telephone from stanford 
it means that somehow the universe is comprehensible that 
its not a total mystery that it can be grasped by the human 
mind riordan said it puts a lid on the complexity of nature 
at its most fundamental level 
until now atom smasher experiments indicated only that there 
were no more than five or six families of fundamental particles 
such as electrons and quarks richter said 
the universe contains more matter than antimatter if there were 
fewer than three families of basic particles the universe would 
contain equal amounts of matter and antimatter said david schramm 
a university of chicago astrophysicist 
because matter and antimatter destroy or annihilate each 
other existence of fewer than three families means we wouldnt 
be here he said the whole universe would be filled with 
radiation and very little else 
on the other hand if the building blocks of matter belonged to 
more than three families the universe would contain more helium 
gas than it does schramm said 
everyday matter is made of four particles belonging to the first 
family they are up quarks down quarks electrons and electron 
neutrinos electrons and electron neutrinos are both classified as 
leptons 
protons and neutrons in the nucleus of an atom are made of the 
two types of quarks electrons orbit the nucleus electron 
neutrinos are produced by exploding stars 
the second family of particles can be found today only in atom 
smashers and cosmic rays from space the particles are the strange 
and charmed quarks and two leptons named muons and muon neutrinos 
particles in the third family first discovered in the 
mid1970s are the bottom quark the yetundetected top quark the 
tau lepton and the tau neutrino 
they can be created today only in atom smashers but like the 
other families of particles existed naturally in the first few 
seconds after the big bang that scientists believe created the 
universe roughly 15 billion years ago 
if there were more than three families of particles experiments 
in stanfords particle smasher should have produced evidence of 
more than the three known types of neutrinos and possibly evidence 
for other quarks and leptons but no such evidence was found 
riordan said 
the machine shaped like a giant tennis racket includes a 
2milelong linear accelerator that speeds up electrons the 
particles that create television pictures and their antimatter 
counterparts called positrons 
in the 1milelong part of the machine that looks like the head 
of the tennis racket the particles are smashed together 
annihilating each other in a way that comes close to recreating 
the incredible temperatures and pressures that existed during the 
big bang 
the collisions produce z particles which are so heavy they 
existed naturally only for moments after the big bang the zs 
produced in stanfords machine then decay into lighter particles 
such as quarks and leptons which are studied with an 1800ton 
detection device 
the atom smasher has produced nearly 500 z particles since it 
made its first one last april without yielding signs that more 
than three families exist 
cosmologists scientists who study the universe predicted in 
1977 there should be only three or four families of fundamental 
particles 
that was based on the amount of helium gas produced by the big 
bang and observed in the universe which contains about 74 percent 
hydrogen 24 percent helium and only 2 percent other elements 
schramm said 
the big bang in some sense was a big hydrogen bomb turning 
hydrogen to helium and the amount of helium made in that big bang 
depends on the number of families schramm said 
he said he was very pleased with stanfords findings because 
its the first time an accelerator experiment has confirmed a 
theoretical prediction made from cosmology

sinhalese radicals and troops fought 
in southern sri lanka and at least 18 people were killed the 
government said thursday 
meanwhile president ranasinghe premadasa convened a conference 
of sri lankas political parties in the hopes of finding a 
negotiated means to end the ethnic violence that has wracked this 
island nation for six years 
the killings were reported over the past 24 hours during which 
the radicals burned at least 39 government buildings the 
government said in a statement 
it said the victims included nine civilians two policemen and a 
soldier in the sinhalesedominated south six unidentified burned 
bodies also were found in the region said the statement which 
gave no further details 
foreign minister ranjan wijeratne told reporters that more 
indian peacekeeping troops will leave ampara district on monday 
ampara is about 125 miles east of colombo india has withdrawn 
about 3300 soldiers this year and promised to pull out the 
remaining 39000 troops by dec 31 
details of the exact numbers leaving cannot be revealed 
but the whole withdrawal process will keep to the dec 31 
deadline wijeratne said 
the government has worked out a plan to replace the withdrawing 
indian soldiers with sri lankan troops said wijeratne also the 
deputy defense minister 
sri lankan soldiers have been confined to barracks in the 
northeast under terms of a 1987 accord that allowed indian troops 
to police the region 
the accord aimed to end the ethnic tamil insurgency for a 
separate homeland by giving them limited autonomy it also allowed 
indian soldiers to be deployed in the northeast to supervise an 
arms surrender by tamil guerrillas and to maintain law 
the accord sparked a violent backlash by sinhalese in the south 
that was led by the peoples liberation front an antigovernment 
sinhalese guerrilla group 
the government says more than 5000 people have been killed in 
two years of fighting between the peoples liberation front and 
government forces 
the front said the 1987 peace plan gave too many concessions to 
the minority tamils who make up 18 percent of sri lankas 16 
million people it also said the presence of indian troops 
compromised the countrys independence 
asked about the continued violence in the south wijeratne said 
the backbone of the front has not been broken yet but we will 
begin operations against them in a day or two 
in yet another attempt to end the fighting premadasa hosted an 
interparty conference thursday that was attended by 90 delegates 
from 22 political parties premadasa said he would accept until the 
end of the month suggestions on how to end the violence 
the peoples liberation front had not accepted an invitation to 
participate in the conference but delegates speaking on condition 
of anonymity said premadasas latest offer was aimed at them 
tamil militias including the largest liberation tigers of tamil 
eelam are attending the conference 
at least 11000 people including 1000 indian soldiers have 
died in the 6yearold tamil separatist war which grew out of 
complaints of discrimination in jobs and education by the majority 
sinhalese 
sinhalese who are mostly buddhists make up 75 percent of the 
population and control the government and the military tamils are 
mostly hindus

a masterpiece from pablo picassos blue period 
long thought to have disappeared is expected to become the worlds 
most expensive painting when sold at auction on nov 30 an 
auctioneer said thursday 
les noces de pierrette pierrettes wedding executed 
in 190405 in montmartre is expected to bring 46 million to 61 
million said auctioneer jeanclaude binoche 
its going to shatter the world record not only for picassos 
but for all paintings binoche said 
the record paid at an auction for a picasso was 487 million 
for a 1901 selfportrait titled yo picasso sold on may 9 
vincent van goghs irises became the most expensive painting in 
the world when it sold two years ago for 539 million 
binoche said he was hopeful culture minister jack lang would 
allow les noces to leave france the painting is considered 
part of frances national heritage and must receive an official 
authorization to leave the country 
with its hauntingly beautiful pink and blue tones the work 
straddles picassos bestloved early periods six figures their 
pale pink faces illuminated by an eerie light sit around a table 
with the newlyweds the bride wears a spanishstyle mantilla her 
husband sports a top hat 
though experts are familiar with dozens of sketches picasso drew 
for les noces the final work dropped from sight years ago 
many thought it was lost in a fire 
it surfaced in 1988 as part of a picasso show in stockholm 
binoche said the work was long the property of a swedish family 
that does not want to be identified 
the family considered the painting to be a private treasure 
and now its for sale thats all he said 
the sale has been hailed as the major event of the auction 
season 
sothebys in new york has said the family of joan whitney 
payson the sellers of van goghs irises hope to fetch a 
similar price on nov 15 for an early picasso selfportrait titled 
au lapin agile named after a tavern frequented by the artist

a pending 3 billion sale of tanks and other 
equipment to saudi arabia will have little effect on israels 
security because the saudis have indicated the weapons will be 
deployed far from israels borders an administration official said 
thursday 
the saudis have told us officials that the threats to their 
security come mostly from the countrys neighbors to the northeast 
iran and iraq and from south yemen along saudi arabias 
southern border 
the main items are 315 modern tanks but twothirds of the price 
tag reflects the cost of equipment and ammunition including huge 
trucks to transport any tanks that break down the deal is roughly 
equivalent to one years us assistance to israel 
the bush administration on wednesday informally notified 
congress of the intended sale setting in motion a 50day period in 
which congress either kills the deal by majority votes in the 
senate and house or lets it go through deliveries will begin in 
about 1993 
israel has registered disapproval of the proposed sale of the 
m1a2 tank as a matter of principal but thus far has not raised 
serious objections the official said the sale also faces little 
apparent opposition from israels supporters on capitol hill 
the official briefing reporters on the condition he not be 
identified by name said he expects some of the tanks will likely 
be deployed at a military training school in northwest saudi arabia 
not far from the israeli border 
this should not be a concern to israel because you need only 
to look at a topographical map of saudi arabia to realize that 
tanks have a very difficult time indeed getting from saudi arabia 
to israel in combat situations the official said 
a pamphlet on the tank sale published by the state and defense 
departments said the m1a2 will give the saudis improved mobility 
over severe terrain the m1a2 would replace frenchbuilt tanks 
designed 30 years ago 
the us will benefit from the sale because the m1a2 will 
enhance the deterrent value of saudi forces that guard natural 
resources of critical strategic importance to the united states 
and the west the pamphlet said 
it added that the tank will provide a 3 billion boost to us 
exports tens of thousands of manyears of employment for american 
workers and over 680 million in savings and revenues to the us 
treasury

the soviet unions 1989 grain harvest is 
turning out larger than previously forecast the agriculture 
department said thursday 
production is now estimated at 205 million metric tons up 5 
million tons from the previous forecast officials said the upward 
revision was due mostly to preliminary yield results published by 
moscow 
the latest estimate includes 89 million tons of wheat an 
increase of 2 million tons and 103 million tons of coarse grains 
such as corn and sorghum up 3 million tons the balance is made up 
of pulses rice buckwheat and miscellaneous grains 
officials also said the usdas estimate of soviet grain imports 
have been reduced 2 million tons to 35 million tons for the trading 
year that runs through june 30 1990 
in a related report the usda announced an additional sale to 
the soviet union of 100000 tons of us corn for delivery in 
198990 under a longterm supply agreement 
orders announced the last two weeks now total 38 million tons 
of corn and 325000 tons of soybean meal in addition 143700 tons 
of soybeans that had been sold for delivery earlier were carried 
over into the seventh year of the agreement between the two 
countries which began oct 1 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 394 bushels 
of corn or 367 bushels of wheat or soybeans

a swiss woman was kidnapped in northern 
lebanon sunday two days after the abduction of two swiss red cross 
workers the foreign ministry said thursday 
ministry spokesman clemens birrer said the parttime flight 
attendant was kidnapped by armed civilians during a visit to the 
mediterranean port of tripoli 
the womans name and age were withheld at the request of her 
parents birrer said 
her disappearance brings to 19 the number of westerners missing 
in lebanon including eight americans most are believed captives 
of shiite moslems loyal to iran 
birrer said the womans parents asked authorities not to 
publicize the case but he confirmed the kidnapping after being 
asked to comment on unattributed news reports 
switzerland requested help from syria because syrian troops 
control much of northern lebanon he added 
last friday two swiss international red cross workers elio 
erriquez and emmanual christen were abducted in southern lebanon 
there have been no demands and no claims of responsibility in 
the kidnappings so far and birrer said swiss officials did not 
assume the womans abduction was connected to the most recent 
kidnappings 
lebanese police said monday that erriquez and christen are being 
held by radical palestinian guerrillas led by terrorist mastermind 
abu nidal whose group denied taking part 
plo spokesmen last week accused abu nidals group of the 
kidnappings linking them to a shiite moslem militant mohammed 
hariri who is serving a life sentence in switzerland for hijacking 
an air afrique jetliner in 1987 and killing a french passenger 
longestheld of the western hostages is terry anderson chief

a respected pediatrician is causing a stir 
with the disclosure of sex change surgery to become a woman 11 
years ago and her desire to change back to a man 
i was born male and i was raised male and i feel like thats 
the way ill feel most contented said dr janis ashley one of 
sedalias two practicing pediatricians 
ashley 38 has refused to talk to reporters after she disclosed 
in an interview published tuesday in the sedalia democrat that she 
was a man until her 1978 sex change operation and wanted to be a 
man once again 
the disclosures surprised ashleys patients but many have 
rallied around her some residents of sedalia a town of 21000 
people in central missouri are making fun of the physician 
some people are saying some really crude things making jokes 
behind her back said asha lees whose twin 10monthold sons 
are ashleys patients 
i figure shes been through a lot of pain and i hope that 
sedalia wont run her out of town that theyll let her stay ms 
lees said 
ashley apologized to the town and said she wanted to continue 
her practice in sedalia 
this topic has the potential to be a flare point im 
sorry for that and for giving this town or any part of the 
community any unwanted notoriety she said 
ashley has a 4yearold adopted son michael and said he might 
be confused about her changing sexuality she is taking male 
hormones and said she would not undergo reconstructive surgery 
right away 
i tell michael i am his mommy and i will always be his mommy 
but im also his daddy ashley said i am his mother his 
parent whatever you call it but that emotional attachment 
will be the same 
ms lees said she sent ashley flowers a balloon and a card with 
her prayers after learning of the baby doctors background and 
plans ms lees said she wants ashley to continue to care for her 
twins 
i think she is an excellent doctor ms lees said a sex 
change doesnt bother me at all her thoughts will be the same 
whether shes a male or a female 
ellen cable who heads the sedalia pta said she also was not 
disturbed by ashleys disclosures 
ive heard nothing but good things about her as a doctor and 
i dont think a sex change is going to make any difference she 
said 
dr robert stockwood chief of staff at sedalias bothwell 
regional health center where ashley occasionally tends patients 
said her sexuality will not affect her status at the hospital as 
long as she continues to provide good medical care 
ashley said she consulted a child psychologist on how to deal 
with questions and any confusion of her son and young patients as 
she changes back to a man 
im going to be direct and honest and answer their 
questions and emphasize to them that im still the same and will 
still doctor them the same she said but gradually i will 
begin to look more like their daddy than their mommy 
ashley was married before deciding at age 25 to become a woman 
the marriage ended in divorce 
a woman who answered the telephone thursday at ashleys office 
and refused to give her name said said all calls from the media 
were being referred to ashleys kansas city lawyer pat white 
white was in court thursday and did not return a reporters 
telephone call

the state department said thursday that blind 
candidates will be allowed to join the us foreign service and 
serve as diplomats abroad 
the policy reversal was announced by ivan selin undersecretary 
of state for management at a joint hearing of the house foreign 
affairs and civil service subcommittees after rep gerry sikorski 
dminn said the state department had a history of discriminating 
against the blind 
selin said state department officials had reconsidered their 
stance since sikorski chairman of the civil service subcommittee 
first aired complaints about discrimination against the blind at a 
february hearing 
we decided you were right all along selin told sikorski 
adding that details about the policy change will be released later 
this month 
after over a decade of discrimination against blind people i 
am glad the state department has changed its policy and opened its 
door to all qualified people who wish to serve our country 
abroad sikorski said after the hearing 
sikorski noted that in testimony in february witness avraham 
rabby said he had been denied admission into the foreign service 
despite the fact that he holds degrees from oxford and the 
university of chicago is fluent in french spanish and hebrew and 
had five times passed the services oral and written examinations 
mr rabby is also blind and was denied access to the foreign 
service simply because of his blindness sikorski said 
the department said last year that the blind could not serve as 
diplomats because they cant work independently with original 
documents without readers or braille translations 
selin told the hearing that the department is reviewing its 
entry procedures including its written foreign service exam to 
eliminate any trace of bias which may in fact exist including 
bias against minorities and women

a high east german official rejected the 
democratic reforms some soviet bloc allies have embraced and said 
thursday that communism will continue to dominate society 
another said the government will listen to all parts of the 
population clamoring for change as long as they do not insist on 
scrapping the current social order 
there were signs of strong differences within the leadership 
over how to deal with the flight of tens of thousands of citizens 
to the west and growing demand at home for a freer society reports 
persisted that 77yearold erich honecker the nations hardline 
leader was in trouble 
bild a masscirculation west german newspaper quoted communist 
party sources it did not identify as saying honecker would be 
replaced oct 18 
eduard lintner intergerman affairs spokesman for christian 
democrats in the west german parliament was quoted in the daily 
passauer neue presse as saying honeckers departure was 
immediately at hand 
communist party sources in east germany said an increasing 
number of ranking party figures are displeased with how honecker 
handled the exodus of young skilled workers and recent 
prodemocracy protests 
the official news agency adn carried a routine dispatch thursday 
that omitted his title as head of the communist party the more 
powerful of his two posts adn usually refers to him as both 
communist party leader and head of state 
honeckers picture has not appeared on the front pages of party 
newspapers for two days it usually appears daily 
der tagesspiegel a west berlin paper said thursday a strong 
majority in the ruling 21member politburo favored honeckers 
departure 
after what sources said was a volatile meeting the politburo 
promised on wednesday to examine the causes of the flight and the 
protests it said the government would be willing to discuss 
reforms 
lutheran church sources in east berlin said late thursday that 
leipzig officials were preparing to release all those arrested in 
protests there since sept 11 the number was not immediately 
known but up to 500 people are believed still to be in jail 
whatever the hints of a more liberal attitude a commentary in 
the berliner zeitung newspaper thursday by central committee member 
otto reinhold emphasized the leading role of the party in 
bringing about any change 
reinhold said he wanted to distinguish the role of the party in 
east germany from the everincreasing variety of changes in 
other socialist countries 
the statement was obviously a reference to east germanys 
previously sharp repudiations of the dramatic democratic reforms 
sweeping east bloc allies hungary and poland 
reforms for the sake of reforms arent in demand but rather 
changes which will serve the further development of socialism 
reinhold said 
kurt hager east german communist party ideology chief and 
another influential politburo member offered a more conciliatory 
line 
he was quoted by west germanys zdf television as saying that 
there was no differences of opinion in the party leadership he 
said leaders had agreed it was necessary to open a dialogue all 
parts of the population 
but hager strongly indicated that he did not include the growing 
opposition movement among them 
if they want to question our social order then thats not a 
basis for discussions said hager 
hagers remarks came during a trip to moscow for the opening of 
a culture exhibition soviet president mikhail s gorbachev during 
a visit to east berlin last week urged honecker to undertake 
reforms 
meanwhile reaction was cautious thursday to the statement the 
day before by the politburo which is trying to appease somewhat 
the forces of unrest while still presenting a unified front 
committed to socialism 
manfred stolpe a top lutheran church official in east berlin 
welcomed the governments commitment to dialogue as an important 
step 
but baerbel bohley cofounder of the opposition group new 
forum described the politburo statement as a verbal shift that 
does not take into account real life 
in washington state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
welcomed the east german offer of a dialogue but said dialogue 
should be meaningful and not just a tactical move to relieve 
domestic and international pressure 
west german chancellor helmut kohls chief of staff rudolf 
seiters said kohl was optimistic 
this could be the first positive signal to the populace that 
the east german leadership has given seiters said of the 
politburo statement but we must wait to see what concrete 
measures it carries

army chief of staff gen carl vuono said 
thursday that he would prefer to have longterm cuts in armed 
forces personnel worked out through the arms control process than 
have them dropped on us right now during budget negotiations on 
capitol hill 
vuono in a meeting with reporters noted that defense secretary 
dick cheney has already proposed a cut of 8000 army personnel in 
the 1990 fiscal year 
out of the more than 21 million people on active military duty 
a cut of 16800 positions was proposed by cheney in may 
some 8000 were to come from the army 5600 from the navy and 
3200 from the air force while the marine corps was untouched 
but in current housesenate negotiations on the pentagon budget 
lawmakers have eyed cuts of up to 40000 individuals to meet 
spending limits in the 1990 fiscal year 
i would hope that we can see our way clear in 90 and 91 
without taking any major end strength reductions and enable us to 
shape that army figure based on the presidents proposal right 
now on the arms control table that gives us a better opportunity 
to shape it rather than piecemeal in 90 and piecemeal in 91 
vuono said

prime minister yitzhak shamir on thursday 
appealed for calm and for trust in the military despite failure to 
detect a syrian warplane flown by a defector into northern israel 
the seven minutes the syrian air force pilot spent over israel 
before landing the mig23 supersonic fighterbomber caused a public 
uproar over possible flaws along one of israels most sophisticated 
defense lines 
in damascus the syrian capital international red cross 
official ulrich lenhartz said the genevabased organization was 
trying to arrange the return of pilot and plane at syrias request 
israeli radio stations and most newspapers said the air force 
failed to scramble inteceptors before the plane landed near haifa 
a city of 250000 
there is a question that people justly ask how and why it 
happened that a plane came in without being detected immediately 
shamir told high school students in raanana there is an 
investigation regarding this i think that people of israel 
with their experience of many years can certainly trust and give 
full confidence to its air force 
lets not turn an event that should be joyful into a cause for 
arguments and worries its good for israel that such an important 
significant valuable plane abandoned syria and came to us 
chief of staff lt gen dan shomron appointed a team to 
investigate the army command said in a communique it will look 
into control antiaircraft and command operations and report by 
monday 
whether the investigators had power to recommend action against 
individuals who may have failed in their duties was not clear 
israels eight leading dailies asked on their front pages how 
the pilot maj adel basem 34 managed to land without 
interference on a cropdusters airstrip at megiddo 57 miles north 
of jerusalem and spend 20 minutes on the ground before security 
officials arrived 
davar newspaper said the plane crossed the golan heights at an 
altitude of 100 feet at about 780 mph 
syria is israels implacable foe israel annexed the golan 
heights after capturing them from syria in the 1967 middle east war 
yaakov abudi an airfield official who was the first to meet 
basem quoted the pilot as saying one major reason he defected was 
being beaten after asking for better housing 
a syrian official in damascus said the pilot did not defect but 
had to make an emergency landing israeli officials denied the 
plane had technical problems 
an israeli army spokesman said a red cross request to meet basem 
would be examined but added the red cross routinely visits 
detainees in israel and he is not a detainee 
officials refused to say where or under what conditions basem 
was staying

a nursing home ravaged by a fire last week 
that killed 12 residents reopened thursday after passing state and 
local inspections 
state health commissioner dr cmg buttery said the hillhaven 
rehabilitation and convalescent center was authorized to let 
residents back on the third and fourth floors 
the second floor where the fire started is being renovated and 
was not approved for patient care the first floor houses services 
such as the dining room and therapy rooms 
lori peacock regional marketing director for hillhaven corp 
said the first resident returned thursday afternoon 
weve only heard about a half a dozen residents who are not 
planning to return she said 
the city fire marshal said earlier this week that a blown fuse 
prevented an alarm from being relayed to authorities when the blaze 
broke out shortly after 10 pm on oct 5 
the alarm system also releases magnets holding fire doors open 
had the system functioned properly and closed the doors smoke 
would not have filled part of the second floor where most of the 
deaths occurred officials said 
fire inspectors cited the nursing home for failing to ensure the 
alarm system worked and for failing to notify the fire department 
when the alarms were shut down for three days in september to 
fumigate the building 
assistant city fire marshal william d beisch said thursday that 
the nursing home had repaired the alarm system and that fire 
officials were satisfied that the home complied with the city fire 
code the city building inspector also gave the home permission to 
resume operations 
authorities said the fire started when a patient who was 
smoking in violation of regulations accidentally tossed a lighted 
match onto a bed the fire was contained to one room on the second 
floor but smoke poured through the building 
nine people were killed in the fire and three other residents 
died monday and tuesday in hospitals those three were among 98 
injured in the fire the home had 161 residents 
in another development a resident of the nursing home filed a 
3 million lawsuit against the homes owner wednesday in norfolk 
circuit court 
edna d carroll 88 who is in stable condition at a hospital 
alleges that her injuries resulted from negligence and breach of 
duty by the nursing home 
pete moore the hillhaven corps director of operations 
declined to comment on the lawsuit

lech walesa said thursday that solidarity 
saved poland from civil war but he wonders whether the independent 
trade union movement can now lead the country out of economic chaos 
the solidarity leader predicted the worst of the process of 
rescuing the economy which is beset by inflation product 
shortages and low industrial productivity could be over in a year 
but he said the government will have to do a better job of 
explaining its policies to a restless populace 
walesa also said that if the first noncommunist government in 
the east bloc led by solidarity journalist tadeusz mazowiecki as 
prime minister fails we will have the moral right to accuse the 
world of not helping us 
the bush administration is supporting a 119 million threeyear 
package of economic aid and 100 million in food aid to poland 
congressional critics are calling for more 
 
walesa made the comments at his weekly news conference at 
solidarity headquarters in gdansk a forum he has used to make a 
series of dramatically worded commentaries on worsening conditions 
in poland 
i claim that it was solidarity that saved this country from a 
civil war is it capable of saving it now thats a question im 
asking myself he said 
id like to emphasize that we avoided civil war and there is a 
chance for rescue in the nearest future if society understands 
this maneuver and joins in it will all take not more than a year 
solidarity banned after martial law was declared in december 
1981 was relegalized this year after a wave of strikes in august 
1988 brought a series of talks and sweeping reforms in april the 
solidarityled government came to power in august after free 
elections in june 
the new government proposes a rapid shift to a marketoriented 
economy but acknowledges the situation inflation is 600 percent 
annually will likely worsen before it gets better 
walesa said the new government is not explaining its changing 
policies well enough 
when i dont understand something it means that at least 60 
percent of the society doesnt understand it the union leader 
said 
walesa also said local government elections expected to 
challenge the last bastion of communist control should not be held 
too soon 
it will only divide the nation which will concentrate on 
electoral struggle and not on the reforms that must unite us he 
said

a panamanian human rights official 
said thursday that 77 people were killed and 200 arrested following 
last weeks coup attempt against gen manuel antonio noriega 
raul escoffery executive director of the panamanian human 
rights committee said the casualty figure was based on sketchy 
evidence but challenged the panamanian defense forces to disprove 
it 
if its not true we will say it publicly escoffery said 
but until the government cooperates with us we presume our 
information to be true 
robert troncoso the rights committees vice president said he 
believed the information the committee has is too sketchy to give 
any estimates 
the day after the oct 3 coup attempt the defense forces issued 
a communique that said 10 rebels were killed and 37 detained in the 
uprising 
troncoso and escoffery said the rights group had received dozens 
of telephone calls most of them anonymous from people who said a 
relative friend or neighbor in the military had not been seen 
since the uprising 
we presume there are many more than this troncoso said but 
he said repeatedly that the evidence was too sketchy to be precise 
the committee wrote to noriega head of panamas defense forces 
and therefore leader of the country three days after the failed 
coup asking permission to visit imprisoned mutineers 
we are still awaiting a reply troncoso said 
the rights officials and family members contacted by the 
associated press said they did not know where prisoners were being 
held 
president carlos andres perez of venezuela has accused the 
defense forces of carrying out summary executions 
defense forces spokesmen have denied reports an enraged noriega 
personally shot the coup leader minutes after the uprising was 
quashed that was one question foreign journalists permitted to 
interview noriega were forbidden to ask

anew in georgia

of basic supplies and georgia hurting for fuel was all over the 
azerbaijani news agency azerinform said thursday 
freight traffic from azerbaijan to armenia has been fully 
restored it said but admitted fewer trains than expected 
arrived in the two republics 
the unrelenting conflict in the caucasus a jigsaw puzzle of 
nationalities set among the mountains between the black and the 
caspian seas is proving one of the kremlins most intractable 
ethnic problems 
in the nagornokarabakh region two men were killed this week in 
clashes with authorities the soviet newspaper komsomolskaya pravda 
said thursday 
in georgia activists said a mass meeting in the capital 
tbilisi drew thousands wednesday night to support calls for 
georgian independence and against the soviet draft 
fifty people have declared a sitin near the sports palace 
against the occupying army tea daraselyan a member of a 
georgian independence group said thursday in a telephone interview 
from tbilisi 
she said the meeting wednesday asked georgian youths to refuse 
to serve in the soviet army and asked all georgians to boycott 
upcoming elections 
nationalist fervor has run high in georgia since spring when 19 
georgians died in a clash between proindependence protesters and 
soviet troops ethnic unrest also turned bloody in the georgian 
enclave of abkhazia this summer 
nagornokarabakh has been the source of a vicious territorial 
dispute between armenia and azerbaijan for 18 months the ethnic 
armenian majority wants the region taken from azerbaijan and 
annexed to armenia kremlin officials imposed direct rule there 
trying to calm tensions

defense secretary dick cheney said thursday 
that hes encouraged by advances in the brilliant pebbles 
component of star wars but that he would recommend president bush 
veto the pentagon budget bill unless congress improves funding for 
the program 
cheney locked in negotiations with congress in an attempt to 
stave off cuts in the programs billiondollar budget acknowledged 
hes got a tough battle ahead 
weve got to convince people that its necessary cheney 
said of the strategic defense initiative in a speech to the 
national security industrial association 
house and senate conferees hammering out the pentagons budget 
for the 1990 fiscal year that began oct 1 are at loggerheads over 
the program 
the senate approved 45 billion for star wars in its 
authorization bill last month while the house adopted a funding 
level of 31 billion president bush had requested 49 billion 
if the house recommendation prevails cheney said he would be 
forced to eliminate some technology options cancel contracts and 
scale back research 
should the congress produce legislation with inadequate 
funding levels for sdi i will recommend to the president that he 
veto the bill he said 
cheney holding up a camera that would be used in the brilliant 
pebbles program lauded scientists for developing a lighter 
smaller and cheaper system he said would save enormous sums of 
money 
im very encouraged cheney said we are using mostly 
offtheshelf technology no scientific breakthroughs have been 
necessary to create brilliant pebbles we are basically using what 
we have 
we havent yet settled on a final design but the work is 
going well and most important we see no major scientific 
roadblocks to the program 
brilliant pebbles refers to the swarm of thousands of small 
computerized rockets that would be put in space to locate track 
and smash enemy missiles by bumping into them rather than through 
explosive force 
it is only one possible component of star wars which has gained 
greater opposition as budget cuts soak up scarce defense funds 
some critics contend star wars experiments could derail ussoviet 
advances in arms control 
cheney spoke positively about other aspects of star wars 
including research in laserbeam technology and groundbased 
interceptor systems he repeated assertions that the soviet unions 
strategic defenses have improved not weakened under mikhail 
gorabachev

the senate began plowing through a 141 
billion deficitreduction bill thursday as democrats claimed enough 
votes to block republicans from tacking on a cut in the 
capitalgains tax 
unless congress completes action before monday on the 
eightinchthick bill which is almost impossible automatic 
acrosstheboard reductions will be triggered in most federal 
spending programs but congress has left itself an out even if the 
automatic cuts take effect they can be restored as soon as the 
bill is enacted 
the sheer size of the bill and the fact that it was put into 
final form barely two hours before debate began were enough to 
cause some senators to view the automatic spending cuts as the 
lesser of two evils 
if somebody wanted to manufacture a piece of legislation 
absolutely confirming the worst suspicions they have about the 
budget process it would be this piece of legislation said sen 
william armstrong rcolo it is impossible as a practical matter 
for any senator to have more than a general idea of whats in this 
bill 
he lodged his complaint as the senate budget committee voting 
97 approved the bill which was written by eight other committees 
members of both parties expressed concern because the bill is 
laden with amendments that have nothing to do with reducing the 
deficit 
during the first four hours of debate on the bill republicans 
criticized congress for not being conscientious in cutting the 
deficit democrats lambasted president bush for pushing the 
capitalgains cut and the senate approved its first amendment of 
the day spending an extra 40 million for hospitals 
sen james sasser dtenn chairman of the budget committee 
acknowledged the bill does not boldly address a deficit problem 
that appears to have drifted from under the spotlight of public 
scrutiny but it does restrain the deficit and it meets 
guidelines the administration and congress agreed on last spring 
he said 
sasser and sen pete domenici of new mexico senior republican 
on the budget committee promised an effort on the senate floor to 
strip away some of the extraneous provisions 
although the major purpose of the spending bill is to reduce the 
deficit in the current budget year to about 110 billion most of 
its bulk is attributable to hundreds of pet projects these range 
from a childcare initiative to repeal of a law designed to prevent 
discrimination in employerpaid health care to scores of tax breaks 
for various special interests 
more important to the bush administration and republican 
senators the bill does not contain the capitalgains tax cut that 
president bush promised during the campaign last year the senate 
finance committee rejected the cut in favor of a democratic plan to 
liberalize taxdeductible individual retirement accounts 
republicans and a handful of democrats have been considering 
trying to add a capitalgains cut to the bill but there was no 
certainty they would make the effort the reason is that while a 
majority of senators favor some kind of capitalgains reduction 
backers apparently cannot muster the 60 votes required under senate 
rules to attach the reduction to the deficit bill 
without a doubt democrats can block the capitalgains cut 
majority leader george j mitchell dmaine told reporters 
however a capitalgains cut is likely to end up in the 
deficitreduction bill when negotiators from the senate and the 
house produce the final version of the legislation that is because 
the house bill contains a reduction that was approved by a lopsided 
majority of representatives 
about 53 billion of the 141 billion worth of deficit 
reduction in the bill would come from a package of mostly minor tax 
increases the one with the most impact on the most people would 
make permanent the 3 percent tax on local and longdistance 
telephone service due to expire at the end of 1990 
a freeze in increased medicare reimbursements for doctors a 
reduction in payments to hospitals and other medicare changes would 
produce an additional 3 billion removing the postal service and 
its own deficit from the budget would save 177 billion 
extending the authority of the department of veterans affairs to 
charge a 1 percent fee on guaranteed housing loans would bring in 
169 million 
the string of specialinterest tax breaks in the bill stretches 
from owners of tuxedorental stores to farmers with annual receipts 
under 5 million to small taverns to rich grandparents who give 
their grandchildren up to 2 million

several countries health professionals and 
manufacturers are violating an international agreement regulating 
the marketing of infant formula according to a church study 
released thursday 
sara shingler head of the united methodist church infant 
formula task force said that in all 16 countries studied 
researchers found that the major manufacturers of breastmilk 
substitutes nestle abbott american home products and 
meadjohnson were deficient in some degree with requirements of 
the code 
the world health organizations code on the marketing of breast 
milk substitutes was adopted by member countries major formula 
manufacturers and international distributors in 1981 
a spokesman for nestle greee chaffee said officials had not 
seen the study and had no comment on it 
a representative of american home products carol emering said 
that in developing countries we comply fully with the who 
code she said the company has had no more than four complaints 
annually since the company adopted the code 
cathy babington a spokeswoman for abbott declined comment 
saying company officials had not received the report efforts to 
reach meadjohnson were unsuccessful 
the who code sets gives national governments primary 
responsibility for distribution of nutritional information and 
prohibits government or manufacturers use of pictures of infants 
or written materials idealizing or promoting use of infant formula 
the code also stipulates that product labels must include 
instructions on proper preparation and use of the formula and must 
emphasize the nutritional superiority of breast feeding 
in addition retail outlets cannot use distributors displays 
advertisements or employees nor can doctors or health facilities 
distribute manufacturers samples or formula information 
in practice shingler said the study which involved 2108 
interviews in hospitals clinics retail outlets foreign 
government agencies and with individual physicians revealed 
problems of compliance in all the countries studied 
the threeyear study concludes that 
more than half of the mothers interviewed had received no 
nutritional information about themselves and their children from 
government health agencies 
information provided by both governments and formula makers 
didnt let people know the financial implications of using formula 
or the difficulty in reversing a decision to bottle feed 
manufacturers retailers doctors healthcare facilities and 
governments violated prohibitions or restrictions in their 
promotion advertising and marketing procedures 
fewer than a third of the labels on formula cans included an 
expiration date 
however where the governmental agencies responsible for 
health care made a firm effort to comply with the code the 
manufacturers improved their level of compliance said shingler 
the companies will do as much as they are required said 
douglas johnson task force researcher at a news conference 
thursday 
but johnson said governments defend lax enforcement because 
their argument is that they do not have enough people and that 
the government needs money also 
the countries included in the study were argentina brazil 
chile dominican republic ecuador jamaica kenya malaysia papua 
new guinea philippines taiwan thailand venezuela ghana 
swaziland and south africa 
members of the united methodist churchs general board of church 
and society and independent infant formula experts serve on the 
sixmember church task force which has studied infant formula 
usage and marketing since 1980

polands prosecutorgeneral asked the 
soviet union on thursday for a murder investigation into the 1940 
killings of 15000 polish army officers at katyn and other soviet 
sites 
prosecutorgeneral jozef zyta also asked soviet authorities to 
clear the names of 16 military and political leaders of polands 
world war ii antinazi resistance convicted as bandits at a 
1945 show trial in moscow 
the soviets were asked to carry out an investigation of murder 
at katyn and other places still unknown of polish officers 
interned in the fall of 1939 in camps at kozielsk starobielsk and 
ostaszkow said a communique carried by the state pap news agency 
the killings one of the most painful issues in polishsoviet 
relations had long been blamed by the polish and soviet 
governments on nazi german troops but most poles and western 
historians concluded the polish officers interned in the soviet 
union were executed on orders of soviet dictator josef stalin in 
1940 before war broke out between the soviets and germany 
more than 4200 bodies of polish officers were found at katyn 
near minsk in 1943 the bodies of an additional 11000 officers 
have never been found 
poland and the soviet union began rewriting the official account 
of the deaths in 1987 when they agreed to form a joint commission 
to review blank spots in history 
zytas communique noted that the polish historians on the 
commission concluded more than a year ago that security officers of 
the soviet nkvd predecessor of todays kgb carried out the 
killings 
the soviet historians never issued a concurring report and 
complained of being denied key archival material in the soviet 
union lack of soviet action raised calls in the polish press for a 
formal legal investiation 
in light of international commitments binding both on poland 
and the soviet union the katyn crime has the feature of a homicide 
and is not subject to expiration zytas communique said 
meaning those responsible might still face trial 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and polish communist first 
secretary mieczyslaw f rakowski reportedly discussed an 
investigation in talks wednesday 
soviet comrades have taken up many problems which are more 
difficult and more painful to them than this one rakowski said 
later according to polish media reports i am sure they are 
going to find an answer to this our tragedy too

the irish republic will not prosecute an 
irish former priest accused by britain of plotting ira violence a 
government legal officer said thursday 
eamonn barnes director of public prosecutions said material 
submitted by britain to bring patrick ryan to trial as well as 
irish police inquiries were not sufficient to justify a 
prosecution 
ryan 59 still wears clerical garb although the roman catholic 
leader in england cardinal basil hume archbishop of westminster 
has said he is no longer a priest 
britain last year failed to secure ryans extradition on charges 
of murder and bombing conspiracy and explosives possession on the 
british mainland between 1975 and 1988 irish attorney general john 
murray said press coverage in the case was prejudicial to a fair 
trial 
murray indicated ryan might be tried in dublin on the explosives 
charges but barnes decided against it 
in london barnes decision was described as a most 
disappointing outcome in a statement by allan green british 
director of public prosecutions 
delegates to britains governing conservative party annual 
conference in blackpool said the decision would strain angloirish 
relations ivor stanbrook a lawyer and conservative party 
legislator said clearly there was enough evidence to prosecute 
ryan the decision was made on political grounds 
peter brook the governments northern ireland secretary 
commented i think we necessarily have to consider it as a 
disappointing decision but it is a decision the irish government 
took on the papers before them 
a long history exists of british failure to extradite suspected 
members of the outlawed irish republican army from the republic 
the guerrillas fighting to end british rule in northern ireland 
and unite the partitioned island are often regarded as fighters 
for a political cause 
belgium returned ryan to the irish republic early in 1988 after 
refusing a british request for his extradition 
ryan denies british allegations that in addition to being an ira 
activist he collected money for the ira in the united states and 
europe

said thursday 
scott fuller a 15yearold black student transferred to 
heritage from nearby west point high school four weeks ago

headmaster would likely forfeit an oct 20 game at heritage but 
added if we dont play it wont be because of that black 
drake refused to elaborate and neither he nor pinkerton returned 
telephone calls thursday from the associated press 
wooten said sharkeyissaquena officials had told him they wanted 
their players fit for the remainder of the schools games against 
class 1a schools in the mpsa the association divides schools into 
classes of 1a 2a and 3a with 3a being the largest schools 
heritage with 540 students is a 2a school 
wooten said sharkeyissaquena has as many people on the roster 
as we do 
east holmes is in our conference and they really havent given 
me any particular reason we only have a 25 record so its not 
like were awesome and beating everybody to death because were

the problem is he said 
fuller said he was just a kid who likes to play sports im 
not trying to change the world 
the sophomore is the first black football player in the mpsa 
north central aa conference 
he said he wasnt bothered by the attitudes of the other schools 
you cant be upset with them its like their religion if 
thats what they believe theres nothing i can do he said 
scott has two younger brothers who attend west point public 
schools his father julius fuller said he wanted his eldest son 
in a school with a strong academic program that could provide more 
individual attention knowing his son would be the only black team 
member

china said thursday its refusal to let hong kong 
return illegal chinese immigrants is britains fault and refused 
to say when it would start accepting them again 
china suspended the repatriations sunday apparently in 
retaliation for hong kongs decision to let yang yang a chinese 
swimmer who sought asylum after participating in prodemocracy 
demonstrations in hong kong to leave for the united states 
cooperation on returning mainland chinese who flee to the 
british colony was damaged by the britishhong kong government 
unilaterally foreign ministry spokesman li zhaoxing said at a 
weekly briefing 
we hope britain and the britishhong kong government will 
express their sincerity in cooperation so that the agreements on 
border issues can be implemented he said 
asked by a hong kong reporter about reports that china may stop 
supplying water and nonstaple food to hong kong li said beijing 
has always been very concerned about the compatriots in hong kong 
and macao he described such reports as irresponsible and with 
ulterior motives 
china has not directly linked the swimmer to the immigrant 
matter but the official news agency xinhua said the yang case 
will for sure adversely affect the normal contacts between the 
residents of the mainland and hong kong 
li said without elaborating recently the british government 
did something that was harmful to the prosperity and stability of 
hong kong 
hong kong authorities have intercepted nearly 50 illegal 
immigrants a day since sunday 
the crushing of prodemocracy dissent in china this spring has 
seriously damaged the confidence of hong kongs 55 million 
residents in the 1984 britishchinese agreement to return the 
colony to china rule in 1997 
li denied knowledge of a reported slowdown of repatriation of 
chinese illegals in the portuguese colony of macao near hong kong 
he said cooperation between china and portugal over macao which is 
to revert to china in 1999 was going very well

up to 50000 gallons of gasoline and other 
fuels leaked from tanks at a depot near an american research 
station on the south polar ice this week officials said thursday 
technicians are working in minus 40degree temperatures are 
attempting to clean up the mess 
jack renirie a spokesman for the national science foundation 
which directs the us antarctic research said thursday that 
experts have not ruled out sabotage as a cause 
he said the leaks occurred in as many as seven of 10 
rubberized bladders used to store jet fuel diesel fuel and 
gasoline at williams field an aircraft landing strip five miles 
from mcmurdo station the principle us research and supply 
station in the antarctic 
weve used these tanks at several locations in the antarctic 
and weve never had leaks from seven tanks simultaneously said 
renirie 
nobody has used the word sabotage he said not yet 
the summer reasearch season is just beginning at mcmurdo and 
about 400 people are now working there at the peak of the season 
about 800 scientists engineers technicians and workers will live 
at the station for the warmer months of the antarctic year 
renirie said the leaky tanks are in a storage area that is 
surrounded with protective dikes made of ice he said the fuel is 
thought to have leaked and then filtered down through snow to an 
ice layer about 30 feet below the surface forming a subsurface 
pool of about 180 feet long by 60 feet wide 
the estimate of the amount of fuel leaked comes from records 
that indicate a shortage of about 50000 gallons he said 
mcmurdo and williams field are located on the ross ice shelf a 
deposit of ice several thousand feet thick that forms a large part 
of the apparent surface of the antarctic continent williams field 
is used as a major supply depot for all of the us operations in 
the south polar area including stations at the south pole and at 
palmer station on the ross sea 
the ice where williams is located is considered stable and 
renirie said it will not move to the sea for years as a 
consequence he said there is little danger that the spilled fuel 
will end up in the ecologically fragile ocean waters around the 
antarctic 
we expect that the environmental impact will be minimal when 
we get it out of there and tanked up he said it spilled 
fuel could be confined to the area just under the tanks for some 
time 
renirie said workers are attempting to dig snow away from the 
tanks to find and repair the leaks they then will start the 
cleanup 
they will pump out the fuel and slush and put it on a tanker 
sled and take it back to mcmurdo for disposal he said the 
tanker sled holds about 3000 gallons he said which means a 
number of trips will be required 
the clean up workers must contend with temperatures dipping 
regularly to a minus 40 degrees fahrenheit the spokesman said 
no method has yet been chose for disposal of the fuel said 
renirie 
the fuel spill is the second in recent weeks at us 
installations at antarctica earlier personnel at the 
amundsenscott station at the south pole found that several 
thousand gallons of diesel fuel had leaked from a pipe that carried 
the fuel to a generator officials said then that the fuel drained 
down though the porous snow covering the south pole and pooled deep 
under the surface no attempt was made to clean up that spill 
on jan 28 an argentine ship called the bahia paraiso ran 
aground near palmer station and spilled about 200000 gallons of 
fuel and lubricants into the ocean about 64000 gallons remain 
aboard the bahia paraiso the ship was abandoned and remains 
aground leaking small amounts of fuel

technicians worked six at a time in 
a cramped engine compartment thursday to remove a flawed computer 
in time to meet a tuesday target for launching the shuttle atlantis 
and its galileo space probe 
the workers had to stand on platforms to unhook the computer so 
it can be replaced friday with a spare that will be tested for 
about 16 hours 
the odds are still 5050 that well be able to make a tuesday 
launch said nasa spokesman karl kristofferson space agency 
officials said they would decide saturday whether to delay liftoff 
until wednesday 
liftoff on tuesday is scheduled for 1257 pm the start of a 
24minute period in which the planet jupiter will be in the proper 
position to nearly cross paths with the galileo spacecraft in 1995 
wednesday has a 27minute launch window and nov 21 is the last 
day jupiter will be in the proper position until mid1991 
after launch atlantis crew of five astronauts is to release 
the 6700pound probe for the sixyear journey to jupiter 
the launch originally was scheduled for thursday but nasa 
postponed the flight tuesday after the engine computer called a 
master controller gave a false fuel pump pressure reading 
similar computers are located in the shuttles other two main 
engines they each weigh 230 pounds cost 6 million and control 
all functions of their individual powerplant during the climb into 
orbit 
had nasa tried to launch atlantis thursday as originally 
planned the effort would have been halted by bad weather 
officials said clouds and high winds prevailed throughout the day 
with intermittant rain 
the astronauts were at their main training base in houston on 
thursday rehearsing in a shuttle simulator 
a federal judge rejected a request by environmental groups to 
halt the flight for fear the nuclearpowered probe could scatter 
plutonium over florida if the shuttle exploded 
the groups filed a notice with the judge thursday that they were 
going to appeal his ruling to the us court of appeals 
the west german green party which focuses on environmental 
issues is asking to join in legal actions to delay the launch it 
hopes to gain time to get the issue of the space shuttles nuclear 
cargo before the world court 
because of the shortness of time they asked that we represent 
them said lanny sinkin a lawyer for the christic institute one 
of three us environmental groups that tried to stop the launch

lebanese legislators reached tentative 
agreement on a peace plan thursday but the christian army 
commander said their actions were irrelevant and he would renew his 
war of liberation against syrian troops 
we cannot rebuild our country under the shadow of an occupying 
force gen michel aoun told a meeting of bank employees in 
christian east beirut referring to the 40000 syrian soldiers 
stationed in lebanon 
he spoke hours after a committee of 17 lebanese parliament 
members meeting in taif saudi arabia approved a tentative plan 
for ending the 14yearold sectarian civil war which has cost more 
than 150000 lives 
conference sources said the committee met again in the evening 
to prepare for a full session of the 63 deputies who must approve 
the agreement 
the evening session ended abruptly when christian deputy george 
saadeh leader of the rightwing phalange party objected to 
crippling demands and stormed out he did not elaborate and no 
word emerged on when committee meetings would resume 
committee members would not give provisions of the plan beirut 
radio stations well connected with various factions said it 
provided for limited and phased syrian withdrawal and curtailed 
the powers of the president traditionally a christian 
aoun said in beirut we want radical reforms of this system 
from the roots and not the patching up of a rotten system the way 
they are trying to patch it up he did not specifically mention 
the taif agreement 
either there is reform in a free land where a free people 
lives or there isnt aoun said i hope everyone will be aware 
of this reality and always remember that a war of liberation 
erupted in lebanon for this purpose 
it will continue until it achieves its goals a meeting trying 
to abort the goals of this war will not stop it let those deputies 
understand that lebanons sovereignty and independence are not a 
matter for bargaining and negotiation 
zaher alkhatib a sunni moslem deputy from the prosyrian 
national front alliance said aoun is the number one enemy of the 
nation trying to affect the course of the conference and abort 
its mission of salvaging the country and ending the suffering of 
its people 
syrian troops are in lebanon under an arab league peacekeeping 
mandate issued in 1976 the year after fighting began aoun 
considers them an occupying force he vowed to drive them out after 
an artillery war began march 8 between his christian army units and 
a moslem alliance led by the syrians 
at least 930 people were killed and more than 2000 wounded 
nearly all of them civilians before a ceasefire sponsored by the 
arab league stopped the shelling sept 22 
on sept 30 those of the 99 lebanese parliament members who had 
survived the long civil war met in taif to seek a settlement 
after an overnight session deputies najah wakim an orthodox 
christian and hassan rifai a sunni said thursday they were 
optimistic 
voice of the people a prosyrian radio station said christians 
would continue to fill the presidency but would have fewer powers 
it said the president no longer would be able to issue general 
amnesties could dissolve the parliament only once in his sixyear 
term and would not be supreme military commander the station said 
the military would rpeort to the cabinet traditionally led by a 
sunni as prime minister 
the reforms are designed to give more power to moslems who have 
become the majority since lebanon gained independence from france 
in 1943 
druse chieftain walid jumblatt and nabih berri leader of the 
shiite moslem militia amal have dismissed the taif deliberations 
on grounds the proposals being considered do not give moslems 
enough power both are allied with syria

on thursday denounced the idea of government talks with narcotics 
traffickers after assassins working for drug barons killed two 
newspaper employees 
because of fear on the part of truck drivers and delivery boys

medellin where the employees were killed tuesday a newspaper 
executive told the associated press 
many kiosks in medellin were not selling el espectador hotel

they said speaking on condition of anonymity 
medellin a city of 2 million people in northwestern colombia 
is the headquarters for the worlds biggest cocaine cartel 
el espectador said in a lead editorial that drug traffickers 
suggestion of talks under their irrevocable threats of

three years ago said it is too late to forgive and forget 
el tiempo also in a leading editorial said el espectador is 
experiencing the gravest threat against the freedom of the press 
in the entire history of our republic

church leaders and the judicial branch in a direct dialogue 
between the government and drug traffickers

traditionally have supported each other in times of threats to the 
free press el tiempo has a daily circulation of 350000 and el 
espectador 285000 
both papers have called for government action against drug 
cartels but el espectador has been more outspoken calling the

elected with contributions from drug traffickers 
escobar was a backup member of the congress from 1982 to 1986 
each congressman is elected along with a backup member to vote when 
the real congressman is not present which is frequent 
on sept 2 a car bomb exploded alongside the el espectador 
building seriously damaging the building and forcing the newspaper 
to suspend advertising and cut back on the size of the paper 
the newspaper closed its office in medellin on wednesday and 
said it will remain closed until the newspaper can figure out what 
to do about security 
the government said thursday it had captured two more suspected 
drug traffickers and was holding them while the united states 
decides if it wanted to extradite them 
the suspects were identified by colombias federal 
administrative scurity police as manuel palma and leonidas vargas 
palma according to the us state department is wanted in 
miami on charges of participating in a money laundering operation

president bush will nominate acting chairman 
james kolstad to run the national transportation safety board 
rather than jim burnett the candidate chosen by president reagan 
a newspaper reported thursday 
the atlanta constitution quoted congressional and administration 
sources as saying burnett an ardent critic of government and 
industry safety practices will not get the nomination 
burnett whose term on the board expires in december 1990 was 
renominated as chairman by reagan in 1988 but kolstad became 
acting chairman when the senate failed to act on burnetts 
nomination 
burnett had served as chairman of the ntsb since 1982 
kolstad contacted in washington said he had heard no word of 
an appointment but he was hopeful and encouraged by the 
reports both kolstad and burnett have said they want the job and 
have deplored the delay in appointment of a permanent chairman 
last week rep john paul hammerschmidt rark said chances of 
burnetts reappointment were not good because he is opposed by sen

the discovery of a new victim in the green river 
serialkilling case gave detectives some fresh leads but few hopes 
were raised with 40 other deaths unsolved the chief investigator 
said thursday 
the skeleton of andrea marion childers who was 19 when she 
disappeared in 1983 was found wednesday by a worker cutting brush 
just 50 yards from where three other victims had been uncovered six 
years ago near seattletacoma international airport 
police believe the killer in the nations worst unsolved 
serialmurder case has not operated in the seattle area since 1984 
in addition to the 41 known victims eight young missing women are 
listed as presumed victims 
ms childers had not been on that missing list but the green 
river task force had information about her because she was reported 
missing in 1983 said king county police capt robert evans the 
task force commander 
investigators werent surprised that she turned out to be a 
green river victim and that her skeleton was found in an area 
heavily searched previously evans said 
if you go back to our experience with recovering bodies 
waiting two years before a family member calls and says i think 
you ought to look at this its just not unexpected anymore 
everything has some sort of a bizarre twist 
few personal details about ms childers were available but 
evans said she fit the profile of other green river victims those 
killed were young women most with links to prostitution 
seattle police had at least one contact with ms childers when 
they arrested her on march 14 1983 on a prostitution charge 
seattle police spokesman mark amundson said 
one month later edmonds wash police received a missing 
person report about ms childers she was last seen by her 
boyfriend as she was on her way to a shopping area frequented by 
prostitutes near the airport police said 
many green river victims were known to frequent the seatac 
strip near the airport south of seattle 
the time of disappearance what little we know now about the 
background of the victim is similar to a lot of our victims 
evans said the location the circumstances of the found 
victim those kinds of things are certainly indicative of a green 
river victim 
the missing person report on ms childers was among hundreds 
that green river investigators had collected as they strove to 
identify several victims found earlier 
however edmonds police later withdrew the missingperson 
report saying a witness had reported seeing ms childers crossing 
the canadian border 
the green river killings occurred from the summer of 1982 to 
early 1984 the killer operated primarily in the puget sound area 
the bodies of the first five victims were found near the green 
river giving the case its name 
no arrests have been made but william j stevens ii 38 of 
spokane has been described by task force investigators as a 
viable suspect he has been jailed in spokane on federal 
weapons charges but he has not been charged in connection with the 
green river killings

a state appeals court refused thursday to 
allow enforcement of a california law that would require an 
unmarried minor to get consent from a parent or a judge before 
having an abortion 
the 1st district court of appeal did not decide if the law was 
constitutional but upheld a san francisco judges decision that 
abortionrights groups had shown a likelihood of overturning the 
law on privacy grounds 
enforcement of the law is to remain blocked at least until the 
case goes to trial unless the ruling is overturned by the state 
supreme court 
among other things the court said abortionrights supporters 
offered evidence which indicates that all but a very few 
adolescent minors have the capacity for exercising mature judgment 
concerning the wisdom of an abortion and that the 
parentalconsent requirement would cause potentially dangerous 
delays 
if that evidence proves true the court said it would tend to 
show that the law invaded minors privacy without being justified 
by a compelling state interest 
since the law will severely impair or totally deny the 
exercise of an intimate and fundamental constitutional right the 
burden at trial will be upon state officials to prove they have a 
compelling interest in the regulation of unemancipated minors 
consent to an abortion said justice william stein in a 30 
decision 
the plaintiffs in the lawsuit were doctors individual minors 
and abortionrights supporters 
the ruling continues a ban on enforcement of the law which was 
scheduled to take effect in january 1988 but was blocked a few days 
earlier by a superior court judge 
the appellate decision relied on californias constitutional 
right of privacy passed by voters in 1972 the court followed 
previous rulings that the state constitutional right is broader 
than federal privacy rights and rejected the states arguments 
that privacy protections do not extend equally to minors 
the ruling comes after a recent florida supreme court decision 
overturning that states parental consent law also on state 
privacy grounds 
the use of the state constitution is important because similar 
laws in other states have been upheld by federal courts under us 
constitutional standards 
the california law would prohibit an unmarried woman under 18 
living at home from getting an abortion without the consent of one 
parent as an alternative she could go to a judge who would allow 
the abortion based on a conclusion that the minor was mature enough 
to make the decision or that it was in her best interest 
state officials have said 34000 women under 18 got abortions in 
california in 1985 the most recent figures available 
the case could give the state supreme courts new majority 
appointed by antiabortion gov george deukmejian a chance to 
reexamine the scope of state privacy rights 
deciding what he described as the only issue before the court 
stein said the lower court judge did not abuse his discretion in 
deciding that opponents of the law had met the standard for an 
injunction blocking its enforcement that enforcement would cause 
irreparable harm and that they had a likelihood of proving at 
trial that the law was unconstitutional 
attorney general john van de kamp the lead defendant in the 
case had argued that an invasion of a minors privacy could be 
justified by a significant state interest stein and his 
colleagues disagreed saying the state must show a compelling 
interest the standard that also applies to adults 
there is no argument that the protection of minors from 
physical psychological and emotional harm manifests a comeplling 
state interest stein said

seven latin american presidents pledged 
thursday to fight international drug trafficking and condemned the 
regime of gen manuel antonio noriega of panama 
in a declaration issued at the end of a twoday summit the 
group of eight presidents also urged that cuba be readmitted to the 
organization of american states it did not elaborate 
the oas expelled cuba in 1961 after accusing fidel castro of 
openly exporting revolution the communique issued by the latin 
american presidents marked the first formal suggestion that cuba be 
allowed to rejoin the group 
the declaration of ica was issued by presidents carlos menem 
of argentina alan garcia of peru carlos salinas de gortari of 
mexico carlos andres perez of venezuela virgilio barco of 
colombia jose sarney of brazil and julio sanguinetti of uruguay 
after the meeting in this remote desert city 180 miles southeast of 
lima 
the communique expressed the presidents regret over the 
violation of human rights and the absence of democracy in panama 
and said they would ask the oas to send a commission to that nation 
to investigate 
the presidents said panama would remain suspended from the group 
of eight formed two years ago as a regional consulting 
organization until it respects once again the democratic 
guarantees that today are absolutely ignored 
noriega foiled a coup attempt last week 
the declaration also said the presidents will use all 
resources available to help the cocaproducing andean nations of 
colombia peru and bolivia in their battle against the regions 
cocaine cartels the three nations produce nearly all of the 
worlds cocaine 
the elimination of these activities requires an integral 
focus the coordination between producing countries and consuming 
countries and the elaboration of special proposals the 
declaration said 
it did not specifically mention us drug policy but the 
presidents said repeatedly during the meeting that president bushs 
emphasis on using police and the military to stop cocaine smuggling 
in the andean countries was insufficient to halt the drug traffic 
we wont get anywhere putting the brakes on production of the 
raw material in countries like peru colombia and bolivia if the 
united states does not provide help and resources for substituting 
this type of product in the producing countries menem said at a 
news conference earlier thursday 
in his welcoming address garcia said the origin of this 
problem is in the demand in the large industrialized nations 
perez was even stronger in his criticism of the focus of bushs 
strategy which provides for 261 million in aid mainly in the 
form of helicopters and weapons to colombia peru and bolivia 
the more demand grows in the north the more production will 
grow in the south police actions will be useless unless demand is 
reduced perez said wednesday 
garcia barco and president jaime paz zamora of bolivia met here 
tuesday before the beginning of the group of eight gathering and 
agreed to invite bush to a drug summit to be held within three 
months in a latin american nation bush accepted immediately 
the three presidents said that drug trafficking could not be 
halted until production and consupmtion are curbed 
peru bolivia and colombia have urged greater us economic 
development aid to generate alternative sources of income for the 
hundreds of thousands of peasants who make their living from 
growing coca the raw material for cocaine 
the best allies that bush could have in his fight against drug 
addiction would be the campesinos themselves garcia said at a 
news conference thursday ours is not a military war its an 
economic war

president bush beat the drum for republican 
candidates from the mississippi gulf coast to gracie mansion 
thursday ending up by urging new yorkers to vote for americas 
greatest crimefighter mayoral hopeful rudolph giuliani 
bush capped a day of campaigning with an effusive speech at a 
fundraising dinner in manhattan expected to reap upwards of 1 
million for giuliani a former federal prosecutor polls indicate 
he is trailing badly in his bid to keep democrat david dinkins from 
becoming new yorks first black mayor 
painting a bleak picture of a city beset by neighborhood 
tensions crumbling bridges homelessness and a declining school 
system bush said rudys the one to turn around new york city 
earlier bush was in gulfport miss to rally support for 
republican tom anderson fighting uphill for a congressional seat 
that has been in gop hands since 1973 
while bush extolled anderson a longtime aide to mississippi 
sen trent lott as a sorely needed house vote for his war on drugs 
and fight against tax increases the endorsement paled in 
comparison to the accolades he showered on giuliani 
bush said new york isnt the city it used to be but rudy 
holds out the hope that it can again become the city it once was 
most of us know him as americas greatest crimefighter 
bush said likening giuliani to such larger than life crime 
busters as teddy roosevelt thomas e dewey and elliot ness 
in the war on drugs no man in america has a better chance of 
succeeding lets take back the streets lets bring back new 
york said bush 
rudy may be an underdog but new york loves an underdog 
said the president 
so take your polls and do what you want with them bush said 
bush quipped that the candidate knows that when he becomes 
mayor hell have the second toughest job in america the first of 
course is managing the new york yankees 
bush also attended a reception for rep guy molinari rny 
who is running for borough president of staten island and shook 
hands for the cameras with rep jim courter rnj who is seeking 
the governorship of new jersey at the newark airport 
bush went first to mississippi with republican national 
chairman lee atwater in tow to try to help the gop retain the seat 
left vacant by the death of rep larkin smith in a plane crash in 
august 
in gulfport bush said he hopes the drug summit he will attend 
with the presidents of colombia bolivia and peru will bring us 
to a new level of international cooperation in this war we must 
win against narcotics no time or place for the summit meeting 
has been announcecd 
anderson who trailed democrat state sen gene taylor in the 
oct 3 open primary was not shy in making party comparisons 
between himself and taylor 
there is a difference between the two candidates said 
anderson the party of michael dukakis walter mondale and ted 
kennedy belongs to gene taylor my party is the party of president 
george bush 
anderson who was ambassador to barbados from 1984 to 1986 also 
vowed to do everything we can to make drugs eradicated from this 
country 
bush said that as ambassador anderson was a pointman in the 
drug interdiction effort and he knows what it takes to stop the 
drug runners from reaching our shores 
he said he also needs andersons vote in congress to enact a 
crime package and on the environment and to push more 
accountability in education 
bush said anderson wont be your average freshman in congress 
because hes already ahead of his class 
bushs campaign appearances followed criticism from some fellow 
republicans for failing to campaign personally for republican bob 
lanier who narrowly lost a bid for the fort worth texas seat of 
former house speaker jim wright last month 
bush also saluted sheila smith widow of the freshman 
congressman killed in an august plane crash who was also at the

the widow of the officer who led the failed coup 
against panamas gen manuel antonio noriega said thursday that 
us officials were notified of the attempt and agreed to help 
then caused a fatal delay 
adela bonilla de giroldi 36 took refuge at a us base during 
the coup and later fled the country after her husband maj moises 
giroldi was executed by noriega loyalists 
on oct 1 two days before the coup mrs giroldi had a friend 
arrange a meeting with a us army colonel at the friends house to 
inform them and ask for help in isolating noriegas downtown 
headquarters 
what my husband wanted was for them to overfly panamanian 
air force bases so that no one could leave she said and 
also to close off the roads around the headquarters 
the colonel made arrangements with two civilianclad us 
officials who then met privately with her husband she said after 
the meeting without revealing details her husband said everything 
had been agreed and that the coup would be oct 3 according to 
mrs giroldi who did not attend the meeting 
my husband told me they made an agreement she said he 
told me there were no problems we were going ahead and that 
everything would turn out well 
the us officials gave him a number she said telling him to 
call them any time during the coup to request help 
but during the coup when the rebels seized temporary control of 
the headquarters and imprisoned noriega her husbands ally capt 
javier licona had little success when he picked up the phone 
when the call was made to tell them that capt licona wanted 
to talk to them to report they didnt believe the call she 
said he had to go to fort clayton to assure them he was himself 
a lot of time was lost 
by the time licona reached the us base and convinced them of 
his identity he could no longer reach giroldi noriega 
sympathizers apparently had retaken control of the headquarters 
because of the confusion licona survived the highestranking 
officer to do so and is now in hiding in the united states 
mrs giroldi however did not place all the blame on the united 
states the worst betrayal came from other panamanian officers 
especially maj federico oleochoa head of battalion 2000 she said 
she said he intially cooperated with the coup letting licona go 
to fort clayton then switched sides 
mrs giroldi strongly disputed statements made by noriega in 
interviews published thursday saying that the plotters had received 
large sums from the united states 
if they had paid the sum of 1 million where is it she 
said she denied that any of the officers involved in the coup had 
been promised money by her husband or the united states

you cant always get what you want when you 
ask the government 
cleveland ohio wanted 69 million to help build a rock n 
roll hall of fame but the department of housing and urban 
development said the museum will have to rock without the federal 
bankroll and hud secretary jack kemp said thursday theres no way 
hell change his mind 
my children love rock n roll i love rock n roll but i 
have no discretion kemp told the associated press 
the rock n roll museum is a worthwhile project for cleveland 
and rock n roll but it couldnt meet the criteria for a udag 
grant kemp said there is no possibility of a udag grant for 
the rock n roll museum 
hud two weeks ago rejected the request for an urban development 
action grant to build an 18story glass pyramid to display rock n 
roll memorabilia 
rep mary rose oakar a democrat whose district includes part of 
cleveland had hoped to persuade kemp the project was worthy of 
discretionary funds 
she was visibly annoyed thursday when kemp brought up the 
request during a house banking committee discussion of unrelated 
hud grant programs 
later in the day kemp called oakar to clear the air he 
apologised for misunderstanding what i was getting at oakar said 
kemp confirmed that he apologised to oakar he said he expressed 
his friendship and desire to work with cleveland on housing 
programs but kemp stressed that he made no promises and held out 
no hope for the music museum 
i have no discretionary money kemp said i dont want 
people to be calling me for discretionary political decisions 
there is nothing that i can do about the rock n roll museum 
aside from urging the private sector and the rock n roll 
musicians and the music industry to put up some more money he 
said 
oakar sees the 48 million project as the citys best hope for 
putting 600 people to work while turning a decaying warehouse 
district into a glistening tourist draw hall of fame officials 
have estimated that the museum will attract as many as 700000 
visitors and up to 85 million in revenue each year 
the new yorkbased rock and roll foundation has set a nov 15 
deadline for the city to raise 40 million in construction money 
huds denial cast doubt on whether the city would be able to meet 
the deadline 
cleveland is where latenight disc jockey alan freed introduced 
a generation of teenyboppers to the term rock n roll 
the city has approved the sale of 18 million of taxexempt 
bonds to pay for construction the state promised to kick in about 
44 million cuyahoga county committed 5 million and corporations 
and other donors pledged 74 million

a iowa farmer received 116000 for finding a 
400pound engine disk that may hold the key to julys dc10 crash 
in sioux city while a neighbor discovered the disks missing part 
thursday officials said 
im just in shock i can manage 20000 but this janice 
sorenson said after general electric co officials sent a check to 
her twostory farmhouse about 10 miles north of alta she said 
company officials told her another check for 3225 will follow 
ge had offered a 50000 reward for the titanium fan disk from 
the rear engine of united airlines flight 232 that crashed july 19 
while trying to land at sioux city killing 112 of 296 the people 
on board ge manufactured the engine and experts believe the disk 
could have caused the crash 
alta is 50 miles northeast of sioux city 
the amount given to mrs sorenson is more than 50000 because 
ge had said it would pay extra for the 25 fan blades and other 
parts still attached to the disk and because some other small parts 
were found nearby 
mrs sorenson discovered about twothirds of the fan disk 
assembly while harvesting corn on her farm tuesday on thursday 
afternoon harold halverson who farms about a half mile north of 
the sorensons found the missing third while driving a tractor in 
his corn field 
i wasnt looking for it at all i just happened to hit the 
disk with it halverson said it wasnt buried deep cause the 
disk tipped it right up 
halverson said he contacted ge officials who carted the part 
away the part weighed about 100 pounds and had 10 fan blades or 
parts of blades attached to it 
they said it would fit right into what is missing he said 
steve gadd an iowa lawyer hired by ge to assist in the search 
confirmed that halverson had found the missing portion of the fan 
disk he said the company was deciding whether to call off the 
search effort 
i know there are a number of small pieces still missing he 
said the reward system will continue in effect theres no 
question about that but its whether or not ge will continue a 
concerted search that decision is being made right now and will be 
made quite promptly 
ge established a reward fund totaling 271000 to pay for 
airplane parts recovered from the crash but had paid only about 
6000 before mrs sorensons discovery said company spokesman 
david lane 
mrs sorenson said she had no plans on how she would spend the 
money and halverson said he does not know yet how much he has 
coming 
the main part of the disk which looks like a windmill was 
flown wednesday to a ge plant near cincinnati for analysis 
investigators suspect the fan disk came apart in midair causing 
the engine to disintegrate and spew shrapnel that severed the jets 
hydraulic system and made the plane virtually impossible to 
control the crippled airliner made it to the nearby sioux city 
airport where it crashed during an emergency landing

more than 100000 people jammed the 
countrys largest soccer stadium thursday in a raucous show of 
support for progovernment presidential candidate hernan buchi 
earlier in the day thousands of supporters of opposition 
candidate patricio aylwin filled a downtown street in a rally 
organized by the countrys most powerful labor federation 
both demonstrations were largely peaceful and no injuries or 
arrests were reported as the end of the opposition rally ended 
some small groups clashed with police but were quickly dispersed 
with water cannon 
the young crowd in the national stadium cheered chanted and

opinion polls an independent buchi is backed by the conservative 
political groups

by a coalition of 17 centrist and leftist parties is allied with 
violent marxist groups and hinted that a labor activist killed in a 
hitandrun accident in southern chile this week was run down 
because he backed buchis campaign aylwin denies soliciting 
marxist support police say they have no evidence of a political 
motive in the accident 
the street rally for aylwin about 15 blocks from the citys 
center also drew a youthful crowd over loudspeakers an organizer 
read a statement from manuel bustos leader of the workers united 
central in which he declared that the organization would 
faithfully back aylwin 
bustos and his vice president arturo martinez were unable to 
attend because they are serving 541 days in internal exile in small 
towns they were convicted of violating national security laws by 
calling a violencemarred general strike against the rightwing 
military government in 1987 
lech walesa leader of the solidarity free trade movement in

members of congress barred at least one covert 
operation in panama proposed by the administration intelligence 
sources said thursday 
one member of the house intelligence committee alluded to the 
congressional restrictions during debate on the appropriations bill 
for intelligence agencies saying president bushs cautious 
response to the coup was justified in part by interference from the 
democratic congress 
who could expect this administration or any administration or 
any intelligence agencies to make gutsy decisions when we have 
lashed them put them under the whip tethered them told them they 
better not do anything said rep bud shuster rpa 
in an apparent allusion to remarks made earlier this week by 
senate intelligence committee chairman david boren dokla 
shuster noted that some on capitol hill have claimed bush has 
received everything he wanted with regard to panama 
and yet we know there are those who have gone to the white 
house and threatened them with exposure of classified 
information and said you dare not engage in covert 
operations shuster said 
other knowledgeable congressional sources said members of the 
house intelligence committee had specifically barred the 
administration from exercising unspecified options that could have 
yielded better inside knowledge of the panamanian defense forces 
the administration had notified congress of the options in an 
intelligence finding a document required to be given to 
congress before undertaking covert actions the sources said 
shuster mentioned no lawmakers by name but house minority 
leader robert michel rill later called shusters remarks 
significant 
referring to lawmakers critical of bushs inaction a group 
that includes boren michel said there is plenty in the 
classified record to know that some of these people are going 
far beyond what theyve got the right to say about the 
administrations requests in the past what was granted and what 
was denied 
in another development the bush administration denied noriegas 
allegations the united states paid 1 million to rebel officers to 
launch last weeks failed coup 
thats nonsense said pentagon spokesman pete williams 
absurd said state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
the state department says its absurd the national security 
council says theres nothing to it and i say we dont believe 
anything noriega says white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
said in gulfport miss 
noriega told reporters for the los angeles times and the boston 
globe in an interview wednesday night that panamanian investigators 
discovered a bank account in the name of capt erick a murillo 
one of the alleged coup leaders with more than 1 million 
there was a lot of money there for a normal panamanian 
noriega was quoted as saying six zeroes it was a million dollar 
account 
noriega said the united states was involved before during 
and after the coup they had to make the contacts woo them 
convince them its a lot of work before youve hooked the fish 
but they were the hook and the useful fools were the fish 
he also said nicaraguan contras delivered money and relayed 
messages between us officials and coup plotters 
the bush administration has said previously that us officials 
were notified in advance by panamanians involved in the coup but 
did not play a part in planning it 
according to a remarks thursday at wichita state university in 
kansas by robert blackwill a national security council staff 
member and 1962 graduate of the university the coup plotters said 
they didnt want us help 
indeed they said they didnt wish for their effort to be 
tainted by american intervention blackwill said in answering 
questions after a speech 
he said the noreiga troops that crushed the coup arrived through 
the honeycomb of streets in the densely populated center of old 
panama city us intervention would have been difficult he said 
this is not putting a log over a tow path he said this 
would have been the deployment of american forces in the center of 
a foreign country perhaps igniting a fight in which many civilians 
would have been killed 
the united states has admitted blocking two other routes to the 
coup site 
as for the accusation that the united states used the contras as 
gobetweens ms tutwiler said thats the first ive ever heard 
of something like that

the labor government introduced 
legislation thursday that would phase out the use of most 
ozonedepleting chemicals within six years 
prime minister geoffrey palmer said the legislation would make 
new zealand a world leader in environmental protection 
it is essential to act quickly but not to panic said 
palmer who also has the environment portfolio we do not want to 
cause unnecessary disruption to industry but we must protect our 
environment 
the ozone layer protection bill would ban 95 percent of harmful 
chemicals by 1995 and that they would be phased out depending on 
the availability of alternatives available to industry 
palmer said all but a few essential uses of such chemicals would 
be banned by the year 2000 he did not elaborate 
the chemicals chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs and halons are 
damaging the ozone layer above earth 
scientists say a thinner ozone shield allows more ultravioletb 
radiation to reach the earths surface and poses a global 
environmental threat through skin cancer and changes to the marine 
life ecosystem 
palmer said the legislation anticipated tougher international 
protocols that he expected by next year 
with these measures in place new zealand will be leading the 
way in action he said 
but opposition national party conservation spokesman denis 
marshall accused palmer of grandstanding and said the legislation 
was wimpish 
in spite of claims by the minister for the environment that we 
are leading the world in saving the ozone layer by banning cfcs 
from spray cans cfcs were banned from spray cans in the usa 
canada sweden and finland 10 years ago he said

guerrillas on thursday claimed to have 
killed 190 moroccan soldiers and wounded 150 during its attack near 
a desert outpost in the disputed western sahara 
the moroccan high command claimed 101 polisario front fighters 
died in the suicide attack wednesday on the defense line at 
hauza 30 miles south of the moroccan border and that 11 
moroccans including an officer were killed 
moroccan officials said the guerrillas casualty claims were 
propaganda 
this is their habitual tactic said one moroccan army 
officer they claim an impossible number of moroccan casualties 
to conceal their own serious losses 
a statement issued in algeria by the polisario front said among 
those killed in wednesdays predawn battle was lt ahmed 
charboudi while 36 moroccans including capt abdel hadroui were 
taken prisoner polisario said nothing about its own casualties 
wednesdays raid followed a bloody tank battle saturday in which 
morocco said a colonel and 13 other soldiers were killed at guelta 
zenmour a town central western sahara near the mauritanian border 
the new polisario offensive coincides with a pending vote in the 
united nations general assembly on whether to hold a referendum 
among the 80000 inhabitants registered as living in the western 
sahara before spain pulled out in 1975 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar has been seeking 
a solution to the 14yearold struggle between morocco and the 
polisario for control of the vast mineralrich territory 
the polisario had observed a selfimposed ceasefire since 
february which was intended to allow peace talks with moroccos 
king hassan ii a chance to succeed hassan later broke off the 
talks calling them pointless 
a polisario official in algiers said the kings decision forced 
the guerrillas to reluctantly take up arms again 
but the official moroccan news agency said the king had canceled 
a new round of talks to have been held in morocco because of the 
latest polisario attacks 
moroccan officials in rabat said the polisario no longer enjoys 
the strong algerian backing it once had and as a result has been 
forced to move its main military supply base from the algerian 
oasis of tindouf near the moroccan border to the mauritanian 
outpost of bir moghrein 
bir moghrein lies south of hauza and east of guelta zemour 
moroccan military officials believe attacks on both points were 
launched from bir moghrein an area of northern mauritania with 
virtually no government troops 
moroccan press reports earlier in the week warned that hassans 
troops might exercise hot pursuit into mauritania unless the 
neighboring nation takes action against the polisario forces 
most of the 10000strong mauritanian army is deployed in the 
south facing senegal 
most of polisarios military supplies from various leftist third 
world sources presently arrive at the mauritanian port of 
nouadhibou where they are unloaded there by polisario 
sympathizers diplomatic sources said

the republican candidate for governor is 
airing advertisements on issues of interest to women including a 
commercial portraying his democratic opponent as insensitive to 
rape victims 
former state attorney general j marshall colemans ad first 
aired wednesday says lt gov l douglas wilder introduced a bill 
in 1972 that would have allowed defense lawyers to interrogate rape 
victims ages 13 and under about their sex lives 
wilders campaign calls the commercial colemans most vicious 
and untruthful to date 
the 30second commercial produced by nationally prominent 
republican advertising consultant i robert goodman shows a court 
scene in which a supposed rape victim is questioned by a defense 
attorney 
the female announcer says remembering after the rape the 
ordeal of questioning by the rapists lawyer it was doug wilder 
who introduced a bill to force rape victims age 13 and under to be 
interrogated about their private lives by lawyers for accused 
rapists so next time mr wilder talks about the rights of women 
ask him about the law he tried to pass 
coleman also released an ad emphasizing his commitment to tax 
credits for child care and expanded day care for working parents in 
state government 
coleman accused wilder during a televised debate monday night of 
being insensitive to women by trying to spread fear that the 
republican would seek to restrict abortions if he wins the nov 7 
election 
published polls show the majority of voters share wilders view 
that the states abortion laws should be left alone following a 
us supreme court decision freeing the states to enact new 
restrictions on abortion 
polls on the governors race show coleman about even with 
wilder who is trying to become the nations first black elected 
governor 
wilder press secretary laura f dillard said the bill which 
failed was intended to broaden the age category for statutory rape 
at the time wilder introduced the bill in the state senate 
virginia law said a defendant could not be convicted of the 
statutory rape of a girl between the ages of 14 and 16 if the judge 
or jury determined she had consented or was lewd or of bad moral 
repute the bill submitted by wilder extended the age category to 
include girls under age 14 
dillard said that defense attorneys in rape cases involving 
minors had already been free to question victims about their 
sexual history

radical students armed with firebombs 
and tear gas briefly occupied part of us ambassador donald 
greggs residence early friday before riot police dragged them out 
officials said 
a us state department spokesman in washington said gregg and 
his wife were not injured in the attack 
police said six male students belonging to an antius death 
squad scaled the walls of greggs residential compound and hurled 
tear gas at guards who tried to stop them from rushing the home 
the students locked themselves inside one building and held off 
riot police for about 30 minutes before troops firing tear gas 
smashed down a door and seized them police said 
drive out the yankees the students screamed as police 
hustled them away 
gregg and his wife meg said at a news conference they were in 
bed about 630 am when they heard a blast and a guard warned them 
by telephone that intruders had entered the compound which is 
about one mile from the us embassy 
the greggs said they heard the intruders on the other side of 
their locked bedroom door but were able to escape the house by 
another entrance and avoid an encounter with the students 
the students however caused extensive damage in the living room 
smashing artwork and pottery gregg said 
he said though that the incident would have no impact on 
ussouth korean relations and that the students represented a 
vocal minority 
this was the act of six people who broke into our house 
gregg said 
police said the intruders were armed with firebombs tear gas 
and steel bars yonhap the south korean news agency said the 
protesters also carried paint thinner and what it described as a 
crude homemade explosive 
police said the intruders did not use any weapons except for one 
tear gas grenade they detonated when forcing their way into the 
compound in central seoul damage from the tear gas grenade which 
were apparently captured police equipment was described as minor 
the students who came from three colleges in the seoul area 
demanded a meeting with gregg to press for an end to us trade 
pressure on south korea police said 
they shouted punish gregg and we oppose us trade 
pressure at least one student was draped in a south korean 
national flag 
the students also demanded south korean president roh taewoo 
call off his proposed trip sunday to washington for talks with 
president bush and other us leaders 
radical students have opposed seouls close ties with the united 
states demanding washington stop pressuring korea to accept more 
us products the united states has been seeking greater access to 
south korean markets to help correct its huge trade imbalance with 
seoul 
the radicals opposed greggs appointment as ambassador because 
he was a former cia station chief in seoul in the 1970s they claim 
gregg who arrived in seoul last month was sent to help bolster 
the conservative south korean government 
the attack on his home came two days after us trade 
representative carla hills left seoul after talks with south korean 
officials hills and other us officials have demanded south korea 
drop its import barriers 
radical students have attacked us diplomatic facilities in the 
past but most of the incidents have been minor and no americans 
have been seriously hurt 
the radicals are demanding the withdrawal of the 43000 us 
troops based in south korea but they have little public support 
because of their extreme political views their support has 
declined further in recent months because of their sympathy for 
rival communist north korea 
gregg served as bushs national security adviser when bush was 
vice president 
he was one of bushs first ambassadorial nominations but met 
significant opposition in the senate because of disputes over his 
role if any in the irancontra affair he was not confirmed until 
september nine months after the nomination and the vote was only 
6633 in his favor

artur yusupov scored a 37move victory over fellow 
soviet anatoly karpov in the fifth round of the world chess 
championship candidates semifinal thursday to even the match at 
25 points apiece 
in a frantic time scramble yusupov playing white unleashed a 
dramatic bishop sacrifice that tied blacks pieces in knots and 
helped win karpovs queen seven moves later 
when karpov resigned the audience in the sadlers wells ballet 
theater rose for a standing ovation punctuated with cheers and 
cries of bravo 
it was a truly godlike performance really courageous said 
international master jonathan tisdall 
ive never been so excited watching the end of a game 
exclaimed british grandmaster nigel short fantastic what a 
glorious move 
karpov 38 held the world championship crown for 10 years until 
1985 and it was widely predicted he would crush his 29yearold 
opponent in the eightgame contest 
the winner of the candidates cycle will challenge world champion 
garri kasparov for his title in a 24game match starting october 
1990 the winning semifinalists will face off in the candidates 
final next march 
a win scores 1 point and a draw onehalf 
in the other semifinal jon speelman of england took a timeout 
thursday postponing his seventh game against dutch grandmaster jan 
timman until saturday with two games remaining timman leads 
3525 
karpovs problems began early in the opening when a faulty 
fourth move let yusupov gain an enduring positional edge 
several commentators said karpov had suffered a lapse of memory 
karpov has a memory like a sieve thats all said gennady 
sosonko a dutch grandmaster who emigrated from the soviet union in 
1971 and is on good terms with the former world champion 
yusupov entrenched a knight on a fine outpost in the center of 
the board which he later replaced with a bishop 
but karpov gradually battled his way out of difficulties and by 
the 22nd move experts were predicting the game would end in a draw 
but at move 30 with only eight minutes thinking time left to 
play 10 moves yusupov flashed out his brilliant sacrifice 
karpov tried desperately to unravel his pieces but after a weak 
34th move playing with less than a minute left to make seven 
moves he was unable to prevent a decisive penetration by yusupovs 
queen and a rook 
with friday a free day the sixth game will be played saturday 
with karpov scheduled to play with the advantage of the white 
pieces 
if either contest ends in a 44 tie two more games will be 
played followed if necessary by sudden death tiebreakers at 
increasingly high speeds

federal safety investigators said thursday 
they had found a preflight crack in the dc10 engine disk 
recovered from an iowa corn field nearly three months after the 
crash of united flight 232 
james kolstad acting chairman of the national transportation 
safety board said the precise size nature and reason for the 
crack were not yet determined 
but he said investigators are hopeful further examination of the 
engine part will lead to a cause of the july 19 crash that killed 
112 of 296 people aboard as the plane was landing at the sioux 
city iowa airport 
there has been no determination on whether this crack was 
detectable before the accident nor has there been a determination 
whether this crack is the point of origin of engine failure said 
board spokesman ted lopatkiewicz 
however he and kolstad said preliminary evidence indicates the 
crack existed prior to the flight he did not say what led 
investigators to that conclusion 
investigators believe the middle engine in the dc10 
disintegrated in flight severing hydraulic lines and making the 
plane almost impossible to steer the craft cartwheeled out of 
control as the pilots were trying to make an emergency landing 
the farmer who found the engine part janice sorenson thursday 
received a reward check for 116000 from engine builder general 
electric co and was told to expect another 3225 
ms sorenson found the piece about a third of it broken off 
while harvesting corn tuesday with a combine near alta iowa ge 
had offered a 50000 reward for the titanium fan disk from the 
rear engine of the united airlines jetliner and several thousand 
dollars more for other parts attached to the disk including fan 
blades which were included in her discovery 
after nearly three months of intensive searching we are 
hopeful this engine part will lead us to the cause of the failure 
so that we can ensure that an accident such as this never happens 
again kolstad said in a telephone interview 
he said the first examination of the engine part indicated a 
crack on the surface that emanates both axially fore and aft 
and radially toward the rim of the disk this means it appears 
along the interior surface of the doughnutlike disk running from 
the front to the back of the engine and penetrates into the rim 
itself 
the portion of the disk that has been recovered includes 
twothirds of the fan disk itself along with 25 of the 38 fan 
blade roots in the engine 
a pieshaped third of the 864inch diameter disk and fan blades 
is still missing kolstad said 
the partial disk assembly was examined wednesday and thursday at 
the evendale ohio ge jet engine plant 
kolstad said a team including two safety board metallurgists and 
other government and industry investigators on the crash 
investigations power plant team were examining the disk 
investigators have said explosive failure of the aircrafts 
tailmounted no 2 engine severed or damaged all three hydraulic 
control systems which control flight pilots managed to maneuver 
the plane down into the sioux city airport by using thrust from the 
two remaining engines 
the crashlanding killed 111 people at the scene and one 
passenger died a month later from injuries

voters turned out by the thousands on thursday to 
elect new high school councils taking the first step in an 
ambitious experiment in grassroots control of the citys ailing 
school system officials said 
board of education officials said they were pleased with the 
twoday turnout to elect members to 71 city high school and 469 
elementary school councils 
an early tally of ballots show that 104000 people voted 
thursday to elect members to the 71 high school councils said 
school board spokesman bob saigh 
there are some close races but there are no major disputes 
saigh said late thursday its been a terrific success in that 
its been so trouble free 
turnout for the elementary vote was below projections made by 
some activists and officials said less than 5 percent of the 
eligible parents had voted in the high school elections 
school board officials estimate about 300000 people voted in 
both high school and elementary school elections twice the vote 
turnout in new york citys most recent election 
we have nothing to compare it with said maxey bacchus an 
election organizer at the board of education offices you know at 
one time we thought there wouldnt be contested elections every 
school had contested elections 
that was the first benchmark and we are absolutely pleased 
that people signed up in the numbers they did to vote and the 
numbers they did to run as candidates he said 
the elections were part of a reform package passed last year by 
the illinois general assembly that also called for cutting 
administrative jobs and shifting money in the 226 billion school 
budget to target lowincome students 
the 17256 candidates in the twoday election sought 5400 
unpaid positions on the 540 councils each of which will include 
six parents two teachers and two community residents without 
schoolchildren school staffs will elect the teacher members the 
11th member of each council will be the principal of the school or 
schools the council oversees 
the councils scheduled to begin their monthly meetings within 
in a week of the elections will have authority to hire and fire 
principals develop schoolimprovement plans and spend money 
enrique munoz who was elected as a community representative to 
an elementary school said one of the first steps of his council 
would be to build a relationship with the principal and the

thursday for a federal ban on flag burning just four months after 
a supreme court decision allowing destruction of an american flag 
as political protest 
this is the least we can do to protect the sanctity of the 
flag rep butler derrick dsc said before the house voted 
37143 to approve the bill 
however president bush and many republicans say congress must 
do more than pass a mere statute and they have been pressing for a 
constitutional amendment to outlaw flag destruction or desecration 
the senate will take up that issue next week 
still 154 republicans joined 217 democrats in supporting the 
statutory ban on thursday while only 18 republicans and 25 
democrats opposed it the bill passed the senate 919

the us roman catholic church should drop its 
qualified support for teaching about condoms in public schools as a 
way of preventing aids and should urge that youngsters be taught 
chastity instead a committee of bishops said thursday 
there is no such thing as safe or safer sex thats an 
illusion said archbishop roger mahony of los angeles chairman 
of the ad hoc committee on the hiv statement hiv is the virus that 
causes aids 
the committees draft statement revises an earlier document 
released by the churchs 50member administrative board in december 
1987 which said the church could tolerate public schools 
providing information about condoms as long as sexual abstinence 
outside of marriage was presented as the only morally correct and 
medically sure way to prevent aids 
the boards document was criticized by some conservative us 
bishops who said it would be misinterpreted as condoning sex 
outside marriage and artificial birth control cardinal joseph 
ratzinger head of the vatican congregation for the doctrine of the 
faith also chastised the administrative board for not consulting 
with the vatican

physicists trying to mimic the birth of the 
universe inside an atom smasher said thursday they found strong 
evidence that the building blocks of matter belong to only three 
families a discovery that puts a lid on the complexity of 
nature 
this brings us closer to really understanding the physical 
universe and how its put together said burton richter a 1976 
nobel laureate in physics and director of the stanford linear 
accelerator center 30 miles southeast of san francisco 
experiments on the 3milelong 125 million stanford linear 
collider showed the odds are 25to1 that there are only three 
families or generations of fundamental particles that make up 
matter physicist michael riordan said by telephone from stanford 
it means that somehow the universe is comprehensible that 
its not a total mystery that it can be grasped by the human 
mind riordan said it puts a lid on the complexity of nature 
at its most fundamental level

robert leonard sees the impact of the 
states faltering economy each day at his union market station 
restaurant he sees it in the empty seats and in the regulars who 
still show up 
i have clients come in every day and talk about layoffs 
said leonard whose 180seat eatery offers burgers salads and 
sandwiches for lunch 
leonards restaurant built around an old railroad car is a 
short ride from route 128 where the hightech industry that fueled 
a boom economy of the 1980s is running out of steam 
i can tell you business is lousy said leonard who can also 
see it in his family his 24yearold daughter who studied to be a 
teacher cant find a job and is living at her parents home in 
arlington 
she hasnt got an inkling of a job anywhere leonard said 
thats not surprising since school systems in massachusetts may 
lay off as many as 5000 teachers due to budget cuts 
layoffs cutbacks and the politics of pennypinching were once 
alien concepts here but this is the new massachusetts not the 
miracle state gov michael s dukakis ballyhooed during his 
presidential campaign its the state where some towns are turning 
off street lights to save money and others are asking kids to pay 
to play high school sports 
this is the massachusetts where just two years ago the economy 
was so strong that leonard and other merchants had to practically 
drag people off the street to work for them now leonard fields 
two to three applications a day 
state officials say that septembers unemployment rate of 44 
percent was higher than before but still was third lowest among the 
11 largest industrial states and 1988 per capita income was the 
third highest in the nation 
however the slowdown in the hightech industry the result of 
more companies in the field and slower sales and growth prompts 
regular reports of belttightening such as wang laboratories 
recent layoff of 2200 people 
and the real estate market once one of the hottest in the 
country has gone mushy said james howell a bank of boston 
economist i would look at this as a flattening out 
in the cycle under way people are spending less and the state 
is reaping less from sales taxes budget cuts are hurting 
especially the poor and sick 
there is a mean spirit out there about the poor said michal 
regunberg spokeswoman for the state department of public welfare 
when times get tough the poor become the easiest target we are 
seeing that all over the state 
karen rock who lives in pelham in the western part of the 
state said she already has trouble feeding two children on a 
welfare check of 178 every two weeks i dont have enough as it 
is the last week of every month is a real struggle for me she 
said rock has epilepsy and her doctor has advised her not to 
drive her 18yearold son has bone disease 
meanwhile the legislature which agonized over budget deficits 
through most of the spring must still cut or raise 500 million in 
a 123 billion budget this year because revenues are falling 
short again 
taxes have haunted dukakis since his presidential campaign he 
originally supported taxes to save state programs but a wave of 
antitax sentiment left him nothing but budgetcutting and hes 
pledged to eliminate 2300 jobs 
dukakis did manage to get through an 18month income tax 
increase that would shave about 85 off a 20000 income this year 
and 170 next year but an antitax group has started a petition 
drive to halt that measure 
the antitax sentiment is so widespread that dukakis is 
considering endorsing a more palatable revenueraising measure a 
bill to allow betting on professional football normally he 
wouldnt touch this with a 10foot pole 
but cuts in the past year especially in aid to cities and 
towns have been severe there is little left 
in middlesex superior court officials have asked for volunteers 
to help with mounting paperwork we need clerk typists and 
stenographers and filing clerks said edward j sullivan the 
clerk magistrate there are four junior clerk vacancies at the 
countys superior courthouses in cambridge and lowell 
we cant fill these positions theyre frozen sullivan 
said this place is going to fall apart if we dont get some 
funds 
essex a town of 3000 north of boston has turned off street 
lights to make ends meet the town had already stopped garbage 
collection and its turnofthecentury town hall may have to close 
because repairs are impossible as long as residents refuse to 
override a statewide 2 percent property tax limit the town hall 
bell no longer is rung for fear it may fall through the steeple 
samuel hoar the towns chairman of selectmen describes the 
building as a dc10 with a bomb in the luggage compartment 
whats left to cut next year nothing we may find a few towns 
going bankrupt hoar said 
the states economic future is a mixed bag said anthony 
ferrara commissioner for the us bureau of labor statistics in 
boston he pointed out that the state is still in better shape than 
many others ironically he said anger and fear about the states 
economic future may continue to cause damage as people refrain from 
spending that could keep the economy moving 
there seems to be a lot of negative psychology out there 
ferrara said 
while the states economic future is in doubt theres no 
question that a political change is coming soon dukakis wont be 
running for reelection in 1990 and candidates from both parties 
are lining up in the starting box 
in the last gubernatorial election republican candidates won 
more jokes than votes now economic trouble has pumped new blood 
into a lifeless gop 
leonard a lifelong democrat sees a political conversion in his 
future i favor the democratic party but i wouldnt vote for a 
democrat right now if it was my brother he said

in joseph girzones epilogue to the new 
testament christ peddles his 2000yearold carpentry skills for 
chicken recipes buses tables to pay his way to the vatican and 
quips that he hasnt had kosher in ages 
and like the christ who tipped over the tables of the 
moneychangers in jerusalem girzones latterday jesus has radical 
ideas to change humanitys relationship with god 
a retired roman catholic priest girzone has just published 
joshua and the children his second bestselling parablenovel 
about christs second comings and goings in todays world 
macmillan publishing co published both books 
this is my attempt to present the clear and simple message of 
jesus thats been lost over the centuries girzone said in an 
interview at a catholic retreat in schroon a town in the 
adirondack mountains 
the chief persecutors of that simple message have been churches 
themselves more intent on preserving their authority than 
spreading truth girzone said 
i see the terrible terrible hurt the anguish people 
suffer girzone said people are desperately trying to find an 
answer to find a god that makes sense i want to present them with 
a god that finally makes sense 
religions his own included have failed their followers 
constructing artificial barriers and rituals christ wouldnt have 
respected girzone said 
christians fighting each other in the name of christ its so 
hypocritical he said my remedy is to plop jesus plop joshua 
right in the middle of it 
in the first book jesus returns to earth takes the name joshua 
and sets up shop as a carpenter and woodcarver he lives simply 
earning just enough to get by and captivates people of all faiths 
with talk of a god who forgives peoples weaknesses who did not 
intend to make humans little gods 
to be perfectly human as god made us should be our goal 
joshua says if we appear to be religious or pious weve missed 
the point and our piety becomes a caricature and unauthentic 
joshua clashes with the establishment he advises a troubled 
priest to fight the celibacy requirement for priests offends 
religious leaders by attending services at church and synagogue 
alike and faces a hostile panel of vatican inquisitors 
joshua tells vatican leaders that churches are ruled by 
unfeeling and arrogant shepherds who hurt the flock and do 
irreparable damage to gods people with complete immunity to 
threaten gods displeasure when people do not follow your rules is 
being a moral bully and does no service to god 
girzone 58 retired from the priesthood for health reasons in 
1981 after 26 years at schools and parishes in the new york city 
borough of the bronx pennsylvania and the albany diocese too 
young to receive a church pension girzone turned to writing and 
lecturing 
joshua which sold 60000 copies under his own companys 
imprint richelieu court publications made the waldenbooks 
bestseller list in 1986 a rare achievement for a selfpublished 
book the sequel whose first printing totaled 175000 copies has 
broken in to the top 10 of the new york times bestseller list 
collier books a division of macmillan has sold nearly 400000 
copies of joshua since issuing a paperback edition in 1987 and 
sales are greater today that two years ago said barry lippman 
president of macmillans adult trade division 
its not some slick fad thats caught on lippman said 
within two or three pages theres something about the book that 
really clicks with people it shows you can have faith without 
thinking of yourself as part of a church 
much of girzones vision replays christs story in modern terms 
instead of raising lazarus from a tomb joshua restores a rabbis 
son to life after he has broken his neck in a fall instead of 
making five loaves and two fish feed a crowd after a sermon joshua 
stretches two sandwiches to feed 25 children on a picnic instead 
of a last supper with his disciples joshua is the guest at a 
surprise party before leaving for rome 
between healing the sick and restoring sight to the blind 
joshua preaches against drugs and ocean pollution uses tv 
evangelism to spread his message and buys gallon jugs of table wine 
from liquor stores 
there are even ascension and resurrection scenes in the first 
book joshua escapes a vatican boarding house where hes been 
locked away after telling the pope what hes doing wrong in the 
second book joshua vanishes from his coffin after being gunned 
down by religious fanatics in northern ireland 
unlike joshua girzone has drawn few harsh words for his ideas 
most religious leaders say they see the truth in what he preaches 
the joshua stories are told simply in simple prose 
reminiscent of christs new testament parables before joshua 
writing had been an agony for him girzone said but the words for 
the parable came effortlessly as if a voice whispered the words in 
his ear he said 
i cant help but feel god wanted something done and is using 
the book to accomplish it he said

members of the nations major religious 
denominations do not believe aids is gods judgment on people 
leading immoral lives said an author who recently completed a 
yearlong study of religious attitudes toward the disease 
this was a startling discovery given the almost universal 
denouncement of homosexuality both as a sexual preference and a 
behavior pattern by american churches said j gordon melton 
author of the churches speak on aids 
melton director of the institute for the study of american 
religion in santa barbara said most religious groups have decided 
that acquired immune deficiency syndrome should be separated from 
the issue of homosexuality that efforts should be made to serve 
aids victims and their families and that the civil rights of 
people suffering with the disease should be protected 
but he also said the churches have done little to fund research 
expand hospital facilities or develop new treatment programs

parents should decide one faith in which to 
raise children of christianjewish marriages according to the 
director of an outreach program for intermarried couples of the 
reform jewish movement 
the tendency among parents in interfaith marriages is to 
choose everything for their children except their religion lydia 
kukoff of los angeles said at a recent panel discussion sponsored 
by the american psychological association 
the reluctance of mixed couples to decide on one faith for 
their child or their announcement that they will expose the child 
to both faiths and let the child decide masks a dangerous 
ambivalence said ms kukoff director of the joint commission on 
outreach of the union of american hebrew congregations and the 
central conference of american rabbis 
and it places the child in the extremely difficult position of 
choosing one parent over the other something to be avoided 
wherever possible

fred davis was particularly disappointed 
when the general assembly adjourned without dealing with youth 
suicide 
the few programs that exist in north carolina are in mental 
health departments but most young people who kill themselves 
arent ill and those who contemplate suicide are reluctant to call 
because of the stigma davis said 
the state highway patrol trooper has reason to research the 
problem and to know the pain from a young persons suicide his 
daughter lee ann used his 357magnum service revolver to kill 
herself in march 1986 she was 15 
on going through our own grief and searching for a way to cope 
with our grief i discovered there was very little for suicide 
survivors it was such a dark subject theres a taboo and stigma 
attached to suicide people feel shameful guilty and cant talk 
about it 
yet the problem of youth suicide is on the rise as the national 
rate of youth suicide increased slowly from 1960 to 1980 in north 
carolina the rate from 52 per million people to 123 per million 
davis a state trooper for 23 years decided to do something 
about it 
at his house clyde in the north carolina mountains he had an 
extra telephone line installed and started parents against teen 
suicide a nonprofit support group that has 450 paying members and 
is 2 years old this month 
davis spends most of his offduty hours working for pats gets 
up to 40 calls a day from troubled youths and parents and travels 
hundreds of miles to speak at churches and schools about youth 
suicide 
this thing has grown so rapidly my wife had to quit her job 
to become a fulltime secretary for pats he said 
last year we were involved with 16 people that had the gun to 
their head or the knife in their hands and we were able to 
intervene and stop it twelve of those were youths 
a 13yearold girl with a learning disability wrote that 
classmates were making fun of her the girls mother found her on 
the bathroom floor after an overdose of a painkiller and davis 
visited the girl the next day and has provided her with counseling 
in another case a deputy sheriff called one night about a young 
man who held a bayonet to his own throat the deputy wanted to know 
what to do after the incident ended davis arranged for counseling 
for the young man 
davis helped develop a suicide intervention class that is being 
used mainly in western north carolina high schools he has 
presented a grant proposal to the state department of human 
resources for a suicide crisis center and hotline for western north 
carolina and hopes the idea will spread statewide 
the legislation not considered by the general assembly before it 
adjourned in august would establish a youth suicide advisory board 
to coordinate state efforts in youth suicide prevention the board 
also would help educate the public about the problem and provide 
training in the schools 
theres a need to help classroom teachers and school personnel 
to be aware of the danger signs reducing class sizes would help 
the teacher to see heres a student thats in serious trouble 
said state rep coy privette 
the measure included 10000 for pilot projects but the bill 
lost out to a push for improved pay for teachers and state 
employees if it is enacted during the session this spring the 
state will join texas california pennsylvania connecticut and 
florida in having youth suicide prevention acts 
davis said the public doesnt realize the magnitude of the 
problem 
each year between 1980 and 1987 an average of 130 youths 
between the ages of 15 and 24 committed suicide in north 
carolina nationally more than 6000 young people killed 
themselves last year one every 90 minutes 
there are warning signs but most people dont recognize them 
davis said they become hopeless helpless hapless they try 
getting involved in several things to take away their emotional 
pain when these things fail then suicide becomes a solution to 
the problem 
one of the things that young people do a lot of times is 
romanticize death but they dont realize that its final 
broken homes and relationships problems in school drugs and 
the strain of adolescence are some of the factors that lead to 
youth suicide experts say 
davis daughter tall with dark hair and blue eyes was an 
academically gifted student at tuscola senior high school in 
waynesville and was active in basketball and volleyball she was 
always smiling davis said 
she didnt have a drug problem but she had a turbulent 
relationship with her boyfriend for more than a year lee ann 
masked her suicidal feelings 
but on a sunday night in march 1986 lee ann walked into her 
parents bedroom where davis kept his revolver by the headboard of 
his bed she hid it under her blouse and as she passed her mother 
she said she was going to iron some school clothes for the next 
day lee ann stepped outside pulled out the gun put it to her 
head and pulled the trigger she died immediately 
now you can look back and see other symptoms an irregular 
pattern in her eating and her sleeping davis said in her last 
few weeks she seemed to become overburdened 
victims of suicide often send out signals that are cries for 
help he said most suicidal people dont really want to die 
they are torn between life and death 
this was among several poems davis and his wife joyce found 
after their daughters death that revealed her anguish 
im an actress on the stage 
playing the role of a comedian 
laughing singing acting dumb 
now the show is over 
the room is clearing out

all right class therell be a pop quiz soon on 
tonights new nbc series which is set in washington dc you may 
be asked who says 
senator thats a smear 
mr ambassador alexandria police are reporting that the nude 
body of your secretary was found floating in your swimming pool 
care to comment on that 
i was a bachelor until i was 39 i had a lot of women a lot 
of women that was then this is now now im married 
remember chappaquiddick i want the truth not a paint job 
ive been through your file mancuso you are a dinosaur you 
are a hangover in a 10 suit 
if a key word in all this leads you to believe all this is in 
tonights premiere of mancuso fbi you need not take the test 
go read shakespeare 
the rest of you watch this show it will illustrate how even a 
fine actor named robert loggia can be sandbagged by a script that 
gives bad a bad name 
loggia plays fbi agent nick mancuso a raspyvoiced 
worldweary 30year fbi veteran he is cynical but unswervingly 
believes in the us constitution despite all the powerful 
immoral unethical scheming rotten people in washington 
particularly those who jog 
mancusologgia was wonderful last year in nbcs kinky 
sentimental and pretty good favorite son miniseries thats the 
one where the president apparently of nbc persuaded him not to 
retire but do his own series 
an unwise move if tonights show is typical written by two of 
the seriess producers ken solarz and mancuso creator and 
executive producer steve sohmer it is of value only to 
classicdialogue collectors 
told in brisk witless fashion it concerns a scandal brewing 
amid senate confirmation hearings on a nominee for secretary of 
defense the nominee stand back friends and neighbors is a 
liberal 
he also a former us ambassador to belgium a war hero and a 
heartless seducer of young women before he married at age 39 he 
claims to have given up seducing young women but there are those 
like everyone who think that were he a marine his motto would be 
semper infidelis 
as mentioned in the dialogue the deceased of tonights plot is 
one of his secretaries she lived in the guest house of the mansion 
the nominee and his wife shared she was a good secretary he 
tells mancuso 
yeah mancuso sneers what else was she good at 
why is mancuso on the case the fbi has been told to quietly 
reopen its background investigation on the nominee for secretary 
of defense 
in washington quietly means reliable sources climb to the top 
of the capitol dome and shout hey the fbi has reopened its 
background investigation into the life of the nominee for secretary 
of defense 
despite this washingtons reporters learn somethings up here 
sex murder and nationalsecuritythreat rumors blossom so do 
such dramatic old reliables as mancusos ambitious yuppie superior 
a smarmy tv anchor lady and even a shadowy figure who tries to 
drive over nick and an apparently key potential witness at night 
the plot twists and turns before going into the pentagon near 
the finale in what probably will become a weekly event mancuso 
passionately rants about his beloved us constitution and causes a 
severe attack of righteousness 
loggias acting is good likewise that of charles siebert who 
plays his best friend a forensics expert but most of the other 
players give the impression that on the whole theyd rather be in 
philadelphia you cant blame them it is difficult to be in a 
washington show that is so darn realistic that early on a key 
character up and says 
senator im going to ask you a question is it liberal to 
support selfdetermination in central america is it liberal to 
endorse sanctions against south africa civil rights tougher 
enviromental standards

prime minister felipe gonzalez the 
socialist who has eased westerns concerns about where he would lead 
spain after his unexpected landslide victory seven years ago is 
heading for what polls indicate will be an unprecedented third term 
in elections oct 29 
gonzalez a 47yearold former labor lawyer has since led the 
country into an economic boom with policies that upset some of his 
own socialists labor particularly 
he also has brought spain into the european economic community 
and reaffirmed its membership in the north atlantic treaty 
organization 
so far it has been a successful road for gonzalez who once had 
to slip into spain from france in the trunk of a car because his 
party was outlawed by the authoritarian regime of gen francisco 
franco 
according to private and government polls the socialists are 
expected to win at least 40 percent of the vote from the countrys 
295 million registered voters for their third absolute majority in 
the 350seat lower house of parliament they now hold 183 seats 
polls also indicate little on the right or left can block the 
spanish socialist workers party the official name of gonzalezs 
party 
the main opposition group the conservative popular party is in 
disarray having struggled in the past two years for coherence 
under three different leaders 
its current leader and candidate to replace gonzalez is 
36yearold jose maria aznar he took the reins of the party less 
than two months before gonzalez on aug 25 issued the call for 
this election the conservatives now hold 91 lower house seats and 
are campaigning on a platform calling for privatization of state 
industry sharp cuts in public spending and lower taxes 
former prime minister adolfo suarez of the social democratic 
center party is repeating his 1986 attempt to recapture the office 
mainly with a call for the abolition of the 12month obligatory 
military service his party now holds 28 seats in the lower house 
in 1977 two years after francos death the 58yearold suarez 
formed spains first democratically elected government in 41 years 
the socialists response to suarez on the military service issue 
is that they reduced the obligatory service time to the current 12 
from the 18 months that existed during his administration the 
socialists also ask how suarez plans to pay for an allvolunteer 
army 
the united left coalition under julio anguita the 48yearold 
communist and former mayor of cordoba is expected to gain up to 
five seats more than its current seven by picking up the votes of 
socialists disillusioned with the gonzalez government which they 
perceive as having shifted towards the centerright 
their slogan we are the alternative is aimed at members of 
the general workers union the countrys largest and historically 
socialist labor movement the union has not called on its rank and 
file to vote socialist this time claiming that the gonzalez 
government has failed to promote an equitable distribution of 
spains new wealth 
according to the organization for economic cooperation and 
development spains per capita gross domestic product rose from 
4192 in 1984 to 7449 in 1987 the year after spain joined the 
eec and confirmed its membership nato 
its annual growth rate of 5 percent is europes highest 
in the 1982 campaign when gonzalez ran in his first successful 
campaign his antinato stance and populist style made western 
leaders nervous 
in this campaign gonzalez and other socialist leaders maintain 
that opposition parties have failed to come up with serious 
platforms and alternatives 
their exaggerated negativism is a reflection of their 
frustration gonzalez has said they would be better off if 
they tried to come up with alternatives that would appeal to 
voters 
another issue that has upset the opposition is gonzalezs wife 
carmen who is running for parliament on the socialist ticket in 
cadiz 
opposition parties have compared her to eva peron who had an 
exceeding influential role in argentina as the wife of populist 
dictator juan d peron and to imelda marcos the wife of former 
president ferdinand e marcos of the philippines 
gonzalezs only response to those who make the comparisons is 
that they lack democratic sentiment

one day on the set of on golden pond jane 
fonda was standing in front of a mirror combing her hair when she 
felt costar katharine hepburn reach over and tug at her cheek 
how do you feel about this hepburn asked peering from 
behind this is your box that carries your persona what do you 
want this to be 
image is what hepburn meant what kind of a person does a face 
suggest 
fonda didnt have a ready answer even though neutrality is 
impossible for this selfstyled crusader 
at age 51 shes still in training memoirs dont interest her 
a house in montana will have to wait theres too much to do her 
outlook remains shaped by possibility and by now her public knows 
that its never too late for a new jane fonda 
it literally doesnt occur to people maybe even women more 
than men because women dont have as many options for change that 
you can become very very different and its never too late and it 
can be very profound she said in a recent interview 
you just have to stay open to life and not allow yourself to 
settle in anything can happen i feel fortunate that i have this 
characteristic of openness 
people say have you fulfilled your dreams i never had any 
dreams my projections of the future were maybe id od at 25 and 
end up lonely and selfdestructive i never had dreams i never 
expected anything so everything was a surprise to me 
relaxed jane 
she sat on a sofa at the regency hotel in jeans and blue flannel 
shirt occasionally resting her black booted feet on a coffee table 
and nibbling chocolates 
she talked about open participation and activism somethings 
wrong well lets form a committee organize protest do 
something get involved it starts with each of us we can change 
the world 
no wonder a special screening in new york of her new film old 
gringo was a benefit for the robert f kennedy memorial 
foundation fonda and costar gregory peck were there so were the 
kennedys ethel caroline john jr kathleen robert jr 
wealth glamour power and idealism fonda and the kennedys 
feasts for the tabloids 
the latest the drug bust of vanessa vadim the daughter fonda 
had with her first husband french filmmaker roger vadim the 
21yearold brown university student was arrested oct 6 with a 
friend thomas feegal outside a reputed drug den in lower 
manhattan at her arraignment she pleaded innocent to obstructing 
governmental administration loitering for the purpose of 
purchasing drugs and disorderly conduct 
patrician jane 
she was born in new york in 1937 the daughter of a highly 
respected film actor henry and his wife frances seymour brokaw 
fonda a descendant of lady jane seymour a wife of king henry 
viii she committed suicide in 1953 although her children were told 
it was a heart attack jane learned the truth a year later from a 
gossip magazine 
her brother peter also went into movies leaving a testament 
to the 1960s with the haunting easy rider 
fonda went to private schools on both coasts and wound up 
partying at vassar college unsure of a career in acting her 
confidence grew in the late 50s under the guidance of method 
acting guru lee strasberg 
thespian jane 
there was broadway and hollywood in the early 60s she had 
great reviews in bad shows but her career was going nowhere she 
escaped to france and made vadims la ronde in 1964 a 
vulgarization of the 1950 classic about love and sex starring 
simone signoret she and vadim married a year later 
sex kitten jane 
she was dubbed la bb americaine by the french press a 
reference to brigitte bardot who was once married to vadim among 
fondas roles over the next three years a woman who seduces her 
stepson la curee a business executives mistress any 
wednesday and an erotic space maiden who takes on a sex robot 
and wins barbarella 
hanoi jane 
in 1968 around the time of barbarella students in paris 
nearly toppled the government and opposition at home to the 
vietnam war overflowed at first she defended the united states 
involvement but soon changed her mind completely 
ive taken many paths ive broken all the rules fonda 
said i left hollywood and went to europe at the time when i 
shouldnt have i came back not as an actress but as an 
activist 
nearly 20 years later her celebrated visit to north vietnam 
when she appeared on radio hanoi and begged american soldiers to 
stop the bombings still isnt completely forgotten 
last year a waterbury conn vet tried to circulate bumper 
stickers that read im not fonda hanoi jane while the 
actress was there filming stanley and iris with robert de niro 
fonda apologized last year on national television to veterans 
who may have been hurt by her actions but her effort at 
reconciliation was rejected by both the american legion and the 
veterans of foreign wars 
and her name is still invoked by conservatives in political 
campaigns do you want jane fonda running this country 
im a good scapegoat she said i can be painted in to an 
image which causes a lot of hostility i may not be that person but 
thats irrelevant 
tom and jane 
she divorced vadim in 1970 and met activist tom hayden a 
founding member of the radical students for a democratic society 
she married him three years later and they had a son troy now 
16 they separated earlier this year 
dick and jane 
fun with dick and jane was a 1976 satire with george segal 
but in real life dick and jane meant president nixon and the 
enemies list a collection of actors authors and activists 
deemed subversive by the administration 
fonda was in the elite wiretapping harassment of friends a 
failed drug bust and agents reporting on vanessas kindergarten 
class 
sometimes i literally feel like somebody who walks through a 
field of gunfire and doesnt get hit fonda said i dont shy 
away from ambushes and i dont particularly have any armor i just 
go through it and the shots miss me its not like im protecting 
myself i just live my life and i dont think about it

a new version of an old grain is raising hopes 
it will prove a valuable crop in the continuing global war against 
hunger 
the crop is triticale a hybrid blend of wheat and rye although 
grown on several million acres worldwide triticale is almost 
unknown in the united states where wheat is the no 1 food grain 
the agriculture department says 
but scientists have been ironing out some of triticales genetic 
problems and usda economists james cole and stephanie mercier say 
crop yields equal or surpass wheat grown under similar 
conditions 
triticale has the potential to increase world grain production 
because it can be grown under conditions that are inadequate to 
consistently grow standard highyielding grains they said it 
is highly drought resistant and thrives in many marginally 
productive soils 
crosspollination of adjacent fields of wheat and rye have 
occurred naturally for centuries but the resulting hybrid seeds 
were small sterile and generally unsuited for use 
cole and mercier writing in the current issue of agricultural 
outlook magazine said modern studies of triticale began in 1876 
with the crosspollination of wheat and scottish rye but the 
result again produced sterile offspring seeds 
then in the 1950s canadian researchers at the university of 
manitoba became interested in triticale as part of an effort to 
combat leaf diseases that were attacking durum wheat 
ryes natural defenses against such diseases contributed to 
triticales development as a useful crop the report said 
triticales sterility problem was overcome in the 1950s and 
seeds were developed for distribution though many other 
difficulties remained 
research also progressed in europe and on a limited scale in 
the united states a major step occurred in the mid1960s when the 
university of manitoba and the international maize and wheat 
improvement center in mexico joined forces 
but it was an accident that provided the key breakthrough in 
1967 a portion of the centers test crop in mexico was 
unintentionally pollinated by dwarf bread wheats from nearby fields 
the resulting strain of triticale known as armadillo 
appeared to solve most of the crops problems at once the report 
said the new crop was high yielding shortstemmed disease 
resistant and early maturing 
today the center known as cimmyt estimates triticale is 
grown on more than 4 million acres worldwide although us output 
is only around 60000 acres of both spring and winter varieties 
more than twothirds of the acreage is planted in winter 
varieties in france the soviet union and poland 
thus most of the current triticale output is grown in developed 
countries on fairly good cropland the report said however 
agronomic studies indicate it also may outperform wheat and rye 
in marginal conditions found in some third world countries 
dependent on food aid 
under neutral or favorable conditions todays triticale is 
able to match or surpass most of wheats key vitamin mineral and 
protein levels although its quality is still inconsistent the 
report said protein levels for example can vary by as much as 
50 percent in a single year making the crop unreliable for certain 
uses 
the report added triticale however can produce a crop under 
conditions in which many wheat varieties would die 
although there are drawbacks such as low test weights when grown 
under marginal conditions research on new varieties is under way 
in mexico in hopes of producing triticale flour yields equal to 
wheat 
triticale flour has many baking uses the report said 
these include unleavened specialty breads and other baked goods 
that typically rely on softwheat flours such as pastas cakes and 
cookies triticale bread depending on the plant variety rises to 
the same level and consistency as breads made with many soft wheat 
strains 
further it said triticale has nonbaking food uses including 
breakfast cereals and is being used in some south american 
countries as a malting agent for beer 
triticale is still an unfamiliar crop in most places the 
report said further its use would require modifying farming and 
milling practices some growth nonetheless could occur soon 
cimmyt research has found triticale to be more adaptable to 
difficult conditions than wheat particularly in drylands tropical 
highlands and acid soils found in many developing countries 
harvest failures from weather and poor soils could be reduced if 
more triticale were planted the report said such failures might 
move farmers to include more triticale 
over time farmers particularly in eastern europe latin 
america and africa may well place greater emphasis on what is 
increasingly considered a reliable highyielding crop the 
report said

barbara jackle and her husband think theyre lucky they found a 
reliable woman to watch their 5yearold son for 85 a week even 
though that required getting special permission to enroll him in a 
school near the caregivers home three miles away 
and thats good for only one year said mrs jackle 37 a 
librarian who lives in upper darby pa near philadelphia were 
even contemplating moving so we could be closer to where she is 
the jackles scramble to find a trustworthy sitter for their 
5yearold is a product of the growth in twoincome families among 
the babyboom generation that in turn has created an enormous 
problem for working parents nationwide who takes care of the kids 
and how to pay them 
nowadays it seems if youre going to need care youd better 
get set up before you get pregnant said louise hurst a licensed 
daycare professional who watches the jackle boy and five other 
young children in her home 
ive gotten lots of calls said mrs hurst 43 i inform 
them im full until september 1991 so i dont even bother to take 
a waiting list 
demand for child care has grown so fast that costs have 
multiplied in some cases nearly consuming the money earned from a 
second income this has crimped budgets of millions of americans 
and created an underground cash economy of unregulated caregivers 
historically american women have been the family caregivers 
but the nations labor pool is becoming increasingly female a 
labor department study by the hudson institute an indianapolis 
research organization says women comprise almost half the work 
force compared with 381 percent in 1970 and 296 percent in 1950 
other labor department figures say 57 percent of all women with 
children under 6 work outside the home compared with 12 percent in 
1950 the childrens defense fund a washingtonbased 
childadvocacy group predicts that by 1995 twothirds of all 
preschool children will have working mothers an increase of 50 
percent in a decade 
only 7 percent of american households now fit the beaver 
cleaver familys mold of breadwinning father and athome mother 
says a policy paper by the child care action campaign a new york 
coalition that advocates a national system of care as female 
labor force participation rates continue to climb the demand for 
child care will grow too 
many companies striving to attract or retain valued employees 
offer incentives ranging from flexible work schedules to emergency 
sitters some have gone further allowing young parents to work at 
home or take years off with full benefits and job guarantees 
others are building inhouse daycare centers hiring roving 
nannies or subsidizing the cost of care with cash 
certainly its fashionable these days for corporations to get 
into this said antony ward director of child care inc a new 
york referral service many companies retain to help employees find 
sitters 
a lot of people viscerally respond to the childcare issue 
he said anyone who takes the kid to the family daycare provider 
to find a note on the door saying i have the flu knows what 
its like 
first bank system of st paul minn for example this year 
donated space in its office building for a public kindergarten that 
doubles as an afterschool daycare center with priority given to 
children of bank employees ncnb corp a fastgrowing bank in 
charlotte nc plans to offer many of its workers a childcare 
reimbursement of up to 50 percent 
pitney bowes inc a leading maker of business machines in 
stamford conn helped pioneer flexible working hours to 
accommodate working parents allowing them to arrive early some 
days leave early on others federal express corp the memphis 
tenn overnight delivery service offers working parents fourday 
weeks and 7 am to 3 pm shifts 
last month seven large new yorkbased employers hoping to cut 
absenteeism announced a pilot program to provide emergency sitters 
for workers whose usual arrangements are disrupted 
companies are finding that if theyre not family friendly 
theyre losing employees said lorraine dusky a freelance 
writer and coauthor of the best companies for women a 
guidebook to 50 american corporations companies arent doing 
this to be altruistic if companies dont do something were in 
trouble 
childcare activists say however that the highprofile 
benefits of a few companies mask a potential labor crisis most 
businesses say child care isnt a workrelated issue despite 
evidence that help from the boss lowers turnover raises morale and 
improves productivity moreover the activists say the federal 
government isnt providing much help 
although a bill that would vastly expand federal support for 
child care is working through congress it faces a likely white 
house veto because of the estimated 227 billion cost over five 
years 
president bush proposes more modest legislation that would cost 
25 billion a year by 1993 mostly through tax credits to parents 
still thats less than 20 a week or about 1000 a year and it 
would go only to poorer families 
actual costs for outofhome child care range from 1500 to 
10000 a year according to a study by the conference board a new 
yorkbased business research group other studies show much higher 
costs for inhome care 
because of the costs and the scarcity of daycare openings the 
vast majority of working parents contend with a hodgepodge 
hitormiss system for finding help they can trust and afford 
stories abound of sitters who ignore abandon abuse or kidnap 
children 
most parents rely on referrals from friends and relatives but 
the result can be hiring an unlicensed untrained caregiver an 
additional aggravation is that these caregivers generally take 
only cash to avoid paying income tax an estimated 7 billion in 
daycare income goes unreported annually 
beginning this year parents must give the internal revenue 
service the name and social security number of their daycare 
provider to qualify for a tax credit to defray childcare costs 
the irs plans to crossreference the returns of sitters and 
prosecute cheaters 
daycare experts believe the law could make it even harder for 
parents to afford day care since many providers will raise rates 
to compensate for taxes 
childcare workers are the lowest paid workers in this 
country one of the ways people are able to survive is to be paid 
without having to declare the income said barbara reisman 
executive director of the child care action campaign 
i dont recommend people cheat on their taxes she said 
but many parents cant afford to pay the full cost of care 
esther j kahn director of parents place a san francisco 
counseling and referral service agrees we have a system that 
has not caught up with rapid social change in our society in which 
more women are back in the labor force and need child care our 
society hasnt provided support for families

chances are growing that those young women pushing strollers in 
the supermarket or nudging toddlers into the playground sandbox are 
modern incarnations of that prim english nursemaid the nanny 
the increasing number of working american mothers has created a 
strong demand for child care for couples who can afford it 
trained nannies are a popular alternative 
inhome child care is obviously not the cheapest way to go 
but if you consider your child to be the most important factor in 
your life then dont have a volvo buy a chevrolet said cathie 
robertson president of the international nanny association a 
professional group based in san diego 
seriously a lot of people have a mercedes and wont spend 
more than 85 a week to take care of their children she said 
depending on the location nannies can earn 200 to 500 a week 
plus room and board they typically work 12hour days doing 
everything from changing diapers to buying infant formula to 
reading bedtime stories 
theyre not there to schlep the dog around to the vet or scrub 
out toilets ms robertson said theyre there for the kids 
thats probably been the hardest thing weve had to do to teach 
parents 
interest in hiring nannies has grown so rapidly that schools now 
train recruits in this country mostly women in their 20s who want 
to make children part of their careers courses range from child 
nutrition to family relations 
terri eurich president of the national academy of nannies in 
denver says her school has graduated dozens of nannies since she 
founded it in 1983 students get nearly five months of training for 
3500 
ms eurich pats her school on the back for helping advance 
nannying as a legitimate profession and says most of her graduates 
quickly find jobs 
were doing our best to create an appreciation of a valuable 
service she said just because theyre not typing into a word 
processor doesnt mean they shouldnt be paid 1200 to 1500 a 
month 
one recent graduate 21yearold paige pessarra cares for the 
11monthold son of mr and mrs stephen mclaughlin in ladue mo 
outside st louis mclaughlin is a businessman his wife a 
fulltime medical student 
i decided i wanted to start with an infant and nurture him 
said miss pessarra who had read about the nanny profession in 
forbes magazine 
she said she works 60 hours a week has her own bedroom and 
living room and gets to use the family fourwheeldrive vehicle 
with mobile phone for emergencies she declined to discuss her

brian luna doesnt mind that doctors broke 
his legs and put him in a wheelchair for 10 months and the 
14yearold dwarf says he will let them do it again because the 
surgery will make him a foot taller 
its worth it its like being on stilts said brian who 
went from 3foot11 to 4foot5 during the first stage of the 
leglengthening procedure 
i can help my mom make breakfast i can turn on light 
switches i can turn on the radio and reach the top shelf on my 
book case its real neat most little people have extensions in 
their car to reach the pedals i wont have that problem 
brian of covina is one of four teenage dwarfs undergoing the 
process which costs 40000 to 50000 at cedarssinai medical 
center 
doctors carefully broke brians shin bones in november 1988 
then used telescoping metal rods to help 6 inches of new bone grow 
in each gap they will do the same to his thigh bones early next 
year increasing brians height to 4foot11 
the procedure is drawing criticism from some members of little 
people of america who believe dwarfs should accept their physical 
characteristics they say teenagers under 18 are too young to 
decide if they want the surgery and that parents may pressure them 
into it 
most little people can do anything they want to accomplish 
and their height is not a barrier said daniel margulies the 
groups immediate past president the fact youre short doesnt 
mean theres anything wrong with you if youre going to do 
something as drastic as surgery you have to take the position that 
short height is something that has to be corrected 
brian replied if they say i dont need to do this its not 
any of their business im pleasing myself im not doing this for 
everybody you really want to have this operation to go through all 
this inconvenience 
the procedure was developed in spain a decade ago but modified 
at cedarssinai to reduce pain and hospitalization 
it does an awful lot for their selfimage and outlook on 
life said dr david rimoin director of pediatrics and the 
hospitals medical geneticsbirth defects center it allows them 
to drive cars reach lights and elevator buttons to live in 
society without the aid that somebody dwarfed in stature requires 
the surgery by drs joseph isaacson and william oppenheim is 
done in two stages breaking the tibias or shin bones and 
lengthening them 6 inches then doing the same thing to the femurs 
or thigh bones the fibulas the lower leg bones next to the 
tibias are bowed in dwarfs so they are straightened and trimmed 
a bit when the tibias are extended 
before each shin or thigh bone is broken four screws are 
implanted two on each side of the planned break they extend at a 
right angle to the bone pointing inward toward the other leg 
after the bones are broken and placed in casts hollow telescoping 
rods are attached to screws parallel to the leg a knob allows the 
rods to be extended onetwentyfifth of an inch daily until the 
gap between each end of the broken bone reaches 6 inches 
because the membrane sheath around each bone is left intact when 
the bones are broken with a small chisel and hammer new bone grows 
in the proper place to fill the gap rimoin said 
leglengthening first developed for people with legs of unequal 
length involves long hospital stays in italy and the soviet union 
where patients are made to walk sooner after surgery causing 
greater pain he said 
cedarssinais patients remain in casts and a wheelchair for at 
least eight months five to lengthen the bone and three for the gap 
to fill and heal they spend only four or five days in the hospital 
after each set of bones is broken 
these kids are in and out of the hospital quickly and after 
the postoperative period of a few days they are painfree 
rimoin said i call it lengthening with a smile 
patients receive frequent physical therapy to maintain muscle 
tone while their legs are being lengthened rimoin monitors 
patients for impaired blood flow or nerve damage but so far hasnt 
seen serious complications 
brian had the screws and telescoping rods removed from his shins 
in june and got out of his wheelchair and onto crutches in august 
when his thigh bones are broken in a few months doctors also 
will cut his groin muscles to straighten his back rimoin said the 
entire procedure lasts about two years 
rimoin said it also will be used to lengthen dwarfs arms 
although brian doesnt want that surgery 
brian and others undergoing leglengthening at cedarssinai are 
achondroplastic dwarfs the inherited birth defect is the most 
common form of dwarfism characterized by short limbs a normal 
trunk small hands a large head prominent buttocks and curvature 
of the spine 
as he grew up brian said people would make fun it would 
hurt theyd call me shorty stuff like that he also received 
impolite stares wasnt allowed on amusement park rides needed 
specially tailored pants and had to use stools to reach bathroom 
sinks or to help in the kitchen 
rimoin said the surgery is best done between ages 16 and 20 and 
that he approves it only for dwarfs old enough to consider the 
consequences carefully brian made a list of pros and cons and 
received psychological evaluation 
it isnt something he did on a whim said brians mother 
barbara luna a divorcee who works for a defense contractor 
margulies fears the surgery is done because doctors and parents 
view dwarfism as a defect that has to be corrected rather than 
a characteristic such as blue eyes or red hair 
theres no way i would have said brian do this his 
mother said hes the one who had to undergo the pain 
most little people if they wait until theyre about 20 and 
are fairly welladjusted would not want the surgery margulies 
said once they get through the teenage years which are 
traumatic for anybody especially if youre different the desire 
to have the surgery is no longer there 
brian is happy with his taller stature but said ill always 
be a little person in my genes and ill have smaller hands it is 
changing my physical appearance but im always going to be a 
little person

tom leamon not only tolerates slipups in 
his basement laboratory he provokes them 
its all for science leamon head of texas tech universitys 
industrial engineering department is a pioneer in the study of 
slipping and falling 
no one has any idea why or how people fall leamon said 
you know its a slip you dont know why 
leamon slipped into the subject a couple years ago when he 
learned that 4000 americans die each year as a result of falling 
in places like stores fastfood restaurants and city streets 
falls are the secondleading cause of accidental death in the 
united states after traffic accidents 
before he can figure out how to prevent falls however he needs 
to find out what makes people slip and how they react when they do 
its not as easy as it sounds because walking is an extremely 
complex activity 
with a 300000 federal grant leamon equipped his lab with 
three video cameras plugged into a minicomputer that records 200 
times a second what people do when they slip and fall 
test subjects graduate students paid 10 an hour to be fall 
guys wear a harness connected to a revolving mechanical arm they 
have reflective pingpong balls taped to their right shoulder 
elbow wrist hip knee ankle and foot 
the subjects walk in circles for two hours at a time repeatedly 
crossing about 15 feet of slick steel plate placed in front of the 
cameras when they slip the cameras sense where the pingpong 
balls are in threedimensional space in other words how the body 
is moving as it falls 
a force plate under the floor a distant cousin of a 
bathroom scale but much more sophisticated senses how much force 
the subjects foot is exerting downward sideways forward and back 
the harness and mechanical arm prevent the subjects from hitting 
the ground and hurting themselves but dont interfere with the 
initial stages of the fall the period leamon is studying 
in two years he has found some facts about slipping that 
surprised him 
when people slip forward they jerk sideways its a physical 
reaction we dont know if that makes life better or worse 
he also found what he calls microslips 
every time you put your foot on the ground theres a slight 
slip up to a centimeter but you usually cant perceive it one 
of the things were trying to find out is when you start to 
perceive it 
the answer seems to be that when you notice a slip youre 
already on a collision course with the ground he said 
leamon also wants to know how vision and carrying things affect 
falling and he would like to find a surface that looks and feels 
slippery but isnt the theory being that people would walk more 
carefully on such a floor which would be a grocers and 
restaurateurs dream 
a question that dogs him when you walk across a slippery 
floor you can tell how without falling 
leamon said he believes peripheral vision helps prevent slips by 
orienting walkers to their environment if so long corridors with 
white unmarked walls might be disorienting and more dangerous than 
those with stripes or designs on the walls do you want vertical 
diagonal or horizontal marks on long corridors we dont know 
the research could help make hospitals nursing homes and 
offices safer 
step by step hes trying to learn with an occasional welcome 
slip

when millions of gallons of oil blackened 
alaskas prince william sound the whole world knew where it came 
from a jagged rip in the hull of the grounded exxon valdez 
but when a fisherman finds his fishing grounds befouled or a 
beachcombers favorite stretch of sand is soaked with oil its 
often a mystery 
thats where the super sleuths of oilspill investigations come 
in the us coast guard oil identification laboratory 
the laboratory often working with dissipated evidence and few 
clues has helped track down those responsible for hundreds of oil 
spills nationwide from one or two gallons to hundreds of thousands 
the laboratory uses sophisticated tests to identify the type of 
oil and pinpoint its source a task complicated by the fact that 
even oils of the same weight have different chemical 
fingerprints depending on where the original crude was pumped 
out of the ground and how it was stored 
its like crimesolving in which all of the pieces of evidence 
have to fit together said martha s hendrick the chief chemist 
and the only civilian in a lab that employs nine other 
marinescience technicians 
the coast guard was given jurisdiction for determining liability 
for oil spills by the federal water pollution control act of 1972 
which created a 6 million to 7 million revolving fund to cover 
the costs of cleanups additional money is collected from those 
found responsible for the spills 
the lab opened at the university of connecticuts avery point 
campus in 1978 moved to washington in 1980 and returned to the 
campus in 1986 
in that time the laboratory which has an annual budget of 
about 440000 has helped investigate more than 3000 oil spills 
and seen its case load grow each year amid heightened concern about 
the environment 
recent spills it investigated include the 11milliongallon 
spill from the exxon tanker in march a 288000gallon spill by the 
greek tanker world prodigy off newport ri on june 23 and the 
306000gallon spill from the uruguayan tanker presidente off 
claymont del on june 24 
the lab can also help exonerate those being blamed for a spill 
two technicians who assisted in the alaska investigation helped 
save exxon 97 million in cleanup costs when they found that 
several thousand gallons in haddock and salmonfishing grounds 
didnt come from the exxon valdez 
we have been very busy since the exxon valdez incident because 
everyone has become much more aware of pollution by petroleum 
products said cmdr larry h gibson 40 who has headed the 
laboratory for two years 
most investigations into oil spills however have far fewer 
clues than the exxon valdez disaster 
in 1987 a 50 to 75gallon spill fouled the willamette river 
near portland ore leaving coast guard officials with a slick 
but no suspects a year later the lab linked the spill to oil 
found near an intake valve on the underside of a tanker that was in 
dry dock for repairs the tankers owner agreed to pay for the 
cleanup 
a lot of people are very surprised when they learn that the 
oil did come from their vessel or their facility and they 
immediately cooperate once theyre shown the evidence gibson 
said some other people fight it tooth and nail 
field investigators take 4ounce samples from the spill along 
with samples from possible sources in the area 
back at the lab six to eight tablespoonsized batches are 
tested gas chromatography thinlayer chromatography fluorescence 
spectroscopy infrared spectroscopy and highperformance liquid 
spectroscopy the combination of tests allows scientists to 
crosscheck their results 
the gas chromatograph for example separates the chemicals that 
make up the oil based on their different boiling points which in 
turn helps scientists determine the oils fingerprints gibson 
said 
we compare the intrinsic chemical traits of the spilled oil 
against all of the suspects to pick out the source of the spill 
he said 
spills can consist of dozens of kinds of oil from the lighter 
kerosene and jet fuels to the thick no 6 oil used in heavy 
industry oil of the same weight can have slightly different 
characteristics 
there are thousands and thousands of compounds in any 
particular oil sample and the makeup of the sample depends on the 
oil fill it came from and the conditions of formation gibson 
said 
also it depends on any refinery processes that the oil has 
been through any time you mix a batch of oil with another batch of 
oil its going to change the fingerprint a little bit and thats 
where we can really get down to pinpointing the source of the 
pollution

people who had radiation therapy for acne 
should be checked for malignant tumors in the largest saliva gland 
says a scientist who linked the treatment to the rare form of 
cancer 
people who got an average of 12 radiation treatments for acne 
were five times more likely than others to develop malignant cancer 
of the parotid gland said susan prestonmartin an associate 
professor of preventive medicine at the university of southern 
california the risk of cancer was eight times normal in people who 
got 15 or more treatments 
radiation was commonly used to treat acne during the 1930s and 
1940s 
treatment of acne with radiation is no longer common 
prestonmartin said but our findings suggest that persons who 
have received this therapy should be checked periodically for 
parotid gland tumors 
she and colleagues studied 139 los angeles county residents with 
malignant parotid gland tumors and 269 with benign tumors all were 
diagnosed between 1976 and 1984 nineteen had received radiation 
treatment for acne their tumors were diagnosed as early as six 
years and as late as 49 years after treatment 
the study found radiations link with malignant parotid gland 
tumors was much stronger than with benign tumors 
in another study prestonmartin concluded last year that 
excessive exposure to dental xrays correlated with parotid gland 
cancers she also identified fullmouth dental xrays given before 
1955 when doses were higher as the cause of meningioma a tumor 
of the membrane covering the brain

men who became fathers when they are 
middleaged feel better prepared for parenthood but those who were 
better off financially said they were less satisfied with the 
experience according to a new study 
i think the reason is because men at the higher socioeconomic 
status have had good jobs probably traveled and had the better 
things in life said deborah ulrich a researcher who studied 210 
ohio fathers when they compare parenthood to those experiences 
it just doesnt rate as high 
ms ulrich an associate professor of nursing at miami 
university chose her study subjects from among 5000 men between 
ages 40 and 55 after examining birth certificates to find those who 
became fathers in 1986 nearly 71 percent said they had at least 
one year of college and average annual income was about 25000 to 
30000 
the advantages of being a father at midlife were that they 
felt they were more responsible more ready to father a child and 
to be an important part of the childs life ms ulrich said 
nearly 90 percent of the men in the study reported being as 
fulfilled with fatherhood as they had anticipated the same number 
said they had more money to spend on a child and had reached a 
point in their professional lives where they could spend less time 
at work and more with the baby 
two factors influencing satisfaction the most were the length 
and strength of a marriage she said fiftytwo percent of the 
fathers were on their second marriage those with shorter second 
marriages said they were happier fathers 
it could be that they wanted their wives being that new 
wives are usually younger to think that they were still young 
enough to be a father and enjoy it she said 
disadvantages of parenthood reported by the fathers were 
physical exhaustion and the knowledge they might not live to see 
their child grow up and have children she said 
the study asked fathers to rate 17 factors associated with 
having a baby including having it cry at night not having time to 
spend with their wives and financial concerns questions on 
satisfaction asked how much pleasure the fathers received from such 
things as watching the child grow

a device that enhances the xray film used 
in breast exams lets hospitals convert equipment to reduce womens 
radiation exposure and could result in better pictures to diagnose 
cancer 
the concept of extended processing of mammographic film is not 
new but it has been available only in new equipment which runs 
upwards of 10000 said dr gw eklund director of radiation at 
st francis medical center here 
eklund and dale surratt a radiology engineer modified a 
swedish process and applied to existing processors conversion kits 
marketed by their advanced radiographic technologies cost 1700 to 
2200 they said 
the process involves installing a variablespeed motor to adjust 
the time that mammographic film spends in chemical developers 
surratt said the kit slows down the processing speed with the push 
of a button 
theres about 30000 of these xray film processors out there 
so its a huge market weve found other applications than 
mammography including bone studies and tissue density pictures 
said surratt theyve sold about two dozen conversion kits in six 
months 
dr eklund has come up with a way to switch xray processors 
back and forth from processing chest film to mammographic film 
said arthur haus a medical physicist in the health and science 
division at eastman kodak inc 
weve found that extended development processing reduces 
patient radiation doses by about 35 percent haus said and the 
resulting pictures offer better resolution and more contrast which 
are easier to interpret for diagnostic purposes those are very 
strong benefits 
weve been most impressed by our film quality and the food and 
drug administration examined it and determined weve reduced our 
radiation dose about 38 percent said jan mcpharolin of salinas 
valley radiologists in salinas calif we didnt want to buy an 
entire new processor so were very happy with the conversion kits 
eklund said hospitals also can expect to see a 25 percent 
increase in the life of the tubes in their xray equipment the 
tubes cost about 14000 
dale stevenson fda health physicist in san francisco confirmed 
the radiation dose reduction and said the extended development of 
mammographic film is producing dramatically improved film pictures

angered by us complaints the 
european community says its plan to limit us and other foreign tv 
programs is perfectly compatible with international trade rules 
us trade representative carla hills said tuesday in washington 
that measure was blatantly protectionist and vowed to file a 
complaint challenging the policy with an international trade agency 
but a spokesman for the 12nation trading bloc who demanded 
anonymity defended the move wednesday as legal and said the united 
states would do better under the new plan than under the current 
fragmented broadcasting system in europe 
european officials consider the measure perfectly compatible 
i repeat perfectly compatible with the international obligations 
of the community he said 
at issue is last weeks decision by european foreign ministers 
to press their local television stations to reserve where 
practicable a majority of air time for europeanmade 
entertainment programs 
the measure is part of the communitys campaign to lift by the 
end of 1992 the many trade barriers preventing the free flow of 
money people goods and services among the dozen nations 
the united states strongly opposed the plan and mrs hills 
underscored her disapproval in her statement tuesday in washington 
the directive is blatantly protectionist and unjustifiable 
and discriminates against us and other nonec film goods she 
said 
mrs hills promised to file a complaint with the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade a 97nation forum and agreement for 
removing trade barriers 
reacting to her complaint the community spokesman said foreign 
ministers measure has a nonbinding character the foreign 
ministers agreed last week their decision would be considered a 
political commitment not a legal obligation 
moreover he said a majority of the community nations already 
have some type of restrictions on broadcast content therefore he 
said there would be advantages to the united states and other 
countries from the new plan even if it were not 100 percent 
liberalization 
the spokesman also said tv programs were considered services 
not commercial products and therefore were not covered by the gatt 
rules 
even so he said the community would be willing to hold talks 
with the united states about the measure 
the dispute has revived american concerns about the communitys 
1992 transformation 
commerce secretary robert mosbacher last week told a us house 
of representatives panel that the united states may have to 
reassess its position if the european community moves toward local 
content rules in such areas as tv computer chips 
telecommunications equipment and cars 
according to industry figures the united states has a trade 
surplus of about 3 billion from its tv and film exports europe is 
the leading buyer of such programs with about 700 million in 
annual sales 
the surge in american tv programs in europe such as dynasty 
and dallas has prompted worries among some politicians about 
their impact on european culture

mcdonnell douglas corp is 
discontinuing development of a revolutionary propfan jet engine 
because customers have shown no interest in the 100 million design 
instead of extending research on the innovative exposed 
propeller engine the aircraft builder will focus on a new 
generation of fuelefficient aircraft the md90 series which it 
previewed tuesday 
after a number of years of research this is what the 
customers are telling us they want said walter orlowski 
mcdonnells md90 program general manager 
mcdonnell douglas introduced the experimental propfan engine in 
february 1988 it resembles a standard jet engine housing fitted 
with external blades similar to aircraft propellers but with 16 
curved blades 
the novelty and designers claims about increased fuel 
efficiency failed to excite customers in the airline industry 
officials said 
despite projections that the engine could reduce fuel 
consumption by 40 percent mcdonnell douglas failed to get a single 
order for the engine type company vice president john wolf said 
our customers indicated they were not interested in buying 
it wolf said 
the gamble to develop the propfan engine was based on the 
belief that the price of jet fuel would increase in the 1980s but 
prices have held steady 
the md90 models which come in two sizes are designed to be 
more fuelefficient than the md80 models from which the new series 
was derived a 114seat version is expected to be 13 percent more 
fuelefficient and a 153seat version will save 17 percent 
company officials predicted 
the company declined to say how much it planned to invest in the 
new planes but industry analysts estimate the development cost at 
between 300 million and 400 million 
the md90 series will be powered by a v2500 engine produced by 
the consortium international aero engines the consortium included 
the american manufacturer pratt amp whitney and the british firm 
rollsroyce and west german italian and japanese companies 
wolf would not say how many orders the company needs before it 
can begin production of md90s but it has already begun its pitch 
to airlines mcdonnell douglas hopes to begin making deliveries as 
early as the fourth quarter of 1994

some small business telephone systems and

the department ruling wednesday means the international trade 
commission must decide within 45 days whether the imports totaling 
more than 1 billion last year injure or threaten the us 
industry 
if the itc agrees with commerce the department will order its

unfair price advantage the foreign products have over similar us 
products 
commerce said the companies involved in the dumping include 
toshiba corp and matsushita of japan and taiwan nitsuko and sun 
moon star of taiwan 
the dumping charges were filed last december on behalf of the

the house ways and means committee killed a 
bill that could have been worth an average of 223 per household 
for customers of power gas and telephone companies 
consumer groups and utilities had lobbied vigorously on opposing 
sides of the issue 
the 2213 vote wednesday probably killed any chance the 
legislation would become law this year it was opposed by all but 
one of the committees 13 republicans and by 10 democrats 
the bill by reps robert matsui dcalif and byron dorgan 
dnd was aimed at a 19 billion reserve that utilities collected 
from customers and under current law are obligated to refund 
within the next 30 years the bill could have resulted in refunds 
within as little as three years 
the excess reserve grew out of the 1986 overhaul of federal tax 
law 
when utilities calculate the prices customers must pay they 
take into account federal taxes they expect to owe and collect them 
in advance before the 1986 tax changes utility prices were based 
on the assumption they would pay the maximum corporate rate of 46 
percent the new law cut that top rate to 34 percent 
a separate provision in the 1986 law inserted ironically by 
matsui gave utilities up to 30 years to refund the excess to 
consumers matsui says now that he was misled into believing 
utilities would put the reserve to good use in ways that would mean 
lower power and phone rates in the future 
now however i dont believe them matsui said earlier this 
year when he introduced the bill never before in my 11 years in 
congress has an issue been as crystal clear as this one its a 
matter of right vs wrong good public policy vs bad special 
interests ethics vs greed 
his bill would have allowed state utility regulators to require 
that refunds be made within as little as three years 
there was little debate before the committee killed the bill 
rep ronnie flippo dala contended that if the pace of 
refunds is accelerated to accommodate present customers it would 
boost utility prices for future customers 
acceleration will affect the credit rating of utilities and in 
the end cost customers more said rep hank brown rcolo 
the bill was strenuously opposed by major utilities but it had 
the backing of a variety of consumer labor and environmental 
groups as well as the organization that represents state regulators 
susan c stone a member of the illinois commerce commission 
estimated earlier this year that a quick refund could be worth an 
average of 223 per household

a congressional subcommittee will travel to 
florida this week to begin a series of field hearings reviewing the 
federal governments policies on offshore oil drilling 
rep george miller dcalif chairman of the house interior 
subcommittee on water power and offshore energy resources said 
his hearing saturday in key west will focus on a bill that would 
permanently ban offshore oil drilling in federal waters off south 
florida and the keys 
his subcommittee also will travel to new england the pacific 
northwest california and texas to review the effectiveness of the 
current offshore drilling law 
the federal offshore drilling program has become paralyzed by 
political gridlock said miller 
he blasted the interior department of the reagan and bush 
administrations for encouraging offshore drilling he said the 
policies have alarmed the residents of coastal states 
congress has responded by passing a series of oneyear 
moratoriums on offshore lease sales in specific areas as part of 
the annual interior appropriations legislation 
at first the strategy was used just for california leases but 
in the fiscal 1990 appropriations bill specific sites in florida 
new england the midatlantic and alaska also were included 
the legislation affecting florida to be discussed at the key 
west hearing would prohibit the interior secretary from issuing oil 
and gas leases on the portion of the outer continental shelf south 
of 26 degrees north latitude and east of 86 degrees west longitude 
it also would require guidelines to be established for the 
buying back by the federal government of existing oil or gas leases 
witnesses are expected from congress the us minerals 
management service the governors office of environmental affairs 
the state legislature local business organizations the oil 
industry and environmental groups

the federal government officially launched the 
worlds largest private telecommunications system with a threeway 
coasttocoast conference call and electronic mail exchange on the 
new fts2000 network 
rep john conyers dmich on wednesday made the first 
telephone call a discussion of day care facilities with a 
department of veterans affairs official in indianapolis and a 
department of energy official in spokane wash 
the brief threeway conversation was piped into a loudspeaker 
in the office of gsas acting administrator richard g austin 
where a gaggle of relieved telephone and government representatives 
applauded the connection 
austin with a bit of fumbling with unfamiliar equipment then 
transmitted and received electronic messages with the two distant 
callers that were displayed on a nearby television screen 
conyers chairman of the house government operations committee 
which oversaw development of the new federal telecommunications 
system 2000 longdistance network told the gathering the 
stateofthe art system was a daring innovative massive leap 
into the next century 
austin said that when fts2000 is fully implemented it will 
provide a host of voice video and highspeed data services to 
1300 federal sites nationwide in what the government says is the 
largest network of its kind the voice part of the system will be 
fully in place by mid1990 
fts2000 is expected to slice at least 200 million annually off 
the governments 400 million yearly phone bill when it is fully in 
place austin said savings should surpass 2 billion over the 
10year contract 
we will exceed the 2 billion mark by a considerable 
distance austin predicted 
austin in an interview later said that as government use of 
fts2000 increases and volume discounts kick in we could see 
upwards of 1 billion a year in hardcash savings when the system 
is fully operational 
austin said the network which actually began operation friday 
when the first of 31 government sites were tied into fts2000 
already had carried 150000 telephone calls 
he said 17 minor problems had been reported out of the 
150000 calls 10 numbers were reached incorrectly and there were 
seven preprogrammed dialing errors 
the 10year fixedprice contract which gsa awarded last 
december following a lengthy contractletting process and 
challenges by failed bidders could be worth as much as 25 billion 
to the two prime contractors the american telephone and telegraph 
co and us sprint communications co 
atampt has 60 percent of the network sprint 40 percent 
richard j lombardi atampt vice president for federal systems 
said the contract was a model for government procurement 
fts2000 will serve nearly 13 million federal employees and is 
expected to handle more than 300 million calls annually 
the network utilizes digital and fiberoptic technology for

treasury secretary nicholas f brady 
campaigning anew for increased personal savings and longterm 
investments warned that the united states is inadequately 
preparing for the future 
noting the high us standard of living and relatively low rates 
of inflation and unemployment brady said wednesday that we must 
not let our pride in these accomplishments distract us from 
focusing on whether the united states is adquately preparing to 
compete over the longterm in an integrated world economy we 
are not adquately preparing for the future 
as he has previously in recent weeks the treasury secretary 
called again for lower capital gains taxes and elimination of 
double taxation of dividends to stimulate investment and for ways 
to expand tax incentives to encourage individual savings 
capital gains are the profits from the sale of investments and 
other assets in remarks prepared for a speech wedneday night to 
the american council for capital formation brady called for 
taxation of only 70 percent of the gains which is what a bill 
approved by the house would do for many taxpayers 
senate democratic leaders want to replace the house cut with an 
expansion of individual retirement accounts 
noting that the united states has higher capital gains rate than 
most of its trading partners brady contended that we cant 
expect to remain competitive when our tax structure provides so 
little incentive for new investment 
he also called again for the elimination of double taxation of 
dividends but conceded options here are limited by the federal 
budget deficit at present companies pay dividends to shareholders 
out of aftertax profits and shareholders in turn are taxed on the 
dividends as well 
brady said the administration continues to examine a range of 
options for expanding the individual retirement accounts as a means 
of encouraging americans to increase their private saving 
americans personal savings rate savings as a percentage of 
aftertax income fell to a 40year low of 32 percent in 1987 and 
increased only slightly to 42 percent last year 
as a result brady said domestic sources of capital are 
inadequate making us industry rely instead on more expensive 
foreign investment 
so ultimately the higher cost of capital endangers the 
competitive position of american companies he continued 
and if our capital costs are consistently higher than those of 
our competitors over a long period of time our leadership in the 
international economy and even our standard of living will be 
placed in jeopardy

allegheny international inc on wednesday 
filed two alternate plans for emerging from chapter 11 of federal 
bankruptcy laws 
the first plan is similar to the proposal the pittsburghbased 
appliance maker filed in august the exception is that the latest 
plan does not provide for a stock sale to raise 140 million in 
cash to pay off some creditors 
under the revised plan those creditors would receive bonds 
instead of cash 
allegheny international said it will offer its second plan as a 
backup if the first one is rejected in us bankruptcy court 
the backup plan calls for the issuance of shares of common and 
preferred stock in the reorganized company to pay off most general 
creditors exceptions would be creditors of allegheny 
internationals sunbeam unit and a secured group of bank lenders 
which will get cash the company said 
allegheny international has a loan commitment of 400 million 
from wells fargo bank to make those cash payments and fund 
continued operating expenses 
robert sable an attorney for the unsecured creditors said his 
clients will not support either plan 
court hearings on the proposed plans begin next month

ramada inc said it postponed a restructuring 
that includes selling its 825 hotels and giving itself a new name 
because of the continuing upheaval in the nations junk bond market 
the hotel chain on wednesday canceled a 400 million debt 
offering that was a prerequisite for the restructuring and said it 
could offer no assurance the deal would be completed 
ramada earlier this year said it would sell its worldwide hotel 
business to new world hotel holdings ltd of hong kong for about 
540 million and rename itself aztar corp a company that would 
operate its nevada and new jersey casinos 
the deal was conditioned on arranging 400 million in financing 
for aztar but ramada said it decided not to proceed because of a 
junk bond market tailspin that began when retailer campeau corp 
announced financial problems last month 
ramadas stock plunged wednesday on the new york stock exchange 
losing 225 to close at 11 
nicholas meris first vice president of prudentialbache 
securities inc in phoenix said difficulties in the market have 
made it hard to create new financing 
ramada had a plan that they believed was viable at the time 
and it was but now they are going to have to sit down and come up 
with something new he said 
also wednesday whitehall financial group cited the junk bond 
jitters in canceling a planned 310 million purchase of several 
units of struggling integrated services inc in august ohio 
mattress co withdrew a 475 million junk bond offering after 
investors shunned the securities 
the ramada deal included issuing 230 million in subordinated 
debt and 170 million in firstmortgage notes secured by the 
tropworld casino and entertainment resort in atlantic city nj 
tropworld is one of three gaming properties ramada intends to 
continue to operate after restructuring the others are the 
tropicana resort and casino in las vegas and the ramada express 
hotel casino in laughlin nev 
ramada announced oct 3 it would consider issuing warrants for 
10 percent of aztar stock as part of the bond offering to make it 
more attractive 
ramada said it plans to develop a revised restructuring plan but 
said it can offer no assurance that a restructuring will be 
completed and it cannot specify the timing of the next steps 
in a new restructuring ramada said it would modify a planned 
payment to shareholders of 7 per share and a halfshare of stock 
ramada also plans to seek an extension of a nov 30 deadline for 
the hotel sale to new world 
shareholders and gaming officials in nevada and new jersey would 
have to approve an amended plan

the dollar kept rising against the japanese yen 
today despite central bank efforts to stop it and the tokyo stock 
exchange reacted with a selling wave that caused the second largest 
oneday drop this year in its key index 
the 225issue nikkei stock average fell 44502 points or 126 
percent to 3479505 the decline was second this year only to a 
48990point drop on june 15 to 3291309 
today marked the indexs first closing below 35000 since sept 
25 
meanwhile the dollar gained 070 yen from wednesdays 
14390yen close ending at 14460 yen it opened at 14425 yen and 
ranged between 14370 yen and 14460 yen 
the dollar had climbed 167 yen on wednesday the day the bank 
of japan raised the nations official discount rate by 05 
percentage point to 375 percent higher interest rates usually 
tend to make a currency more attractive to investors boosting its 
value 
the hike by 05 percentage points was too small to have much 
power in the market to reverse the dollars uptrend said a 
trader with mitsubishi bank speaking on condition of anonymity 
gaps between japans discount rate and those of other 
countries with major currencies are still wide and the dollar 
remains a good investment he said 
japans discount rate is the lowest among the group of seven 
industrial nations it compares with 6 percent in west germany and 
7 percent in the united states 
the bank of japan also was selling dollars today in an effort to 
check the dollars rise but the amount was unknown the central 
bank does not comment on its exchange market activities 
unless the united states eases its credit the dollars 
bullish trend will continue the trader said although the 
united states would not change its policy just for the sake of 
stability in currency exchange 
on the stock market the nikkei plunged partly because of the 
discount rate hike yesterday said masahiro umemori a stock 
analyst with nomura securities 
what hit the market most however was the fact that it didnt 
work he said noting the dollar had continued to rise 
nikko securities dealer masaya hashizume said investors were 
afraid of another discount rate hike sometime soon believing the 
central bank could not sell dollars endlessly in its efforts to end 
the dollars rise 
other dealers said investors sold issues in anticipation of 
further price declines amid uncertainties about interest rate 
movements the discount rate the fee charged for commercial bank 
borrowings from the central bank in turn affects other interest 
rates 
trading was moderate with first section trading estimated at 
650 million shares down from wednesdays 750 million 
prices were lower across the board dealers said

executives at many major corporations travel 
separately to reduce the risk that top management would be wiped 
out in a fatal accident officials said the day after three trump 
organization executives died in a helicopter crash 
on tuesday three of developer donald trumps highest ranking 
gaming executives died when their helicopter crashed en route from 
new york city to atlantic city 
one of the executives oversaw all casino operations in atlantic 
city for trump another headed the 1 billion taj mahal casino 
under construction on the boardwalk and the third was senior vice 
president of one of trumps operating casinos 
in general terms top executives would not travel on the same 
aircraft said peter j peterson a spokesman for general motors 
corp in the interest of continuity at the highest levels of 
management you limit your risk 
not all corporations however have policies about their 
executives traveling together said francis h goranin the 
immediate past president of the american society of travel agents 
some companies do some companies dont there is no set 
rule he said adding that concern over executive safety and 
travel had increased since the bombing of pan am flight 103 last 
december 
trump organization spokesman dan klores said wednesday that 
trump at one point planned to be on the helicopter that crashed in 
a heavily wooded area along new jerseys garden state parkway but 
changed his mind 
klores said he was unaware of any travel policy in the trump 
organization 
even those companies with such policies however said having 
executives part company at the airline terminal is difficult to 
enforce unless the officers themselves are concerned 
a 1988 survey by runzheimer international ltd a northbrook 
ill management consulting firm found that 56 percent of 108 
companies responding to a survey had policies on employee travel 
sixtyeight percent of the companies with policies include 
limits on executives traveling together those limits include air 
travel at 93 percent of the companies and ground restrictions at 
27 percent of the companies 
fifteen percent of the companies with limitations place 
restrictions on executives checking in to the same hotel 
bradford burris executive vice president with runzheimer said 
most companies usually cant police their executives to make sure 
they adhere to travel policies 
it is a policy that is difficult to enforce unless the 
travelers themselves are concerned burris said 
youd never know it is adhered to until the plane crashes 
he said 
some companies limits reach into the middlemanagement level 
we restrict the number of divisional people that can travel 
together said robert t mcdonough a spokesman for the upjohn 
co a pharmaceutical manufacturer in kalamazoo mich we 
basically say that our most senior executives will not travel 
together at all 
peterson said gms policy also included division heads 
it would just appear to be good judgment he said 
at atampt our chairman does not fly with either of our first 
vice chairmen said lynn newman a spokeswoman for the 
bedminster njbased company we dont want more than two of 
our senior managers on the same flight 
as with most other companies who discussed their policies with 
the associated press ms newman said atampts restrictions did not 
result from a particular incident 
one company however declined to discuss policy for security 
reasons 
our policy is not to discuss publicly the companys travel 
policy said harold carr a spokesman for the boeing corp in 
seattle we have executives traveling around the world every day 
of the week 
and the policy goes far beyond the corporate world 
even when appearing at the same function president bush and 
vice president quayle take separate planes

a family with a working head of the household 
is nearly twice as likely to be poor in rural america as in the 
countrys metropolitan areas says a policy research group 
many of the nonmetro poor keep their end of societys 
bargain they find employment and try to earn their way out of 
poverty but they are unable to do so the center on budget and 
policy priorities said in a report released wednesday 
the substantially higher poverty rates among rural working poor 
were found among both whites and blacks as well as fulltime and 
parttime workers the report said 
in 1987 the most recent year for which data was available the 
overall poverty rate in families in which the household head works 
at least part time was 10 percent in rural areas compared with 57 
percent in metropolitan areas 
for blacks the rural poverty rate was 278 percent compared 
with 155 percent in metropolitan areas among white families the 
poverty rate was 85 percent in rural areas compared with 45 
percent in metropolitan areas 
the 1987 poverty line defined by the federal government was an 
annual income of 11611 for a family of four 
the report said there were significantly higher poverty rates in 
rural areas even though a substantial majority of the 
nonmetropolitan poor live in a household with at least one 
worker 
about 91 million americans in rural areas lived in poverty in 
1987 the study said of those an estimate 58 million lived in a 
household where at least one household member worked during the 
year 
in 1987 said the report 705 percent of the heads of rural 
poor families who were not ill disabled or retired were people who 
worked for all or part of the year with 243 percent working full 
time yearround 
the poverty rate among workers in nonmetro areas rose sharply 
during the backtoback recessions of the early 1980s and decline 
during the ensuing economic recovery the report said despite 
the lengthy recovery however poverty rates among nonmetro 
workers are higher now than they were during the recovery of the 
late 1970s 
one reason rural job growth has lagged behind job growth in 
metropolitan areas is that nonmetro area employment is more 
concentrated in industries that are experiencing decline the 
report said 
in particular nonmetro unemployment is more concentrated in 
two areas resource industries mining and agriculture and 
routine manufacturing that have encountered substantial problems 
in the 1980s

a rhode island securities dealer and 
investment adviser has been barred from associating with the 
national association of securities dealers for allegedly bilking 
14 million from investors in six states 
edward e dockray was also fined 700000 by nasd the 
selfregulatory body of the securities industry the providence 
journalbulletin reported today 
this effectively kicks him out of the business said willis 
h riccio vice president and director of nasds district office in 
boston most brokers are either members of nasd or the stock 
exchange and the us securities and exchange commission honors 
the nasd bar 
nasd alleges dockray ran a fraudulent securities scheme that 
enticed 140 people to invest more than 14 million in a white 
board an electronic bulletin board and copying machine for 
hotels and convention centers 
the nasd disciplinary complaint charged that dockray and his 
partner raymond d pollard of missouri city texas misused and 
or misappropriated the investments 
dockray 48 could not be reached for comment nasd said he 
neither admitted nor denied the allegations but agreed to the 
sanctions and findings thereby avoiding an administrative trial 
pollard is not a nasd member and is not subject to nasd 
sanctions 
dockray has denied allegations in a complaint filed against him 
by the massachusetts division of securities a hearing on those 
allegations is set for november said paul glickman chief of 
enforcement 
the massachusetts complaint charges that the scheme was run from 
may 1987 to april 1988 while dockray worked as the branch manager 
of equities international securities in north providence 
according to nasd massachusetts investors accounted for 
805000 of the money taken while 110000 was taken from 
connecticut investors 420000 from california 85000 from rhode 
island 10000 from utah and 5000 from new hampshire 
investors were promised that their 5000 investments were fully 
guaranteed and would return 200 a month for 48 months 
the massachusetts complaint maintains only one white board was 
ever purchased and none were placed in hotels for rental 
dockray had run several investment firms in rhode island until 
his license was terminated in may he had been registered with nasd

japans trade surplus with the united states 
widened in september although rising purchases abroad reduced 
japans overall trade surplus from yearago levels for the fifth 
consecutive month the finance ministry said thursday 
total exports exceeded imports by 724 billion down from 776 
billion in september 1988 the surplus was up however from 344 
billion in august 
although september imports from the united states surged 123 
percent from a year ago to 388 billion japans surplus with the 
united states rose to 478 billion from 465 billion a year 
earlier us imports from japan rose 68 percent to 867 billion 
it was the first increase in three months in japans surplus 
with the united states 
on a global basis japans exports rose 48 percent from 
september 1988 to 2429 billion while imports climbed 106 percent 
to 1705 billion the import growth was down from the 158 percent 
between august 1988 and august 1989 
while analysts say they do not anticipate a major export 
expansion soon some cited fears that the yens continued weakening 
against the us dollar which makes japanese goods cheaper abroad 
could add to already firm foreign demand for japans products 
the weakening yen also makes japanese purchases abroad more 
expensive but government officials have said demand in japan is 
robust 
japan registered a trade surplus of 202 billion with the 
european economic community in september up from 201 billion a 
year earlier exports rose 44 percent to 408 billion while 
imports increased 87 percent to 206 billion

despite regulatory vigilance and significant 
government cleanup efforts that brought the great lakes back from 
an environmental crisis in the 1970s the lakes may still pose a 
health threat us and canadian experts say 
accumulations of toxic contaminants are poisoning wildlife and 
may reach up the food chain to the 35 million people who live in 
the region according to a report great lakes great legacy 
released wednesday at news conferences held simultaneously in 
chicago and toronto 
our study concludes that the great lakes environment is sick 
and its no longer getting better said david runnalls an 
associate director at the institute for research on public policy 
in ottawa canada which coauthored the study 
the report said the great lakes cleanup that began in the early 
1970s has reduced the amount of human waste and toxic industrial 
garbage dumped into the lakes but has not prevented continued 
buildups of some dangerous chemicals including cancercausing 
polychlorinated biphenyls or pcbs as well as pesticides that 
leach into the lakes 
millions of people in the great lakes region are exposed to 
the hazardous chemicals drink them in the contaminated water eat 
them concentrated in the flesh of the fish and breathe them in the 
air said jeff leonard vice president of the conservation 
foundation of washington dc a nonprofit group that produced the 
report with the irpp 
we know that these continuous exposures have serious adverse 
effects on the wildlife of the great lakes region leonard said 
from toronto 
we fear increasingly that humans especially pregnant women 
and children may be affected as well 
leonard said researchers do not know for certain what the risk 
is to people from the toxic contamination in the great lakes but 
the report recommends that state health departments need to 
reexamine and strengthen warnings about fish consumption 
william k reilly administrator of the us environmental 
protection agency praised the report at the chicago news 
conference but said his agency was not prepared to say that 
states recommendations on fish consumption are outofdate or 
inappropriate 
state officials in the great lakes region provide advice on fish 
consumption based on us food and drug administration standards 
for commercial fish they are based on findings that certain types 
of fish particularly bigger and older ones are more likely to 
contain dangerous contaminants than others 
the four states along lake michigan have advised that women and 
children should not eat mediumsized fish and that no one should 
eat very large fish from the lake 
reilly said the report shows that as a society we are not 
moving fast enough to deal with pollution problems in the great 
lakes 
but he disagreed with report authors who said the united states 
has not done enough to meet its obligations under the great lakes 
water quality agreement that it signed with canada in 1978 
the goal of zero discharge of toxic substances set for the 
great lakes in the 1978 agreement and as yet unmet is one of seven 
principles for action outlined in the report 
others include increased monitoring and research to correct 
grossly inadequate feedback on the environmental quality of the 
region and an emphasis on prevention of pollution ahead of cleanup 
the great lakes erie huron michigan ontario and superior 
border eight states and canada and hold 20 percent of the worlds 
fresh surface water

cocacola co reported today that the sale of its 
bottled water business and increased international soft drink 
volume helped boost its thirdquarter profit 22 percent from the 
same period a year ago 
net income for the threemonth period totaled 3613 million or 
103 a share compared with 2956 million or 81 cents a share 
in the same 1988 period the atlantabased soft drink company said 
net operating revenues rose 8 percent to 23 billion from 21 
billion 
for the first nine months of 1989 net income was up 19 percent 
to 9666 million or 273 a share from 8092 million or 220 
a share a year earlier revenue rose 6 percent to 67 billion 
from 63 billion 
the results included a nonrecurring aftertax gain of about 36 
million or 10 cents per share from the sale of the bottled water 
business the company said 
a much larger aftertax gain 530 million or 153 per common 
share is expected to be added to fourthquarter earnings because 
of the sale of cocacolas 538 million shares of columbia pictures 
entertainment inc to sony corp company officials said the 
cocacola board approved the sale oct 2 
chairman roberto c goizueta said thirdquarter earnings also 
were helped by an 8 percent increase in worldwide sales of soft 
drink syrups and concentrates international syrup sales were up 14 
percent but domestic sales of syrups and concentrates was down 2 
percent during the three months ended sept 30 he said 
case sales of soft drinks in the united states were even with 
the previous year 
the cocacola foods subsidiary which markets minute maid 
brands reported a 25 percent increase in chilled orange juice 
volume and a 33 percent decline in frozen orange juice volume for 
the quarter 
the company also reported that it completed a 40 millionshare 
stock repurchase plan during the third quarter the plan was 
initiated in 1987 
the board of directors has authorized the repurchase of an 
additional 20 million shares through 1991 the company said

after raising millions of insects to feast 
on corn plants in test fields this summer researchers are 
surveying the damage for genetic clues to fight the 400 million 
pests 
using the same techniques that enable law enforcement agencies 
to identify the genetic fingerprints of criminals they are 
trying to pinpoint pestresistant genes on corn chromosomes 
the aim not only is to breed corn that resists infestation by 
the european corn borer but also to use the findings to protect 
corn and other crops from a wide range of pests and diseases says 
michael lee an assistant professor of agronomy at iowa state 
university 
you end up with an agricultural system less dependent on 
chemical control of insects lee says a more stable 
agricultural system 
if scientists can map the location of genes for traits such as 
pest resistance they can tackle more complex genetic traits such 
as those that could increase crop yields with less reliance on 
chemical fertilizers he says 
lee is working in cooperation with academic and government 
scientists at the corn insects research unit of the us department 
of agriculture at ankeny a community between des moines and ames 
where iowa state is located 
he has a 160000 grant for a fouryear genetic study the usda 
contributed about 10000 of its 477000 budget from the corn 
research unit this year to produce the insects place them on tens 
of thousands of plants and record data according to the 
agricultural research service 
at laboratories in the midst of corn fields about 3 million egg 
masses of 25 corn borer eggs each were produced this year and kept 
in mason jars the larvae were raised in a mixture of ground corn 
grits and later placed in plastic dispensers that released them in 
batches of 60 
typically 240 larvae are placed on a corn plant but in some 
cases as many as 900 of the pests are let loose on one plant there 
are six to 10 plants in each of the more than 14000 test plots in 
ankeny and ames 
nothing escapes infestation says bud guthrie research 
leader at the ankeny corn insects research unit 
but researchers say there is no threat that a feeding frenzy of 
insects will be unleashed on farmers fields from the test plots 
the larvae cannot survive if they fall off the plant lee said 
they stay where you put them they never reach adult stage 
he says 
adult moths do not damage corn but lay eggs in fields that 
hatch and can decimate crops 
the corn borer causes damage when the first generation of larvae 
eats corn leaves and the second generation eats the protective 
sheath around the stalk at the time of pollination burrowing into 
the plant the damage weakens the plants and causes them to topple 
before the corn can be harvested 
first found in this country in 1917 the european corn borer was 
a seemingly unbeatable scourge in the 1930s entire fields were 
laid waste 
guthrie estimates that in iowa fields this past summer where 
corn typically is sown 25000 plants to an acre there was one 
borer for every other plant thats down from an average of eight a 
plant 40 years ago when fields were not so thick with corn 
development of hybrid corn strains and spraying has helped 
reduce the devastation but it still costs us farmers 400 
million a year in losses and control efforts the usda says in 
iowa the leading corn producing state the corn borer costs 
farmers about 100 million a year 
this summer in test plots near the laboratory corn with 
brittle stalks and leaves that looked like theyd been raked by 
shotgun fire stood beside plants that would have been at home in 
any healthy field 
even the highly susceptible plants look good compared with 
pictures of the crop devastation of the 1930s 
compared with the old times the entire acreage is 
resistant guthrie says 
this fall researchers are splitting each plant by hand 
measuring the tunnels produced by the insects 
scientists already have identified eight corn genes that resist 
leaf feeding by the first generation of larvae and seven genes that 
condition the corn plant to resist the second generation while 
those genes are not on the same chromosome says guthrie 
scientists know which of the 10 pairs of chromosome arms are 
involved with those genes 
the problem is each arm contains tens of thousands of genes 
using xray film and small amounts of radioactivity the 
scientists are looking at dna samples from each of the plants to 
detect genetic differences between the corn that resists borers and 
is susceptible to the pests 
dna or deoxyribonucleic acid is the basic building block of 
life it contains the genetic code and transmits the hereditary 
pattern for reproduction 
a technique known as restriction fragment length polymorphism 
is used to detect differences in the dna sequence among corn plants 
this is exactly the same technique as genetic fingerprinting 
what theyre trying to do with the prison population were trying 
to do with plants says lee 
once the genes are mapped the information can be used in 
selection programs for the development of corn seed companies 
could use the information to develop new hybrids a process that 
takes about five years 
the first thing we hope to establish is a more precise 
location of the genes lee says well know the location of the 
some of the genes next summer

market suspicion surrounding donald trumps 7 
billion offer for the parent of american airlines is misplaced and 
incorrect say some airline analysts and trump officials 
everybody that i speak to says that the street the financial 
community doesnt believe it but i think people should give 
trump more credit said samuel buttrick an analyst with 
kidder peabody amp co in new york 
nevertheless buttrick agreed with other analysts that 
skepticism over trumps intentions and general profittaking 
combined wednesday to drive down the price of amr corp stock by 
425 to close at 9712 the lowest level since the billionaires 
120pershare offer was revealed a week ago 
more than 26 million amr shares changed hands wednesday in 
composite trading on the new york stock exchange 
in midday trading today amr was up 175 a share at 9887 in 
fairly active dealings 
the wall street journal reported today that representatives of 
fort worth billionaire robert m bass were willing to help amr fend 
off trump group officials refused to discuss the report although 
bass has been mentioned from the first as a possible white 
knight 
the market may not believe it trump attorney jack nusbaum 
said wednesday but he has not sold his shares and doesnt plan 
to this is not a stock play 
officials of fort worthbased amr have refused to discuss the 
bid for the parent of the nations largest airline and nusbaum 
said there had been no meetings between the two sides 
until there is some visible action industry analyst david 
pizzimenti said the softness in amrs price is likely to continue 
i think that until you see some concrete kind of action by 
either party the stock will continue to trade at a discount 
to trumps offer said pizzimenti who works for nomura securities 
international inc in new york 
amr considered one of the nations bestrun carriers has said 
it will consider the offer in due course but gave no 
indication when it might respond 
there has been speculation that amr may seek a competing bid 
either from an employeemanagement group or a friendly buyer that 
it would push congress for quick legislation to require government 
review of airline takeovers or that it would restructure and pay a 
special dividend 
the senate commerce science and transportation committee has 
approved a bill giving the transportation secretary authority to 
review takeovers but the bill is not scheduled for debate a 
similar bill has been introduced in the house but is far from 
being adopted 
legislative concern has centered over the use of debt to finance 
the recent wave of airline takeovers fearing that maintenance 
might suffer while companies work to pay off debt 
while congress considers the legislation nusbaum said trump has 
received justice department clearance to pursue the offer under 
the hartscottrodino act the government must review the antitrust 
implications of certain transactions involving the acquisition of 
15 million worth of a company 
meanwhlie wednesday the airlines largest union said it had 
retained a financial consultant to advise it on any possible buyout 
ed koziatek vice president of the transport workers union said 
officials had had no contact with american officials but were 
seeking financial advice the union represents 33000 ground and 
support workers 
earlier the association of professional flight attendants said 
its officials were meeting with advisers and the allied pilots 
association is reported to have retained an adviser 
meanwhile one of amrs large institutional stockholders said it 
would hold onto its stock 
we think the riskreward is good at this point said gerald 
r smith senior vice president of aetna equity investors in 
hartford conn the worst case is that amr will do something to 
make the stock worth more than it was selling before offer we peg 
that in the low 90s the upside we dont think is limited to 120 
necessarily 
we knew that when the offer was made that there was going 
to be a bumpy road and the stock was going to fluctuate he said 
smith said aetna holds a substantial amount of amr stock but 
would not be specific 
another institutional investor the windsor fund said it sold 
its amr holdings recently cashing in on the higher prices since 
trumps bid

a ninefoottall male ostrich is a strange 
sight in the west texas oil fields especially when its trying to 
scare interlopers and attract females but to cooper campbell 
theres gold in them there quills 
careful he said handing a visitor an offwhite pebbly 
surfaced 3pound ostrich egg the size of a human babys head 
thats worth 1500 
if the egg is fertile and the embryo survives its 42day 
incubation and the chick survives the critical first three months 
the odds of everything going right are about 50 percent at best 
the 2foottall baby bird can command more than 5000 
a pair of fertile productive adults can bring 30000 to 
50000 
campbell is manager of the yellow rose ostrich ranch south of 
odessa part of a business taking its first steps in the united 
states 
potential profits attract ranchers all over the country 
especially in texas oklahoma and the pacific northwest although 
the hardy birds can be raised in almost every state and even above 
the arctic circle in canada 
just a few years ago ostriches in the united states could be 
found only in zoos and in the pastures of exoticanimal collectors 
now the us commercial ostrich population is 4000 to 8000 said 
tom mantzel executive director of the fort worthbased american 
ostrich association 
its growing growing growing at a phenomenal clip said 
mantzel who promotes the ostrich industry with preacher zeal 
about 500 ranchers belong to the organization threequarters of 
them in texas most of the rest are in oklahoma 
mantzel estimated the countrys adult ostrich population will 
have to reach at least 75000 before it makes economic sense to 
slaughter them for their hide feathers and meat until then which 
he estimates will be in the mid1990s the birds are more valuable 
as breeders 
the hide is used to make western boots belts other items of 
clothing and luggage the feathers are used in dusters south 
africans and europeans eat the meat which looks feels and tastes 
like beef and is low in cholesterol and fat 
ostriches are slaughtered at 12 to 14 months when they weigh 
about 300 pounds and carry about 80 pounds of meat the hide 
feathers and meat are worth 400 to 500 mantzel said 
ostrich ranchers are getting a boost from global politics since 
virtually all ostrich products come from south africa 
because of american economic sanctions aimed at protesting south 
africas apartheid racial segregation system us consumers cant 
buy ostrich hides directly from south africa and must buy treated 
skins from third countries 
mantzel believes american ostriches will mean big business and 
that americans will develop an appetite for the meat just as they 
have developed a taste for catfish and sushi 
americans already have developed a liking for ostrich leather 
highestgrade treated hide costs about 28 a square foot said joe 
lama buyer for the tony lama boot co in el paso 
the average ostrich will yield about five boots made from the 
bestlooking skin called full quill lama said about two pairs 
can be made from the birds lesserquality hide whose 
characteristic bumps are smaller and less prominent than in 
fullquill leather 
before a cowboy sticks his feet into a pair of ostrichskin 
boots though the bird has to hatch and grow up thats campbells 
business 
the laying season lasts from about march to october with hens 
laying an egg about every other day after 42 days in an incubator 
and hatchery the hatchling is ready sometimes getting a little 
human help to peck itself out of the eggshell which is about as 
thick as a nickel 
a hatchling weighs about 1 pounds and can stand up and walk 
almost immediately its gray feathers look and feel like coarse 
hair 
days after hatching chicks already can run they grow eight to 
10 inches a month during their first few months they can reproduce 
at about 2 to 3 years of age ostriches in the wild can live to be 
75 
because of their speed they have few predators 
they can sustain 35 to 40 miles an hour for five or six 
miles cooper said adding that lions and even cheetahs have 
trouble catching the birds in the wild and almost always go for 
something more attainable 
contrary to popular belief they dont stick their heads in the 
sand if theyre cornered or dont feel like running they can 
kick mantzel said the birds have been known to kick coyotes to 
death on the american range 
a 20acre tract of range can sustain 50 or 60 ostriches which 
forage and eat pellet feed 
i tell ranchers just set aside 1 percent of your land two 
or three acres and raise ostriches mantzel said i say 
instead of spending a dollar and a dime to make a dollar try 
something you can make a profit on someday it will be a barnyard 
industry like sheep cattle and goats

the nobel prize in physics was awarded 
today to two americans and a west german whose work led to the 
atomic clock used as an international standard the chemistry prize 
went to two americans for the discovery of surprising properties of 
the genetic material rna 
the physics award was given to norman f ramsey of harvard 
university for measurement techniques that led to the cesium atomic 
clock and to hans g dehmelt of the university of washington and 
wolfgang paul of west germany for a method to isolate single atoms 
and make exacting measurements of them 
the nobel prize in chemistry is shared by thomas cech 41 of 
the university of colorado and sidney altman 50 of yale 
university they showed independently in the 1970s and early 1980s 
that rna then thought to be merely a genetic messenger could 
rearrange itself and produce chemical reactions 
their discovery will probably provide a new tool for gene 
technology with potential to create a new defense against viral 
infections the swedish academy said 
half the physics prize will go to ramsey 74 the other half 
will be shared by the germanborn dehmelt 67 of the university of 
washington in seattle and paul 76 of the university of bonn 
all three of them have developed exact methods of measurement 
which has made it possible to conduct experiments that might force 
us to reconsider some basic physical laws especially regarding 
time and space said ingvar lindgren chairman of the awarding 
committee 
each nobel prize is worth 469000 
informed by the associated press that he had won the prize 
ramsey said are you sure in an interview he said it feels 
great im just delighted and im delighted with the people with 
whom im sharing the prize 
cech reached in boston said i am obviously excited about 
it it was something that everyone has been telling me would 
happen but i had no way of knowing when 
my main emotion is that this is a great thing for the 
university of colorado and the state of colorado he said this 
is not the sort of event that happens annually in the mountains the 
way it does in boston that gives me a really good feeling 
the canadianborn altman reached by telephone in new haven 
conn said im very happy im very grateful to all my 
colleagues and coworkers teachers and family 
ramsey developed a way to study the structure of atoms by 
exciting them to different energy levels using two oscillating 
electromagnetic fields 
that led to the development of the hydrogen maser a laserlike 
device that excites hydrogen atoms and provided the most detailed 
determination of their internal structure 
another application was the cesium atomic clock in which cesium 
atoms are excited to higher levels since 1967 the second has been 
defined as the time during which the cesium atom makes 
9192631770 oscillations 
i was really studying the fundamental properties of atoms and 
nuclei and it was apparent this was a very very stable 
clock ramsey said its a very valuable application it gets 
used in radio astronomy navigation satellite navigation many

dehmelt and paul were recognized for the development of the 
iontrap technique for separating single ions electrically 
charged atoms according to their weight the two developed 
similar techniques independently the swedish academy said 
cech and altman forced chemistry books to be rewritten when they 
showed independently that rna or ribonucleic acid could be a 
catalyst or trigger for chemical reactions 
the researchers found that rna has the rudimentary ability to 
reproduce itself suggesting that the first living things might 
have arisen from rna rather than dna or deoxyribonucleic acid the 
principal carrier of hereditary information in plants animals and 
bacteria 
when altman discovered in 1978 that rna was necessary for a 
catalytic reaction in the cell the discovery was met with 
disbelief and he could hardly believe it himself said bertil 
andersson a member of the academy 
four years later cech demonstrated that the rna molecule was not 
only necessary to the reaction but could trigger the reaction by 
itself without associated proteins that had been thought essential 
the academy said the discoveries of the two scientists may 
provide a method to destroy harmful rna molecules that cause 
infections such as the common cold 
cech born in chicago has been at the university of colorado in 
boulder since 1983 he received his doctorate from the university 
of california berkeley 
altman who was born in montreal earned his doctorate at the 
university of colorado studied at harvard and cambridge and moved 
to yale in 1971 
ramsey has been at harvard in cambridge mass since 1947

afternoons in the little village of golf are 
lulled by the soft hum of electric carts and the pleasant snap of a 
good tee shot 
not far beyond the back nine however the sounds change trees 
cracking under diesel bulldozers and hammers banging out another 
clubhouse 
these are the rhythms of golf in recent years reflecting a 
dramatic surge in the sports popularity that has spurred a boom in 
new golf courses and country clubstyle housing tracts around the 
nation led by sunbelt states such as florida texas and south 
carolina 
meanwhile tourism groups golf schools and clothing 
manufacturers are seeking a share of the 20 billion domestic 
industry 
the 32yearold community of golf homesteaded in lonely 
woodlands southwest of west palm beach as one of the nations first 
golforiented developments is now surrounded by new courses and 
billboards promising more 
now they call this area golf lane said john mosher manager 
of the 131home village that surrounds an 18hole course its 
like they cant build enough courses 
actually they may fall considerably short of demand the 
national golf foundation says 
the jupiter flabased trade group predicts nearly 4000 new 
courses may be necessary by the end of the century to accommodate 
the burgeoning number of players from hackers to tournament 
professionals 
thats about one every day from now on during the entire next 
decade said spokeswoman kit bradshaw who noted 320 new courses 
have been built since 1987 with about the same number either 
proposed or under construction 
an estimated 234 million golfers are whacking golf balls at 
about 13630 us courses an average of about 3700 golfers for 
every 18 holes and their ranks could reach between 30 million and 
40 million by the year 2000 at present growth rates in 1980 151 
million golfers played on 12800 courses 
florida which leads the nation with 932 courses is also no 1 
in planned new golf courses with 53 california new york and texas 
have more than 750 courses each 
the age of golf as the exclusive pastime of the rich ended in 
the 1960s as golfer arnold palmer rose from a modest background in 
pennsylvania to become a legend in the sport said john rooney a 
professor of geography at oklahoma state university and author of 
several books on sport and leisure 
thats when more bluecollar and factory workers started to 
play he said 
golf however ranks in the bottom half of the 20 most popular 
sports or activities the national sporting goods association 
reported in september 
swimming was enjoyed by 711 million people followed by 
exercise walking and bicycling 
but the golf foundation noted nearly half the players are 
younger than 40 years old with the average age 381 and may drop 
other sports as they age also less than a quarter of all us 
golfers are women and their numbers may grow in coming years 
baby boomers are moving into middle age and taking up a sport 
that isnt so physically demanding said thomas dorsel a sports 
psychologist at francis marion college in florence sc 
id also like to think that they are starting to recognize the 
almost philosophical aspect of the game golf parallels life in so 
many ways and it may appeal to people more when they enter a more 
philosophical stage of their life 
yet it still takes cash and a willingness to part with it to 
hit the links 
sales of clubs and balls have jumped 53 percent since 1984 to 
963 million last year according to the sporting goods 
association golf apparel manufacturers sold about 270 million in 
merchandise to retailers last year the sportswear manufacturers 
association reported 
hefty sums may also be paid to learn to swing the costly clubs 
money is not the question with many of our guests the 
objective is to learn the game of golf said fred griffin 
director of the 3yearold grand cypress academy of golf in orlando 
for up to 3000 for a fiveday stay students have access to a 
medical team including a psychologist optics and muscle experts 
and an orthopedic surgeon on a special practice tee a 
computerized video unit analyzes golf swings for flaws 
the system records the students swing then superimposes a 
computer graphics model of the stroke of a famous professional 
golfer such as jack nicklaus or palmer 
its the only one like it said griffin its things like 
this that people are willing to pay for 
courses too are now making special efforts to attract 
outoftown golfers who spent about 78 billion last year on 
travel and lodging 
consortiums of courses in areas such as myrtle beach sc 
arizona and the great smoky mountains now offer charter golf 
vacations some tours even provide putting greens at the airport 
other tours are specifically aimed at the estimated 136 million 
japanese golfers who often pay dearly for a membership to one of 
that nations 1600 courses 
in europe a golf summit earlier this month in west germany 
examined the growing crowds at courses from spain to sweden canada 
is scheduled to hold its first golf conference in december in 
toronto 
were already seeing what happens when there are too many 
golfers and too few courses said ms bradshaw 
despite forecasts of continued growth she warned the us golf 
boom could be suffocated by the early 1990s unless more municipal 
courses are built 
if it starts taking six hours to play a round because of 
overcrowded courses thats when people are just going to say 
forget it and put away their clubs

northwest airlines today announced a 27 billion 
order for boeing jets in a deal that could involve 90 planes and 
reach 52 billion if the airline exercises all its purchase 
options 
northwest in a statement from minneapolis said the order was a 
testament to the new ownerships and new managements commitment 
to the people of the northwest and the growth of the company 
the order was for six boeing 747400s the worlds largst 
passenger jet and 40 757200s a shorterrange highly fuel 
efficient twin jet 
in addition to those firm orders northwest took options on four 
additional 747400s and another 40 757200s 
chris longridge vice president of sales at boeing commercial 
airplanes said the show of confidence in boeing which has been 
hit with a strike by production workers was appreciated 
boeing is happy with the good relationship our companies have 
enjoyed over the years and we look forward to working closely with 
northwests new management to further strengthen those ties 
longridge said 
the planes to be delivered from late 1993 through 1998 will be 
powered by pratt amp whitney engines 
striking boeing workers who had heard reports of northwests 
impending order said the news bolstered their contention that 
boeing can afford a better wage and benefit offer 
it doesnt change anything said matt bates of the 
international association of machinists and aerospace workers 
when youve got an 80 billion backlog it just underscores 
our position 
striking machinists say five consecutive years of record orders 
for the worlds largest aircraft manufacturer should result in 
employees getting a bigger chunk of the gains 
the companys order backlog stretches into the late 1990s 
orders before the walkout amounted to 736 jets worth 385 billion 
this year 
the northwest order was not the first placed during the strike 
by the machinists who represent 57800 boeing workers 
approximately 43300 of the workers are in seattle and its suburbs 
another 12000 or so are in wichita kan 1700 are in portland 
ore and a few hundred others are at sites in several other states 
cathay pacific airways ltd of hong kong said this week it has 
placed orders for two boeing 747400 freighters and secured options 
for two additional models in a transaction valued at about 600 
million 
last friday company officials announced an order by evergreen 
airways corp of taiwan for four 747400s and two extendedrange 
767300ers and options for a like number of the same planes worth 
as much as 193 billion 
four planes have been delivered since the strike began oct 4 
no talks had been scheduled federal mediator doug hammond said 
wednesday 
boeings threeyear offer to the machinists featured wage hikes 
of 4 percent 3 percent and 3 percent bonuses of 8 percent of 
gross pay this year and 3 percent in 1990 a costofliving clause 
to virtually match inflation a reduction in mandatory overtime and 
increases in some benefits 
another 28000 boeing workers start contract talks on monday 
they are members of the companys secondlargest union the seattle 
professional engineering employees association roughly 95 percent 
of them work in the puget sound area with the rest in portland and 
at air force bases and other government installations in 
california florida and utah said dan mahoney general counsel 
mahoney predicted the talks covering engineers and technical 
workers would have little effect on or be much affected by the 
machinists strike he said the two unions coordinated strategies 
in recent years but this year the machinists decided not to 
the contract for engineers and technical workers whose work 
includes designing drawing drafting and testing expires dec 1 
but the earliest they could possibly strike would be sometime in 
january mahoney said they have never struck and nobodys 
interested in a strike he said 
boeing spokesman harold carr said boeing officials hoped to have 
a settlement in the machinists strike by dec 1 
the last walkout by the machinists lasted 45 days in 1977 
ending a couple weeks before the associations contract expired 
but had little effect on the smaller unions negotiations mahoney 
said 
speea engineers want a 14 percent increase in the first six 
months 5 percent in the second six months followed by 4 percent 
in each subsequent sixmonth period of a threeyear contract 
technical employees want 14 percent the first six months and 2 
percent every six months thereafter for the rest of the contract 
both want quarterly costofliving adjustments and an unspecified 
lump sum bonus 
to go on strike mahoney said his group would first have to 
reject a contract by a simple majority then approve a walkout by 
at least twothirds both on mail ballots taking at least two weeks 
each to conduct 
a walkout would mean design and development work would grind to 
a halt and a return to production with the return of the 
machinists would be much slower he said 
engineers and technical workers bound by a nostrike clause 
have been crossing the machinists picket lines while refusing to 
do work normally done by the strikers

in a reversal of an electronics trend 
philips consumer electronics co on thursdasy began shipping 
americanmade television sets to japan 
philips plans to export 1500 tabletop sets to the land of the 
rising sun this year with significantly increasing exports 
projected for the 1990s the company said in a statement 
philips president and chief executive donald f johnstone called 
the shipment a significant first step in gaining a muchneeded 
equilibrium in the balance of trade between the us and foreign 
nations particularly japan 
the 27inch sets were specially designed following an intensive 
study of japanese consumers they have special colors and exterior 
finishes that proved appealing to japanese buyers 
they like complexity and features said al rodgers 
director of international marketing adding that simplicity in 
using the product also is important to the japanese consumer 
rodgers said the sets will be marketed to upscale japanese 
consumers the same purchaser who buys a mercedes benz imported 
from germany 
the sets will be sold as products of philips international 
rather than as americanmade sets but with control buttons in 
english the fact that the sets are americanmade will not be 
hidden rodgers said 
the sets were manufactured at the philips greenville plant 
which employs 4800 people 
in addition to these directview sets philips plans to 
manufacture projection tvs for export in 1990 and 1991

the machinists union at united airlines has asked 
the labor department to block the proposed employee buyout of the 
airlines parent company claiming it violates laws governing the 
use of retirement funds 
in a threepage letter sent wednesday to labor secretary 
elizabeth dole the union charged that the tax benefits of the 
proposed 675 billion buyout are effectively subsidizing a 
substantial and excessive windfall to ual corps management and 
uniteds pilots the employee group spearheading the takeover 
effort 
on tuesday uniteds pilots voted overwhelmingly to commit 200 
million from their 12 billion pension fund to buy preferred stock 
in an employee stock ownership plan 
the banks financing the deal wanted to see such a commitment 
before providing financing for the takeover 
a group led by the pilots and uals management with the 
participation of british airways plc has offered to buy the 
chicagobased company for 300 a share in a tender offer that 
expires oct 26 
the pilots are the only ual employee group so far committed to 
participating in the buyout the machinists previously declared 
their opposition to the plan and uniteds flight attendants are 
continuing to negotiate with uals management on contract 
concessions in exchange for partial ownership of the company 
the deal also is being examined by the transportation 
department which has expressed concern about leveraged buyouts 
and foreign stakes in us airlines

us officials pressed japan on thursday to open 
its markets wider to us businesses with trade representative 
carla hills calling for measures to aid entry of construction 
companies supercomputers and telecommunications satellites 
meanwhile deputy secretary of the treasury john e robson told 
a private business conference that us companies were becoming 
more competitive at home and abroad but still faced difficult trade 
and investment barriers in japan 
mrs hills in a luncheon meeting with construction minister 
shozo harada asked japan to continue working to open the domestic 
construction market a construction ministry official said 
she also urged japan to increase penalties for companies caught 
rigging bids for construction projects said the official speaking 
on condition of anonymity 
last month the us government said it was seeking at least 
357 million in compensation from 145 japanese construction 
companies for alleged price fixing on projects at a us military 
base 
harada replied that bidrigging is illegal in japan and 
authorities have taken appropriate measures japan bars violating 
firms from participation in public projects for up to nine months 
the ministry official said 
mrs hills singled out supercomputers and telecommunications 
satellites in talks thursday evening with foreign minister taro 
nakayama a foreign ministry official said 
nakayama said japans policy of favoring japanese manufacture 
was meant to develop the nations technology rather than as a 
scheme to establish a domestic industry the official said 
mrs hills replied that the united states had no objections to 
japan carrying out research and development but if that led to 
closing out foreign products it would be opposed the official said 
mrs hills arrived in tokyo on thursday after visiting south 
korea later in her fourday stay she was to confer with prime 
minister toshiki kaifu minister of international trade and 
industry hikaru matsunaga and other japanese leaders 
robson and other senior us officials in japan for the business 
conference urged japan to show results soon in lifting structural 
market barriers or risk stronger protectionist legislation from 
congress such barriers are the subject of ongoing trade talks 
between the two sides 
our objective is to make significant progress in the 
discussions before next spring robson told reporters we 
believe the risks in failing to make significant progress may be 
considerable 
increased competitiveness will do little to boost american 
exports to and investment in japan if markets remain closed to 
foreign investors he said 
robson said accusations that american corporate management is 
too shortsighted emphasizing shortterm profits over longerterm 
planning ignored that many businesses do plan for the future 
energetic merger and acquisition activity in the united states 
another factor often blamed for shortterm planning and instability 
in american businesses does not have an entirely negative impact 
on us competitiveness robson said 
many of these transactions have resulted in a new corporate 
strategic focus beneficial to competitiveness he said 
increased spending for onthejob training and retraining and 
cooperation with public sector education also are enhancing 
american competitiveness robson said 
he said the us government was taking seriously japanese 
complaints raised in the trade talks that inadequate education a 
low personal savings rate and the huge federal budget deficit 
estimated at 1551 billion us dollars in fiscal 1988 were 
significant contributors to the us trade imbalance with japan 
the overall us trade deficit was estimated at 1198 billion 
last year down from 1712 billion in 1987 according to us 
figures it suffered a 52 billion deficit with japan

with floppy ears flaccid faces and fat 
stomachs the beauty of chinese swine is in the eyes of their 
scientistbeholders who see them as a key to breeding efficient 
super pigs of the future 
us researchers hope to unlock the secret of large litters from 
these porkers of the orient and incorporate that trait into 
domestic hogs it would be an important breakthrough for 
scientists who already have bred hogs that grow faster and produce 
leaner meat 
litter size hasnt changed much in 30 years but were nowhere 
near the limit said david mclaren a university of illinois 
animal scientist and member of the research team 
the brown meishan and fengjing sows wean about 15 pigs and the 
black minzhu nearly that number about twice as many as most us 
sows 
scientists will try to determine exactly why these chinese pigs 
have such large litters then they hope to use conventional 
breeding or genetic engineering to give us pigs more offspring 
they hope the result will be available to commercial producers 
in five to 10 years increasing the number of weaned pigs to 11 per 
sow would save us pork producers about 78 million a year through 
lower production costs university scientists say 
for example illinois sows now wean about eight pigs per litter 
if chinese pigs could be used to produce a new sow that could wean 
11 pigs researchers estimate pork producers costs would drop 
about 9 a hog 
this is not like going down to your friendly local breeder 
and buying a boar said robert easter an animal nutritionist and 
member of the research team this is something new 
the 47 chinese pigs here are among 140 purchased from china and 
imported in march after more than six years of battling bureacratic 
obstacles 
the pigs cost 11000 each including delivery and the expense 
was shared by the university of illinois iowa state university and 
the federal government some of the pigs are at iowa state and at 
the us department of agriculture livestock research station in 
nebraska 
the chinese pigs at the university of illinois share quarters 
with sleek white us yorkshire hogs in the schools new 
2million stateoftheart swine research facility that includes 
a solar heating system but that is all the pigs have in common 
the yorkshires are as solid as the chinese pigs are flabby they 
thrash about and squeal loudly for food while the chinese pigs are 
quiet 
these chinese pigs are so docile and nonaggressive theyll 
work out the pecking order with the us pigs in a short time 
mclaren said 
us pigs which grow quickly are bred for meat production and 
the yorkshires are known for heavy muscle big pork chops and 
hams the chinese pigs mature slowly and are too fat for domestic 
meat standards 
chinese pigs also are nearly blind because the wrinkles of 
their faces cover their eyes 
scientists are breeding the chinese pigs to each other to 
increase the number of animals to work with the first chinese pigs 
should be born here in january then the chinese will be 
crossbred with yorkshires 
scientists from 13 disciplines will study every aspect of the 
chinese pigs including what food makes them grow the fastest and 
leanest and whether growthenhancers will help 
were talking about turning out an animal thats the pig of 
the future said easter

million or 10 cents per share in the third quarter from the sale 
of the bottled water business the company said 
another aftertax gain 530 million or 153 per common share 
is expected to be added to fourth quarter earnings because of the 
sale of cocacolas 538 million shares of columbia pictures 
entertainment inc to sony corp company officials said the 
cocacola board approved the sale oct 2 
chairman roberto c goizueta said thirdquarter earnings also 
were helped by an 8 percent increase in worldwide sales of soft 
drink syrups and concentrates international syrup sales were up 14 
percent but domestic sales of syrups and concentrates was down 2 
percent during the three months ended sept 30 he said 
case sales of soft drinks in the united states were about the 
same as the previous year

brands reported a 25 percent increase in chilled orange juice 
volume but a 33 percent decline in frozen orange juice volume for 
the quarter

a season without alar has taken its 
toll on mcintosh apples the crisp and tangy mainstay of new 
englands fall crop forcing some growers to begin the lengthy 
process of switching to hardier varieties 
agriculture officials say some growers are being forced out 
because they cant afford to wait the five to seven years it can 
take for new trees to produce 
they cant just change over orchards said john odonnell 
marketing director of the new york amp new england apple institute 
i know some growers that have tossed their hands up in the air 
and said theyre done theyre not going to continue said frank 
carlson coowner of carlsons orchards inc a 150acre concern in 
harvard 
growers are marketing a greener mcintosh apple and trying to 
convert bruised fruit into apple juice sauce and cider said 
agriculture commissioner august schumacher jr a new trend may be 
the brewing of alcoholic hard cider he said 
the mcintosh crop was down this year except in vermont with 
the yield estimated at 71 million bushels instead of the projected 
83 million according to figures from the regional apple institute 
the growthretardant alar keeps apples on the tree longer 
producing redder fruit with a longer shelf life it voluntarily was 
taken off the market earlier this year after a private consumer 
group said eating apples treated with the chemical increased cancer 
risk in children 
the apple industry and federal environmental protection agency 
and the food and drug administration disputed the report as an 
exaggeration of the risk and the epa has proposed new standards 
for use of the chemical 
alar was just one of the factors in the reduced new england 
mcintosh crop and the problem of apples dropping before they could 
be picked was not as bad as had been expected said wesley autio 
assistant professor of pomology the study of fruitgrowing at the 
university of massachusetts 
but the loss of alar is hard on mcintosh apples because they are 
a tender variety more prone to dropping 
new england and new york account for 65 percent of the national 
mcintosh crop odonnell said overall new england apples account 
for 3 percent to 5 percent of the total national crop 
autio said growers appear to be ready to plant different 
varieties such as empire cortland and macoun and wait out the 
production lag 
i think that theyve had three to four years now to come to 
terms with it he said 
autio said he expects mcintosh eventually will account for about 
40 percent of the regions crop compared with the current 55 
percent 
elsewhere in the nation apples appear to be bearing up without 
alar said maureen miklavic spokeswoman for the international 
apple institute based in mclean virginia 
red stayman grown in virginia and pennsylvania and winesap 
apples grown in the western states are cracking without alar 
beyond that we really dont see any other difficulties she 
said 
schumacher said growers are hoping for higher prices in november 
to offset losses he said hes optimistic the mcintosh wont fade 
away 
its a great apple and we hope that farmers will continue to 
grow it but cultural practices may have to change and some 
farmers may want to put in other varieties schumacher said

plant pathologists have discovered a 
previously unknown virus in floridas tomato crop but say they 
dont have enough information about it to predict the impact on the 
states vegetable industry 
its a new virus for most of us said george n agrios 
chairman of university of floridas department of plant technology 
since we really need to study the virus we have no 
recommendation on what to do about it 
tomatoes comprise about onethird of all vegetables grown in 
florida last year growers shipped to market 6487 million 25pound 
cartons valued at more than 600 million 
with an estimated 54000 acres planted in tomatoes florida 
produces much of the winter domestic crop sold november through may 
with no way now to defend against the stillunnamed virus 
researchers plan simply to learn what they can about its behavior 
researchers said the suspected virus is similar to one that has 
stunted plant grown and reduced the quantity of tomatoes produced 
in mexico symptons include green and gold mottled leaves leaf

continued weakness in the market for highyield 
junk bonds is casting doubt on prospects for 11 billion worth 
of new securities companies plan to issue by year end market 
players said thursday 
hotel giant ramada inc on wednesday postponed indefinitely a 
400 million bond issue and traders expect more cancellations in a 
market wracked since retailer campeau corp had to get a 250 
million loan to meet its junk bond obligations in september 
the junk bond market has not collapsed but its done a pretty 
good impression of it in the last month said tom fendrich a 
managing director at standard amp poors corp 
prices of the highyield debt securities which frequently are 
used to raise money for small or mediumsized businesses with slim 
credit histories dropped again on thursday issues were down on 
average about 1 point or 10 for every 1000 in face amount 
moodys investors service incs index of prices of 24 
highyield bond funds is down 33 percent in net asset value since 
sept 12 shortly before campeaus financial problems sent the junk 
market into a tailspin 
in the same period the stock market rose 22 percent based on 
the wilshire associates index of 5000 stocks and longerterm us 
treasury bonds gained about 04 percent 
a sustained decline in junk bonds which offer high yields to 
investors to compensate for companies poor credit ratings could 
discourage use of the highcost debt that could crimp companies 
plans for junkfinanced expansions acquisitions or restructurings 
traders said the junk bond markets weakness has extended in 
recent days to include securities of some companies normally seen 
as stable 
bond prices of duracell inc lost about 1 points wednesday and 
thursday harcourt brace jovanovich inc bonds have declined four 
points this week as investors were discouraged by a 
lowerthanexpected sale price for its sea world theme parks 
supermarkets general corp which owns pathmark grocery stores 
also has been under selling pressure in recent days for 
apparently no reason said a trader at a major firm who asked not 
to be named 
these bonds objectively should not be that cheap the trader 
said i think its a marketplace where people are nervous and 
they would rather have a small loss today than a nasty surprise a 
year from now 
meantime a total of about 11 billion in new offerings from 
companies including continental airlines blockbuster 
entertainment grand union and cnw corps chicago amp north western 
railroad are scheduled to occur by the end of the year 
traders expect some of the issues to be hard sells and others to 
be delayed like the ramada offering or canceled outright like a 
475 million offering by ohio mattress co was last month 
people are being very selective because they can afford to be 
selective said jim lewis a highyield bond trader at 
prudentialbache securities inc theres a lot more paper coming 
out right now youll probably see several more postponements or 
cancellations 
drexel burnham lambert inc the leader in junk bond 
underwriting estimates that only 6 billion to 7 billion of the 
planned offerings will be completed 
but the firm also said 11 billion in existing bonds will leave 
the market because of redemptions refinancings and other bond 
buyback programs which should help boost the market for the new 
issues 
not all new issues are struggling investors snapped up 550 
million in new drexelunderwritten debentures by turner 
broadcasting inc this week and cnws 475 million issue by 
donaldson lufkin amp jenrette securities corp next week is expected 
to stimulate demand 
also with the price declines junk bond yields are as high as 
14 percent the spread between returns on highyield and 
treasury bonds was 59 percentage points on thursday compared with 
4 percentage points in january 
but with the continued shakeout in the 200 billion junk bond 
market by all accounts its longest and most severe ever 
investors are maintaining their cash positions and not buying new 
junk 
at this point we are reluctant to draw down our reserve 
levels said steven norwitz a spokesman for t rowe price 
associates inc in baltimore which has over 1 billion in 
junkbond assets 
our view is the market still really hasnt stabilized he 
said

ford motor co has formed a holding company to 
dull the potential tax sting of its pending acquisition of the 
associates financial concern the automaker said thursday 
the value of the move cant be determined precisely but an 
analyst says it may be worth millions to the nations most 
profitable automaker 
the creation of ford holdings inc and the sale of 25 percent of 
it for 800 million to institutional investors should deflect some 
of the taxes related to fords acquisition of the associates corp 
finance company ford officials said 
in a complicated procedure involving seldomused provisions of 
the 1986 tax law and foreign tax credits ford is avoiding the 
potential taxes by owning less than 80 percent of the holding 
company compared with owning it outright 
the net effect for us is that unless we form ford holdings or 
a similar company the effective tax bill for associates earnings 
would go up said assistant ford treasurer malcolm macdonald 
neither he nor george brown executive director of ford 
financial services would estimate how much savings may be realized 
it could be literally millions said charles bee national 
director for international tax issues at the seidman amp seidman 
accounting firm in new york the spectre of losing millions of 
dollars in potential tax revenues may kick congress into action he 
added 
i think congress will look again at this area because there 
are probably so many dollars involved bee said 
he said there has been talk for months about the procedure ford 
is using but as far as he knows no large corporation has tried it 
so far 
if a lot of companies did this theres no way we can balance 
our books he said 
the holding company would include fords american road insurance 
co us leasing ford motor land development and ford leasing 
development co in addition to associates it would not include 
ford motor credit corp or first nationwide financial corp two of 
fords largest financial subsidiaries 
the stock sale should be completed by the end of the month the 
same time fords acquisition of associates from paramount 
communications inc is expected to be completed macdonald and 
brown said 
the cash we are raising through the sale will be paid to 
paramount as part of the associates acquisition mcdonald said 
the associates founded in 1918 and acquired by paramount 21 
years ago is the nations thirdlargest independent finance 
company it has assets close to 14 billion 
it was fords largest financial acquisition the company took 
over the san franciscobased first nationwide in 1985 and doubled 
its size last year through the takeover of a number of savings and 
loan institutions 
those acquisitions made first nationwide the secondlargest 
savings and loan association at the end of 1988 the latest figures 
available the largest is home savings of america held by hf

the dollar fell in subdued dealings thursday as 
traders awaited the release of fresh economic data 
gold prices rose worldwide 
on the commodity exchange in new york gold bullion for current 
delivery closed at 36340 a troy ounce up 140 from wednesday 
republic national bank of new york quoted a late bid for gold at 
363 an ounce 150 higher than wednesdays late bid 
many traders stayed on the sidelines while awaiting the 
governments release friday of retail sales and producer prices 
data for september 
if the producer price index comes in on the high side the 
federal reserve wont have room to ease interest rates any 
further said bob morrissey a senior trader at the bank of 
bostons new york office 
while the fed is concerned about the level of the dollar 
their major priority is to keep inflation down he added 
foreign exchange dealers said the dollar was undermined by 
speculation that the fed was considering a cut in the discount 
rate its interest charge on loans to member banks lower interest 
rates make us investments less attractive to foreigners thereby 
diminishing their need for dollars 
stephen flanagan a vice president at manufacturers hanover 
trust co said that despite the fact that the dollar is holding to 
key levels the us currency is likely to come under pressure 
because interest rate differentials have narrowed considerably 
us interest rates currently are about 25 percent higher than 
those in japan he said 
and historically as it gets under 3 percent the dollar comes 
under pressure flanagan said adding that earlier this year the 
spread was as high as 5 percent which had kept the underlying 
support of the dollar all year 
separately the british pound got a boost from comments by 
chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson who told the governing 
conservative partys annual conference he would continue to fight 
inflation with high interest rates for as long as necessary

the european community and the united 
states reached tentative agreement on a new accord increasing 
slightly the european share of the american steel market the 
trading bloc announced thursday 
the european commission the communitys executive body said 
the european share would rise from 668 percent to 7 percent under 
the new arrangement which will remain in effect until march 31 
1992 
the accord which still must be approved by the 12 nations of 
the european community means european producers could increase 
exports to the united states by almost 300000 metric tons 
the trading bloc exported 59 million metric tons of steel 
products to the united states in 1988 
frans andriessen the communitys top trading official told 
members of the european parliament the results are not 
unsatisfactory but we are bound to see it with mixed feelings 
there was no need for an agreement objectively speaking 
it was unnecessary he said 
the arrangement stems from a decision in july by president bush 
to extend steel import quotas which were first put in place in 
1984 they had been set to expire on sept 30 
the restrictions set annual limits on the amount of steel that 
can be brought into the united states from 29 countries including 
those of the european community japan south korea and brazil 
the european commission said the new agreement covered the same 
steel products and that some terms of the arrangement were 
improved particularly for the export of goods in short supply in 
the united states 
it said the 30month extension of the us restrictions was a 
credible step toward the liberalization of the steel trade 
in strasbourg france the european parliament the communitys 
legislative body said it regretted the new agreement limiting 
european sales in light of the improvement in the american steel 
industry it said the accord could complicate international trade 
talks for a broader steel pact 
the us quotas were first imposed at a time the american steel 
industry was suffering heavy losses steelmakers complained they 
were hurt by foreign producers who were helped by big government 
subsidies and import restrictions 
they say they have benefited from the quotas but argue they 
still need more time to modernize their operations

traded when levitt took over in 1978 to 994 million shares last 
year but the number of companies traded has fallen from 1004 to

try to add to a climate of economic growth and capital 
formation and help midsized companies develop capital and

i think there are a lot midsized companies that are either 
unfamiliar or unsure of themselves in both markets he said

be very helpful as we move into this global marketplace and find a 
niche for the amex

frozen porkbelly futures prices soared the permitted 
2centsapound daily limit thursday on the chicago mercantile 
exchange thursday amid growing supply fears rooted in the 
governments decision to ship pork bellies to poland 
on other commodity markets copper and precious metals futures 
advanced grains and soybeans were mixed and energy futures were 
mostly higher 
frozen pork bellies futures settled 2 cents higher across the 
board with the contract for delivery in february at 4972 cents a 
pound 
the rally followed a surge of buying on wednesday and may 
reflect the markets uneasiness about the governments plan to ship 
10 million worth of us pork bellies to poland as part of a 
foodaid package 
pork bellies are the part of a pig from which bacon is made 
with stocks of frozen pork bellies at historically high levels 
supply tightness would seem to be low on the markets list of 
concerns 
but under the rules of the futures market only bellies frozen 
after nov 1 are deliverable against any of the futures contracts 
currently trading and some of the surplus bellies produced this 
winter perhaps as much as 15 million pounds worth are destined 
to be sent to poland instead of being packed away in commercial 
freezers for domestic use later on 
traders fear that the large stockpile of bellies currently in 
freezers may be too old to guarantee their quality if they were to 
be shipped to poland but the government has not yet decided on the 
specifications for the polish shipment 
the longer the government delays in outlining the 
specifications of the product that has to go to poland the more 
uncertain the situation becomes and the more nervous the 
futures market becomes said chuck levitt senior livestock 
analyst with shearson lehman hutton inc in chicago 
in livestock trading on the chicago merc live cattle futures 
settled 20 cent lower to 07 cent higher with october at 73 cents 
a pound feeder cattle were 05 cent lower to 42 cent higher with 
october at 8310 cents a pound live hogs were 10 cent lower to 
105 cent higher with october at 4867 cents a pound 
copper futures rose on new yorks commodity exchange after the 
arizonabased copper producer magma copper co announced it was 
forced to cancel some shipments due to equipment problems 
copper settled 12 cents to 145 cents higher with december at 
13035 a pound 
in preciousmetals trading on the commodity exchange gold 
settled 130 to 150 higher with october at 36340 a troy ounce 
silver was 1 cent to 14 cents higher with december at 5153 a 
troy ounce 
grain and soybean futures ended narrowly mixed on the chicago 
board of trade ahead of the agriculture departments 
eagerlyawaited monthly crop report 
the report which was released after the close estimated the 
1989 us corn crop at 745 billion bushels up 2 percent from last 
months projection of projection of 732 billion bushels and 51 
percent higher than the droughtshriveled 1988 crop of 492 billion 
bushels 
the usda estimated the 1989 us soybean crop at 193 billion 
bushels up 2 percent from last months projection of 189 billion 
and 24 percent larger than last years harvest of 154 billion 
and the usda estimated total 1989 us wheat production at 204 
billion bushels up 13 percent from last year but 1 percent below 
the september forecast of 206 billion bushels 
the corn and soybean numbers were above market expectations and 
analysts said the report may send corn and soybean futures prices 
moderately lower at fridays opening 
wheat futures were expected to open slightly higher friday in 
response to the report 
wheat futures settled 2 cents to 2 cents higher with december 
at 406 a bushel corn futures were 1 cents lower to cent 
higher with december at 235 a bushel oats were unchanged to

two major insurance companies agreed 
thursday to pay 500000 each and testify in texas antitrust 
lawsuit against other of the nations largest insurers attorney 
general jim mattox said 
mattox said travelers insurance co and st paul fire and marine 
insurance co also agreed to stop certain industry activities in a 
settlement agreement signed by state district judge pete lowry of 
austin 
in the agreements both companies denied any wrongdoing or 
liability the pacts say each 500000 payment is for investigative 
and legal costs and does not represent a fine or penalty 
in essence these companies have entered a nolo contendere no 
contest plea and have agreed to testify for the state as the 
lawsuit continues against the other defendants mattox said 
the state accuses the insurance industry of seeking to create a 
phony insurance crisis several years ago in which insurers 
claimed that an increase in lawsuits was forcing them out of the 
commercial liability field 
mattox in march 1988 sued eight major insurance companies and 
other insurance groups accusing them of illegally conspiring to 
boycott coerce and intimidate insurance consumers in order to 
drive up rates cut back coverage and create a false insurance 
crisis in the commercial liability field 
several other states joined a similar suit filed in federal 
court in california 
we fully intend to proceed with our legal action against all 
these other defendants as a prosecutor i can explain it to you 
like this sometimes you cut a deal with one member of a gang in 
order to put the entire gang out of business he said 
we are asking the court to set us a trial date as soon as 
possible for the rest of the defendants mattox said 
the states lawsuit seeks civil penalties and restitution for 
consumers 
the civil penalties could range up to 1 million for each 
violation of the states antitrust law by corporate defendants and 
up to 100000 for each violation by individuals 
spokesmen for both travelers and st paul fire and marine said 
their companies believe they would have won but decided to settle 
because of the costs involved 
we look at this as a very costeffective way for the company 
to avoid further legal expense a lot of inconvenience and a lot of 
burden on our shareholders said st paul spokeswoman suzi hagen 
we feel confident that if it would have gone to its 
conclusion there would have been a ruling in our favor but the 
costs of doing this would have far outdistanced the benefits we 
would have been getting said travelers spokesman dan kaferle 
mattox recalled a television advertising campaign in which the 
insurance industry contended that the crisis would hinder 
everything from high school football games to fire protection 
when his suit was filed mattox charged the insurance industry 
with the most insidious consumer fraud perpetrated upon the 
american public in decades 
mattoxs investigation began with a letter from the austin 
suburb of westlake hills which was notified in 1985 that its 
liability coverage was being canceled 
after years with the same liability carriers westlakes 
coverage was suddenly canceled despite the fact that the city had 
only one minor claim since becoming a city in 1953 he said

900 million to its cushion against possible loan losses resulting 
in an 8246 million thirdquarter loss for the nations fifth 
largest bank holding company 
also on thursday bank of new york co announced a 600 million 
increase in its allowance to cover potentially bad loans the 
provision caused bank of new york to post a loss of 2713 million 
in the third quarter 
chemical and bank of new york joined a lengthening list of big 
us banks that recently have bolstered their protection against 
losses amid a widespread perception that economic and political 
difficulties in the third world might make it impossible for 
countries to repay their debts 
chase manhattan corp jp morgan amp co and manufacturers 
hanover corp were among the nations major moneycenter banks that 
previously announced they were substantially boosting their 
loanloss reserves 
chemical said in a news release that it has made a special 600 
million provision to its reserve for losses on loans to countries 
engaged in debt rescheduling negotiations chemicals allowance for 
losses on loans to troubled third world debtors has grown to 184 
billion on account of the addition 
another 300 million was set aside to cover possible losses on 
nonperforming loans at texas commerce bancshares inc a chemical 
subsidiary chemical has been trying to weed out shaky loans at 
texas commerce bancshares since acquiring it in 1987 
the federallyassisted bailout and recapitalization of numerous 
texas banks has weighed down the states real estate market by 
making the 300 million provision chemical was attempting to 
insulate future earnings from expected losses on the disposal of 
nonperforming texas commerce bancshares loans 
in a move aimed at enhancing its equity capital position 
chemical also announced plans to issue 500 million in common 
stock chemical said it soon would file a registration statement 
with the securities and exchange commission 
chemicals loss for the quarter ended sept 30 came to 1289 a 
share in 1988s third quarter chemical earned 2119 million or 
343 a share a period in which results benefited from several 
nonrecurring gains 
chemical lost 5781 million or 975 a share in the first 
nine months of 1989 compared to aftertax income of 4651 million 
or 736 a share in the corresponding 1988 period 
bank of new york said its loss for the quarter ended sept 30 
which came to 410 a share compared with income of 542 million 
or 151 a share a year earlier 
but without the special addition to its loan loss allowance 
bank of new york would have earned 1187 million or 160 a share 
on a fully diluted basis in the quarter 
j carter bacot bank of new yorks chairman and chief executive 
officer said 400 million of the special addition was designated 
to cover loans to third world countries and the remainder was set 
aside for other unspecified loans 
our decision was prompted by recent developments regarding 
lesser developed country debt negotiations and is consistent with 
our policy of maintaining appropriate reserves for the entire loan 
portfolio bacot said in a news release 
bank of new york said its provision for ldc loans now stands at 
9386 million out of a total loanloss allowance of 152 billion 
the banks earnings meanwhile were said to be strong the bank 
benefited from cost savings related to its 14 billion acquisition 
of irving trust co completed in december of last year revenue 
growth from securities processing operations also contributed to 
third quarter results 
for the nine months ended sept 30 bank of new york reported a 
loss of 559 million or 118 per share compared to the prior 
years income of 1583 million or 452 a share 
excluding the special addition ninemonth earnings would have 
been 3341 million or 452 a share fully diluted which 
includes common stock and equivalents 
bank of new york said it expects to post a profit for all of 
this year

the largest aircraft deal in northwest airlines 
history 52 billion in orders and options for boeing jets was 
good news thursday to striking production workers as well as to 
company officials 
chris longridge vice president of sales at boeing commercial 
airplanes said the show of confidence on the ninth day of a strike 
by the international association of machinists and aerospace 
workers was appreciated 
boeing is happy with the good relationship our companies have 
enjoyed over the years and we look forward to working closely with 
northwests new management to further strengthen those ties 
longridge said 
striking machinists saw the order as more evidence that theyre 
needed 
its wonderful it means well have more work for a long time 
to come said jack daniels communications director of machinists 
district lodge 751 but you cant get paid for it until you build 
them 
a statement issued by northwest in minneapolis called the order 
a testament to the new ownerships and new managements 
commitment to the people of the northwest and the growth of the 
company 
northwest ordered six boeing 747400s the worlds largest 
passenger jet and 40 757200s a shorterrange highly 
fuelefficient twinjet and took options on four 747400s and 40 
757200s 
the planes scheduled for delivery from late 1993 through 1998 
were ordered with pratt amp whitney pw2000 and pw4000 engines making 
the deal worth 15 billion or more to the east hartford conn 
manufacturer 
chief corporate spokesman harold carr said the deal boosted 
boeings orders to 788 planes worth 42 billion this year the 
fifth straight year of record orders and the backlog of firm 
orders excluding options to 1644 planes worth 82 billion with 
deliveries extending into the late 1990s 
those figures do not include an order announced wednesday by 
cathay pacific airways ltd for two 747400 freighters and options 
on two more models for a total potential pricetag of about 600 
million because the deal was still being confirmed thursday carr 
said 
last friday company officials announced an order by evergreen 
airways corp of taiwan for four 747400s and two extendedrange 
767300ers and options for a like number of the same planes worth 
as much as 193 billion 
production has been grinding to a halt at boeing since the union 
representing about 57800 workers including 43300 puget 
soundarea members of district lodge 751 went on strike oct 4 
the machinists also represent about 12000 workers in wichita 
kan 1700 in portland ore and a few hundred in california 
utah montana hawaii and other states 
four planes have been delivered since the strike began and 
company officials said about three dozen more were close enough to 
completion for nonstriking personnel to finish them 
carr said senior boeing officials had heard no concern from 
customers about delivery problems the northwest order was the 
third received by boeing during the strike 
its certainly not going to be an issue at the bargaining 
table carr said 
local union president tom baker said boeing should start to feel 
the heat soon 
i just dont know how they can withstand a prolonged work 
stoppage without facing a great deal of pressure baker said 
the company is not going to be able to deliver the existing 
aircraft much less these new orders without us being back on 
the job 
federal mediator doug hammond said thursday he was remaining in 
contact with both sides but no talks were scheduled 
there have been no negotiations since the machinists voted 85 
percent to strike rather than accept a threeyear offer featuring 
wage hikes of 4 percent 3 percent and 3 percent bonuses of 8 
percent of gross pay this year and 3 percent in 1990 a 
costofliving clause to virtually match inflation a reduction in 
mandatory overtime and increases in some benefits

northwest airlines said thursday it has 
placed orders and options for 52 billion worth of boeing jets 
the largest order in northwests history 
this order is a testament to the new ownerships and new 
managements commitment to the people of northwest and the growth 
of the company said fred malek who last month was named 
president of the nations fourthlargest carrier by its new 
chairman alfred checchi 
northwest ordered six boeing 747400s and secured options on 
four more of the 420passenger hightechnology jumbo jets in 
addition the airline bought 40 boeing 757200 twin jets and placed 
options on 40 more 
the order comes even as boeing has been hit with a strike by 
production workers 
in seattle thursday chris longridge vice president of sales at 
boeing commercial airplanes said the show of confidence in boeing 
was appreciated striking boeing workers said the reports of the 
impending order bolstered their contention that boeing can afford a 
better wage and benefit offer 
value of the firm orders in todays dollars is about 27 
billion and the options represent another 25 billion malek told 
a news conference at minneapolisst paul international airport 
deliveries of aircraft included in this order are scheduled 
between the second half of 1993 and 1998 
northwest which earlier this year became the first airline to

pw4000 engines northwest already operates the worlds largest 
fleet of 747400s with five in service now and five more scheduled 
for delivery by the end of 1990 
malek said northwest plans to use the new 747400s on routes to 
and from asia projections show that transpacific markets will 
continue to grow at a doubledigit pace he said adding that the 
range payload and fuel efficiency of the 400 make it an excellent 
choice for high density asian routes 
the 757 orders and options will bring northwests fleet of these 
184passenger twin jets to 113 aircraft the 757s will be powered 
by pratt amp whitney pw2037 engines which are designed for fuel 
efficiency and low community noise levels 
northwest purchased in june by a group of investors led by 
checchi received its first 757 in 1985 and currently operates 33 
of them the 757s with transcontinental range will be used on 
medium and longhaul domestic routes malek said

aircraft on order for delivery through the 1990s for a total value 
of more than 115 billion

a house panel on thursday lashed out at the 
european communitys decision to place quotas on imported 
television programs and urged president bush to use trade sanctions 
if necessary to assure us access to european viewers 
the house ways and means subcommittee on trade in a unanimous 
voice vote approved a nonbinding resolution that said the 102 
vote on oct 3 by the european community council of ministers was 
illegal under terms of the 96nation general agreement on trade and 
tariffs 
the resolution said the house deplores the damage which will 
be inflicted on united states broadcasting film and related 
industries and urged bush and us trade representative carla 
hills to take all feasible action under its authority including 
possible action under section 301 of the trade act of 1974 to 
protect and maintain united states access to the ec broadcasting 
market 
section 301 authorizes the us trade representative to take 
action against a foreign nation that discriminates against us 
commerce 
on tuesday hills said she would file a fairtrade complaint 
with gatt against the european community over the oct 3 directive 
which urges the 12 member nations to take steps to limit imports to 
no more than half of all shows aired 
although the socalled television without frontiers directive 
was not binding on european community nations hills said it was 
blatantly protectionist and discriminates against us and 
other noneuropean community film goods 
although gatt has no police power over the european community 
hills action indicated the bush administration was having second 
thoughts about the plan to drop internal trade barriers by the end 
of 1992 
commerce secretary robert mosbacher also has told congress the 
administration is concerned that the european community will impose 
local content rules in areas such as television computer chips 
telecommunications equipment and automobiles 
according to industry figures the united states realizes a 3 
billion annual surplus balance of trade through film and tv 
exports and europe is the leading market for such programs with 
about 700 million in purchases yearly 
tv series such as miami vice and dallas are very popular 
in europe which has caused legislators there to decry the 
americanization of their citizenry 
officials estimate that out of 125000 hours of tv shown in 
western europe annually only 20000 hours are produced in europe 
japan australia and the united states provide the bulk of the 
remainder 
the house resolution was sponsored by rep sam gibbons dfla 
and had 14 cosponsors the subcommittee staff said

the state public utilities commission on 
thursday scrapped its 50yearold system of regulating telephone 
rates and adopted a new plan tying rates to inflation encouraging 
new technology and promising pacific bell customers a rate decrease 
local telephone companies are becoming more like competitive 
businesses and should be treated that way the commissions 
president g mitchell wilk said before the new system was 
approved on a 50 vote 
pacific bell and gte california the other company affected 
both praised the plan a consumer group toward utility rate 
normalization called it a dangerous ride down an unmapped road 
the plan effective next year is part of an overall policy by 
the current puc appointed by gov george deukmejian to loosen 
some of its traditional regulation and scrutiny of management 
decisions by utility companies in telecommunications energy and 
transportation 
current phone rates are based on the commissions determination 
of major phone companies revenue needs based on its costs 
efficiency and the state of the economy 
under the new system rates will be changed annually according 
to this formula a federal inflation index called the gross 
national product price index will be reduced by 45 percent based 
on the assumption that phone companies can increase their 
productivity by that amount each year 
for example if inflation was 48 percent the figure shown by 
the index this past march the rate increase would be 3 percent 
the companies basic rate of return on investment would be set 
at 115 percent as of jan 1 carl danner an aide to wilk said 
the result would probably be a rate decrease of 100 million or 
more for pacific bell next year and probably little change for gte 
which had a 20 percent rate cut last year 
if a company increased its efficiency to earn a higher rate of 
return stockholders could keep all amounts up to 13 percent 
additional earnings up to 165 percent would be split 5050 with 
ratepayers and any amounts above 165 percent would belong to 
ratepayers 
sometime next year the current 120amonth charge for 
touchtone telephone service would be eliminated and the free 
local calling area would be expanded from eight to 12 miles 
the puc said pacific bell would be allowed to spend 405 million 
to modernize its system over the next three years so that 950000 
customers would have access to services they now lack including 
touchtone phones and blocking of dialaporn and other 
tapemessage fee calls 
the commission will also let phone companies cut prices for some 
hightech and businessoriented services and require the companies 
to assume all financial risks of many new services while keeping 
all revenues from those services

fears that a computer virus will trash 
information on some personal computers are overblown experts said 
thursday but some alarmed users have taken steps to make sure they 
dont wake up friday the 13th with the infection 
our advice to people is stop worrying said dennis steinauer 
of the national institute of standards and technology people 
should make a backup copy of their files and dont call me in the 
morning theres virtually no way it can spread around and cause 
any significant damage at all 
but others feel the threat is real from the socalled columbus 
day virus programmed to activate after computers internal clocks 
hit 1201 am friday and begin doing its dirty work when an 
operator begins using an infected program 
were talking about a communicable disease that is absolutely 
indiscriminate said winn schwartau president of american 
computer security industries in nashville tenn 
its not going to be armageddon today or tomorrow but if you 
ignore it and youre infected the risk is high for getting your 
data destroyed schwartau said 
by coincidence more than 2000 of the nations top computer 
security experts convened their annual meeting thursday in 
baltimore md 
few if any opted to stay on the job because of the virus 
threat according to the sponsoring national institute of standards 
and technology and the national computer security center 
only a tiny fraction of the nations 40 million users of 
personal computers are expected to catch the virus officials said 
at a news conference 
we want to send a calming message to people that if they take 
reasonable precautions this virus poses no more danger than any 
other said thomas p malarkey deputy chief of the computer 
service office of the federal national computer security center 
a computer virus is the electronic equivalent of a biological 
bug it is a malevolent program designed to sneak through a 
computer system on infected disks or in programs copied over 
networks from electronic bulletin boards 
once activated the rogue program copies itself like a breeding 
germ eating away processing power and storage space or even 
destroying information about 30 viruses are known to exist not 
counting strains and mutations 
the columbus day virus also known as datacrime is programmed 
to scramble indexing information in ibm or ibmcompatible personal 
computers it would be the equivalent of zapping index cards in a 
library so books would be impossible to locate 
the virus of unknown origin has been identified about 12 times 
since march 1 when experts discovered suspicious strings of code 
that had attached themselves to programs the confirmed cases of 
columbus day viruses were discovered before they did any real 
damage a number of programmers including ibm have developed ways 
to detect if a disk or program has been contaminated 
ibm took 2000 calls since oct 2 on a special hotline for 
people who want its virus scanning program 
were taking the threat seriously said ibm spokesman arthur 
hill you dont defeat computer viruses you detect them and 
erase them 
in south carolina the budget and control board checked its 
computers 
its being handled exactly like a bomb threat said 
spokesman larry huckabee i think you have to be serious about 
it but not necessarily alarmist 
also lurking in computer networks is another virus which has 
strains known as jerusalem friday the 13th or plo 
russ sura of antiquity piano co in south amboy nj on monday 
lost all the business information he had in two computers to the 
jerusalem strain 
how would you feel if every piece of business information was 
stuck on a computer and you couldnt get it out those dirty dogs 
i got hit but good sura said thursday 
theyve stolen time from me this will take two to four days 
of work to correct sura said this is worse than the 
heartbreak of psoriasis 
to avoid losing information pc users have been warned to make 
duplicates of their programs they can lower risks of infection by 
avoiding disks networks and shared programs that may be 
contaminated 
some users also have moved up their computer clocks to make oct 
13 arrive early and try to bring the virus out into the open 
but some experts insist the fuss in unwarranted 
you have more chance of being hit by lightning than getting 
this virus said john mcafee chairman of the computer virus 
industry association in santa clara calif the virus is a 
phantom its a media virus nothing is going to happen 
computer viruses are similiar to sick practical jokes done by 
mischiefmakers 
why do folks call in bomb scares its the thrill of knowing 
youre driving a bunch of people nuts said steinauer you 
cant stop it anymore than you can stop people from writing 
graffiti on subway walls 
he said that perhaps the point of the virus threat is that 
computer users should take measures to protect themselves 
if this threat has done nothing more than gotten everyone to 
go out to make backup files then maybe its not such a bad 
thing steinauer said the bottom line is make a backup and 
get back to work he said

united airlines pilot and management 
representatives met with labor department officials thursday after 
the machinists union asked the agency to block a proposed employee 
buyout of the airline a department spokesman said 
the agency called leaders of the ual corp buyout group to 
washington to meet with us and describe the details of the 
proposed transaction said department spokesman paul williams 
the machinists union representing more than a third of uals 
70000 employees has asked the labor department to block the 
groups 675 billion buyout of the nations secondlargest 
airline contending it is too highpriced and unfair to employees 
in a letter to department officials the machinists said the 
proposed deal violates sections of the employment retirement income 
security act which governs use of employee investment funds 
williams said that after gathering the facts the department 
would make a judgment under the erisa as to what if any problems 
exist with the proposed buyout 
meanwhile the united chapter of the association of flight 
attendants hit what it called a number of major stumbling blocks in 
contract negotiations aimed at giving the attendants an ownership 
stake in ual union spokeswoman carol holmes said at least one of 
those hurdles may prove to be insurmountable 
the only unionized employees committed to participating in the 
buyout are uniteds 7000 pilots who are leading the takeover 
group that also includes uals top management and british airways 
plc 
the companys 24000 nonunion workers would automatically 
participate in an employee stock ownership plan if the buyout 
which has been approved by uals board goes through 
the pilots have said they are prepared to proceed with the 
300ashare deal regardless of whether fellow unions participate 
nonetheless disunity among the workers has raised questions about 
the chance of the buyouts longterm success 
in trading on the new york stock exchange ual climbed 325 a 
share to 285 
the pilots have agreed to accept contract concessions of 250 
million a year and have voted by a 9to1 margin to commit 200 
million from their 12 billion pension fund to buy preferred stock 
in the employee stock ownership plan 
in a threepage letter delivered wednesday to labor secretary 
elizabeth dole the machinists charged that the tax benefits of the 
proposed buyout are effectively subsidizing a substantial and 
excessive windfall for uals management and uniteds pilots 
the letter signed by john peterpaul executive vice president 
of the machinists union also contended the purchase price 
approved by uals board is too high and that the buyout would 
result in significant risk and inefficiency caused by ongoing 
labor strife and disharmony 
peterpaul referred calls about the letter to brian freeman 
financial adviser for the international association of machinists 
and aerospace workers who did not immediately return telephone 
calls 
labor department spokesman paul williams said agency officials 
were meeting to consider the letter 
the pilots had no comment on the letter said spokeswoman kathie 
hardin of the air line pilots association 
the machinists previously said they opposed the deal because of 
the increased debt it would involve and the uncertain prospects for 
the companys continued prosperity 
the deal also is under scrutiny by the transportation 
department which has expressed concern about debtfinanced buyouts 
and foreign stakes in us airlines 
ms holmes said contract negotiators for the 14000 united 
flight attendants have balked at company proposals to increase the 
attendants share of their medical costs and to increase the number 
of foreignlanguagespeaking attendants on international flights 
she said the latter proposal would unfairly reduce the 
international flight opportunities for senior attendants who do not 
speak a foreign language 
meanwhile thursday amr corp parent of american airlines 
issued a statement saying it had asked the department of 
transportation to make fundamental changes in the air service 
agreement between the united states and great britain before 
allowing british airways to participate in the ual buyout 
amr which is weighing a 7 billion takeover offer from donald 
trump 
said the ual deal represents a unilateral opening of us 
aviation markets and it is unsound as a matter of policy and 
it is inconsistent with us efforts to attain fair trading 
relationships 
amr spokesman al becker said the company did not object in 
general to british airways participation in the deal but believes 
the us government should require great britain to open up its 
markets to greater access by us carriers 
becker said american has been stymied in its efforts to open up 
nonstop chicagolondon and new yorkmanchester routes because 
the british government is one of the most restrictive in the 
world in allowing foreign carriers access to its markets

the chicago board options exchange wont be just 
for options anymore officials of the exchange announced thursday 
the worlds biggest options marketplace is planning to launch a 
stock market basket during the week of oct 23 pending securities 
and exchange commission approval

dramatically after the 1987 stock market crash

500 and sampp 100 indexes on interest rates and on us treasury

the futures industry needs to get behind 
market reforms now or it will wind up paying for those enacted by 
congress without any say in the matter a top federal futures 
regulator warned thursday 
in the upcoming year the future of the futures industry will 
be written for better or for worse in washington not in chicago 
or new york said wendy l gramm chairwoman of the commodity 
futures trading commission 
in a speech prepared for the commodities law institute in 
chicago the text of which was released here ms gramm said recent 
events have placed the cftc and the industry it oversees under 
more public and congressional scrutiny than ever before 
in july an emergency soybean futures liquidation order on the 
chicago board of trade reportedly caused by an alleged attempt to 
corner the market led to wild price fluctuations that had traders 
and farmers howling 
in august more than 40 traders and brokers at the cbot and the 
chicago mercantile exchange the nations two largest futures 
exchanges were indicted on a variety of charges including 
racketeering for alleged schemes to defraud customers several 
already have pleaded guilty 
earlier this year it was revealed that futures markets in new 
york also are under investigation although no charges have been 
brought 
after a series of congressional hearings and reports by the 
general accounting office the accounting arm of congress the 
very legitimacy and integrity of the markets are being 
challenged said ms gramm 
a reform bill already has been passed by the house and another 
is being considered by the senate the senate agriculture 
nutrition and forestry committee has scheduled hearings in 
washington for tuesday 
ms gramm said her agency supports the general goals of both 
bills which require exchanges to toughen record keeping standards 
that would allow investigators to precisely reconstruct a given 
transaction a process known as following the audit trail 
but she said the agency has some reservations in terms of 
necessity and practicability about aspects of the house bill that 
would require recording of transactions to within 30 seconds of 
their occurrance 
the house bill also would require the cftc to monitor and 
approve changes in the margin levels or the amount of collateral 
put up to buy stock index futures 
ms gramm a supporter of the cftc policy of selfregulation by 
the exchanges said that could all be changed by congress depending 
on industry exchange and cftc response to the call for reforms 
she said the cftc was proposing reforms to detect and deter 
trading abuses but the industry needs to show those writing the 
reform agenda in washington that they are prepared to act and act 
decisively to ensure market integrity only in this way can public 
confidence in these markets be maintained
