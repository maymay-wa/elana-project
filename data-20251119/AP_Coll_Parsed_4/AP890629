housing and urban development secretary on 
thursday ordered cancellation of another troubled program in his 
department one designed to prepare building sites for housing 
projects and said by the department to have been riddled with 
abuse 
twentyfive of 58 projects financed through the 12yearold 
title ten land development mortgage insurance program have 
defaulted costing the government 90 million the department said 
this program guarantees mortgages to finances land acquisition 
and site preparation such as street construction and sewer line 
installation for smaller developers who would include housing for 
lowincome and moderate income families in their projects 
about 500 million in loans has been guaranteed since 1977 
this program was an absolute disaster said spokesman bob 
nipp 
kemp said application fees will be returned for projects that 
have not yet been approved projects with initial approval or with 
commitments for funds will be reviewed to determine whether fraud 
or misrepresentation warrant the denial of government insurance 
he said 
the department will publish a proposed regulation to terminate 
the program due to the enormity of the losses involved high 
patterns of abuse and the failure of the program to benefit the 
needy the departments announcement said 
the reagan administration sought legislation to abolish the 
program but was unsuccessful kemps proposed regulation will have 
to remain open for a period of public comment before it can become 
final 
kemp ordered an examination of the program in april by the 
departments inspectorgeneral initial findings caused him to order 
a complete audit of the program and related consultant activity and 
the circumstances of the recent approval of a loan for mcnair farms

some witnesses who testified before a 
congressional panel on influence peddling at the housing and urban 
development department have come dangerously close to perjuring 
themselves a republican member of the subcommittee said wednesday 
meanwhile rep tom lantos dcalif the panels chairman said 
he has met with lawyers for a key witness who has refused to 
testify but lantos would not say whether the discussions included a 
request for or offer of immunity 
the hearings before the house government operations subcommittee 
on housing and employment were to resume thursday with fred bush a 
1988 fundraiser for george bushs presidential effort among those 
scheduled to testify fred bush unrelated to the president 
testified may 25 and the subcommittee recalled him 
after more than a month of hearings on allegations that bigname 
republicans profited handsomely by using their connections to land 
multimilliondollar contracts at hud rep christopher shays 
rconn said in an interview that some contradictions have emerged 
but he refused to specify what they were or who made them 
i think there are some persons who are dangerously close to 
perjuring themselves shays said we have some conflicting 
testimony 
shays a member of the subcommittee has been outspoken in his 
criticism of the management of hud during the eight years of the 
reagan administration 
he said that some of the conflicts among witnesses also may be 
due to poor memory or misunderstanding the questions 
but lantos while not disagreeing with shays said he would wait 
until the hearings are nearly over before saying whether any of the 
witnesses had lied 
i think everything that chris shays says may well prove to 
be the case lantos said but i would prefer to make any 
comments along those lines much later than at this stage of the 
game 
obviously in a number of instances we have had people claiming 
not knowing not remembering and there comes a point where this 
appears less and less plausible lantos said in an interview 
ive tried my very best to give the witnesses the benefit of 
the doubt and caution them when i thought they were on dangerous 
territory lantos said 
witnesses said they made contact with deborah gore dean who was 
then executive assistant to housing secretary samuel pierce jr to 
get approval for their projects seeking funds from hud for 
rehabilitating rundown housing for the poor in some of these 
cases the funds for fixing up the property rent subsidies and tax 
credits ran into the tens of millions of dollars 
the witnesses have said that ms deans support for a project was 
crucial in gaining department approval contact with her often was 
made through former hud employees or by wellplaced republicans 
such as former interior secretary james watt who hired out their 
services for sixfigure fees as consultants 
another prominent republican who received a consulting fee for 
helping a project win federal housing funds was fred brown a new 
york businessman and chairman of the national black republican 
council the new york times said in thursday editions 
a 1987 audit by hud investigators questioned browns 50000 fee 
for consulting work on behalf of new haven conn in its successful 
bid for a 10 million federal urban development action grant 
the audit said there was insufficient data to determine whether 
the fee is reasonable and that this type of service was necessary 
a lawyer for brown joshua s vogel said his client was 
instrumental in obtaining the new haven grant through his contacts 
with ms dean the newspaper said 
in his earlier testimony fred bush whose company made 268000 
as consultant on a hud project said that he too sought ms deans 
support at the department but said that he was not personally 
acquainted with her 
in her appearance before the subcommittee last month ms dean 
refused to testify citing her constitutional protection against 
selfincrimination 
lantos said he remained hopeful that ms dean would testify in 
which case some of the questions of controversy among the various 
businesses will come out into the open 
asked if he has discussed a deal with ms deans attorneys under 
which she would be granted immunity for her testimony before the 
panel lantos replied i can confirm that i have met with them 
but i am not liberty to discuss what they talked to me about and 
what i talked to them about 
ms dean contacted by telephone declined to talk about meetings 
between her attorneys and the subcommittee she said that she had 
been spending her time examining a box full of documents recently 
obtained from hud 
one of her attorneys charles leeper also confirmed meetings 
with the subcommittee but would not elaborate

here is a chronology of the supreme courts 
major abortion decisions 
jan 22 1973 in roe vs wade the court for the first time 
legalized abortion nationwide the court in an opinion by justice 
harry a blackmun based its 72 ruling on a womans constitutional 
right to privacy 
the court said a womans decision to have an abortion during the 
first three months of pregnancy must be left to her and her doctor 
it said states may impose certain regulations during the second 
trimester to protect the womans health and may take steps to 
protect fetal life in the third trimester state authority to 
regulate abortions after the first trimester was not made absolute 
however 
jan 22 1973 in roe vs bolton the court that same day struck 
down by a 72 vote restrictions on facilities that could be used to 
perform abortions the decision gave rise to a new kind of medical 
facility the abortion clinic 
july 1 1976 in planned parenthood vs danforth the court by 
a 63 vote said states cannot give husbands veto power over their 
pregnant wives decision to abort their pregnancies by a 54 vote 
the court said that neither can parents of minor unwed girls be 
given an absolute veto over abortions 
june 20 1977 in maher vs roe the court ruled 63 that states 
have no legal obligation to pay for nontherapeutic abortions 
jan 9 1979 in colautti vs franklin reached by a 63 vote 
the court reaffirmed its intention to give doctors broad discretion 
in determining the timing of fetal viability when a fetus can 
live outside the mothers womb the justices said states may seek to 
protect a fetus that has reached viability but the determination is 
up to doctors not courts or legislatures 
july 2 1979 in bellotti vs baird the court by an 81 vote 
elaborated on its parental consent decision of 1976 it implied that 
states may be able to require a pregnant unmarried minor to obtain 
parental consent to an abortion so long as the state law provides an 
alternative procedure to parental approval such as letting the 
minor seek a state judges approval instead 
june 30 1980 in harris vs mcrae the socalled hyde amendment 
was upheld by a 54 vote the court said the federal government and 
individual states are under no legal obligation to pay for even 
medically necessary abortions sought by women receiving welfare 
march 23 1981 in hl vs matheson the court ruled by a 63 
vote that states may require doctors consulted by some girls those 
still dependent on their parents and too immature to decide such 
matters for themselves to try to inform parents before performing 
a requested abortion 
june 15 1983 in three decisions called city of akron vs akron 
center for reproductive health planned parenthood of kansas city 
vs ashcroft and simopolous vs virginia the court in a 63 
ruling said states and local communities may not require that all 
abortions for women more than three months pregnant be performed in 
a hospital 
the court also struck down regulations that among other things 
imposed a 24hour waiting period between the signing of an abortion 
consent form and the medical procedure and required doctors to tell 
women seeking an abortion that a fetus is a human life 
june 11 1986 in thornburgh vs american college of 
obstetricians and gynecologists the court voted 54 to strike down 
pennsylvania abortion regulations somewhat similar to those it 
invalidated in 1983 the court said states may not require doctors 
to inform women seeking abortions about potential risks and about 
available medical assistance benefits for prenatal care and 
childbirth 
in that decision the court also struck down requirements that 
doctors performing thirdtrimester abortions which are rare use 
procedures least risky to a fetus capable of surviving outside the 
womb and that two doctors always be present for abortions performed 
in the third trimester also invalidated was a regulation requiring 
doctors to make a record which could become available to the 
public of every abortion they perform 
dec 14 1987 in hartigan vs zbaraz the court split 44 the 
effect was to invalidate an illinois law that could have made 
abortions more difficult to obtain for some teenagers 
the decision was announced two months before justice anthony m 
kennedy joined the court and replaced justice lewis f powell who 
had retired the previous june

meanwhile fred bush the chief fundraiser for george bushs 
1988 presidential campaign making a second appearance before the 
house government operations subcommittee on employment and housing 
substantially changed his previous sworn testimony about his initial 
contacts with the memos author 
the memo dated june 10 1987 was sent from deborah gore dean 
former executive assistant to thenhousing secretary samuel pierce 
jr to tony benedi coordinator of special projects in the vice 
presidents office 
the memo details more than 2 million in funding from the 
department of housing and urban development to the city of bayamon 
puerto rico during fiscal years 1986 and 1987 information dean 
provided per your request to benedi 
although no hud inspector generals investigations at that time 
involved bayamon the city had been asked to repay 1 million to the 
agency 
if advance work is handled properly this should not present a 
problem but it is potentially dangerous she said 
on a related matter hud secretary jack kemp ordered thursday 
cancellation of a troubled program in his department one designed 
to prepare building sites for housing projects and said by the 
department to have been riddled with abuse 
twentyfive of 58 projects financed through the 12yearold 
title ten land development mortgage insurance program have 
defaulted costing the government 90 million the department said 
this program guarantees mortgages to finance land acquisition and 
site preparation such as street construction and sewer line 
installation for smaller developers who would include housing for 
lowincome and moderate income families in their projects 
earlier this week president bush said he would accept some 
responsibility for alleged influencepeddling favoritism and 
mismanagement in several hud programs while he was vice president in 
the reagan administration 
if you want to assign blame to the vice president for what 
happened over the past eight years ok thats fine i accept 
it president bush said he added that he wanted to make sure 
there is no recurrence of cronyism and special favors in 
awarding government contracts 
meanwhile fred bush former deputy chief of staff for thenvice 
president bush sought to make what he termed clarifying 
statements to the house subcommittee fred bush who is not 
related to george bush previously testified may 25 
at that time fred bush told the subcommittee he contacted dean 
about the bayamon project after finding her name in an federal 
executive telephone directory 
however bush said one of his former colleagues at bush amp co 
reminded him later that they had contacted dean after another former 
official at hud spoke with the colleague at a social gathering 
they have told me of their best recollection sometime in late 
1984 or early 1985 one of my colleagues met hunter cushing at a 
social gathering and learned that he worked at hud said bush 
my colleagues recollection is that mr cushing told him we 
should talk to deborah gore dean he said adding that the 
colleague asked bush if he knew dean 
bush said he didnt and it was then that he consulted the 
directory subsequently called dean and later met with her at her 
office to discuss the project 
no one at bush amp co understood at the time that ms dean might 
have the power to approve this project bush added 
bush ambassadordesignate to luxembourg said he could not 
explain why benedi had sent the memo to dean about the bayamon 
project bush said he didnt know benedi who joined the staff after 
bush had left 
i think its extremely important that we have this different 
version which seems to be a dramatically more plausible version 
than your initial testimony said rep tom lantos dcalif the 
subcommittee chairman 
im getting a little confused as to whether you knew deborah 
dean or hunter cushing first said rep christopher shays 
rconn questioning bush extensively on thursdays version of his 
initial contacts with hud officials 
lantos also cited bushs access to those officials in repeatedly 
questioning why the los jamines project was subsequently approved by 
hud political appointees over the objections of career hud 
employees bush earned 253000 as a consultant on the project which 
was subsequently canceled by the municipality 
i did not feel nor do i feel today that i had political 
infulence said bush 
i made the distinction between what i call political access and 
political influence he added 
but rep charles schumer dny countered with a question about 
bushs nomination as ambassador asking whether it had to do more 
with his influence than with his laymans knowledge of foreign 
policy 
cushing former deputy assistant secretary for multifamily 
housing on thursday asked the panel to postpone his testimony until 
he could review documents that would help him prepare to answer 
questions 
ive only recently been retained and not had adequate 
opportunity to review the facts in this case said jamie gorelick 
an attorney who accompanied the former hud official 
gorelick said cushing a deputy assistant secretary at the 
commerce department would appear voluntarily before the 
subcommittee after the congressional recess for the fourth of july 
lantos excused cushing and said he would be recalled 
investigators also questioned why bush had failed in his previous 
testimony to mention several other hud projects in which his company 
was involved including a 268000 technical assistance grant for 
another project in puerto rico 
because there has been no bush amp co since november of last 
year it has been particularly difficult to pull all this 
together said bush 
additionally he said he was only peripherally involved in the 
projects because from march 1986 to november 1988 he worked from 
three offices and was involved in fundraising

thousands of elderly americans are hospitalized 
and die every year because they take too many medicines and suffer 
adverse reactions sam benton after two decades abusing 
prescription drugs kicked the habit on his own science writer lee 
siegel is his grandson 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
sam benton doesnt look like a junkie but 
for 22 years the unassuming grandfather was hooked on a narcotic 
painkiller and sleeping pills 
ive been on so many different kinds of pills youd have to get 
a book to tell you how many the more you take the worse off you 
are one pill leads to another pill and i was drinking liquor on 
top of that too 
its a wonder hes alive today said rose benton 81 married 
for nearly 60 years to the retired clothing factory production 
manager you know what living in hell is watching somebody go 
through this 
for benton 86 recovery started early last year when he felt 
ill sleepless confused and like my mind wasnt acting properly 
he quit cigarettes most medicines and finally the two hefty 
shots of whiskey he enjoyed nightly last fall he spent two 
agonizing months withdrawing from his 22year habit of three to 
seven daily percodans a painkiller containing a synthetic narcotic 
he was a percodan junkie said bentons soninlaw portland 
lawyer sol siegel but he quit percodan at home without any help 
a doctor first prescribed percodan in 1966 when benton suffered 
severe stress headaches over the years he mixed percodan with 
feldene and indocin arthritis drugs orinase for diabetes 
antacids decongestants motrin a nonnarcotic painkiller 
coumadin to prevent blood clots that caused leg pains elavil an 
antidepressant and xanax ativan librium and serax to fight 
sleeplessness anxiety and nervousness 
the situation worsened several years ago when a car rearended 
bentons injuring his neck and prompting another doctor to 
prescribe more percodan 
doctors keep giving you the stuff you just tell them my head 
bothers me my neck bothers me i cant sleep theyll give you 
pills he said 
if any doctor objected benton would say doc if you take me 
off it youll hurt me more than if you leave me on it 
the minute it wears off you get a terrible urge everything 
begins to disturb you you crave it i couldnt go to sleep without 
it i couldnt do anything without it 
bentons daughter julie siegel said his latest doctor kept 
urging him to quit percodan but was compassionate enough not to cut 
off his supply 
gramp was desperately profoundly dependent on his various 
doctors to keep him in percodan he lived in fear of someone cutting 
him off it would be easy to condemn all the doctors involved but i 
can see their position too 
i dont want to blame my doctor i was the one who coaxed 
him said benton who finally decided to quit most medications and 
then percodan because of sleeplessness weakness druginduced hives 
and mental confusion 
as benton tapered off percodan i was weak sweaty nauseous 
had an inner craving my mind wouldnt relax i was hot and cold all 
the time he also suffered severe insomnia 
he now takes only coated aspirin for arthritis and occasionally 
onequarter of a sleeping pill my mind is now alert he said 
he sleeps and feels better and is starting to regain the 
motivation he believes the drugs robbed him of and he wants other 
senior citizens to know the dangers of overmedication 
it wrecks your body and your mind its going to ruin your 
life

a leading actress has broken one barrier 
for women on turkeys maledominated political stage by getting 
elected mayor of sisli a borough of istanbul where fancy 
residential and shopping areas are ringed by slums 
fatma girik 46 believes in personal contact with her 
550000member constituency and in daily personal inspection of 
public works rather than relying on reports of her staff 
women make better mayors she recently told a turkish newspaper 
i see sisli as my own home and i can communicate much better 
with women who deal with daytoday problems she was quoted as 
saying 
once a month she opens up city hall to constituents who have 
problems 
whitebearded men clutching worry beads young mothers carrying 
wailing babies widows without pensions people from the underclass 
come to share their problems with miss girik 
at one recent meeting a young woman just graduated from high 
school said she was looking for a job 
dont we have anything at the switchboard or someplace miss 
girik asked her staff 
not at the moment she was told that angered her 
why did she go to school if she cannot even earn a living do 
something she ordered the staff 
grandad she pleaded with another supplicant dont keep 
coming here everyday i promise you your water will be connected 
soon 
political experts say it is too early to tell whether miss 
giriks way of doing things putting pressure on bureaucracy and 
stretching rules in favor of common people will succeed in 
istanbul turkeys largest city with an overall population of 7 
million 
she won the mayoralty in march when her social democrat populist 
party swept turkeys urban centers 
during the campaign the ruling motherland party candidates 
attacked her as unsuitable on grounds that she lacked experience and 
because of her 25yearold commonlaw marriage to film director 
memduh un 
i am running for mayor of sisli not for the imam of the sisli 
mosque she shot back at opponents referring to the moslem 
religious leader 
born in istanbul to a middleclass family in which the father was 
a seaman she quit school after the eighth grade and a few years 
later made her way into the movie world in istanbuls yesilcam 
district mainly on the strength of her looks 
she turned out to be a good actress a natural born one says 
movie critic erman sener 
she has made 300 movies since starting her film career in 1958 
and many are potboilers typical of the turkish movie industry but 
in the past two decades she has specialized in the portrayal of 
anatolian peasant women heroines played by miss girik fight for 
their rights and their families against difficult odds and often 
prevail 
attempting to overcome turkeys social and economic problems may 
be more difficult in real life 
i have no time for books for movies anymore she said i 
am on my feet all day long and hit the bed exhausted

its 830 am at camp solidarity and the 
united mine workers version of the snake dance is about to begin 
along narrow coal hauling roads in southwestern virginia 
several hundred appalachian and midwestern miners who left their 
jobs in sympathetic wildcat strikes have lined up their cars and 
trucks in a daily convoy they use to slow coal traffic 
most of the miners involved in the walkouts officially 
unauthorized by the union stay in tents and campers at a 10acre 
campground leased by the union others stay in hotels nearby 
nearly every working day since june 19 theyve driven a few 
miles along a dirt road following the path of the clinch river to 
pittston coal groups main processing plant in russell county 
there they link up with miners on strike against pittston in a 
contract dispute 
the vehicles slowly parade bumpertobumper for a few miles turn 
around pass the entrance again meander for another few miles and 
turn around again a similar smaller convoy is run along a road 
connecting pittston mines with its other processing plant in mcclure 
coal trucks occasionally slip into the convoys and into the 
processing plants but far fewer than normal 
state police say there is little they can do when drivers do not 
go too slow and obey traffic laws troopers watch the passing parade 
of cars and occassionally issue tickets for impeding traffic 
strike captain bill bise of lebanon stands at the entrance to 
pittstons main processing plant and marks down the number of trucks 
that make it through the union gauntlet how many loads we got 
whats the count now miners riding shotgun in convoy cars 
periodically ask bise as they drove slowly by 
at days end the wildcat strikers head back to the campground 
for a hearty buffet 
its a humongous pot luck supper explains joyce kiser of 
castlewood the wife of a retired miner as she helps dish out food 
donated by area families and businesses supporting the strike 
after the meal the campers play horseshoes whittle and talk 
about the union or listen to local musicians fill the hollow with 
bluegrass or gospel tunes 
the next morning after a breakfast of eggs bacon and potatoes 
cooked on a huge makeshift grill the convoy forms again 
people coordinating the activity said the wildcat strikers from 
west virginia kentucky indiana pennsylvania ohio tennessee and 
missouri will be rotated in weekly and biweekly shifts indefinitely 
well stay as long as it takes said tim evans who is on 
strike from belva coal co a pittston mine near logan wva 
on monday us district judge glen williams tried to put a 
financial roadblock in the way of the miners he fined the union and 
two officers 240000 for organizing the convoys and he promised to 
levy fines totaling 120000 for each day the convoys continue 
on tuesday a federal judge in west virginia ruled that the 
nearly 43000 coal miners on wildcat strikes in nine states are 
violating us labor law and ordered them to return to work 
but the wildcat strikers said they have a permanent stake in what 
happens to the 1900 union members on strike against pittston 
pittston broke away from an association of coal companies that 
signed a national contract with the umw last year and miners 
believe that if the union loses its dispute with pittston their 
companies may follow suit and lower their benefits pensions and job 
security 
if everybody else does what pittston is doing were all up a 
creek evans said 
he sleeps on a plastic sheet on the ground in a tent with a dozen 
other men its been raining almost every day and mud is up to his 
ankles in some parts of the campground 
but the 28yearold equipment operator is almost gleeful 
if pittston thinks that this is eventually going to wear us 
down they better think again evans said when youre from the 
west virginia mountains you get used to roughing it staying in the 
woods theyve got a saying about it a country boy can survive 
were in our element

hugh hefner is taking a bride this weekend 
ending the hedonistic fantasy he nourished through playboy magazine 
and as pajamaclad lord of the playboy mansion and its flocks of 
worldclass women 
the king of the playboys is succumbing to romance the way the 
rest of the country is doing we are out of the era of play sex 
observed media psychologist joyce brothers the onenight stand is 
over 
the 63yearold founder of playboy magazine and 1988 playmate of 
the year kimberley conrad 26 will recite wedding vows saturday 
afternoon at the playboy mansion in exclusive holmby hills some 450 
guests will then party the night away beneath a huge white tent 
alongside the mansions exotic grotto 
the formal ceremony will be elaborate yet traditional planners 
say in keeping with southern california standards ushers are 
required to have tans 
hefner will wear a vested black tuxedo when he walks from a 
wishing well to the altar to greet his bride it was at the wishing 
well where he uttered the m word last july 
miss conrad will make her entrance down the mansions grand 
staircase wearing an offwhite taffeta gown by new york designer jim 
hjelm the gowns chapellength train is embroidered with the 
couples initials 
there wont be a hidden playboy bunny logo anywhere 
and miss conrad a former playboy bunny later picked as last 
years playmate already has evicted the bevy of cottontailed 
beauties from the 53acre estate 
the ceremony is offlimits to the news media pictures will be 
taken by former white house photographer david hume kennerly the 
guest list was secret but wedding planner colin cowie let it slip 
that bill cosby was coming 
it was the kind of thing i felt quite certain would never 
happen in my life hefner said of the wedding adding i guess 
ive changed 
or maybe the rest of society just changed less than a reader of 
hefners playboy philosophy might expect a survey of more than 
3000 adults suggests that if there was a sexual revolution in the 
1960s most americans missed it the survey conducted by 
researchers in 1970 but published this week for the first time 
found that americans overwhelmingly disapproved of extramarital sex 
and premarital sex 
said brothers finding sex that is fun in monogamy is the goal 
today sex without caring sex without commitment is just dull 
hefner was married once before for 10 years to millie williams 
and they had two children christie 36 and david 34 
i am most important excited about it because hes so happy 
christie hefner said confessing she has often found herself 
mothering hefner and worrying about whom hes dating you want to 
be sure somebody theyre hefner going with is somebody whos good 
enough for him she has the same interests as him and is making him 
very happy 
christie hefner is now chairman and chief executive officer of 
playboy enterprises inc the empire hefner started in 1953 about 
10 years before his bride was born 
the wedding flies in the face of the playboy sexcapades 
lifestyle his own magazine said in an article last year that hefner 
has lived by woody allens law marriage is the death of hope 
the gothic playboy mansion just south of sunset boulevard near 
westwoods university of california at los angeles campus was a 
frequent party stop for hollywood celebrities 
it once had a ribald flabor with nude swimming sunbathing and 
cavorting on the lavish grounds it now seems prosaic 
hefner was tamed in part by a mild stroke in 1986 he stopped 
smoking his pipe and switched to caffeinefree diet pepsi but he 
still wears his trademark purple silk pajamas day and night 
playboy magazine now has a circulation of 35 million and a 
national playboy channel cable tv audience 
christie hefner feels the marriage captures the spirit of the 
1990s 
on a kind of commercial note i think its fabulous because 
the majority of subscribers to the magazine are married now and i 
think the 90s are an era of romance and commitment she said 
brothers said there will always be room for playboy magazine 
we still need fuel for our fantasies playboy magazine will 
still be popular paper dolls with staples across their navels are a 
lot less dangerous these days she said

it was hailed as the first usstyle football 
contest played in the soviet union and the two allstar high school 
teams from oklahoma had the time of their lives showing the soviets 
what football is all about 
the announcer tried to lecture the soviet spectators on the fine 
points 
remember the idea of the game is to try to move forward he 
said 
the main thing is not to fall the thing is to stay on your 
feet as long as possible 
the thousands of soviets who paid four rubles each about 7 to 
get into moscows dynamo stadium for the exhibition wednesday looked 
like they had a good time though the basics did sort of elude them 
for a while 
i thought the crowd was kind of confused said offensive 
tackle chance walentiny 18 a senior from bixby okla near games 
end but i think they liked it i think they like american 
football 
ive never played in front of so many people before im 
ecstatic right now 
it was the boomers against the stars and quarterback matt cook 
had himself a day to remember passing for three touchdowns and 
running for a fourth to lead the boomers to a 286 victory 
muscovites know rugby soccer and baseball but americanstyle 
football was something new they cheered when players gestured to 
them but most of the yells in the right places came from family 
members imported from oklahoma 
and also from youths in black jerseys who journeyed more than 
1000 to moscow from chelyabinsk in the ural mountains to meet the 
american players 
the federal football club whose 80 players include girls is the 
only americanstyle football team in the soviet union and has been 
playing since late 1987 coach alexander kovrygin said 
the kids had the idea that football means murder and brawls 
and they figured they could fight legally on the field he jested 
american coach dan crookham did report however that one 
muscovite approached him before the game with a question 
he asked how many people he could expect to be killed in 
tonights contest crookham said smiling 
the tass news agency said the three games the americans play in 
moscow leningrad and tallinn should help football overcome its 
violent reputation 
kemp fox an umpire at the game from tulsa okla said the match 
served as a good example of american football with few 
penalties and no injuries 
up in the stands phil straus a scientist from los angeles 
tried to explain the game to soviet vladimir katashov 
its the most important thing on monday nights you go to the 
bar and have a pitcher of beer straus told him 
katashov shrugged it doesnt seem very dynamic to me its 
rather monotonous 
another soviet spectator a policeman who identified himself only 
as sergei complained it has so many pauses as soon as any 
excitement starts they stop again 
organizers expect the two 45player teams game in leningrad 
last on the oklahomans itinerary to draw up to 100000 people 
the soviet sports committee that helped organize the tour is 
pocketing the proceeds

as palestinian rioters and israeli 
troops battle in the occupied territories a young arab refugee and 
an orthodox jewish woman have done what is almost unthinkable in 
israel they married 
ignoring their families outrage and the war that separates their 
people zaki elamoudi and nurit yehuda signed a marriage contract 
on a parked car in front of nurits aunts apartment last year 
since then nurits family has abducted her several times and 
once sent her to the united states and jewish extremists have 
kidnapped the couples baby daughter 
only intervention by israeli police and the fbi reunited the 
couple and their daughter a restraining order banning nurits 
family from approaching their home has given the palestinian 
romeo and israeli juliet a semblance of quiet 
zaki said his story of love conquering hate should be a message 
to the israeli and palestinian people 
my daughter was born in the middle of a war said zaki 
sitting in his small suburban apartment near tel aviv it shows 
how much we need real peace 
zaki 25 and nurit 24 met four years ago when they worked at a 
chocolate factory near tel aviv 
i invited her for a cup of coffee but she refused zaki 
said laughing 
he pursued the shy quiet nurit and after two months she agreed 
to meet him after work in a park 
for more than a year they met clandestinely until nurits 
parents discovered their daughter was seeing a palestinian from work 
nurit said when she returned from a meeting with zaki my 
mother began shouting at me and moshe her elder brother slapped me 
in the face and shouted from tomorrow on youre not going to 
work 
zaki said when his family found out about his jewish girlfriend 
they barged into his apartment they wanted to break my legs and 
take me home he said 
nurits family forced her to quit her job but the lovers managed 
to meet secretly for two more years 
then we got the idea that if she was pregnant her family would 
have to accept us zaki said but things became even worse 
when nurits parents found out she was pregnant they took her 
and hid her in her aunts home north of tel aviv zaki found her and 
rushed to the house with a marriage contract which the two lovers 
signed on the parked car 
nurits parents sent her to baltimore where they had hoped she 
would have an abortion but doctors refused to perform one when they 
discovered she was in her seventh month of pregnancy 
they thought that if we were apart our love would die and the 
baby would be unnecessary said nurit 
when zaki learned that nurit was in baltimore he called an 
israeli lawyer who contacted the fbi he said the fbi forced the 
orthodox jewish family that was holding nurit to allow her to return 
to israel 
zaki and nurit then moved to khan yunis a town in the occupied 
gaza strip to live with his family which had become reconciled to 
the idea of an israeliarab marriage 
nurit went into labor late one night when gaza was under a 
military curfew 
i grabbed my brother and told him the pains had started and we 
had to go zaki recalled 
he and his brother samir took nurit to a hospital but when 
zaki returned home he was stopped by soldiers at an army checkpoint 
i told them that my wife was pregnant but i certainly didnt 
tell them she was jewish he said 
the soldiers didnt listen and ordered zaki to clear a roadblock 
set up by palestinian protesters thats where he was when his 
daughter lina was born 
when the couple returned to tel aviv a month later nurits 
family again abducted their daughter along with the infant 
i called the aunt and she said we have nurit we have the 
baby go to gaza go to hell zaki said 
zaki took the case to court in april and won custody of his 
child but the family again seized nurit and jewish extremists 
kidnapped the 2monthold girl and gave her to jewish settlers in 
the occupied west bank 
the baby was found only after police detained and questioned 
nurits father uncle and brother a court then issued the order 
banning the yehudas from approaching nurit and zakis apartment 
i fought so hard because i loved her zaki said of the ordeal 
to live in peace with his jewish wife 
nurit who is pregnant again said we just want to raise our 
children quietly

postworld war ii generations a taste of london under german 
bombardment 
as those who lived through the 194042 bombing of london can 
attest the blitz experience is unnerving the smoke smells 
real the ground really does shake and the sounds are authentic 
wartime recordings 
the blitz experience the centerpiece of the imperial war 
museums 31 million redevelopment begins in a brick shelter like 
those in which thousands of britons cowered during air raids 
for seven minutes mostly in chilly darkness when the single 
storm lantern is blown out visitors listen to a raid launched in 
the fall of 1940 
if you lived in our street youd have been in here 12 hours a 
night night after night says the recorded voice of george 
barker a cockney grocer who doubled as an air raid warden 
patrolling the streets in a tin hat and who lost his shop to a bomb 
there are moments of humor in tribute to the legendary spirit of 
the londoners under siege such as barker remarking that a shop 
whose front was blown up put out this big sign know what it says 
more open than usual 
those on the recording sing roll out the barrel breaking off 
as a woman screams when a bomb explodes close by 
when the allclear siren sounds barker ushers everyone out 
saying lets see what jerrys the germans left us 
a man named albert who disdains the shelter and always sleeps 
behind the bar groans in the wreckage of his pub but is pulled 
out alive 
the london skyline is red with fire an unexploded bomb lies 
nearby the firefighters are running out of water 
our house it aint there a woman says 
a little boy hunts for his toys his mother is heard coaxing him 
away from the wreckage promising him new toys 
its our job to make the terror the horror and the sacrifice 
as real to people who we hope will never experience it as those 
who did said the museums director alan borg 
the blitz he said has been mythologized by nostalgia it 
wasnt fun and one of the aims of our experience is to show that it 
must have been a terrifying thing to live through he said 
its no good being serious and boring about it and saying 
youve got to listen to me ive got to get people in and say 
this is interesting come and see and then hopefully theyll 
think about it 
queen elizabeth ii who served in the wartime auxiliary 
territorial service and whose buckingham palace home was bombed in 
1940 will visit the blitz experience thursday when she 
officially opens the redeveloped museum 
the museum arose from a government decision in march 1917 to 
collect and display material from world war i 
it is housed appropriately some say in the building that was 
the 19th century mental hospital known as bedlam 
its extraordinary relics include caltrops a sabotage instrument 
with four spikes used by the ancient romans and resurrected in world 
war i to damage the feet of men and horses 
besides little tins labeled queen marys comforts for the 
troops from world war i needles and cotton cigarettes and candy 
there are guns and gas masks tanks and twoman submarines 
uniforms and medals fighter planes suspended from the ceiling 
100000 books and the worlds best war art collection of 12000 
paintings and drawings 
next year it plans to open the trench experience which will 
expose visitors to the mud and smells of a world war i fighting 
front

temperatures in southern and central 
sweden this week hit 82 degrees the same as reported from the 
mediterranean resort island of majorca good for vacationers but 
not so hot for farmers 
or maybe a trifle too hot for farmers who are complaining of the 
worst drought in 50 years 
the national news agency tt said the water table dropped by up to 
a foot in parts of sweden after a virtually snowless winter dry 
spring and early summer 
local authorities imposed irrigation bans in some areas 
including the skane and blekinge agricultural provinces in the 
south where rainfall in june was 20 to 50 percent below normal 
bans on campfires and warnings against forest fires also were 
issued in many parts of the country

japanese businessmen arent concerned just about 
market shares and interest rates these days some are wondering 
whether their jobs might kill them 
its called karoshi death from overwork or pokkuri 
byo sudden death the number of such deaths among harried 
japanese businessmen is growing at an alarming rate researchers say 
victims share a common pattern sudden deaths from heart attacks 
or strokes after months or years of extralong working hours under 
heavy stress says dr kiyoyasu arikawa who advises executives on 
how to reduce their risk 
arikawa found that sudden deaths among top executives have 
skyrocketed in the past 20 years from 10 in 1969 to about 150 in 
1987 recently he says the number of such deaths has grown fastest 
among those in their 40s and 50s men who on average could expect to 
live to about 79 
the risks of japans competitive work world were highlighted by 
the sudden deaths in the past two years of several prominent men in 
their 40s including publishing executive koremichi noma trading 
company president hirotoshi inui fanuc co president nobuo hanaoka 
and chairman of the mass media group fuji sankei haruo shikanai 
pokkuri byo is a real concern among the businessmen i know 
said mitsuya goto a former nissan motor co executive who now heads 
an international exchange center theyre all pretty concerned 
about it 
arikawa runs a clinic in a skyscraper in downtown tokyo where he 
counsels executives on how to minimize damage from their 
stressladen careers the arikawa medical counseling club with its 
plush carpets dim lighting and classical music serves an elite 
clientele 
but sudden death is not confined to stressed executives 
various reports show such deaths occur among taxi drivers 
teachers journalists salespeople and maintenance workers 
a hot line set up by a lawyers group to handle inquiries from 
families of people who suffered premature sudden deaths estimates 
that as many as 600 japanese may have died of overwork last year 
in japan where time spent on the job and personal sacrifice are 
viewed as key measures of company loyalty the temptation to 
overwork is overwhelming says hiroshi kawahito a lawyer associated 
with the hot line 
people feel companies are more important than their individual 
rights and theyre praised by the company if they work hard their 
pay and position depend on it he said 
families of the victims are usually unprepared to cope with the 
loss of a breadwinner the hot line counsels them on how to obtain 
government assistance and in some cases workmens compensation 
in over 95 percent of the cases the government ruled against 
paying workmens compensation because its difficult to prove 
overwork was the cause of death kawahito says 
in the past the government required that families of sudden 
death cases prove the victim was overworked on the day he died it 
now accepts evidence an overwork victim was under extreme stress in 
the week before his death 
for years noboru fujii directed traffic on 24hour shifts 
sometimes longer every other day with only six hours for naps and 
meals at the kobe ferry terminal in western japan he died at age 60 
of a heart attack at work 
in his case the local labor standards office judged that fujii 
did die of overwork and awarded compensation to his family 
heart attacks and strokes are the second and third most common 
causes of death in japan claiming 267535 lives in 1987 192 
percent and 165 percent respectively of the 751172 people who 
died that year 
cancer killed 265 percent 
researchers say the underlying cause of sudden death is the 
excessive competition inherent in japanese society and working life 
japan lost world war ii so we feel we have to work harder 
than americans and europeans says kawahito 
competition and stress permeate the lives of overwork victims 
coupled with poor health habits attributable mostly to their busy 
work schedules arikawa says 
these people have no psychological or physical space or time 
for themselves the physician says its not so much that they 
love to work but they feel company loyalty demands that their whole 
life be work 
mental stress business stress and private problems accumulate 
until the body just cant take any more 
japanese companies despite their reputation for concern for 
workers welfare are just becoming aware of the problem says dr 
tetsunojo uehata of the national institute of public health 
japanese with their diet of fish and vegetables traditionally 
have good habits says uehata because of their jobs however 
they are expected to go out drinking at night they smoke lose 
sleep eat poorly and have no chance to go to the doctor 
the government has embarked on a drive to reduce working hours 
but so far with little evidence of success 
japanese are on the job an average 2150 hours a year compared 
with 1924 hours in the united states and 1655 hours in west 
germany according to the labor ministry 
a survey by the governmentaffiliated leisure development center 
in 1987 showed some firms require employees to work up to 3000 
hours a year 
theres a very clear link between these work pressures and 
health problems says uehata

joe howe who proudly waves hundreds of 
american flags daily atop the capitol believes flag burners should 
be punished no matter what the supreme court says and says he 
hopes he never meets one 
howe 32 of hollywood md is foreman of the crew that spends 
eight hours every weekday on the roof of the capitol raising and 
lowering flags for members of congress who send them to constituents 
on request 
for prices ranging from 738 to 5625 each depending on size 
and such accessories as a pole and decorative eagle constituents 
can boast that their flags actually flew over the capitol even if 
only for a few seconds 
i take pride in my work howe said in an interview during a 
coffee break from his rooftop labors how many people have the job 
of flying the flag over the capitol 
howe would be surprised if there werent a patriotic surge in 
requests for flags inspired by the furor over the supreme courts 
ruling last week that flagburning is a form of free speech 
guaranteed by the first amendment 
i dont agree with that decision and you can quote me howe 
said and i dont agree with people who burn flags 
what would be suitable punishment for a flag burner a lengthy 
stint on howes work crew raising flags on the capitol roof in the 
sweltering heat and suffocating humidity of summertime washington 
thats not stiff enough howe replied he thought a moment 
and added i wouldnt want to be up there with someone whos 
burned a flag 
howe and his nine helpers raise and lower an average of more than 
350 flags each weekday they sometimes work on weekends to meet 
requests for flags to be flown on special anniversary dates that 
happen to fall on a saturday or sunday 
the heaviest demand occurs on such patriotic holidays as memorial 
day and the fourth of july when as many as 1200 flags have been 
flown in a single day 
using three small flagpoles on the roof of the house side of the 
capitol they raise a flag for a few seconds lower it and fold it 
back into its box in bad weather they use six ropes equipped with 
flag hooks under the sheltered skirt of the capitol dome to fly 
their flags 
the practice began in 1937 when a dozen flags were flown over 
the capitol for legislators constituents last year the number had 
risen to more than 114000 altogether more than 14 million flags 
have been flown over the capitol to meet public requests in the past 
halfcentury 
down in the flag room in the capitol basement the busy 
staging area for the flag flying operation boxed flags are stacked 
to the ceilings in four cramped rooms decorated with portraits of 
betsy ross and a plaque bearing a poem titled our flag 
chris benza who has run the flag room for 28 years said the 
public demand for the stars and stripes is growing so fast that 
shes been promised a fifth storage room to handle the crush 
the last few weeks weve been overwhelmed with flag requests 
and i dont know why said william f raines administrative 
assistant to the architect of the capitol who oversees the flag 
program raines said the trend began before the supreme courts june 
22 decision 
asked if the court ruling had any effect on her business ms 
benza replied i havent noticed any yet but its possible well 
get swamped

wolves have an undeserved bad reputation 
because they howl at night and scare people says a congressman who 
wants the national wildlife service to consider returning the 
animals to yellowstone national park 
the issue drew rep wayne owens dutah and morning star a 
13monthold female wolf to the lawn outside the capitol on 
wednesday the animal was a relaxed center of attention at the 
event panting occasionally in the humidity and yawning as 
wolfadvocates praised her docility 
owens is sponsoring a bill requiring the national park service to 
study the effect of returning wolves to yellowstone national park 
but in cheyenne wyo sen alan k simpson termed owens effort 
a misguided effort that does not consider the harm wolves could 
cause to people in the area 
at the center of the dispute is the gray wolf canis lupus 
once native to much of america but shot trapped and poisoned nearly 
to extinction over the last century or so today only alaska has 
large numbers of wolves with about 1200 in northern minnesota and 
a few reported in michigan and montana 
wolves have gotten an undeserved bad reputation because they 
howl at night and scare people and compete with us for food 
said owens wolves dont eat little children 
it has been 60 years since a wolfs howl has been heard in 
yellowstone added m rupert cutler president of the conservation 
group defenders of wildlife it never should have been silenced 
wolves were exterminated from yellowstone by hunters and 
government trappers cutler noted with the result that today 
thousands of elk and bison are over grazing the yellowstone range 
and many starve to death every winter 
wolves are needed in the northern rockies to restore the 
natural balance among animals said cutler 
although backed by defenders of wildlife the national wildlife 
federation the national parks and conservation association and 
other national and local conservation groups owens measure may 
face rough going due to opposition from ranchers who fear wolves 
will eat their sheep and cattle 
simpson condemned owens bill as a misguided and zealous effort 
to accelerate wolf reintroduction without considering in any way how 
wolves will affect other animals in yellowstone park and the very 
real human beings that also live in wyoming 
owens bill requires the study to be completed by dec 31 1991

the nations largest group of doctors says a 
medicare costcontrol plan moving through congress with bush 
administration support is nothing more than a health care 
rationing scheme 
the american medical association attacked the house ways and 
means committees approval wednesday of a medicare package that for 
the first time sets a spending target for payments to physicians in 
the program 
the ama has lobbied hard to derail this part of the package 
which is designed to help curb soaring growth in the medicare 
program by controlling the volume of services physicians provide to 
medicare patients 
but so far the organization has been losing the battle which has 
put doctors against key house democrats and republicans as well as 
the bush administration 
a spending target is nothing less than a health care rationing 
scheme for senior citizens and the disabled covered by medicare 
dr joseph t painter vice chairman of the ama board said in a 
statement after wednesdays voice vote 
furthermore what they are trying to do is make physicians do 
the dirty work of deciding which services to cut he said 
committee members who voted in closed session contend spending 
targets will not erode the quality of health care provided to the 33 
million elderly and disabled in the program but are needed to 
contain its annual 15 percent growth 
theyre dead wrong said rep willis gradison rohio 
ranking republican on the ways and means health subcommittee he 
said the amas lobbying and advertising against the plan was an 
obvious attempt to scare the frail and elderly 
meanwhile a group of house republicans introduced legislation to 
delay implementation of major provisions of medicares new 
catastrophic illness protections including a controversial income 
tax surcharge the measure introduced wednesday has 25 sponsors and 
is identical to one that failed to pass the senate by one vote 
the congressional budget office estimates that just under 40 
percent of the 33 million americans eligible for medicare have 
enough income to subject them to the surtax 
under the medicare savings package approved wednesday the first 
spending target would be set for fiscal 1990 but would have no 
impact on the medicare budget that year in future years the target 
along with a change in the payment structure for physicians would 
help curb spending backers say 
under the target system if spending exceeded the target one 
year the excess could be recouped the following year by trimming 
payment rates for services performed by physicians 
rep pete stark dcalif subcommittee chairman said the effect 
of the target on physicians fees will be imperceptible he said 
he doubted the change would give doctors reason to drop out of the 
program and refuse to take medicare patients 
the american college of surgeons successfully lobbied to have 
their own expenditure target separate from the one that would cover 
all other physicians the surgeons said they would support the 
target proposal with that change 
a third part of the plan is designed to protect medicare patients 
by limiting the amount they can be charged beyond the programs 
reimbursement rate

the securities and exchange commission is using 
greed to battle greed 
the agency by a 50 vote wednesday decided to take advantage of 
a new law giving it the power to offer cash rewards to tipsters who 
provide information leading to the conviction of inside traders 
legislation enacted in november authorizes the sec to pay 
bounties of up to 10 percent of any civil fine it collects from 
violators who use inside information to illegally profit or avoid 
loss in securities markets 
rather than relying on scorned lovers or on people who werent 
dealt in on the inside information it makes sense to treat this as 
a business matter said commission member charles c cox 
the commission will require bounty recipients to apply in 
writing starting when they first contact the sec but no later than 
180 days after a court imposes a fine within the 10 percent limit 
the sec will have sole discretion to decide whether and how much to 
pay 
meanwhile in a separate case growing out of the washington 
public power supply system default the commission voted 50 to 
adopt rules aimed at providing more information to purchasers of 
government bonds 
congress included the bounty provision in broader legislation 
passed in response to the wave of wall street corruption cases 
inside trading can be difficult to detect and the goal was to 
improve the governments chances of uncovering violations 
the reward is aimed at volunteers rather than people already 
subpoenaed by investigators although anyone can apply 
the securities industry has been skeptical arguing that 
informants will hold out for sec rewards rather than passing their 
knowledge on to firms internal compliance officers 
gary g lynch sec enforcement director said his investigators 
have received about 25 tips that could be eligible for bounties 
since the legislation passed in november 
several of the calls were extremely helpful he said 
lynch said the agency will make every effort to preserve the 
anonymity of bounty recipients when asked but said it was possible 
that a court could order release of an informants name 
the new municipal bond rules were written in response to the 1983 
default on 225 billion in revenue bonds by the washington public 
power supply system the largest municipal bond default in us 
history 
the system had issued the bonds to pay for the construction of 
two nuclear power plants but cost overruns forced it to abandon the 
projects the sec decided last september that it could not pursue 
enforcement action in the case because that would drain the agencys 
resources 
instead the sec will require firms underwriting municipal bond 
issues of more than 1 million to obtain and disclose more extensive 
and timely information about the projects being financed and the 
governments issuing the bonds 
commission member joseph a grundfest said the new regulation 
probably will not prevent defaults but forcing disclosure of more 
information will force issuers financing risky projects to pay 
higher interest rates he said

president bush will nominate commerce 
department official alfred c sikes as the next chairman of the 
federal communications commission to succeed the deregulationminded 
dennis r patrick 
the white house said wednesday that sikes a former missouri 
broadcaster will fill the seat vacated in december 1987 by mimi 
weyforth dawson for the remainder of a fiveyear term that began 
july 1 1988 
the commission has had only three of its fivemember complement 
since the 1987 resignations of dawson and former chairman mark s 
fowler patrick a republican who often has clashed with congress 
has been outnumbered by commissioners patricia diaz dennis and james 
h quello 
patrick announced in april he will resign upon confirmation of 
his successor 
sen ernest hollings dsc chairman of the senate commerce 
science and transportation committee that oversees the fcc refused 
to consider replacements offered by thenpresident reagan because of 
congressional displeasure with patrick 
hollings has expressed no opposition to sikes and two other fcc 
nominees bush proposed two weeks ago washington attorney sherrie p 
marshall a former patrick aide and illinois commerce commission 
member andrew c barrett 
quello has said he will retire when his commission ends in 1991 
dennis has indicated she would like to stay beyond friday when her 
term expires but no announcement of her fate has been made if she 
stays on the commission will be at full strength for the first time 
since 1987 
sikes 49 an assistant secretary of commerce and head of the 
national telecommunications and information administration is 
considered a moderate on regulatory issues he reportedly won out 
over marshall for the chairmans post because he was considered more 
likely to be confirmed by the senate 
sikes was being pushed for the job by sen john danforth rmo 
a longtime friend and ranking minority member of the senate commerce 
committee 
danforth through a spokesman described sikes as practical 
open and wellregarded in congress he will be confirmed 
american telephone amp telegraph co also praised the selection of 
sikes 
sikes told fcc week an industry newsletter last week i would 
describe myself as a flexible and moderate regulator i dont 
believe in regulation for regulations sake 
sikes said in in a statement released by his office wednesday 
that he is honored to be asked to lead the fcc during an 
especially challenging period 
as head of ntia since 1986 sikes has helped formulate government 
policy on telecommunications issues including governmental 
involvement in highdefinition television which is expected to be a 
major business in the 1990s

unsanitary working conditions contracting out and outright 
unionbusting 
amtrak spokeswoman sue martin said officials expect the picketing 
to cause no disruptions in service on the railroads 24000 miles of 
rails serving 500 communities she said no workers are expected to 
walk off the job 
i think were a long way from a strike she said 
ms martin said the company has been negotiating with the unions 
separately for several months with both sides applying for federal 
mediation in some of the talks 
she acknowledged that under present contracts union workers earn 
an average of about 12 percent less than employees of other 
railroads but said salaries are ahead of those for similar jobs in 
other industries 
for example she said employees who help passengers with luggage 
make 23000 a year compared to 12000 to 16000 for similar jobs 
at airports 
ms martin said the company is taking steps to improve safety and 
sanitary conditions in 35 cars used to accommodate ontrain 
employees including installation of emergency windows in all rooms 
and overhaul of the cars to meet the same standards as passenger 
cars eighteen of the crew cars have so far been refurbished she 
said 
an employee was killed in a fire aboard a dormitory car last year 
joel parker a spokesman for onboard union employees said 
company demands would amount to 100aweek pay cuts for some 
workers 
he said the union objects to the contracting out of reservations 
work and could call a strike on that issue 
ms martin confirmed that some reservations work will be handled 
by outside employees for the peak summer months however she said 
that is allowed by union agreements and the outside workers will 
supplement union workers not replace them 
the unions announced rallies in los angeles and oakland calif 
chicago boston newark nj philadelphia baltimore and 
wilmington del it also said picket lines will be set up at 
stations in seattle denver atlanta indianapolis new orleans

a former prostitute has received her 
punishment by becoming infected with aids a judge said in sparing 
her from prison 
elizabeth kay sherouse seriously ill with the deadly disease 
was once charged with attempted manslaughter for having sex with two 
men while knowing she had the aids virus 
those charges were dropped but miss sherouse 26 appeared 
before circuit judge michael cycmanick on tuesday for sentencing on 
six prostitutionrelated misdemeanors for which should could have 
been sentenced to more than four years in prison 
the judge placed her on four years probation and sent her home 
to spend her remaining days with her family 
there is no question that punishment in this case is what you 
have sustained and are enduring because of your conduct cycmanick 
told her 
miss sherouse has been living under house arrest with her mother 
for more than a year she was just released from a hospital after a 
weeklong bout with pneumonia and weighs 88 pounds 
defense lawyer bill sheaffer said she sleeps up to 15 hours a 
day eats and sees a doctor 
any sentence this court imposes would equal a life sentence for 
miss sherouse sheaffer told the judge 
with the probation order the judge closed the case that cast a 
prostitute and drug addict with a seventhgrade education in the 
national spotlight 
her arrest in december 1987 is believed to have been the first of 
a prostitute charged with attempted manslaughter in an aidsrelated 
case 
the two men wore condoms and have since tested negative for the 
virus 
cycmanick dismissed the attempted manslaughter charges last year 
saying miss sherouse showed no intent to kill the men an appeals 
court upheld the judges ruling saying the charges did not fit the 
crime 
earlier this year cycmanick also dismissed racketeering charges 
and she pleaded guilty to the six misdemeanors 
the protection of society is best served by the home 
confinement restrictions that ive assigned said the judge 
sheaffer said wednesday miss sherouse was relieved that she can 
return home to her family her health is not good 
assistant state attorney rick bogle who in the past has argued 
that miss sherouse be imprisoned agreed with the defense lawyer on 
his request for probation

members of 17 roman catholic parishes say a judge 
failed to break their spirits when he refused to block the shutdown 
of their churches 
all i can say is were in good company said leonard gross 
of our lady of the rosary parish david had a lot of opposition 
when he went up against goliath 
wayne county circuit judge james a hathaway on wednesday refused 
to grant an injunction barring the detroit archdioceses order to 
close the churches saying courts shouldnt settle religious 
disputes 
but the judge agreed to consider issuing a temporary stay of 
cardinal edmund szokas order to close the churches the delay would 
give opponents a chance to go to the michigan court of appeals a 
hearing was scheduled for this afernoon 
outside the courthouse more than 150 demonstrators marched and 
sang we shall overcome to protest the closings some carried 
signs that read jesus would be in this demonstration and we 
pray the judge to save our church 
it was jesus idea that we love one another and with a little 
effort we can do that hathaway told a packed courtroom this 
idea of walking around with posters and haranguing each other i 
dont want to see that 
we need to approach the matter from the point of trying to heal 
differences rather than exacerbate them 
the 17 churches involved in the lawsuit are among 30 that szoka 
contends are no longer financially viable since the cardinal issued 
his order in january the 15 millionmember archdiocese has closed 
16 parishes including five last weekend 
five of the 17 parishes that went to court have permission to 
remain open until july 16 and four others have longer extensions 
tied to priests retirements or church anniversaries archdiocese 
spokesman jay berman said the eight others in the lawsuit already 
have closed 
as hundreds of thousands of catholics joined the white and 
middleclass flight to the detroit suburbs in recent decades fewer 
than 50000 catholics remained in the nations sixthlargest city 
according to a church survey 
robert van cleef an attorney for the parishioners argued 
wednesday that szoka reneged on a promise to conduct open grievance 
hearings before closing parishes 
if these churches close they will be destroyed van cleef 
said theyll never come back 
but szokas attorney joseph sullivan said church members 
wouldnt suffer by having their parishes closed until all appeals to 
the vatican are exhausted 
its a little bit difficult for me to understand that 
worshiping at a church a few blocks away or a halfmile or a mile 
from where one used to worship is a serious problem he said 
church members said wednesday they havent lost all hope of 
saving their parishes 
i think another judge would have ruled differently said 
sister jolene van handel of nativity catholic church one of 25 
parishes given until 1990 to increase membership and improve 
finances or also be closed we have to keep going we dont have 
much choice 
last week priests nuns and parishioners from nine churches said 
they would defy the closing order in several cases they have held 
services outside locked buildings 
but determination to resist the closings began to crumble when 
szoka announced friday that the vatican had rejected appeals filed 
in march by 14 parishes 
a second appeal will be filed with the vatican supreme court and 
parishioners will petition pope john paul ii if that attempt fails 
van cleef said

efforts to fund a 5 billion atomsmasher in 
texas president bushs home state now move to the senate as part 
of an 185 billion spending bill for energy and water projects 
house members fearing that water projects in their own states 
might also falter voted overwhelmingly against an amendment 
wednesday to delete bushs request for the superconducting super 
collider from the measure 
later approved on a voice vote the fiscal 1990 spending measure 
for energy and water projects also quadruples funds to 636 
million for environmental cleanups at the nations nuclear weapons 
plants 
similar legislation has yet to move through the senate where 
another attempt may be made to eliminate 110 million to begin 
construction on the highenergy physics research project 
located 25 miles south of dallas the project would consist of 
two giant rings 53 miles around for accelerating and colliding 
protons into each other in an effort to examine subatomic particles 
physicists hope the device to be completed in 1999 will enable 
them to duplicate for the first time but on an infinitesimally 
small scale the conditions of the big bang theory of creation 
the ssc is a critical part of this administrations initiative 
to strengthen the position of the nation as a world leader in 
science and technology the white house said in a statement 
wednesday 
it will produce discoveries innovations and spinoffs that 
could touch profoundly on every american 
opponents expressed fears that the super colliders construction 
cost will balloon to 900 million a year and squeeze out funds for 
research on improving computers and finding a cancer cure 
but the attempt to delay construction was defeated on a 33093 
vote after bush personally appealed to key legislators 
chief among them was rep tom bevil dala who as chairman of 
the house appropriations energy and water development subcommittee 
holds the spending keys to hundreds of water projects in every state 
rep sherwood boehlert rny one of the sponsors of the 
amendment to strike super collider construction funds from the bill 
said the effort failed partly because of widespread fears of 
antagonizing bevil 
the bill includes 11 billion for construction of 93 army corps 
of engineer water projects 37 of them new in 39 states plus 661 
million for interior department water projects in 10 western states 
the energy department has put a 49 billion price tag on the 
super collider project but the congressional budget office 
estimates it will cost at least 64 billion

a private study shows that farm policy is 
gradually moving toward the free market and away from reliance on 
government programs that date back to the early 1930s 
the evolution of agricultural policy toward less government 
intervention and control is a very positive trend based on 
fundamental economic and social changes the report said 
agriculture today is very different than it was in the 1930s when 
most of our current programs were designed 
the study released by washington consultants lesher russell and 
moos for the farm industrys agricultural policy working group said 
agriculture is a much more integral part of the national economy 
today than 60 years ago 
farms also more closely resemble nonagricultural businesses 
across the nation than farms of half a century ago the study said 
farm law passed in 1985 expires next year and congress has begun 
preliminary work on a 1990 bill 
although the current law the food security act of 1985 is 
noted for its major commodity programs and their various 
pricesupport mechanisms it includes provisions for food stamps 
nutrition conservation trade credit research and many other 
functions 
the study concentrates on the crop programs including wheat 
feed grains cotton and soybeans and their effect on the nations 
economy 
officials of the consulting company include bill lesher and randy 
russell senior economists in the agriculture department in the 
early reagan years and chief architects of the 1985 farm 
legislation gene moos is a former agricultural aide to house 
speaker thomas s foley dwash 
members of the sponsoring group are major companies deeply 
involved in agriculturalrelated enterprises cargill inc central 
soya company inc louis dreyfus corp imc fertilizer group inc 
monsanto co nabisco brands inc and norfolk southern corp 
the study was done by government research corp part of the 
public relations firm hill and knowlton and economic perspectives 
inc of mclean va part of sparks commodities inc of memphis 
tenn 
one course the study said would be for congress to extend 
current farm law which is regarded to have worked well but 
tacking on another five years would produce a stagnant sector 
severely limited by sluggish market growth 
another option calling for planting flexibility would retain 
the basic structure of the 1985 farm law but without specific crop 
acreage bases instead the acreage bases for such crops as wheat 
corn and cotton plus the acreage typically planted to soybeans 
would be combined into a single farm base 
acreage idling programs would still be used to control 
production but the setasides would be from the whole farm base 
not specific crop bases 
the flexibility option over five years would result in smaller 
annual carryover supplies or surpluses faster market growth and 
somewhat higher incomes for farmers the report said 
a third option would be to continue federal income supports to 
farmers but without annual requirements for idling specific crop 
acreages farmers would be free to plant what they choose 
the report said this would require a transition period during 
which prices and sales receipts would decline but that declining 
farm income could be avoided by making federal income support 
payments larger in the early years 
following about two years of adjustment increased market 
growth would bring price recovery and higher incomes as well the 
report said 
but analysts said that perhaps the greatest difference between 
this and other options is what it could mean for the future 
as us products become more competitive and more widely 
available markets expand significantly resulting in much stronger 
future growth they said

the agriculture department expanded a drought 
emergency measure to permit hay cuttings on land taken out of 
production under the longterm conservation reserve program 
effective immediately qualifying farmers in counties where a 
livestock emergency has been determined to exist may cut hay from 
permanent wildlife habitat acres enrolled in the crp officials 
said wednesday 
haying may not be closer than 20 feet to shrubs or trees 
established as part of the habitat practice and is subject to the 
earlier provision that at least 25 percent of the field much be left 
undisturbed for wildlife cover the department said 
haying of alfalfa used for temporary cover was also authorized 
providing the ground is prepared immediately for planting permanent 
cover at the next normal opportunity for seeding

agriculture secretary clayton yeutter says milk 
price supports will be cut sharply on july 1 removing a temporary 
increase ordered last year to help droughtstricken dairy farmers 
congress specified in the disaster assistance act of 1988 that 
milk price supports be boosted 50 cents per 100 pounds from april 1 
through june 30 that put the basic support price at 1110 per 
hundredweight 
effective july 1 the support will revert back to the 1060 
level yeutter said wednesday 
the national milk producers federation had estimated the 
threemonth boost of 50 cents per hundredweight provided an 
additional 300 million in revenues for dairy farmers

a juror in oliver norths trial acknowledges 
she forgot to disclose her brothers prison record when she was

us district judge gerhard a gesell said he would rule today on 
claims by norths lawyers that juror tara kings misstatements

a fatherly figure sentenced to death more 
than 40 years ago for his communist activities holds the key to a 
political deadlock that has gripped greece since elections failed to 
form a government 
harilaos florakis the 75yearold leader of the coalition of the 
left and progress has suddenly been thrust into the limelight as he 
approaches the twilight of his political career 
florakis jailed for 17 years after the countrys civil war has 
spent his entire career criticizing the united states and its bases 
in this nato nation and pressing each government in office to 
withdraw from the alliance 
his coalition dominated by florakis promoscow greek communist 
party kke won 28 parliamentary seats in the june 18 general 
election enough to play the kingmakers role 
the incumbent panhellenic socialist movement pasok took 125 
seats and the conservative new democracy won 145 but neither can 
govern without leftist suppport because a majority is needed in the 
300member parliament 
florakis has become the grand old man of greek politics no one 
could imagine years ago that a communist would play such an 
important role in our political life said a conservative deputy 
who spoke on condition of anonymity 
florakis emerged as a leader in the illegal greek communist 
movement after fighting alongside national resistance forces against 
the nazis during world war ii 
two years after the nazis left communists under the guise of a 
greek liberation army attempted to seize power kicking off a bloody 
threeyear civil war that ended in 1949 and a humiliating defeat for 
the communists 
florakis then a 33yearold idealist with training as a 
telegraphist led the communist 1st regiment of the greek liberation 
army and was condemned to death by a military tribunal for his role 
in the civil war 
like thousands of communists who fought and lost against the 
americanbacked greek nationalist army he was imprisoned others 
were exiled to barren islands or remote villages thousands of 
communists also fled to east bloc countries and the soviet union 
never knowing when they could return home 
but time healed many wounds as communist exiles slowly came back 
to greece in december 1982 premier andreas papandreou head of a 
socialist administration allowed mass repatriation in an effort at 
national reconciliation 
florakis spent 17 years in prison for his communist activities 
which should have made him bitter but colleagues say he holds no 
grudge 
the pipesmoking silverhaired florakis a widower who never had 
children looks more today like a college professor with his 
conservative dress 
in a spirit of political change conservative premier constantine 
caramanlis officially recognized the kke in 1974 months after the 
collapse of a sevenyear military dictatorship and with 
recognition florakis was appointed secretary general the kkes top 
position 
florakis now holds the balance of power so far he has been able 
to frustrate attempts by new democracy and pasok at forming a 
coalition government 
he says he wants a coalition of widespread acceptance that 
can fully examine greek political life especially former pasok 
ministers accused of involvement in a multimilliondollar 
embezzlement scandal at the bank of crete 
we want a government that will not be accused of attempting to 
cover up the scandals a government that will not be accused of 
seeking revenge he said

hundreds of imprisoned chinese activists are in 
danger of being executed on the whim of officialdom and their 
safety may depend on protests from abroad amnesty international 
said today 
the international human rights organization said its fears for 
hundreds of people detained since the prodemocracy movement was 
violently crushed june 4 were based on chinas notorious record 
of executions and unfair trials 
chinese authorities have announced 27 executions since soldiers 
killed hundreds of unarmed civilians in clearing central beijing of 
protesters 
amnesty said there have been 33 executions though unconfirmed 
unofficial reports estimated that hundreds have been put to 
death about 1800 people have been arrested 
the group said chinas practice of verdict first trial 
second resulted in as many as 30000 people being executed in an 
anticrime drive between 1983 and 1987 many after unfair and 
summary trials 
offenses ranged from murder and rape to stealing bicycles 
hanging political slogans and stealing museum antiques 
in such a situation the lives of defendants facing capital 
charges depend totally on the whim of officialdom amnesty said in 
a statement their only hope may be the voices raised on their 
behalf outside china by governments and ordinary people around the 
world 
the group rejected the notion that chinese authorities are 
impervious to foreign pleas for restraint noting that recent 
efforts to reassure visiting trade delegations shows their concern 
for world opinion 
those executed this month were charged with violent offenses but 
there is no way of determining whether the charges bore any 
relation to reality because of the swiftness of the proceedings 
and the absence of adequate safeguards for the defense amnesty said 
our concerns are heightened by the number of people believed to 
have been arrested after the nationwide demonstrations in may and 
early june and the danger of many of them being charged with the 
wide battery of capital offenses provided for by chinese law it 
said 
china has announced that 10 people were executed because of the 
unrest and accused the 17 others of seriously endangering public 
order 
amnesty said trials and appeals are usually mere formalities 
in china that people are often executed within days of arrest and 
that there is no presumption of innocence in chinese law 
it said many accused are not given enough time to prepare a 
defense and that lawyers may meet clients only when the indictment 
is served in death penalty and other serious cases the law permits 
courts to give a copy of the indictment to defendants only when the 
trial starts it said 
the world must make the chinese government aware that human 
rights violations on the scale of the past few weeks will not be 
forgotten said amnesty winner of the 1977 nobel peace prize

northwest lawmakers say despite the collapse of

momentum has been lost but the public should know that we will

washington state congressional delegations wednesday 
lastminute efforts to revive a compromise that came out of a 
weekend timber summit collapsed wednesday and congressmen said 
they would not try and attach it to the house interior 
appropriations bill today 
however legislative action may still be possible when the senate 
considers the spending bill in late july 
aucoin and other lawmakers blamed environmentalists for scuttling 
the compromise but officials of national environmental groups said 
they too were prepared to continue negotiations and thought the 
proposal offered a framework for a possible solution

a house panel has dealt a major setback to 
efforts by nuclear power supporters to simplify and shorten reactor 
licensing 
the energy and commerce committee on wednesday voted 2220 to 
omit from a nuclear regulatory commission budget bill a provision 
that would have allowed a utility to get both a construction permit 
and an operating license at the same time 
under current law the nuclear regulatory commission must wait 
until construction is complete to commence hearings on whether to 
grant an operating license 
a major streamlining of commission rules which took effect last 
month limits the issues that can be raised in hearings on an 
operating license but without legislation the commission may not do 
away with that step 
the industry believes the new commission rules will not produce 
the simplification the commission expects and will not do enough to 
remove uncertainty 
the industry has complained for years that the twostage process 
takes too much time and causes too much financial risk since the 
second hearing opens the door to lastminute challenges that can 
kill plants that already are completed

the department of housing and urban development 
gave millions of dollars in aid to apartment projects around the 
country in 1987 and 1988 that did not meet the departments 
eligibility requirements according to an auditors report 
the funds came from a special discretionary fund controlled by 
thomas demery then an assistant hud secretary that was intended to 
help financially ailing projects insured by the federal housing 
administration according to the report released wednesday by rep 
bill green rny 
green said the audit of 25 projects that got grants in the 1987 
and 1988 fiscal years showed found 11 did not meet hud 
qualifications and that 30 million to 35 million went to 
undeserving or lowneed projects 
that also means more needy projects went without help and some 
of those ultimately failed adding to the fhas insurance costs 
said green a former hud regional housing administrator and the 
ranking republican on the house appropriations housing subcommittee 
many of the discretionary funds were made in direct conflict 
with existing office of housing policies the report concluded 
according to todays editions of the new york times 
documentation was not available to justify why these policies 
were not followed for the particular awards the times quoted the 
report as saying consequently these awards raise concern as to 
whether any other factors entered into the decisionmaking process 
in some cases local hud offices had recommended against awarding 
federal assistance to the apartment projects while in others the 
local hud office was bypassed according to the audit of the section 
8 discretionary loan management setaside program 
in one instance a chicago apartment owner received 11 million 
from hud even though the apartment building had 100 percent 
occupancy no tenants paying more than 40 percent of their income in 
rent and was rated by hud as being at no financial risk 
the audit covered grants for the 1987 and 1988 fiscal years the 
report was completed march 31 1989 
the program was designed to avoid failures of troubled housing 
projects insured by hud through the fha failure requires hud to 
assume the mortgages 
under the program projects with low vacancy rates andor low 
tenant income levels are eligible for subsidies to improve a 
buildings cash flow and ability to meet mortgage payments 
many of the projects receiving awards did not file formal 
requests for aid through local hud offices but went directly to 
headquarters according to the audit 
demery told the times that decisions were made only on merit and 
need

agreement that would open japans multibillion dollar tokyo 
marketplace to american cellular telephones and ease restraints on 
business radios 
the agreement reached in washington wednesday after 10 days of 
highlevel talks averts a threatened showdown on usjapan 
telecommunications trade washington had said it was prepared to 
impose tariffs of as much as 100 percent on more than 50 japanese 
electronics exports 
i am very pleased that the significance of our countrys effort 
and proposals toward solving the issue was understood by the us 
government i hope again that the latest agreement will contribute 
to maintaining and developing japanus friendly relations 
kanezo muraoka minister of posts and telecommunications told a 
news conference wednesday night

morning also hailed as very good the accord reached between the 
two countries kyodo news service said 
the latest agreement affects cellular phones and thirdparty 
radios including pagers and equipment for dispatching taxis and 
delivery trucks 
motorola inc the major american maker of cellular phones and 
business radios based in schaumberg ill contended that the 
japanese restrictions were caysing it 2 billions in lost sales of 
five years 
the american company began selling its cellular phones in japan 
through a japanese company dainidenden inc in 1987 
but motorolas phones do not work in the tokyo area because 
motorola equipment is not compatible with the cellular phone network

a prosecutor hailed the racketeering convictions 
of seven men linked to 11 killings as a victory over some of the 
most vicious and violent mobsters 
the number and ferocity of the crimes charged and proved in 
this case are difficult to comprehend for normal individuals us 
attorney benito romano said they ruled their turf with absolute 
disregard for human life 
five of the defendants were involved in the slayings that 
prosecutors claimed were carried out in connection with other crimes 
committed by associates of the gambino family 
the crimes included narcotics trafficking pornography auto 
theft loan sharking and extortion 
among those slain were witnesses and intermediaries for florida 
drug dealers some victims were dismembered and put in garbage bags 
a defense attorney benjamin brafman said there would be an 
appeal 
he said the verdict showed the patent unfairness of a 
multidefendant trial which took 17 months and was one of the 
longest federal criminal trials ever 
if you put enough defendants in a room and enough criminal 
charges in an indictment and if the trial takes long enough the 
jurors will feel an obligation to convict in light of the enormous 
time and expenditure of the government he said 
after the verdict us district judge vincent l broderick 
immediately revoked the bail of all but one defendant 
these defendants were the most vicious and violent members and 
associates of organized crime that have ever been brought to 
trial romano said new yorkers can feel a little safer today 
and the mob i think considerably weaker 
prosecutors said the crew which operated out of an apartment in 
brooklyn was headed by roy demeo who was killed by gang members in 
a power struggle in 1983 
jurors who heard 207 witnesses appeared grim and tired as the 
foreman read back guilty verdicts on all 17 counts 
they had deliberated 12 days 
the numerous murder allegations were part of racketeering and 
conspiracy charges against anthony senter 34 ronald ustica 44 
joseph testa 34 salvatore mangialino 52 and douglas rega 39 
other defendants convicted of racketeering in counts that did not 
include murder allegations were sol hellman 63 and carlo profeta 
46 hellman was allowed to remain free on bail 
testa and senter who were convicted of conspiring to murder a 
witness against the stolen car operation face possible life 
sentences the other defendants could receive prison terms of 20 
years 
broderick scheduled sentencing for sept 13 
the case which dates from a 1984 indictment is one of the last 
in a series of widely publicized mobrelated prosecutions brought 
by thenus attorney rudolph giuliani 
the original 78count indictment charged that paul castellano 
headed a racketeering enterprise the gambino family 
us district judge kevin t duffy who originally had the case 
broke it up in 1985 with the first trial focusing on a cartheft 
ring that allegedly stole hundreds of cars in new york 
before the conclusion of that case castellano was slain outside 
a restaurant eventually six of eight defendants in that trial were 
convicted of various charges

a new experimental version of a drug that 
interrupts heart attacks is a step toward cutting treatment cost and 
possibly reducing risk of a second heart attack after therapy a 
researcher says 
laboratory results reported today are part of an effort to create 
a version of tissue plasminogen activator that will work longer in 
the body said joseph sambrook 
a longerlasting version might make treatment cheaper by 
permitting smaller doses of the drug called tpa he said 
tpa treatment which costs about 2000 requires a continuous 
infusion over a few hours because a given dose works only briefly 
in contrast treatment with a drug called streptokinase 
administered in a single injection costs about onetenth as much 
tpa stops heart attacks by dissolving blood clots most heart 
attacks occur when a clot plugs an artery that feeds blood to part 
of the heart muscle 
but some patients who get tpa therapy develop another clot after 
the treatment stops putting them at risk for another heart attack 
if tpa can be made to remain active longer it may reduce the 
tendency toward forming clots after therapy stops sambrook said 
sambrook a biochemist at the university of texas southwestern 
medical center in dallas reports on one tpa variant in todays 
issue of the british journal nature with colleagues from the medical 
center and the howard hughes medical institute there 
in test tube experiments the variant remained largely potent 
when exposed to substances in blood that deactivate the current 
form of the drug 
such deactivation is one reason the current version of tpa acts 
only briefly another is the fact that it is removed from the 
bloodstream by the liver sambrook said 
because of this animal studies will be needed to assess 
persistence of altered versions of tpa said edgar haber president 
of the squibb institute for medical research in princeton nj 
some researchers have altered tpa to hamper removal by the liver 
and perhaps that approach can be combined with that of the new study 
to create a longerlasting drug he and sambrook said

a federal judge has ordered a special grand jury 
impaneled to investigate alleged environmental violations at rocky 
flats nuclear weapons plant 
us energy secretary james watkins meanwhile pledged that the 
plant will be run safely or not at all he said however that an 
agreement signed with gov roy romer will help ensure that it is run 
properly 
theres a whole new ball game at rocky flats watkins said 
wednesday during a visit to new mexico we have put in a new team 
of line managers working with a new site manager 
the agreement signed during a meeting at the waste isolation 
pilot plant near carlsbad nm will allow colorado to monitor 
rocky flats more closely romer said 
in denver us district court judge sherman finesilver said a 
23member special grand jury was needed because of the possibility 
of a long and complicated investigation it will be the first time 
in 27 years that a special grand jury was called in the federal 
district of colorado said court clerk jim manspeaker 
the special grand jury will have to utilize its complete 
energies in pursuance of this directive finesilver said colorado 
has two regular grand juries 
on jun 6 fbi and environmental protection agency investigators 
raided the plant 15 miles northwest of denver looking for evidence 
of criminal environmental violations including illegal disposal of 
hazardous wastes the department of energy plant is operated by 
rockwell international and uses plutonium to make triggers for 
nuclear bombs 
the fbi affidavit that led to the search warrant alleged that 
plant workers illegally burned and dumped hazardous wastes and that 
the plant illegally discharged pollutants into two creeks that flow 
into water supplies serving four suburbs 
agents completed the search of rocky flats last week and are now 
checking truckloads of documents 
acting us attorney mike norton said unlike a regular grand 
jury the special grand jury will have the power to issue public 
reports on its investigation even if no criminal activity is found 
finesilver issued the order wednesday at the request of the 
prosecutors the 23 jurors are to be chosen and ready for duty aug 
1 
romer hailed the decision 
i welcome anything that helps get the complete facts on the 
table we need to remove the mystery about rocky flats and i think a 
grand jury will help accomplish that i want all of the truth to 
come out romer said 
the agreement signed by watkins and romer was worked out two 
weeks ago after the justice department announced its rocky flats 
investigation watkins said the purpose of the agreement was to 
ensure the plant was run safely 
if either of us is not convinced of that then well both shut 
it down he said 
the waste isolation pilot plant near carlsbad also was a focus of 
the meeting the plant proposed as the nations first permanent 
nuclear waste repository originally was scheduled to open last 
october 
that date was revised to september 1989 but watkins said this 
week it wont open until the federal government shows it can safely 
transport and bury nuclear waste 
we will open wipp but we will open it when its ready 
watkins said at a news conference following a meeting with the 
governors of new mexico idaho and colorado 
the governors said they were pleased with watkins takecharge 
attitude toward the growing nuclear waste problem but they were 
unwilling to budge on their stance toward the problem 
new mexico gov garrey carruthers said his state wont accept any 
nuclear waste until doe meets all commitments to the state gov 
cecil andrus said idaho wont accept any more waste after august 
and romer said he will shut down the rocky flats if its storage 
capacity is met

california gets an overall d grade for its 
efforts to keep children healthy in school and out of jail 
according to a report card from an advocacy group 
im anything but proud of the results that have been achieved 
in california for children said wendy lazarus of children now 
which released the report wednesday we cannot tolerate a 
situation in which we are losing so much in human lives 
the nonprofit nonpartisan group founded last year based its 
childrens report card on 27 factors such as test scores and 
the number of children in foster homes and jails 
the report was strongly criticized by gov george deukmejian 
california spends more on poor children than any other 
state he said if that deserves a d the report card deserves 
an f 
but state schools chief william honig agreed with the reports 
conclusion 
there is a major problem on comprehensive childrens 
programs he said theres been an explosive growth in poverty 
and were all going to pay the price 
statistics gathered by children now showed that compared to other 
states california ranked worse than the national average in many 
areas ranging from the studentteacher ratio in classes to the 
number of youth homicides 
the statistics indicated that the number of children living in 
poverty 16 million rose 47 percent between 1981 and 1987 and 
that child abuse reports jumped 135 percent between 1980 and 1988 
the report also found that the percentage of juveniles locked up 
in california is twice as high as in the nation overall and the 
states teenage pregnancy rate is the second highest in the country 
but the state fared better than most in a few areas including 
infant mortality rates scholastic aptitude test scores for 
collegebound students and public assistance payments 
the grades were compiled by a panel of five based on statistics 
from various state and federal agencies 
the panel included california supreme court justice allen 
broussard stanford university president donald kennedy former us 
secretary of education shirley hufstedler teacher jaime escalante 
whose life was depicted in the film stand and deliver and 
former baseball commissioner peter ueberroth

an imprisoned bigamist who made the guinness 
book of world records for having more than 100 wives is seeking 
his freedom on the grounds he received bad legal advice 
but a magistrate has delayed making a decision on the case 
donald e wilkes jr a university of georgia law professor on 
wednesday told us magistrate morton sitver that giovanni vigliotto 
was influenced by questionable counsel when he withdrew his appeal 
of his 1983 conviction 
vigliotto now a 60yearold diabetic and a stroke victim who 
needs a wheelchair is serving a 34year prison term for bigamy and 
fraud he once acknowledged having married 105 women without 
divorcing them becoming the subject of the news talk shows and 
madefortv movies 
state assistant attorney general joe maziarz asked sitver to 
dismiss the petition with prejudice meaning it could not be 
refiled because vigliotto had withdrawn his appeal and failed to 
appeal systematically through the state courts 
maziarz said the state courts have bent over backwards for 
the bigamist and even have appointed an attorney to discuss with 
vigliotto his decision to withdraw his appeal 
instead vigliotto refused to talk to the attorney calling him 
a lackey of the court and a friend of the judges maziarz told 
sitver 
sitver gave vigliottos counsel 20 days to submit a revised writ 
for habeas corpus to conform with arizona requirements and said he 
would issue his decision once that was done 
private investigator patricia oconnor who is coordinating an 
effort to free the former fleamarket trader who has been declared 
indigent by maricopa superior court said several other lawyers have 
been hired to represent vigliotto 
i thought i was going to be here by myself wilkes said 
before leaving to catch a plane he was flanked by several others in 
the courtroom during a posthearing press conference 
the vigliotto case is arizonas mississippi burning in my 
view said ralph temple a former director of the american civil 
liberties union in washington 
temple said he and the others were aiding vigliotto because he 
was denied a fair trial and was dealt an irrationally severe 
sentence 
maziarz said later that vigliottos sentencing was more severe 
because of prior convictions 
vigliottos petition was filed in federal court because the state 
has frustrated his attempts for due process in denying him access to 
legal materials needed for a trial temple said 
asked whether arizonas courts were capable of giving vigliotto a 
fair trail attorney edwin sigel said they havent done it in the 
past 
vigliottos legal team claims 277 instances of judicial and 
prosecutorial misconduct and ineffective counsel

delegates arriving for the national 
right to life committees annual convention were met by prochoice 
pickets and asked not to engage in civil disobedience at abortion 
clinics 
about 1200 members of the nations largest antiabortion lobby 
were beginning their meeting today as the us supreme court was 
expected to release its decision on a missouri law restricting 
abortion availability and defining life as starting at conception 
on wednesday mayor don fraser of nearby minneapolis urged 
conventioneers to remain within the law in any demonstrations 
several prochoice pickets walked outside the radisson south 
hotel later in the day as delegates arrived 
if they break the law well ask the police to intervene but 
wed like to avoid that fraser told reporters as about 30 
antiabortion protesters held up posters of fetuses and fetal parts 
representatives of abortion clinics in the twin cities area had 
asked the mayors of minneapolis st paul and bloomington to issue 
pleas against civil disobedience while conventioneers are in 
minnesota mayors george latimer of st paul and kurt laughinghouse 
of bloomington issued no statements 
with the convention coming into town i think its appropriate 
that we call upon our mayors to set a tone said jeri rasmussen 
executive director of midwest health center for women one of six 
twin cities clinics that perform abortions 
rasmussen said at a news conference she was especially concerned 
following a demonstration at her downtown minneapolis clinic friday 
police arrested 153 abortion opponents who blocked the clinic 
entrance and packed the hallway outside the clinic 
clearly there are differing views on the abortion issue in the 
united states and in this community fraser said active 
vigorous debate and dissent is a part of our american freedoms 
our concern is that protest and dissent be peaceful and 
especially that those dissenting not inflict harm on others 
rasmussen said the last three conferences of the national right 
to life committee which claims 2500 local affiliates in 50 states 
have coincided with attacks on clinics 
what were anticipating is conducting our clinic as usual but 
were prepared for any eventuality rasmussen said 
jackie schweitz executive director of minnesota citizens 
concerned for life the conventions host group said neither her 
organization nor the national right to life committee is involved in 
civil disobedience 
i dont know of any demonstrations planned the business of 
this convention is education schweitz said as delegates look at 
ways to provide alternatives to abortion infanticide and euthanasia

the national wildlife federation today said 
people who eat lake michigan sport fish face a greater risk of 
cancer than previously believed due to toxic contamination 
wisconsin health officials and toxicpollution experts however 
criticized the nations largest conservation organizations 
estimates of cancer risk as too high and likely to confuse fish 
eaters 
the federation calculated that over a lifetime a person who eats 
as few as 11 meals of lake michigan lake trout longer than 30 inches 
faces a one in 10000 risk of cancer the figures were based on 
levels of four toxic chemicals the fish are likely to contain 
the wildlife federation recommended that pregnant women women 
who intend to have children nursing mothers and children age 15 or 
younger not eat any lake trout brown trout chinook salmon coho 
salmon walleye or yellow perch from the lake 
in a 17page booklet produced after two years of research the 
federation also urges fishermen to pressure public officials to 
control toxicchemical pollution in the lake 
the problem is the pollution sources and the solution is to 
insist that industry and government clean them up federation 
president jay d hair said 
wisconsin officials said the groups recommendations may confuse 
fishermen and their families because it conflicts with a lake 
michigan fish advisory jointly issued by wisconsin michigan 
illinois and indiana 
the joint health advisory does not advise women and children 
against eating lake trout less than 20 inches long coho less than 
26 inches long chinook less than 21 inches long or brook trout or 
perch 
the longer and older a fish the more likely it is have in its 
tissues toxic chemicals like pcbs and the pesticides ddt dieldrin 
and chordane 
all its going to do is confuse the public on an issue thats 
already complex lee liebenstein toxic substances specialist in 
wisconsins department of natural resources said of the report 
weve got experts arguing among themselves in the media and 
thats a nowin situation 
what theyve done is not an accurate estimation of the true 
risk said dr henry anderson chief of environmental epidemiology 
for the wisconsin division of health its a very conservative 
assessment 
dean heili of manitowoc legislative chairman of the wisconsin 
federation of great lakes sport fishing clubs said his group is 
sticking with the advice issued by the four states 
public health and water quality standards are too important to 
be used as political footballs he said 
lake michigan fishing is a 48 billion a year business heili 
said and employs 36000 people in wisconsin alone 
mark van putten director of the wildlife federations great 
lakes natural resource center in ann arbor mich said his group 
shares the concern that conflicting advice could cause confusion 
but according to the wildlife federation the four states 
advice is based on outdated us food and drug administration 
numbers lake michigan anglers also eat more fish than the average 
american a figure used by the fda to base its calculations van 
putten said 
what were talking about is giving the people the best 
information thats available he said we are a conservation and 
education organization and this is consistent with our mission 
but wisconsins liebenstein defended the states advisory we 
believe what we have is very good at protecting the public health

long island lighting co shareholders have 
overwhelmingly approved a deal that could make shoreham the first 
licensed nuclear power plant in the nation to be abandoned before 
coming on line 
the agreement approved wednesday by 95 percent of the 
shareholders calls for the utility to sell shoreham for 1 to the 
long island power authority a state agency 
in exchange a tentative rate hike schedule was established under 
which the company gets 11 increases over 10 years of about 5 percent 
each the state public service commission must approve each increase 
the federal nuclear regulatory commission still must give 
permission to the company to sell the plant and to long island power 
authority to dismantle it 
deputy secretary of energy w henson moore said the shareholders 
vote is not a fatal blow to the shoreham nuclear power plant nor 
is it a fatal blow to the energy future for the people of long 
island 
moore vowed to preserve the option of using shoreham in the 
future by trying to thwart the transfer of the plant to the state 
agency 
long island lighting chairman william catacosinos told 
shareholders he doubts the energy department can legally block the 
sale or keep the plant from being dismantled 
gov mario cuomo called the federal governments sudden 
interest regarding shoreham all the more troubling in view of 
the unfolding scandal surrounding its own nuclear facilities and the 
threats they pose to public safety and national security 
energy officials say nuclear power is essential to reducing the 
countrys need for imported oil long island lighting is almost 
entirely dependent on foreign oil 
in april the nrc granted a license to shoreham to operate at 
full power previously the plant was licensed to operate at 5 
percent shoreham was completed in 1985 10 years behind schedule 
at a cost of 55 billion it was supposed to cost 261 million 
other plants have been abandoned before completion 
the campaign to close shoreham centered on contentions by state 
and local officials that long island could never be safely evacuated 
in the event of a nuclear accident 
most of the 20 shareholders who spoke at the companys annual 
meeting denounced the plants demise but catacosinos called for an 
end to the uncertainty surrounding shoreham which nearly bankrupted 
the utility in 1984 
the shareholders also approved settlement of a classaction 
lawsuit under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act 
in which suffolk county charged that long island lighting had lied 
about costs and the progress of shoreham to get rate hikes 
a federal jury convicted the utility but a judge threw out the 
case a lawyer for the ratepayers settled the case for 390 million 
to be refunded to ratepayers in monthly bills over 10 years 
meantime the nrc has begun its investigation of improper control

the tenacity of two detectives finally paid off 
when a 27yearold man was convicted of killing a boy 10 years ago 
after he refused to hand over his new 10speed bicycle 
pedro lozado was convicted wednesday in the death of 12yearold 
tireak ghandy lozado faces a mandatory sentence of life in prison 
when hes sentenced aug 10 
on july 30 1979 tireak took his new 250 bike to yankee stadium 
the kid was doing what every kid who ever grew up in the bronx 
did he rode his bike to yankee stadium detective john hennessy 
said last year after he and detective jerry dunn finally got enough 
evidence to arrest lozado 
tireak was leaving the stadium when lozado demanded the bike 
when the boy resisted lozado stabbed him in the heart 
this guy was a lot bigger than him he could have smacked the 
kid in the mouth and taken the bike thats all he really had to do 
he didnt have to stab him hennessy said 
as tireak fell the attacker snatched a basketball from his hands 
and escaped on his bike the child was bleeding so badly that police 
didnt wait for an ambulance but drove him to the hospital 
themselves he was dead before they reached the emergency room 
after getting a lead during questioning of another man hennessy

serving three years for criminal possession of stolen property 
he couldnt believe that after all these years it had caught 
up with him dunn said at the time i guess he figured hed beat

two leading chinese dissidents who escaped to 
the west plan to form a new organization and move their 
prodemocracy campaign to a base outside china a hong kong activist 
said today 
student leader wuer kaixi and intellectual yan jiaqi are 
expected to release a joint statement next week calling on chinese 
people in and out of china to continue the struggle for 
democracy said the activist who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the pair were smuggled out of china by a hong kongbased 
underground railroad both are reportedly in hiding in a western 
country 
in statements written after they fled china both men called for 
the overthrow of the current leadership in china 
wuer in an 18minute videotaped message called chinas leaders 
wild beasts and predicted their government would fall 
those of us who remain alive our lives are no longer our 
own he said on the tape the lives of those classmates and 
countrymen who died for democracy for freedom and for our beautiful 
motherland have melted into ours 
in a letter written after his escape yan said chinas 
political situation is in the midst of a white terror 
he said the chinese leaderships inhuman policies have not only 
intensified the peoples desire for revenge and planted the seeds of 
democracy and freedom in the hearts of more and more people they 
also hastened their demise 
wuer a freshman at beijing normal university was one of the 
top leaders of the student movement for democratic reform he also 
was one of 21 students sought by chinas government for his role in 
what the authorities called a counterrevolutionary rebellion 
yan was one of the founding members of an independent union of 
beijing intellectuals who participated actively in the protests his 
name was placed on an another government wantedlist of 
intellectuals 
chinese troops crushed the prodemocracy movement on june 34 
when they opened fire on unarmed crowds in central beijing killing 
hundreds of people 
the activist said details of the new organization had yet to be 
worked out there are currently a number of organizations in the 
united states canada france and great britain devoted to 
establishing democracy in china 
but several of them including the new yorkbased chinese 
alliance for democracy have been convulsed by internal strife 
caused by both personal and ideological clashes 
some organizations are supported by taiwans nationalist 
government while others claim to be independent 
if these groups can solve their problems western experts on 
china say they could play an important role in transforming china 
a leading chinese dissident liu binyan recently urged overseas 
chinese to send weapons prodemocracy pamphlets and money to 
underground groups on the mainland 
overseas chinese organizations and money played an important role 
in the overthrow of the qing dynasty in 1911 by sun yatsen 
sun relied on chinese money in hawaii new york san francisco 
and hong kong to fuel his rebellion against the decadent qing 
chinese students abroad also played an important role in the 
chinese communist revolution late premier zhou enlai and senior 
leader deng xiaoping both lived in france and received political 
education there other communists were schooled in moscow 
today chinese has tens of thousands of students in the west 
including about 30000 in the united states

a soviet mig29 jet fighter that crashed in flames 
at the paris air show went down because a small bird was sucked into 
its engine a commission has concluded 
specialists found feathers sticking to the wrecked engines 
blades the newspaper socialist industry said today quoting the 
head of the frenchsoviet panels soviet contingent donat 
ogorodnikov 
the commissions findings absolved the organizers of the june air 
show of all blame the newspaper said 
some reports had said another plane taxiing near the lowflying 
mig29 might have kicked up a stone from the runway that flew into 
the migs engine 
that assumption threw a shadow on the organizers of the show

the fighter crashed june 8 as it was making its final pass over 
the le bourget airfield north of paris its pilot anatoly kvochur 
survived after ejecting from the lowflying jet and plummeting to 
the ground with his parachute only partly opened

and destroyed nine structures

came into the structure area but no buildings were lost capt 
will donaldson of the california department of forestry said early 
today 
more than 200 families living on the lake elsinore shore and in 
the mountains nearby were evacuated because of the 6500acre fire 
that started tuesday in the cleveland national forest 60 miles 
southeast of los angeles 
the fire destroyed six structures and forced the evacuation of a 
youth correctional facility a nudist colony and many homes and 
cabins it threatened an undisclosed number of homes on the lake and 
in the mountains 
three firefighters suffered back injuries more than 750 battled 
the blaze which jumped two fire lines 
im nervous im shaking said cynthia hayes who was

in brush country but this makes me think twice you think its

a swedish court refused today to hear 
testimony that an international conspiracy may have been behind the 
1986 slaying of prime minister olof palme 
stockholm district court ruled that allegations kurdish 
separatists plotted the assassination are irrelevant to the trial of 
christer pettersson who denies killing palme 
palme who dominated swedish politics for more than a decade was 
gunned down while walking home from a movie with his wife lisbeth 
judge carl anton spak rejected a defense request to call former 
intelligence agent jan henrik barrling to recount his investigation 
of the militant kurdish workers party the group was the focus of a 
yearlong police investigation into the killing the investigation 
was closed for lack of evidence 
barrlings testimony lacks relevance to the case spak said 
the kurdish group was suspected because the palme government held 
several of its members under house arrest as suspected terrorists 
and denied refugee status to one of its leaders 
the prosecution today called a 34yearold music teacher to the 
stand he appeared to be the only witness to see the shooting from 
beginning to end 
inge morelius said he saw a man standing by a shop window as 
palme and his wife walked past morelius said the man whom he could 
not identify went up behind the couple put his left hand on 
palmes left shoulder and his right hand in palmes back 
asked if he saw a weapon morelius said its difficult to say 
about that reconstructing it afterward but i saw clearly and 
distinctly two flashes he pulled off two shots at once it was 
bang bang maybe one or 1 seconds between them 
it was slaughter it was an execution it was nothing done in 
the heat of the moment morelius said 
he said he saw lisbeth palme look twice at the gunman mrs palme 
identified pettersson in court last week as the man she saw lean 
over her husband when he fell to the ground she said she did not 
see him shoot palme or see any gun 
morelius said the man took a few steps then circled around and 
looked at mrs palme again while she knelt beside her dying husband 
the man then turned trotted up a side street and was lost in the 
darkness the witness said 
earlier witnesses identified pettersson as the man who appeared 
to wait outside the movie theater for the palmes to emerge then 
followed them down the street

women once used hangers to end unwanted 
pregnancies now health officials say a few desperate women are 
using cocaine to induce abortions 
the national association for perinatal addiction research and 
education has heard of cocaineinduced abortions in every major us 
city during the last three years said ira chasnoff president of 
the chicagobased organization 
its probably cheaper faster and more efficient to do it 
themselves rather than seek an abortion in a clinic he said in a 
telephone interview wednesday 
doctors say cocaineinduced abortions can cause heavy bleeding in 
the mother and children who survive have a higher risk of 
retardation and other problems because the drug can cut off the 
blood supply to the fetus 
the group keeps no statistics on cocaineinduced abortions but 
officials in miami and detroit say scattered cases of women who used 
large doses of cocaine to end pregnancies are showing up in 
emergency rooms as miscarriage patients 
if you pin down some of them and ask questions you will find 
some are using it as an abortifacient said dr gene burkette 
medical director of the obstetrical and gynecology clinic at jackson 
memorial hospital in miami 
even though abortion has been legal since 1973 burkette said 
several factors cause women to attempt to induce abortion themselves 
some might not be able to afford it and some may figure why 
waste the money when you can use it to buy cocaine he said 
it shouldnt be surprising i guess that desperate women will 
try anything available to them said raj wiener acting director 
of the michigan department of public health 
at least one patient at a detroit drugtreatment program for 
pregnant women deliberately increased her drug use after discovering 
she was pregnant according to dr rhonda beale clinical director 
at the eleanor hutzel recovery center 
one woman talked about at the beginning of the pregnancy she 
started taking more and more coke said beale a psychiatrist 
she didnt want to deal with the reality of pregnancy she 
wanted to be rid of the pregnancy she was happy when she 
miscarried because she didnt want the baby anyway 
other women tire of being pregnant and use the drug to prompt 
early labor and ensure a less painful delivery burkette said 
the pregnancy is interfering with their lifestyle the heavy 
weight is interfering with something that they want to do women 
often get a little impatient in the last three months of pregnancy 
most normal women are willing to wait it out these women do not 
have that sort of resiliency they want to deliver early and 
painlessly he said 
between 1 and 2 percent of the 15000 women who deliver at 
jackson memorial each year have used cocaine to cause premature 
labor and relieve pain he estimated not all of the babies die 
chasnoff an expert on cocaine addiction and pregnancy said the 
drug causes blood vessels to constrict cutting off blood supply to 
the fetus and stimulates the pregnant uterus to contract 
its a setup for pregnancy failure he said 
dr charles vincent chief of gynecology at detroit receiving 
hospital has yet to see a case of cocaineinduced abortion but he 
said that will change if restrictions on abortion such as a new 
michigan law banning statepaid abortions for poor women multiply 
if they find out that it works particularly with the 
ridiculous state law that bans medicaid abortions i think were 
going to find a lot of women trying it you get a desperate 
teenager they will try almost anything he said

a prosecutor said today he has opened a 
criminal investigation involving officials of a company that 
contracted to deliver to iran chemicals that could be used to make 
poison gas 
the rheineisen chemical products company of duesseldorf said 
wednesday that it canceled its contract to deliver the thionyl 
chloride from a company in india government officials said they 
were investigating whether the deal violated export laws 
rolf chanteaux the chief state prosecutor in duesseldorf where 
the company is based said he opened a criminal probe wednesday 
afternoon that will focus on rheineisen officials 
chanteaux told the associated press the company is suspected of 
violating west german foreign trade laws by allegedly failing to get 
a special permit for the deal he gave no further details 
west german officials began looking into the case after us 
officials tipped off investigators the thionyl chloride shipment 
could be used to make mustard gas authorities said 
the incident raised questions about how tough west germanys new 
export control efforts are following last years scandal over german 
links to a suspected libyan chemical weapons plant 
it may be comforting that west german officials are now 
investigating zdf television network said in a newscast late 
wednesday not so comforting is the thought that we would again be 
totally in the dark without the tip from the united states 
the duesseldorf company insisted west german customs officials 
initially assured the firm there was nothing wrong with shipping the 
257 tons of thionyl chloride to iran 
a customs employee confirmed on may 22 that there were no 
objections to the shipment company attorney georg greeven told 
reporters wednesday night 
greeven claimed west german customs authorities didnt alert the 
company until wednesday that under new export control laws adopted 
april 7 the firm might need a permit for its involvement in the 
iran transaction 
he said rheineisen was able at the last moment wednesday to 
keep the first delivery of the chemicals from being loaded aboard a 
ship in india he did not identify the ship or the port or give 
other details 
greeven said the chemicals were made by a company in india called 
transpec he did not give the location of the firm 
he also did not indicate whether rheineisen knew the chemical 
could be used to make mustard gas 
iran used mustard gas in its eightyear war with iraq which 
ended with a ceasefire in august and there have been unconfirmed 
reports tehran is trying to add to its chemical weapons stockpile 
rheineisen is run by an iranian family and was contracted to 
arrange the shipment by irans stateowned industrial organization 
vezarate defa greeven said he said iran approached the duesseldorf 
company about arranging delivery of the chemical in january 
under an agreement reached june 1 rheineisen was to receive 
360000 from iran greeven said he did not reveal any details on 
the india companys involvement in the transaction 
us authorities tipped the west german government to 
rheineisens involvement in the deal last week bonn officials say 
american officials also alerted west germany late last year about 
alleged links between german companies and a suspected chemical 
weapons plant in rabta libya about 40 miles outside tripoli 
the west german government at first insisted the united states 
had no convincing evidence for its allegations but later launched 
its own investigation 
west german authorities have since arrested the head of the 
imhausenchemie company in connection with the libyan deal

demonstrating their opposition to flagburning 
a form of protest the supreme court declared legal last week house 
members held an allnight session of speechmaking that ended just 
before 9 am today 
meanwhile the house has drafted a constitutional amendment to 
forbid flagburning and president bush hopes to work with republican 
leaders in congress to have a final version done as early as friday 
house republican leader robert michel of illinois who launched 
the allnight session drafted his own version of what a 
constitutional amendment could look like his would simply give 
congress the authority to ban desecration of the flag 
presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater said wednesday that 
bushs proposal would be developed jointly with michel and senate 
minority leader bob dole rkan 
michel included democrat sonny montgomery of mississippi in 
sponsoring his speech marathon and more than a dozen lawmakers of 
both parties spoke 
rep charles wilson dtexas called the supreme court ruling a 
bit of muddleheaded libertarianism by the majority and he 
predicted a constitutional amendment would pass 
the amendment proposals seek to set aside last weeks ruling 
upholding the constitutionality of flag burning as a form of 
political protest 
fitzwater had earlier said a final white house amendment would be 
ready by the end of the day wednesday but later explained the new 
target by saying the gop leaders wanted to be part of it 
fitzwater said efforts would be made to reach a consensus 
proposal with republicans and democrats who favor addressing the 
flag issue through a constitutional amendment 
he said it would likely follow the lines of proposals already 
advanced in congress which have suggested that congress and the 
states have the power to pass laws banning flag desecration 
fitzwater said the amendment would likely be only one to three 
sentences 
the outcry began last week with the supreme courts 54 decision 
which overturned flagdesecration laws in 48 states both houses 
have passed resolutions condemning the decision 
gregory johnson whose prosecution for participating in a 
flagburning protest at the 1984 republican national convention was 
barred by the high courts decision told a news conference in new 
york the president should debate him on flagburning on primetime 
television on the eve of the fourth of july 
johnson said that if the values the flag represents are so 
strong you should not have to resort to this kinder gentler 
choke hold on protestors and dissenters 
one amendment proposed in congress by sen strom thurmond of 
south carolina senior republican on the senate judiciary committee 
does not mention criminal penalties but states 
the congress of the united states and the states have the power 
to prohibit the desecrating mutilating defacing defiling or 
burning of the flag of the united states 
meanwhile several house members who voted against a house 
resolution condemning the supreme court decision said wednesday they 
acted in support of more rather than less freedom of expression 
the resolution expressed profound concern with the ruling 
four of the five lawmakers who voted against the nonbinding 
resolution said they agreed with the 54 court majority the fifth 
rep gus savage dill refused to comment on the vote 
rep william clay dmo said the resolution just indicates 
the hypocrisy in congress and the nation we ought to preserve 
freedom of speech we condemn china for executing protesters but 
every chance we get we vote in favor of capital punishment

sales of new homes edged up 27 percent in may 
as mortgage interest rates continued to decline but they remained 
well behind the pace set in the previous two years the government 
reported today 
the commerce department said sales of new singlefamily homes 
rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 613000 units in may 
following a 91 percent increase in april the april figure was 
revised downward from the 109 percent increase reported earlier 
the april increase had been attributed by some economists to an 
aberration in sales in february and march when sales dropped 113 
percent and 119 percent respectively sales had risen 46 percent 
in january 
the pace of sales in may still was well behind the 676000 new 
homes sold in 1988 and the 671000 units sold in 1987 
for the first five months of the year new home sales were 71 
percent lower than in the same period a year earlier 
the housing industry has been among the sectors of the economy 
hardest hit by the federal reserves campaign to push up interest 
rates in an effort to slow economic growth and thus restrain 
inflation recently it appeared to ease its grip slightly as the 
economy showed signs of cooling 
fixedinterest rates peaked in march at 1122 percent and fell 
since then to 1048 percent in the last week in may according to 
the federal home loan mortgage corp 
the northeast led the sales rebound in may with a 126 percent 
increase to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 98000 units after 
falling 209 percent in april 
sales also were up 77 percent in the west to a rate of 197000 
units following a 28 percent jump in april the south posted an 
increase of 26 percent to a rate of 234000 homes after a 163 
percent hike the month earlier 
the midwest had the only decline in sales off 153 percent to an 
annual rate of 83000 units sales had been flat in the region 
during april and march at an annual rate of 98000 homes 
the increase in sales was accompanied by a 9000 increase to 
125000 in the median price of the homes sold the median price 
means half the homes sold for more and half for less 
the average price which is pulled up by sales of expensive 
homes also increased last month rising 13000 to 158800

the state of new jersey has no right to put 
asunder what love has joined together say a couple who ran afoul of 
a regulation barring police officers and court clerks from marrying 
each other 
joseph and marie hughes of north arlington asked us district 
judge nicholas politan on wednesday to strike down the state 
regulation which was aimed at avoiding any appearance of conflict 
of interest 
mrs hughes has been a municipal court clerk in north arlington 
since 1981 after four years as an acting clerk her husband of one 
year they met in the courthouse has been a police officer since 
1971 
we happened to fall in love and get married and all of a 
sudden im told im out of a job mrs hughes said 
their lawyer lisa agresti carey said the 1977 regulation 
interferes with the hugheses fundamental right to tie the knot and 
is blatantly unconstitutional 
at wednesdays hearing deputy attorney general michael diller 
argued that municipal courts are more intimate than others and are 
the mostoften used by the average person 
the rule was necessary to avoid the appearance that police could 
influence the courts workings he said 
but politan remarked this is the real world we live in were 
not dealing with stick men were dealing with real people 
politan said he would rule later this summer 
under the state supreme court regulation that took effect a few 
months before mrs hughes became acting clerk no spouse parent or 
child of a police officer can be made a municipal court clerk or 
deputy clerk 
the hugheses sued to overturn the rule in february they have 
permission to stay on the job until the issue is resolved 
ms carey attacked the rule as oppressive to the hugheses 
illogical and unfair for one thing she said hughes rarely handles 
municipal court cases 
she said mrs hughes could remove herself from all cases 
involving her husband just as officerclerk couples who married 
before the rule must do

france is allowing shipment of spare parts for 
nonlethal military equipment to libya the defense ministry 
announced it said this will not violate a 1986 european embargo 
french news commentaries said today the action appears to be a 
response to apparent moderation in recent statements and actions by 
libyan leader moammar gadhafi 
france has simply taken note of a certain number of 
demonstrations of appeasement on the part of col gadhafi the 
conservative le figaro said in a frontpage editorial 
a defense ministry statement wednesday said the exports were 
approved by the interministerial commission for export of war 
materiel it denied that crotale surfacetoair missiles were 
involved and said france will permit no new weapons sales to libya 
reports by le figaro agence francepresse and other french news 
organizations quoted unidentified officials as saying the parts will 
be used to repair radar systems 
the european economic community banned arms sales to libya in 
april 1986 amid reports linking gadhafis government to terrorist 
attacks at about the same time the united states bombed the libyan 
capital tripoli and benghazi citing alleged terrorist links

the last temptation of christ 
the subject of one of the most virulent protests in hollywood 
history is being released today on home video with as little 
fanfare as possible 
fearful of encouraging more demonstrations and boycotts mca home 
video distributed the last temptation without store displays 
promotional posters or advertising some stores refused to carry the 
film 
we were conscious of provoking a new controversy which was 
clearly not in anybodys interest said robert blattner president 
of mca home video a company affiliated with last temptation 
producer universal pictures 
on the other hand were not willing to keep it on the shelf 
we think its important that this title be made available in the 
marketplace 
many fundamentalist christian organizations attacked the last 
temptation before its debut in theaters last august most objected 
to director martin scorseses depiction of jesus played by willem 
dafoe as a doubting messiah with human frailties and sexual 
fantasies 
a secretary for the rev donald wildmon a fundamentalist who led 
those attacks said wednesday that wildmon planned no protests 
against the videocassette debut as he had threatened to do last 
year 
blockbuster video the nations largest videostore chain with 
343 companyowned outlets has refused to carry the last 
temptation video which has a suggested retail price of 8995 
its certainly unusual but it was a corporate decision 
considering all that went on with the film said wally knief a 
spokesman for the fort lauderdalebased chain it is the chains 
first such action against a major studio release knief said 
nearly 80 percent of blockbusters 387 franchise locations also 
have indicated they wont carry the video knief said 
numerous independent stores also will not carry the film john 
clark owner of the video center in gilroy calif said that 
although the store carries xrated videos that could be considered 
controversial he would not bring in the last temptation 
i just dont need the potential of the community being upset 
clark said 
he said he has a separate room for the sexually explicit movies 
and that he was not willing to build another room just for the 
last temptation 
employees of national video retailer music plus which will carry 
the last temptation have been instructed to tell patrons that 
the chain does not censor its product line because that would not 
serve customer needs 
in new york this morning clerks at rko warner theater video and 
tower video outlets said the last temptation was available for 
rental today 
although several major theater chains declined to show the last 
temptation it has grossed 82 million to date according to

the supreme court today placed new limits on 
the constitutions freespeech protections when commercial 
expression is involved 
by a 63 vote in a case involving the sale of cookware on state 
university of new york campuses the court said government officials 
are not required to adopt the least restrictive regulations 
possible to limit commercial speech 
instead justice antonin scalia said for the court officials 
need only adopt reasonable not perfect rules for 
limiting the commercial activity 
within those bounds we leave it to government decision makers 
to judge what manner of regulation may best be employed he said 
the leastrestrictive test rejected by the court today still 
applies to noncommercial speech such as political expression 
in a dissenting opinion justice harry a blackmun said the court 
was turning its back on important court precedents 
the majority holds that leastrestrictive means analysis does 
not apply to commercial speech cases a holding it is able to reach 
only by recasting a good bit of contrary language in our past 
cases blackmun said 
he was joined by justices william j brennan and thurgood 
marshall 
scalia said todays ruling is in line with a 1986 ruling that 
upheld puerto ricos ban on promotional advertising of casino 
gambling aimed at puerto rican residents 
in todays case the justices ordered further lower court 
hearings to determine whether a new york state university ban on 
commercial activities violates the constitution because it is too 
broad the court did not answer that question today 
but the dissenters said the ban does go too far they said for 
example it could prevent a student from meeting his doctor or 
lawyer in his dorm room if the doctor or lawyer is paid for the 
visit 
it could even prevent a student from paying a music teacher or a 
speech therapist to come to the dorm room for tutoring blackmun 
said 
todays case has attracted widespread interest among educators 
the state university of new york suny appealed to the court to 
revive the universitys ban on commercial activities in the dorm 
an appeal supported by university officials in 10 states and groups 
representing thousands of college administraors nationwide 
the suny board of trustees adopted a rule in 1966 to prohibit 
most commercial enterprises from operating on state university 
campuses 
the ban was challenged by american future systems inc a 
housewares company in bryn mawr pa after one of its 
representatives was arrested in 1982 at the state university campus 
in cortland ny for refusing to leave a dormitory 
the housewares company attracts customers by offering free 
florida vacations to students who arrange sales demonstrations in 
their dormitory rooms for groups of their friends 
a federal judge upheld the suny ban but the 2nd us circuit 
court of appeals overturned the judges ruling last year 
the appeals court ordered further hearings to determine whether 
there may be less restrictive rules to accomplish the universitys 
purpose 
in a friendofthecourt legal brief officials from 10 states 
said the fundamental right of state colleges and universities to 
control the use of their premises is at issue 
the officials are from state universities in california 
connecticut florida michigan illinois ohio south carolina 
rhode island new jersey and vermont 
other groups that supported the suny appeal were the american 
council on education the american association of state colleges and 
universities the national association of state universities and 
land grant colleges and the national association of student 
personnel administrators 
the case is state university of new york vs fox 872013

the supreme court today limited the power of 
indian tribes to control through tribal zoning laws the use of 
land owned by nonindians within a reservations boundaries 
in a case of significance to any state in which an indian 
reservation is located the court said tribes may be forced to share 
the zoning power with state or county officials 
the justices in splintered voting that yielded no one majority 
opinion ruled that the confederated tribes and bands of the yakima 
indian nation has the authority to regulate and may zone fee 
or privately owned land on about 800000 acres of its reservation in 
washington state 
but the court said the tribe has no such power to regulate land 
parcels owned by nonindians on some 500000 acres of the 
reservation 
the yakima reservation encompasses 13 million acres of land 
most of it within yakima county about 5000 tribal members and 
about 20000 nonmembers live on the reservation 
about 800000 acres including some 740000 in yakima county 
fall within the reservations closed area in which the tribes 
zoning ordinance allows no permanent structures 
philip brendale who owns 160 acres of land within the closed 
area was barred by the tribal ordinance from selling his land for 
residential development 
stanley wilkinson who owns about 100 acres just within the 
reservations northern boundary in the reservations open area 
was barred from subdividing a portion of his land 
neither man is a member of the yakima tribe they along with 
yakima county officials contended that the tribe lacks the legal 
authority to control the use of their land 
today the supreme court ruled against brendale but for wilkinson 
drawing a distinction between the closed area and open 
area lands 
the closed area is one in which only a very small percentage of 
land is held in fee by private owners and not the tribe about 
half the land in the open area is privately owned 
almost all of the reservations residents live in the open area 
the controlling opinion in todays decision was written by 
justice john paul stevens who was joined by justice sandra day 
oconnor 
he said the difference between the closed and open areas is of 
critical importance and requires a different disposition of the 
appeals filed by brendale and wilkinson 
four court members chief justice william h rehnquist and 
justices byron r white antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy 
would have disallowed tribal regulation of private land throughout 
the reservation 
justices harry a blackmun william j brennan and thurgood 
marshall voted to allow tribal regulation of privately owned land 
throughout the reservation 
thus the vote allowing the tribe to regulate private land in the 
reservations closed area was 54 the vote barring the tribe from 
regulating private land owned by nonindians in the open area was 
63 
writing for himself brennan and marshall blackmun said 
splitting tribal authority over nonindian fee lands between the 
socalled open and closed areas is solomonic in appearance 
only 
he added our past decisions and common sense compel a finding 
that the tribe has zoning authority over all lands within its 
reservation 
the efforts to limit tribal control of land use were supported in 
friendofthecourt briefs submitted by the national association of 
counties the national league of cities the national governors 
association and 11 states 
they are washington arizona idaho michigan montana nevada 
new mexico north dakota south dakota utah and wyoming 
numerous indian tribes filed friendofthecourt briefs 
supporting the yakimas 
the cases are brendale vs confederated tribes 871622 
wilkinson vs confederated tribes 871697 and yakima county vs 
confederated tribes 871711

closely watched case of the decade 
the courts lack of action disappointed the scores of abortion 
opponents and advocates who waited in line overnight for one of the 
few seats available in the courtroom others milled outside the 
historic court building in anticipation of a decision that could 
overturn or retain a womans right to an abortion 
the justices are being asked to use the missouri case to reverse 
the courts 1973 landmark roe vs wade decision legalizing abortion 
chief justice william h rehnquist said from the bench on 
monday july 3 the court will announce all the remaining opinions 
during this term of the court 
in addition the court left hanging its decision in an important 
case on churchstate relations 
that case stems from the holiday displays of a christmas nativity 
scene and a hanukkah menorah at government buildings in pittsburgh 
lower courts said the displays represented an impermissible 
promotion of religion by government 
the court announced just two rulings from the bench during a 
brief public session the missouri case called webster vs 
reproductive health services was not one of them 
in todays decisions the court 
placed new limits on the constitutions freespeech protections 
when commercial expression is involved 
by a 63 vote in a case involving sale of cookware on state 
university of new york campuses the court said government officials 
are not required to adopt the least restrictive regulations 
possible to limit commercial speech 
instead justice antonin scalia said for the court officials 
need only adopt reasonable not perfect rules for 
limiting the commercial activity 
limited the power of indian tribes to control through tribal 
zoning laws the use of land owned by nonindians within a 
reservations boundaries 
in a case of significance to any state in which an indian 
reservation is located the court said tribes may be forced to share 
the zoning power with state or county officials 
people on either side of the emotional abortion issue were left 
with another weekend of anticipation 
it is difficult to wait for the court to hand down these 
decisions of course it is difficult but we remain optimistic 
said olivia gans of the national right to life committee 
faye wattleton president of planned parenthood spoke of the 
potential for a delay into next year and said it would be an 
indication of the turmoil that this court is willing to create in 
the country 
the webster case is one of three cases separating the court from 
its threemonth summer recess which reporters previously had been 
led to believe would begin today 
despite rumors that some justices are still writing opinions on 
the highly controversial abortion and religious cases the delay 
could have an administrative explanation for example the courts 
computer print shop could be having trouble producing enough copies 
of the abortion ruling to meet what will surely be a flood of 
requests 
the case has become the most closely watched supreme court 
controversy of the 1980s 
the court must say something about the case in which oral 
arguments were conducted april 26 before ending its current term 
rehnquists statement might indicate that decisions in the 
webster case and two other cases will be announced monday 
but instead of announcing a decision the justices could choose 
to order another round of arguments during the term that begins in 
october that would delay a decision until sometime in 1990 
roe vs wade itself was a case that had to be argued twice before 
a decision was announced such orders are not rare the court hears 
arguments in about 150 cases each term and since 1977 has held over 
at least one case for reargument the following term 
in the 1973 decision the court said women have a constitutional 
right based on their right to privacy to seek and obain abortions 
the ruling said a womans decision to have an abortion during the 
first three months of pregnancy must be left to her and her doctor 
it said states may regulate abortions during the second trimester 
only to protect the womans health and may take steps to protect 
fetal life in the third trimester 
state authority to regulate abortions after the first trimester 
was not made absolute however 
suspense grew over the abortion case in the waning weeks of the 
courts term as day after day passed without a decision 
opponents and advocates of abortion anxiously awaited the 
decision outside the court only to be disappointed again today 
some opponents prayed others carried signs protesting abortion 
including one that read the child killing must stop supporters 
of a womans right to abortion toted signs that said keep abortion 
legal around them swarmed dozens of reporters and cameramen 
waiting to file their stories on a decision that did not come down 
competition was keen for the few seats available to the public 
inside the courtroom people began lining up at 630 pm wednesday 
more than 15 hours before the justices gathered in the court only 
about 50 people were allowed inside the other seats were reserved 
far in advance for friends and relatives of court workers as well 
as reporters and lawyers

the captain of a tanker that spilled 
420000 gallons of oil was confined to his ship today after being 
charged with polluting waters off rhode island 
for the first time since fridays accident fishermen were free 
today to harvest shellfish from parts of the upper narragansett bay 
officials said almost all the oil had evaporated 
in two other spills cleanup crews made headway in mopping up oil 
iakovos georgudis 43 was charged wednesday with two misdemeanor 
counts of discharging pollutants into the water in violation of the 
clean water act and federal refuse act the captain also is under 
investigation by a state grand jury 
each misdemeanor carries up to a year in prison and a 100000 
fine or double the actual damages said us attorney lincoln 
almond the coast guard has estimated damages at 16 million and 
gov edward d diprete said president bush has promised full federal 
reimbursement to the state 
the clean water act prohibits the negligent discharge of 
pollutants the refuse act prohibits unlawfully discharging refuse 
into navigable water without a permit 
almond said that georgudis a greek resident was arrested 
because of concern that he might leave the united states the united 
states extradition treaty with greece does not cover pollution 
crimes he said 
a federal magistrate set bail at 50000 and ordered him to 
surrender his passport the magistrate also ordered that the captain 
and his greek tanker world prodigy remain in rhode island waters 
almond said georgudis was confined to the ship to insure the 
integrity of the vesssel 
meanwhile in philadelphia witnesses at a coast guard inquiry 
into a spill of about 300000 gallons on the delaware river said a 
botched anchoring procedure led to the grounding of a tanker and the 
spill of industrial heating oil the hearing was recessed until july 
5 
hundreds of people have been working to clean up the globs of oil 
since the weekend a hot sun melted some congealed oil on tuesday 
but cooler weather wednesday kept the oil in more of a solid 
condition workers used shovels and pitchforks to remove it 
we believe we are making more progress and now the weather is 
working with us instead of against us said coast guard spokesman 
jim weakley 
but wind shifts began moving oil toward new jersey riverbanks 
which had been spared much of the black goo 
in houston crews are nearly finished cleaning up a 
250000gallon oil spill that occurred friday when a tanker and a 
barge collided in the houston ship channel but the process has 
slowed a bit officials said 
only about 40 of the 6000 barrels of oil that leaked remained on 
the water wednesday afternoon us coast guard spokesman william 
nash said but most of the slick was difficult to reach officials 
said 
georgudis who has admitted to rhode islands governor and coast 
guard officials that he made a mistake in navigation would not be 
called to testify before a joint hearing by the coast guard and the 
national transportation safety board said the chief investigator 
coast guard capt david whitten 
whitten said georgudis intends to invoke his fifth amendment 
right to protect against selfincrimination 
the world prodigys chief engineer who does not face 
prosecution was expected to testify today but whitten said the 
us attorneys office had indicated that testimony by the chief 
mate and helmsman could be delayed because of an unexplained snag in 
obtaining immunity from prosecution 
us attorney lincoln c almond said only that he was trying to 
obtain approval for grants of immunity from washington he said he 
did not know how long it would take 
georgudis lawyer has said the captain would invoke the fifth 
amendment if brought before the grand jury which is investigating 
possible violations of state pollution laws and a law requiring 
harbor pilots aboard ships within narragansett bay 
on tuesday helmsman konstadinos paraskevopulos invoked the fifth 
amendment before the grand jury but after being granted immunity 
he testified wednesday he declined to comment afterward 
georgudis also declined to comment 
he said little during the hearing before us magistrate jacob 
hagopian except to acknowledge that he spoke english and understood 
the charges 
coast guard lt paul wolf said the unloading of almost 8 million 
gallons of oil remaining aboard the ship had been completed to five 
barges where the fuel would be purified

on arm sales to china and urged the world bank to postpone new loans 
to beijing the united states has already cut off arms sales to 
china to protest the crackdwon

the army today deported eight arabs accused of 
being leaders of the palestinian uprising against israeli rule and 
sent them to lebanon a military communique said 
the army also announced it demolished the homes of three 
palestinian murder suspects 
about 20 rightwing legislators guarded by soldiers went on a 
hike in the occupied west bank to dramatize israels claim to the 
terrritory 
the expulsions came despite repeated us statements that the 
measure is a human rights violation and could mire washingtonbacked 
efforts to get middle east peace talks started 
israel has deported 55 palestinians during the 18monthold 
palestinian uprising in the west bank and gaza strip most have been 
expelled to neighboring lebanon 
an army spokesman said those deported were leaders of the 
uprising in the territories and activists of yasser arafats 
mainstream plo faction fatah and of the syrianbased democratic 
front for the liberation of palestine 
there were no immediate details about how they were deported 
the army communique quoted defense minister yitzhak rabin as 
saying israel would consider allowing the deportees back home within 
three years if there will be tranquility in the territories 
israel contends deportations are an effective way to curb 
violence 
in a statement published in february the foreign ministry said 
explusions were only done in extreme cases where other measures 
have not succeeded in stopping hostile activity 
four of todays deportees were from the west bank and four are 
from the gaza strip 
they include two prominent labor union activists mohammed 
abdullah labadi 34 and radwan ahmad zayad 31 both of the 
democratic front for the liberation of palestine headed by nayef 
hawatmeh 
another is atah abu karesh 50 from gaza city a teacher and a 
prominent fatah activist 
all three were jailed without trial in the past for antiisraeli 
activities or held on charges of membership in illegal 
organizations the army said all those deported had exhausted legal 
appeals 
earlier this month the democratic front to which several of the 
deportees belong warned that expelling more palestinians would 
torpedo negotiations for the return of the body of samir assad a 
druse soldier captured in lebanon in 1983 
palestinians maintained he was killed during an israeli bombing 
raid on a plo base in 1984 
the homes razed by the army before dawn included two blown up in 
beit lahiya and one bulldozed in rafah both in the gaza strip 
the beit lahiya houses were home to 15 people including two 
members of the moslem fundamentalist hamas movement accused of axing 
to death an alleged palestinian collaborator the army and arab 
reports said 
the rafah building belonged to a family whose son was charged 
with slaying an israeli soldier in gaza two years ago the son was 
shot to death by soldiers last year after escaping from prison 
among the rightwing legislators who walked through the west bank 
were several members of prime minister yitzhak shamirs likud bloc 
the 20 legislators were guarded by about two dozen soldiers and 
their walk preceded about 50 hikes planned by jewish settlers friday 
in the west bank 
lawmaker benny begin the son of former prime minister menachem 
begin told the associated press he was hiking to protest stoning 
attacks on jews and to stress there was an important historic link 
between israel and the west bank 
a jew can walk on any trail in the catskill mountains in 
upstate new york begin said it is discrimination against jews 
to say that in these areas only arabs can live and walk freely free 
from stones knives and firebombs 
the 90minute hike went without incident except for an illegal 
palestinian flag unfurled in the nearby village of kunya after the 
legislators passed through

hundreds of steelworkers rallied in a small virginia town against 
pittston coal group inc in support of 37000 defiant miners in 
their eightstate walkout 
at another rally wednesday coal miners and supporters planted 
small white wooden crosses in the lawn of pittstons parent company 
in greenwich conn 
in southern west virginia where pickets have blocked pittston 
trucks circuit judge eric obriant on wednesday slapped the miners 
union with more than a dozen contempt citations and set an aug 1 
hearing to determine whether the union should compensate pittston 
for losses 
in st paul va 300 steelworkers joined nearly 2700 united 
mine workers members and supporters from a half dozen states 
every union man in this country has a stake in this said 
mike hathaway a wildcat striker from steelville ill if they 
break this union theyll break every union right on down the line 
were just trying to show these miners that unions around the 
country are behind them 100 percent said joe kiker a steelworker 
from atlanta and a former coal miner its our fight too 
about 1600 pittston miners went on strike april 5 in west 
virginia and virginia after working 14 months without a contract 
the company is seeking cutbacks that it says are needed to compete 
with foreign coal producers 
the strikers were joined earlier this month by 300 pittston 
miners in kentucky 
the walkout triggered sympathy strikes beginning june 12 and at 
one point included 46000 miners in west virginia alabama 
illinois indiana kentucky ohio pennsylvania tennessee virginia 
and missouri the wildcat miners in missouri and virginia have gone 
back to work 
coal industry and union officials estimate 37000 miners remain 
out 
before wednesday nights rally in virginia the governors of 
three more states joined four others in calling for an end to the 
pittston strike 
govs richard thompson of illinois robert casey of pennsylvania 
and john ashcroft of missouri asked the umw and pittston to resume 
negotiations 
no one knows better than you the terrible economic and 
emotional strain of a protracted strike ashcroft wrote to paul 
douglas chairman of the pittston co the coal companys parent 
there was no immediate response from the union or pittston 
the call echoed requests of govs gaston caperton of west 
virginia richard celeste of ohio gerald baliles of virginia and 
wallace wilkinson of kentucky 
a federal judge in charleston wva this week ordered an end to 
the wildcat strike but strikers have largely ignored previous 
backtowork orders 
the umw says it has not authorized the wildcat strikes which 
violate the contract the union signed in february 1988 with the 
bituminous coal operators association which represents most major 
coal operators but not pittston 
on wednesday four coal trucks in west virginia and virginia were 
peppered with bullets and two others were damaged by steel balls 
fired from slingshots no injuries were reported and no arrests were 
made 
shots were fired at coal trucks and on picket lines late last 
week for the first time since the wildcat strikes began no one was 
seriously injured 
in virginia union members continued to create traffic jams on 
coal hauling roads despite a federal judges threat of daily fines 
of 120000 
hundreds of cars and trucks paraded slowly on a narrow road 
linking pittston coal groups main processing plant with supply 
mines said state police spokesman charlie vaughan 
at the rally in connecticut 350 coal miners and their families 
held an emotional but peaceful rally outside pittston headquarters 
they carried small crosses bearing the names of miners killed in 
accidents or dead from black lung disease 
the demonstrators were bused to connecticut from pennsylvania and 
virginia by the union

a federal judge has ruled that the boston globe may 
question participants in a police officers drug trial under oath 
because a court clerk erased the tape recording of the case 
us district judge joseph l tauros ruling wednesday allows the 
newspapers lawyers to subpoena and take depositions from 
participants in the 1987 cocaine possession trial in state court 
the globe said today 
experts couldnt say whether such a recreation had been allowed 
before but david sellers spokesman for the administrative office 
of us courts in washington said its certainly something that 
sounds highly unusual 
the globe has said its aim is to check out a tip that salvador 
aponte who no longer is on the police force had been found guilty 
but then was acquitted after a defense lawyer told the judge the 
officer would be fired if convicted 
the newspaper sued in federal court 18 months ago to get the tape 
last year tauro ruled that a law sealing from the public court 
records in criminal cases that did not end in convictions was 
unconstitutional 
but the clerks office later found that the tape recording of the 
trial had been erased james mannering assistant clerk told the 
associated press today 
lawyers for the globe reported to tauro that court clerks said 
they ran short of tapes and erased the aponte trial despite a 
february 1988 order to keep tapes for at least 2 years the 
newspaper said the attorney generals office did not tell anyone in 
the clerks office that the aponte trial was the subject of a 
federal lawsuit and had to be preserved

soviet legislator boris n yeltsin said 
in an interview shown today that poor living standards will lead to 
a revolution in the soviet union within two years 
fortyeight million people live under the poverty line which 
means that we are on the brim of a precipice the maverick 
communist told hungarian state television in an interview wednesday 
night the official mti news agency carried excerpts from the 
interview today 
i think patience wont last longer than one or two more years 
thats the maximum and then the people will take their destiny into 
their own hands the revolution from above will turn into a 
grassroots spontaneous revolution said yeltsin who last month 
was named to the new supreme soviet 
he said perestroika soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs program 
to reform the economy should not have been introduced in so many 
fields 
we should carry out a political reform this should be the 
starting point then the scope of perestroika should be narrowed 
yeltsin said 
we should postpone the space program cut defense expenditure 
and slash industrial investment costs by 30 percent he said 
without elaborating 
if we had done this from the beginning we could have raised 
the living standards of the people over the last four years 
yeltsin was dismissed as communist party chief for moscow in 1987 
after he said gorbachevs changes were not proceeding fast enough 
when he won a congress seat he achieved one of the most stunning 
political comebacks in soviet history he won the seat only after 
another legislator stepped down and gave his spot to yeltsin

the scene was set the demonstrators in place 
the banners unfurled but no drama occurred on the sunsplashed 
plaza outside the us supreme court building today 
the courts longawaited decision on abortion was postponed once 
again perhaps until monday perhaps later 
the effect was like air escaping from a wellfilled balloon 
what a letdown said a young capitol hill intern who said she 
had waited in line for a seat in the courtroom since 4 am 
disappointed spectators streamed out of the court shortly after 
10 am filing down the marble steps toward the hundred 
demonstrators gathered on the broad sidewalk 
they were almost equally divided between the forces opposing 
abortion and those advocating a womans right to choose 
on the left were yellow banners with black letters the child 
killing must be stopped 
on the right were purple banners with white letters keep 
abortion legal 
in between were the large color photographs of bleeding fetuses 
that have been seen at antiabortion demonstrations across the 
country 
in the center a kneeling bearded man in the robes of a monk 
said his rosary while frowning at prochoice placards three feet 
away 
earlier a line of hundreds of people had snaked around the court 
in hopes of a seat inside 
at its head was michael carrier who identified himself as a 
student at yale university 
ive been here since 630 last night he said ive been 
sleeping on concrete ive been not sleeping on concrete 
im here because i feel this is such an important decision 
carrier said i just had to be here when it came down 
he was not the only person to have spent the night at the court 
not the only one to be disappointed 
a woman who was no 5 in the line had been there since 930 pm 
wednesday night 
we spent most of the night talking speculating on what would 
happen said another woman you get pretty chummy in a situation 
like that 
nearby other signs a small girl holds a placard larger than she 
is my mother chose life 
another girl holds a sign reading why do my future playmates 
have to die 
but there was no decision 
and the commentators poised to comment commented anyway 
the old and emotional arguments for and against the speculation 
on what the postponement meant 
but one central figure had nothing to add 
frank sussman the attorney who argued the case before the court 
for prochoice advocates was asked to comment 
he threw up his hands 
theres nothing new he said nothing happened 
weve got a paper to put out a reporter shouted 
ive got a paper to read sussman replied ill read 
another part 
then referring to the manager of the cincinnati reds baseball 
team under investigation for gambling sussman added 
go talk to pete rose

if the supreme court wants to plunge back into 
the abortion issue after the webster dispute three cases from 
illinois ohio and minnesota now pending before the justices offer 
immediate opportunities 
any of the three could lead the court to reevaluate its 1973 roe 
vs wade decision which said women have a constitutional right to 
seek and obtain abortions 
the court already is assessing a womans abortion rights in a 
missouri case called webster vs reproductive health services no 
decision was announced in the webster case today but the court said 
its 198889 term will end on monday 
a decision could come then or the justices could choose to 
request new arguments during the next term 
if one or more of the other three cases is granted review before 
the end of the courts current term or early in the 198990 term 
that begins next october a decision likely would be announced 
sometime in 1990 
of the three pending cases the illinois dispute might affect roe 
vs wade most directly it would be extremely difficult for the 
court to revive the illinois laws without substantially dismantling 
its 1973 decision

the focus of the cleanup shifted today as changing winds directed 
the oil from the delaware side of the river toward new jersey by 
this morning 98 oilcovered birds had been brought to a rescue 
center near wilmington del 
coast guard officials said the cleanup was going well partly 
because rain and cooler weather helped congeal the oil which had 
begun to liquefy in the hot sun tuesday as of 8 pm wednesday 
146500 gallons of the estimated 306000 gallons spilled had been 
recovered the coast guard said

priests in lefebvres st pius x fraternity according to the rev 
franz schmidberger the german priest who succeeded the archbishop 
in 1984 as the fraternitys superior general

his followers they also would be excommunicated unless they break 
with him 
in the same period 34 new priests were ordained by the four new 
bishops schmidberger said attendance at the fraternitys six 
theological schools in switzerland australia the united states

members of a congressional panel investigating 
abuse and mismanagement in a federal lowincome housing program 
today allowed one witness scheduled to appear before them to 
postpone his testimony while another witness sought to clarify 
previous statements he had made 
hunter cushing former deputy assistant secretary for 
multifamily housing at the department of housing and urban 
development asked congressional investigators to give him more time 
to review documents and prepare to answer their questions 
ive only recently been retained and not had adequate 
opportunity to review the facts in this case said jamie gorelick 
an attorney who accompanied the former hud official 
gorelick said cushing a deputy assistant secretary at the 
commerce department would appear voluntarily before the house 
subcommittee on employment and housing after congress july 4th 
recess 
rep tom lantos dcalif the subcommittee chairman excused 
cushing and said he would be recalled 
the subcommittees hearings resumed today with a second 
appearance by fred bush a 1988 fundraiser for george bushs 
presidential effort who sought to make a few clarifying statements 
of my earlier testimony bush who is not related to the 
president previously testified on may 25 
bush earned 268000 as a consultant on a project in puerto rico 
funded under the huds moderate rehabilitation program and 253000 
on a technical assistance grant to another project on the island 
bush the ambassadordesignate to luxembourg originally told the 
subcommittee he contacted deborah gore dean former executive 
assistant to thenhud secretary samuel after finding her name in a 
federal executive telephone directory 
bush said today however that one of his former colleagues at 
bush amp co reminded him they had contacted ms dean after cushing 
and the colleague spoke at a social gathering 
they have told me of their best recollection sometime in late 
1984 or early 1985 one of my colleagues met hunter cushing at a 
social gathering and learned that he worked at hud said bush 
my colleagues recollection is that mr cushing taold him we 
should talk to deborah gore dean he said adding that the 
colleague asked bush if he knew ms dean 
bush said he didnt and it was then that he consulted the 
directory to see who ms dean was 
members of the panel have met with lawyers for dean who wont 
testify about influencepeddling for federal money but neither side 
will say whether they are working on a deal 
dean the former official at the center of the dispute said she 
spent wednesday sifting through a box of documents from her tenure 
at the hud 
that was about all she would say 
please dont do this to me dean said during a brief 
telephone conversation im very bad at hanging up on people i 
think its rude and i always get stuck 
one of ms deans attorneys charles leeper acknowledged the 
meeting with congressional investigators 
our client has asserted the fifth amendment privilege and 
were not under any obligation as things stand now to appear again 
before the subcommittee but were continuing discussions with 
them leeper said 
meanwhile an auditors report released wednesday showed that hud 
gave millions of dollars to private apartment projects around the 
country in 1987 and 1988 although they did not qualify under the 
agencys own guidelines 
the funds came from a hud discretionary fund intended to help 
financially ailing projects which were insured by the federal 
housing administration said the report released by rep bill green 
rny 
green said the audit of awards to 25 projects indicated that 30 
million of 35 million granted went to undeserving or lowneed 
projects 
ms dean who appeared before the subcommittee last month has 
invoked her constitutional right against selfincrimination in 
refusing to testify about her role in awarding hud money 
the panel is investigating allegations that millions of dollars 
were steered to developers who were either former hud employees or 
hired top republicans such as former interior secretary james watt 
who sold their services as consultants for sixfigure fees 
the new york times reported today that one prominent republican 
who received a consulting fee to help a project win federal housing 
funds was fred brown a new york businessman and chairman of the 
national black republican council 
a 1987 audit by hud investigators questioned browns 50000 fee 
for consulting work on behalf of new haven conn in its successful 
bid for a 10 million federal urban development action grant 
asked if he has discussed a deal with ms deans attorneys under 
which she could be granted immunity for her testimony before the 
panellantos replied i can confirm that i have met with them but 
i am not at liberty to discuss what they talked to me about and what 
i talked to them about 
a parade of witnesses identified ms dean as the hud official 
whose support was crucial in getting scarce housing funds from the 
department ms dean was executive assistant to housing secretary 
samuel pierce jr 
after more than a month of hearings rep christopher shays 
rconn said in an interview wednesday that some contradictions 
have emerged but he refused to specify what they were or who made 
them 
i think there are some persons who are dangerously close to 
perjuring themselves shays said we have some conflicting 
testimony 
shays a member of the government operations subcommittee has 
been outspoken in his criticism of the management of hud during the 
eight years of the reagan administration 
he said some of the conflicts among witnesses also may be due to 
poor memory or misunderstanding the questions 
but lantos while not disagreeing with shays said he will wait 
until the hearings are nearly over before saying whether any of the 
witnesses have lied

the author of a state law allowing 
authorities to withhold the names of crime victims said today he 
will seek to repeal the measure which has angered news 
organizations and confused police 
rep fred blair a democrat said he asked gov bill clements to 
allow legislators to repeal the law during a special session that 
ends july 19 
i think the need at this time is to repeal the bill because of 
what is going on now and because of the future misapplication of the 
bill said blair 
the law which went into effect june 14 and is thought to be the 
first of its kind in the nation allows police fire and other 
agencies to withhold felony victims names addresses or other 
information that could lead to their identification 
previously police reports were open to the public 
sponsors of the law said they meant to protect crime victims from 
sales pitches by security and alarm companies and that their intent 
was misinterpreted 
now the news media in some cities cannot get routine crime 
information such as the names of people killed in drunkendriving 
accidents state troopers have been instructed to withhold such 
information 
amid calls from legislators to amend the law the odessa american 
newspaper wednesday left a blank space where its police blotter goes 
its absurd m olaf frandsen managing editor of the odessa 
american wrote you no longer are entitled to know if a burglar 
is working your neighborhood or if an acquaintance or relative has 
been traumatized by a criminal and could use your help 
odessa police have sealed arrest reports though the ector county 
sheriff hasnt changed his release policy frandsen said 
rebecca daugherty of the reporters committee for freedom of the 
press in washington said a scan of the agencys records showed no 
other state has enacted a law summarily closing victim information 
to the public 
state sens kent caperton and cyndi krier said they will ask gov 
bill clements to put the issue on the special session agenda 
we need to repeal the harm that is done by this bill said 
caperton it just slipped through 
clements said wednesday he was surprised by the reaction and how 
the bill has been interpreted when he signed it the governor said 
he thought certain victims would be reasonably protected but i 
didnt think that the records would be put in seclusion so to 
speak 
blair and sen john leedom said they sponsored the bill for the 
dallas police department which has had voluminous requests by 
security companies for crime reports that can help them make sales 
texas media a freedom of information lobby composed of several 
statewide news associations is discussing how to respond to the law 
in fort worth police chief thomas windham said he doesnt like 
the law but his department would be risking a lawsuit if it did not 
strictly follow it police will not be able to tell the public about 
homicide victims or even newsworthy crimes of a less serious 
nature the chief said 
if the mayors car gets stolen like it did a while back we 
wouldnt be able to make that a news story he said it sure 
places us in a tremendous confused state over here

a cityowned watershed is teeming with wild 
pigs which splash around in city drinking water root up the land 
and may create a health threat 
they reproduce like crazy and there are no predators to get 
rid of them said arthur jenson water department deputy manager 
the department hopes to trap and sell the animals as pork the 
animals are descendants of farm animals that either escaped or were 
abandoned 
city water managers fear the feral swine could spread livestock 
diseases such as cholera and hoofandmouth they are also concerned 
the pigs rooting up the ground on hillsides in search of food may 
promote erosion of the watershed area 
jenson said about 250 pigs are roaming san franciscos 
37000acre watershed containing the calaveras and san antonio 
reservoirs near the dividing line of alameda and santa clara 
counties 
the city public utilities commission on tuesday unanimously 
approved the water departments plan to conduct a swine damage 
survey to determine the pig population and study ways to 
eliminate or at least control the animals 
but because the state fish and game department lists feral swine 
as a game species the city will need a permit to kill the pigs 
and under state law the pigs cannot be killed and disposed of or 
sold as dog food but must be sold for human consumption or given to 
a soup kitchen or shelter we are trying to avoid wanton waste 
said jim swanson of the state department of fish and game 
as a result the us department of agriculture must inspect and 
certify the meat

prensa latina said 
a brief communique from the communist partys political bureau 
signed by president fidel castro said gen abelardo colome ibarra 
had been appointed to replace gen jose abrantes according to the

the conduct of a group of officials who for 2 years with impunity 
and without being discovered conducted drug trafficking 
operations prensa latina quoted the statement as saying 
cuba said it arrested nine military officers this month in 
connection with drug trafficking a military tribunal has 
recommended a courtmartial for one of them maj gen arnaldo 
ochoa and said he should be executed by a firing squad if convicted 
the communique said the new minister should adopt all measures 
that make repetition of the deficiency impossible prensa latina 
said 
us officials have questioned the sincerity of cubas new war on 
drugs partly because of continued reports of smuggling through cuba 
colome ibarra born in 1939 is the third highest military 
officer in cuba after castro and his brother defense minister gen 
raul castro prensa latina said since dec 31 1988 he has been 
the only threestar general in the armed forces and holds the 
highest military honors the country awards including the title hero 
of the revolution it said 
he has been a member of the communist partys central committee

smoke coming from under one of the cars after it passed chris 
checked the rails and found a groove

trains from chris before csx took chris advice and checked the 
train and found a worn wheel that could not have gone more than a 
dozen miles without cracking 
if it hadnt been for chris call the wheel might not have 
been detected until it derailed and caused us a lot of damage and 
maybe some injuries ford said he saved the company a good bit 
of money and maybe some lives

sales of new homes rose 27 percent in may as 
interest rates continued to fall the government reported thursday 
but analysts predicted that sales would remain slow because of the 
weakening economy 
declining interest rates should produce increased home sales in 
the next few months said michael carliner vice president of the 
national association of home builders 
however while interest rates are more favorable now the 
economy is weaker so the response will be less than it would 
be he said 
david berson chief economist for the federal national mortgage 
association said slower overall ecnomic growth is a negative for 
housing 
were not looking for a surge in sales as rates decline 
berson said the improvement will be slow but steady 
the slower economic growth and high interest rates have resulted 
from the federal reserve campaign against inflation although 
interest rates have begun to fall as the central bank appears to 
ease its grip the economy continues to moderate 
richard peach a mortgage bankers association economist also 
blames a satiated market for the slow sales pace 
weve had several years of generally favorable conditions for 
home purchases peach said we dont have the pentup demand so 
things are kind of sluggish 
the commerce department said sales of new singlefamily homes 
rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 613000 units in may 
but still trailed the 676000 rate in 1988 and the 671000 rate in 
1987 
for the first five months of the year new home sales were down 
71 percent from the same period a year earlier 
the may sales increase followed a 91 percent jump in april 
although the figure was revised downward from the 109 percent 
increase reported earlier sales in february and march had dropped 
113 percent and 119 percent respectively after rising 46 percent 
in january 
john a tuccillo an economist with the national association of 
realtors said part of mays increase was due to firsttime buyers 
entering the market because of lower interest rates 
fixedinterest rates have been dropping since march when they 
peaked at 1122 percent the rates averaged 1048 percent the last 
week in may and were 1019 percent last week according to the 
federal home loan mortgage corp 
we anticipate the interest rate drops that occurred in june 
will allow more firsttime buyers back in boosting sales of both 
new homes and existing home tuccillo said 
mays sales rebound was led by the northeast which posted a 126 
percent increase to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 98000 
units after falling 209 percent in april 
other increases occurred in the west up 77 percent to a rate of 
197000 units after a 28 percent increase in april and the south 
up 26 percent to a rate of 234000 homes after a 163 percent 
increase a month earlier 
the midwest had the only decline in sales off 153 percent to an 
annual rate of 83000 units sales had been flat in the region in 
april after falling 49 percent to an annual rate of 98000 homes in 
march 
the median price of homes sold in may rose 9000 to 125000 
the median price means half the homes sold for more and half for 
less 
the average price which is pulled up by sales of expensive 
homes rose 13000 to 158000

charles haughey failed to win reelection 
as prime minister thursday losing a parliamentary vote by 86 votes 
to 78 
the impasse pushes ireland into tricky constitutional terrain 
and could force state president patrick hillery whose post is 
largely ceremonial to make the next move 
haughey needed 83 votes but mustered only the 78 of his fianna 
fail party and independent lawmaker tom foxe one legislator 
abstained 
the 166member dail or parliament voted on other candidates 
but rejected all of them alan dukes leader of the opposition fine 
gael party was defeated 10361 with one abstention 
proceedings halted for two hours haughey proposed adjourning 
until monday but opposition lawmakers demanded he resign as party 
leader and make way for a new candidate 
if no compromise is reached the president must decide whether to 
give haughey another chance to muster a majority or an option 
seen as less likely order another election 
the crisis arose from the june 15 election which haughey called 
in an unsuccessful bid to win an outright majority 
haughey had led ireland with a minority government for more than 
two years with tacit support of the fine gael and progressive 
democrat parties 
he called the election when opinion polls showed him likely to 
win a majority but his ratings slid in the days before the vote 
and he won 77 seats four fewer than he had held

shells exploded in beiruts moslem and 
christian sectors today as syrian and christian gunners fought 
despite a call by arab leaders for a truce six people were killed 
and 26 wounded police said 
the whooshing sound of outgoing rockets and the thuds of 
exploding shells rocked the city smoke and dust billowed from 
several targeted areas 
by police count 380 people have been killed and 1497 wounded 
since march 8 when the current round of violence broke out pitting 
christian army cmdr gen michel aouns troops against syrian and 
allied militia forces 
a police spokesman said todays fatalities included two civilians 
killed in moslem west beirut when a shell crashed on their car the 
two were driving on a seaside boulevard where the syrians have 
several artillery batteries firing on christian districts 
a civilian also was killed at west beiruts barbir hospital near 
the capitals dividing green line when the facility took several 
direct rounds from christian gunners said the spokesman who could 
not be named in line with standing regulations 
he said the three other civilians were killed in christian east 
beirut 
a hospital official speaking on condition he not be named said 
the man killed at the hospital had taken refuge there after shelling 
started while he was in the street 
syrian artillery batteries also shelled the christian coastline 
north of the city to maintain a blockade of the enclave home to 
about 1 million christians 
christian radio stations interrupted their programs to flash 
reports of the renewed syrian shelling and urge the population to 
take the needed precautions 
this is the way the syrians responded to the ceasefire called 
by the tripartite arab committee the voice of lebanon radio said 
the truce was requested tuesday by king hassan ii of morocco 
king fahd of saudi arabia and president chadli bendjedid of algeria 
the three leaders concluding talks in oran algeria also called 
for lifting the siege of the christian enclave it invited lebanons 
parliament to meet outside the country to forge a settlement to the 
14yearold civil war 
an arab league leaders summit in morocco last month asked the 
three heads of state to find a settlement to the civil war by 
november 
christian and moslem leaders have welcomed the call by the three 
arab leaders for an end to violence in all its forms but 
differed on whether lebanons parliament should meet overseas 
christian parliament members in general have opposed meeting 
outside lebanon saying if the siege were lifted and crossing 
gateways reopened there would be no need to travel 
shafiq badr was the only christian deputy who expressed readiness 
wednesday to go anywhere to discuss an end to the war 
the independent daily paper annahar said aoun a maronite 
expressed reservations over parliaments meeting abroad because it 
contradicts lebanons sovereignty 
however it is up to the deputies to decide the paper quoted 
the 54yearold general as saying 
syrias 40000 troops in lebanon besieged the christian enclave 
early in march to retaliate for a blockade imposed by aoun against 
illegal ports run by syrianbacked militias south of beirut 
aoun and other christian leaders accuse the syrians of failing to 
achieve a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the 22nation arab league 
by siding with the moslems against the christians in the lebanese 
civil war 
prosyrian moslem and leftist factions say syrian troops should 
remain in lebanon until the christians agree to reform the 45year 
political system in a way that guarantees equal shares to the 
various sects in running the nations affairs

syrian and christian gunners brushed aside 
an arab call to end the beirut bloodbath and fought ferociously 
thursday police said six people were killed and 26 wounded 
the latest casualties mostly civilians caught in the crossfire 
raised the toll to 380 killed and 1497 wounded in the 15week 
confrontation between syrian troops and mainly christian soldiers of 
the lebanese army 
a police spokesman said victims included two civilians killed in 
moslem west beirut when a 155mm shell crashed on their car 
another civilian was killed at west beiruts barbir hospital 
which took several direct hits from christian gunners said the 
spokesman who cannot be identified under standing regulations 
he said the other three civilians were killed in christian east 
beirut 
barbir hospitals two upper floors could be seen burning from a 
distance 
a hospital official speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
man killed there took refuge at the hospital after shelling started 
none of the patients and medical staff were hurt the official 
said they evacuated to the basement and an underground shelter 
barbir one of four major medical centers in the moslem sector 
is near the green line that divides lebanons capital into christian 
and moslem sectors 
the sound of exploding shells rocked beirut around noon smoke 
and dust billowed from stricken targets and ambulance sirens wailed 
panicking motorists abandoned their cars and took refuge in building 
entrances shopkeepers lowered their shutters 
parents rushed to the few open schools to bring children home 
some schools reopened last week when the security situation appeared 
to improve 
the latest fighting erupted march 8 two days after christian 
leader gen michel aoun blockaded illegal ports run by syrianbacked 
militias south of beirut 
retaliating lebanese druse militiamen started to besiege the 
310squaremile christian enclave north of beirut that is home to 
about 1 million people that siege has been enforced by syrian 
troops in lebanon under an arab league peacekeeping mandate 
this is the way the syrians responded to the ceasefire called 
by the tripartite arab committee the christian voice of lebanon 
radio complained 
the arab league has given its committee comprising algerian 
president chadli bendjedid king hassan ii of morocco and saudi 
arabias king fahd until november to negotiate a settlement in 
lebanon 
on tuesday the committee repeated calls for a ceasefire and a 
lifting of port blockades 
it said once the ceasefire is consolidated it will invite 
lebanons parliament to meet outside the country to negotiate a new 
powersharing formula and end the 14year conflict between 
christians and moslems 
leaders of both sides welcomed the peace call but the christians 
do not want to meet abroad 
christian legislators say that if syria lifts the siege they 
could meet at beiruts midcity parliament building 
the leftist daily paper assafir quoted moslem parliament speaker 
hussein husseini as calling on deputies to carry out your duty and 
cooperate with the tripartite arab committee

police today arrested a suspect in the 
poisoning of austins centuriesold treaty oak 
no details were immediately available police scheduled a news 
conference to discuss the arrest of the person suspected of applying 
the potent herbicide that is making the 50foot oaks leaves turn 
brown and fall off 
legend has it stephen f austin the father of texas signed a 
treaty with the indians under the trees branches although 
historians give little credence to the story over the years people 
have proposed marriage under its boughs 
the attack on the venerable oak saddened many and offerings 
ranging from getwell cards and flowers to crystals and chicken soup 
have been left at the ailing tree which has a 127foot limb spread 
and is 525 inches in diameter at chest height 
the vandal could be charged with criminal mischief punishable by 
up to 20 years in prison 
the austin americanstatesman citing unidentified sources 
reported earlier that a man is suspected of poisoning the tree in an 
attempt to invoke a magic spell 
the circle of herbicide poured next to the tree may be a symbol 
of unrequited love the newspaper said 
it was not immediately known if the man cited in the report was 
the one under arrest 
du pont co which produces the herbicide velpar at a plant in 
la porte put up a 10000 reward for the vandals conviction the 
texas forestry association added 1000

secretary of state james a baker iii 
disapproving of moves in congress for further sanctions against 
china said thursday that us foreign policy cannot be guided 
entirely by human rights considerations 
he urged congress to work out a compromise with the white house 
that would preserve president bushs flexibility in framing a us 
response to the crackdown on prodemocracy forces and permit the 
united states to speak with one voice on the subject 
baker said bush who headed the us liaison office in beijing 
from 1974 to 1975 knows as much about china as any elected 
official we do recognize the desire of elected officials to speak 
to this and to vote on this issue baker said at a white house 
news conference 
but we really and firmly believe that the leadership in this 
instance must come from the executive branch and it should come from 
the president of the united states as commanderinchief and as one 
who is thoroughly and completely versed in the affairs of china 
therefore baker said the bush administration could not endorse 
the package of sanctions being put together on capitol hill to 
register congressional concern over a wave of arrests and executions 
and to try to moderate the chinese leadership 
within hours of his comments the house voted 4180 for the 
package which endorses previous bush moves but would add suspension 
of trade and development programs a ban on the sale of police 
equipment and a limit on transfer of hightechnology and nuclear 
materials or components 
the house provision is part of a foreign aid bill that has not 
yet been debated in the senate 
even though bush and baker have expressed outrage over 
developments in china including the attack by the military on 
students in tiananmen square june 34 several members of congress 
have exhorted them to take stronger action and make more damning 
statements 
but baker said we will not use inflammatory rhetoric 
he said uschinese relations served a variety of purposes and 
should not be jettisoned as a response to the crackdown 
the principle of human rights has to be a major foundation 
principle for our foreign policy baker said it has been it 
continues to be and in my view it will continue to be well into the 
future that is a very very important principle 
but he said it is not the only principle which determines our 
foreign policy and it is not and cannot be the sole and only 
principle which determines the extent and scope and degree of the 
response of the united states in a situation such as this 
when we say the relationship is important and that we ought to 
try and preserve the relationship we do not suggest that we do so 
at all cost and we are not suggesting that it is important solely 
from an economic basis 
it is important economically yes but it is important as well 
from a geopolitical and geostrategic standpoint 
baker did not elaborate on the point but us relations with the 
communist government in beijing built up over the last two dozen 
years has sometimes been used as leverage in dealing with the 
soviet union 
the sanctions imposed by bush suspended military sales to china 
and prohibited visits by senior us military and civilian officials 
the congressional package an amendment to a twoyear 23 billion 
foreign aid bill would put these executive actions into law 
suspend trade and development programs ban the sale of 
policerelated weapons and limit transfer of high technology and 
nuclear materials or components 
the amendment also included some harsh rhetoric condemning the 
unprovoked brutal and indiscriminate assault on peaceful 
demonstrators that left at least 700 dead

defense secretary dick cheney said today he was 
generally pleased with the house armed services committees 
action on the defense budget but he questioned congress desire to 
cut spending without canceling weapons systems 
the house panel on wednesday restored funds for the marine corps 
v22 osprey aircraft and f14d tomcat fighter two programs cheney 
wants to eliminate against the advice of its chairman the 
democraticcontrolled committee rejected an amendment to accept 
cheneys 64 billion procurement budget without additions or 
deletions 
cheney in a statement released at the pentagon said he was 
generally pleased with the committees decision but he added 
the problem is that while congress wants to cut defense spending 
some dont want to cancel any systems or close any bases 
we must not preserve the fiction that we can keep all the 
weapons and bases everyone wants and still spend less money he 
said 
pentagon spokesman pete williams said cheney clearly wished 
the armed services committee had accepted the budget proposal 
without change but understands thats the way the process works 
republicans on the panel warned that restoring funds for the v22 
and f14d by amending cheneys proposal for the fiscal year starting 
oct 1 will lead to chaos on the house floor when the legislation is 
debated 
but democrats who changed the package and also cut funds for the 
b2 stealth bomber said their efforts indicate they wont roll 
over and play dead 
by virtue of a 2626 tie the result of lastminute no votes 
from reps patricia schroeder dcolo and ron dellums dcalif 
the committee defeated a proposal to accept cheneys procurement 
budget without changes 
this let the panel approve 445 a budget that includes funds for 
the osprey and tomcat planes 
the bill goes to the full house the overall defense budget is 
295 billion 
under the individual amendments approved earlier by the panel 
the bellboeing osprey which is built in fort worth texas would 
receive 157 million in fiscal 1990 beginning oct 1 
the tomcat manufactured by grumman corp on long island would 
get about 1 billion 
the national guard and reserves would receive about 1 billion 
half of which had been earmarked for the b2 bomber while the other 
half had been appropriated for spare parts 
rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services 
panel urged his colleagues to accept cheneys procurement budget 
without revision 
rep herbert bateman rva added that breaking cheneys plan 
breaks a logjam that will bring total chaos 
but others on the panel were not deterred 
rep marvin leath dtexas said that after 11 years of hard work 
he will not roll over and play dead 
dellums introduced an amendment to cancel the b2 bomber which 
at 500 million to 650 million each is considered the most 
expensive plane in history 
its time to cut loose from the monument to misallocated 
money dellums argued weve obligated ourselves to 22 billion 
without knowing whether this plane can fly 
rep john kasich rohio who backed the amendment said that 
every week the air force changes the mission for the radarevading 
plane 
but aspin argued that a vote on the b2 will take place on the 
house floor and total termination at this point is wrong 
dellums amendment lost 3616 but a handful of members responded 
no for now indicating that when the question comes up on the 
house floor they may oppose funds for the costly radarevading plane 
the panel also rejected dellums amendment to delete 164 million 
requested by the pentagon to move 50 mx missiles from silos to 
railroad cars 
the panel did approve language that transferred money from b2 
purchasing to research and development on the stealth bomber a day 
earlier the panel rejected an amendment to restore 351 million for 
the bomber that the research and development subcommittee voted to 
spend on the osprey 
that vote left 27 billion in purchasing funds for the b2 and 
cut the proposed 18 billion for research and development to about 
15 billion 
the budget vote came one day after the panel slashed 11 billion 
from star wars formally known as the strategic defense initiative 
by voice vote the committee approved a 35 billion budget for sdi 
considerably less than the 46 billion bush proposed for the 
program

bush promised closer economic ties between the two nations after two 
hours of private talks today at the white house

africa said he and the african leader exchanged paperwork for a 
treaty to encourage greater us investment there 
he also said the united states supports zaires efforts to win 
new loans from the international monetary fund and praised its 
commitment to reform its economy 
in a departure ceremony outside the white house bush also 
praised mobutu for his role in bringing about the recent ceasefire 
in the bordering nation of angola where civil war has raged for 14 
years

mobutu the first african headofstate invited by bush to the 
white house thanked the president for giving us support to 
efforts to strengthen his nations economy

humanrights improvements in zaire 
mobutu has long supported us policy goals in africa while 
compiling a human rights record widely regarded as one of the worst 
on the continent 
zaire can be ranked among those countries which observe the 
rule of law not to be confused or mistaken with any incidental 
mishaps that are attributable to an administration or to 
individuals mobutu said 
the two leaders made their formal remarks in public at the end of 
their twohour meeting and lunch 
mobutu won plaudits from us diplomats last week for the key 
role he played in helping arrange the angolan ceasefire which was 
agreed upon at an 18nation african summit meeting hosted by mobutu 
mobutu brushed aside questions wednesday about his human rights 
performance saying he has no reason to repress any zairean because 
100 percent of his subjects support him 
the united states and zaire have enjoyed close ties for most of 
the 24 years mobutu has ruled his country zaire has received 
substantial us assistance over the years while serving as a 
transit point for us military supplies destined for anticommunist 
rebels in neighboring angola 
but concern on capitol hill over the rights situation in zaire is 
expected to lead to a cut in the administrations zaire military aid 
request from 9 million to 3 million in fiscal 1990 mobutus 
schedule today included an afternoon meeting with members of the 
house foreign affairs committee 
freedom house a new yorkbased group which promotes democracy 
around the world ranks zaire with the worst human rights violators 
in africa 
the annual state department human rights report released in 
february said that among the human rights abuses in zaire are 
torture and other forms of physical mistreatment of detainees 
state department deputy spokesman richard boucher said wednesday 
that mobutu recently has taken a number of steps to correct abuses 
he added however that human rights problems and deficiencies are 
part of our ongoing dialogue with zaire 
there also have been allegations about widespread corruption in 
zaire a state department document cited in a new york times article 
two years ago estimated mobutus wealth at more than 5 billion 
among mobutus assets are a number of castles and palaces in 
zaire and in europe

the leader of the governing 
national party said today the partys plan to eventually give blacks 
a direct vote in national affairs will end south africas isolation 
antiapartheid activists and conservatives reacted with 
skepticism to the proposal which envisions blacks having a vote in 
national affairs within five years anglican archbishop desmond 
tutu who won the 1984 nobel peace prize for his fight against 
apartheid rejected the plan outright 
the plan is part of the partys new election platform which also 
holds out the possibility of giving the black majority a voice in 
writing a new constitution 
the party held a oneday congress in pretoria today and accepted 
the platform no vote was held the congress simply adjourned with 
no delegates voicing objections to the plan 
party leader fw de klerk designated to replace retiring 
president pw botha after the sept 6 parliamentary elections 
opened the meeting by saying the party could lead the country back 
into the international community which has condemned south africas 
system of racial separation 
our cause is just and the doors must open we will not have to 
go crawling back we will walk in proudly and with our heads high 
said de klerk who wept when the 1500 delegates greeted him with a 
standing ovation in pretoria city hall 
a less enthusiastic ovation followed his brief tribute to botha 
who did not attend the meeting the two have had strained relations 
since march when party leaders indicated they wanted botha to 
resign so de klerk could take over 
an editorial in the antiapartheid cape times of cape town 
complained that the proposal provided for a bill of rights only as a 
possible option and failed to say how blacks would be 
incorporated into the government 
whatever its votewinning merits for the np as a plan to 
resolve the south african crisis it is much too tentative the 
newspaper said 
tutu said the platform it was designed to make apartheid more 
comfortable rather than dismantle it 
we are not interested in reform we want to see apartheid 
abolished tutue said today in hilleroed denmark where he was 
attending a festival of the danish national church 
ferdi hartzenberg deputy leader of the proapartheid 
conservative party said the plan would lead to majority rule by 
south africas 28 million blacks and deprive the 5 million whites of 
influence in the writing of a new constitution 
political analysts say the conservative party may gain some seats 
in the national legislature as a result of the national party reform 
proposals 
south africas apartheid system denies blacks a voice in 
government and relegates them to separate housing schools and 
health care facilities whites also control the nations economy 
many foreign governments have imposed economic sanctions and 
other limitations on dealing with south africa in efforts to force 
an end to apartheid 
much of the national partys platform represents a softening of 
policies designed to maintain white control and is seen as 
reflecting the views of de klerk 
the fiveyear program includes removal of criminal penalties for 
residential apartheid violations more government subsidies for 
multiracial schools removal of race as the major criterion for 
identifying political groups a bill of rights and negotiating a 
new constitution with black leaders 
in london a leader of the outlawed african national congress 
guerrilla group called the platform an advance but from a wrong 
position 
its a step forward to the extent that the national party 
recognizes that south africa cannot be ruled on the basis of 
exclusive power for the white minority thabo mbeki secretary for 
international affairs said wednesday en route to the ancs base in 
lusaka zambia 
but the position is wrong because it continues to define people 
as black and white and not as the people of south africa the period 
of transition must emerge from negotiations 
clive derbylewis spokesman for the conservative party likened 
the plan to the sales talk of an unscrupulous car dealer and 
said the national party was hiding plans to go further in reducing 
racial laws 
it is completely different from what they really intend to do 
it is real skulduggery he said in a telephone interview it 
will generate further distrust in the nationalists by the 
electorate 
beeld the leading afrikaanslanguage newspaper progovernment 
but generally moderate in its views said the partys plan has the 
potential to create a new south africa if carried out with vigor

the nontoxic waste produced when chemical 
weapons stored on a pacific island are destroyed should be buried in 
us landfills the army said thursday 
the army had hoped to dump some of the waste from johnston atoll 
into the ocean but said in a statement that it decided against 
asking congress for an exception to a law that bans such disposal 
landfills that might be used in the project werent named in 
thursdays environmental impact study sites wont be known until 
the project is approved and bids solicited from private companies 
said army spokesman lt col john chapla 
the disposal cannot proceed until public comments are reviewed 
and the armys impact statement approved 
the impact study deals with the first part of a longterm program 
to destroy thousands of rounds of aging chemical weapons stored at 
various army depots 
the johnston atoll depot was used by the army to test and develop 
an incineration process to destroy the weapons the environmental 
impact studies for that depot are farther along than for those 
inside the united states 
the incineration process will destroy the toxic chemical gases 
however it produces three types of waste liquid brine solid waste 
that can be sold for scrap and solid waste without value 
the army said the liquid brine should be dried and shipped to 
landfills in the united states 
this alternative will be used unless other considerations 
cost logistics impact or political factors make it not viable 
the army said no significant adverse environmental impacts are 
expected 
if the plan isnt approved the brine likely would be stored in 
drums on the island 
the army refuses to disclose the size of its chemical stockpile 
however published estimates range from 25000 tons to 40000 tons 
the armys existing chemical stocks average more than 25 years 
old within the united states they are stored at depots in utah 
alabama maryland indiana kentucky oregon colorado and arkansas 
congress in approving the production of new chemical weapons 
during the reagan administration specified the army would have to 
proceed simultaneously with the destruction of existing stocks

the house appropriations committee citing 
concerns about a possible oil spill approved legislation today 
imposing a yearlong moratorium on oil or gas exploration in 
alaskas bristol bay one of the nations premier fishing areas 
the legislation also would extend existing prohibitions against 
oil or gas exploration along vast stretches off the coasts of 
california florida and new england and impose a new moratorium on 
leases along a coastal stretch from rhode island to maryland 
the curbs which would deal a sharp blow to the petroleum 
industry if they prevail in final legislation were included in an 
116 billion fiscal 1990 appropriation bill for the interior 
department which oversees the leasing of offshore oil exporation 
rights 
it prohibits interior from using any funds during the fiscal year 
beginning oct 1 on oil leases in bristol bay 
an amendment that would have allowed exploration to proceed in 
the bay off southwestern alaska was defeated by a vote of 2922 its 
sponsor rep ralph regula rohio argued development of the bays 
oil reserves is badly needed to meet the countrys energy needs 
but rep sydney yates dill chairman of the appropriations 
subcommittee that had recommended the moratorium cited the 
devastation left by the oil spill from the tanker exxon valdez in 
alaskas prince william sound last march 24 
weve seen whats happened in prince william sound yates 
declared and began reciting details of the environmental and 
economic chaos left by the spill he said the 1 billion fishing 
industry in bristol bay is is probably 50 times as significant 
the alaska state government has said the fishing industry in 
bristol bay could be even more vulnerable to a major oil spill as in 
the area of prince william sound the oil from bristol bay would 
likely be transported by tanker 
in juneau alaska gov steve cowper called the committee action 
clear evidence that our views are being heard in washington the 
alaska congressional delegation had sought the moratorium on bristol 
bay exploration 
the interior department last year sold exploratory leases for a 
halfdozen sites in bristol bay for 95 million the legislation 
would call for repurchasing those leases 
in addition to the curbs on oil exploration in bristol bay the 
legislation also calls for a moratorium on exploration in three 
areas off the california coast in the gulf of mexico off the 
southern florida coast in the georges banks off the new england 
coast and along a coastal buffer from rhode island to southern 
maryland 
the bush administration already has postponed issuing leases in 
southern and northern california pending further environmental 
review the house bill would extend the moratorium to leases off the 
central california coast as well the leases off southern florida 
also have been put on hold by the administration 
a moratorium also has been in effect previously for the leases in 
the georges bank

three western governors at odds with 
washington over disposal of nuclear waste in their states stood 
their ground despite assurances from energy secretary james watkins 
that the government is serious about safety 
gov garrey carruthers said new mexico wont accept any 
radioactive waste until the energy department meets all commitments 
to the state gov cecil andrus said idaho wont take any more 
shipments after august and colorado gov roy romer said he will 
shut down the rocky flats weapons plant when it reaches its storage 
capacity 
during a meeting with the governors on wednesday the secretary 
said the plutoniumwaste storage facility built a third of a mile 
underground near here wont open until the government shows it can 
safely transport and bury nuclear waste 
the departments waste isolation pilot plant is designed for 
permanent storage of radioactive waste created by military projects 
the waste would be kept 2150 feet below ground in ancient salt beds 
26 miles southeast of here 
we will open wipp but we will open it when its ready 
watkins said 
the wipp was supposed to open last october but questions about 
the longterm safety of the salt beds and how waste is to be 
transported to it have delayed the opening watkins has said he 
expects to open the plant next year but has not given a target date 
with rocky flats expected to run out of storage space by early 
next year and the three western governors standing firm the 
government could find itself without a place to store nuclear waste 
a stalemate that federal officials said could endanger maintenance 
of the nations nuclear arsenal 
the president asked me to come into this job to clean up the 
mess dealing with the production reactors the waste facilities so 
this nation can stand tall again on the peacethroughstrength 
concept which wipp is all about watkins said 
watkins said he couldnt speculate on where waste would be stored 
if rocky flats became filled but he said it is unlikely idaho 
colorado or new mexico would be used for any type of interim storage 
facility 
after the meeting the governors said they were pleased with 
watkins takecharge attitude 
there is a new breeze blowing across eddy county and across the 
united states with respect to the department of energy carruthers 
said i like the fact the secretary has committed to us that he 
will operate at his pace a pace that he determines is safe 
but none of the governors was willing to budge on accepting more 
waste 
andrus said idaho as planned will accept four boxcars of waste 
from rocky flats in august and then close its border idahos 
position is not going to change he said 
romer said rocky flats may not expand its storage capacity 
and when we reach the limit we will close rocky flats 
carruthers said the state of new mexico believes wipp is not 
yet ready to accept waste and we will resist all efforts to open 
until such time as doe commitments to new mexico are met those 
commitments include compensation for road improvements and 
assurances on safety and environmental protection

by the hundreds they waited in line some all 
night long for the abortion decision what they got those few who 
actually made it into the supreme court thursday were decisions 
affecting indian reservations and tupperware sales 
people who have waited for a space shot that eventually is 
postponed would know how that feels 
disappointing is too weak a word frustrating doesnt make it 
neither does thwarted letdown or dissatisfied thursdays failure 
to deliver a decision in the abortion case was like a countdown to 
nothing a scrub no go 
molly yard president of the national organization of women 
likened the wait to a chinese water torture 
i have to say that i think in my fantasizing that there must be 
an argument going on she said weve always believed that 
sandra day oconnor was the swing vote and i hope and pray that she 
will join with our four friends on the supreme court who are for the 
right of a woman to control her reproductive life under the privacy 
interpretation of the constitution 
randall terry national director of operation rescue said it was 
a little frustrating to keep coming again and again and again and 
again and added frankly i just think they want to get the 
decision and get out of town i mean if i was a supreme court 
justice i would throw the decision off the airplane as i was 
leaving the country 
olivia gans director of victims of abortion a righttolife 
group acknowledged it was hard to wait but were optimistic 
when the word came out that the only decisions thursday were in 
the cookware and indian reservation cases the cameras and 
microphones were dismantled but the demonstrators got into a little 
dialogue of their own 
not the church not the state women must decide our fate 
chanted the prochoice side 
what about the babies fate was a chant in response 
two male demonstrators faced off 
do you have the right to decide the choice of someone else 
no neither does the woman she doesnt have the right to 
but its her body 
oh come on man a fetus is not a womans body 
you cant tell her what to do with her body 
then she cant tell the baby that babys got no right to live 
its her body and you dont have the right to make that choice 
for her 
a fetus is not her body 
its inside her body 
a tapeworms inside you does that make a tapeworm your body 
a young woman holding up a placard of the national organization 
of women told an older woman i dont believe it is human until it 
is born the response you dont believe it is human til it is 
born you had better study science honey 
of the line of people stretching around one side of the building 
only about 50 got in for the brief session first in line was 
michael carrier a student at yale university who said he had 
waited since 630 pm wednesday 
im here because i feel this is such an important decision 
carrier said i just had to be here when it came down 
in front of the meditative female statue on one side of the 
entrance stairs of the supreme court the forces opposing abortion 
were arrayed holding yellow banners with black letters the child 
killing must be stopped 
on the right in front of the vigilant male statue that typifies 
execution of the laws were the prochoice demonstrators holding 
purple banners with white letters keep abortion legal 
a kneeling bearded man in the robes of a monk said his rosary 
while frowning at prochoice placards one small girl held a placard 
larger than herself my mother chose life anothers read why 
do my future playmates have to die there were the usual people 
displaying large color photographs of bleeding fetuses a staple of 
antiabortion demonstrations 
in space lingo a launch scrub is followed by a turnaround 
readying the ship for its next try for the court the

authorities have begun an 
international manhunt for a convicted nazi murderer who fled to 
avoid arrest a state prosecutor said thursday 
wuppertal prosecutor friedhelm gabriel did not rule out the 
possibility that an underground group may have aided the escape of 
former nazi death camp guard gottfried weise 
weise 69 was convicted jan 28 1988 of killing at least five 
prisoners in 1944 at the auschwitz concentration camp weise 
disappeared after a federal court upheld his conviction and life 
sentence 
gabriel said weise was allowed to remain at his home near 
wuppertal pending appeal to care for his sick wife after officials 
confiscated his passport and weise mortgaged his house to post a 
150000 bond 
but when police went to arrest him on april 20 to begin serving 
his prison term weise had disappeared 
asked about speculation that an underground organization similar 
to one described in frederick forsyths 1972 novel the odessa 
file could have helped weise escape gabriel said there are 
suspicions that groups like odessa exist but we dont have concrete 
evidence 
such an organization would have to be very secretive gabrial 
said in an interview from wuppertal about 210 miles northwest of 
frankfurt 
the novel is about a ruthless group of nazi sympathizers who help 
smuggle war criminals to safety in south america and other parts of 
the world 
but weise had to have some sort of help he had to get new 
identity papers somewhere because we have his passport he also 
doesnt have much money he was on a pension gabriel said 
he said weises wife ursula 62 subsequently disappeared 
she suddenly left we think on june 22 and her relatives 
refuse to tell us where shes gone we believe shes trying to join 
her husband the prosecutor said 
police issued an international arrest warrant for weise 
alfred streim who runs the federal nazi document center in 
ludwigsburg said it was possible weise was helped to escape but 
there has never been proof that an odessatype organization exists 
streims office is responsible for tracking fugitive war 
criminals in west germany 
there were some people in italy who helped in escapes after the 
war but they were not as organized as odessa streim said 
during weises 15month trial he became known as the william 
tell of auschwitz when witnesses testified that he killed an 
8yearold boy and a 17yearold girl by forcing them to balance tin 
cans on their heads which he used for target practice 
he was convicted in their deaths and of killing two male 
prisoners who tried to escape by hiding in a supply truck weise 
also was convicted of killing an inmate because he responded too 
slowly to orders

president bush promised today that he will 
work with congress toward attaining a pay raise for members and 
top federal officials but he stopped short of offering a specific 
proposal 
in a speech centered on campaign finance proposals to truly 
clean up the system bush also proposed new restrictions on 
political action committees and curtailing some advantages enjoyed 
by incumbent members of congress 
regarding a pay raise which members rejected earlier this year 
amid public outrage bush said i will also work with congress on 
the development of details for increasing the pay of those in 
congress as well as other senior employees of the executive branch 
he said he would also send congress separate legislation to ban 
honoraria members earn for outside speaking engagements and to 
address certain aspects of compenstation for federal officials 
including a 25 percent pay increase for judges that he endorsed 
previously 
campaign finance reform was the focus of bushs speech before a 
group of congressional interns 
the president said his proposals were designed to loosen the 
grip of special interests in politics and strengthen the role of 
the political parties which he called the indispensable 
organizers of democracy 
several of his proposals would have the effect of harming 
democrats the most since they hold the majority in congress and 
control most statehouses which have the power to draw political 
district lines 
bushs proposals would 
abolish political action committees that are connected to 
corporations unions or trade groups while allowing socalled 
ideological pacs that operate independently of any such organization 
reduce the percandidate contribution limit for the remaining 
pacs from the current 5000 to 2500 
more than double the amount of money political parties are 
allowed to give to each congressional candidate for senate races 
the amount currently ranges from 92000 to about 15 million 
depending on state population 
ban carrying over campaign funds from one election to the next 
that would require congressional candidates to return leftover funds 
to the contributors or give the money to the political parties or 
the government 
curtail gerrymandering methods of drawing political district 
lines to benefit one political party or group over another the 
districts would have to be drawn according to geographical and 
community boundaries said a senior administration official who 
acknowledged litigation would be the only way to enforce such laws 
require full disclosure of socalled soft money 
contributions to political parties soft money refers generally to 
corporate and labor donations that are barred in federal campaigns 
such money often takes a back channel path into federal campaigns 
when the funds are contributed to political parties which then help 
the candidates 
require disclosure by unions corporations and trade 
associations of any money they spend for election activity such as 
voter registration drives 
restrict franking privileges which allow members of congress to 
send mail to their constituents free blanket constituency mailings 
such as the curent practice of sending newsletters would be banned 
a group of gop congressional leaders discussed the proposals with 
bush at the white house today and later praised him for taking a 
leadership role on the issue 
although congress has consistently squelched previous efforts to 
restrict pacs and make other campaign reforms rep guy vander jagt 
rmich said that will change because there exists in the country 
a growing prairie fire where people are going to rise up and say 
wed like these elections back in our hands 
administration officials sought to emphasize the campaign reform 
proposals and downplay the payhike issue which covers ground the 
president has trod before 
bush endorsed a 51 percent salary increase for congress 
executive branch officials and judges in january at his first news 
conference but congress squelched the pay hike under a firestorm of 
criticism in february 
in april bush endorsed a 25 percent pay increase for federal 
judges a measure still pending in congress he has said he wanted 
to separate the question of congressional pay hikes from raises for 
judges and executive branch officials because the politically 
sensitive congress is skittish about raising its own pay 
by all accounts there is little sentiment on capitol hill for 
delving into the pay raisehonoraria flap again 
on the election law reform bush has been consulting with a 
variety of experts and met this week with advocacy groups that have 
long criticized the current system as allowing special interest 
groups to buy influence through a variety of backdoor campaign 
contribution methods 
bush won their praise for his direction but they said he did not 
appear willing to take the dramatic steps they think will solve the 
problem 
ellen miller who heads the nonprofit center for responsive 
politics said that disclosing contributions and expenditures of 
soft money will shed light on the sources but will not eliminate the 
practice 
fred wertheimer president of the lobby group common cause said 
abolishing corporate and union pacs but allowing nonconnected pacs 
would merely allow people to reorganize pacs

china on thursday said the european economic 
community was presumptuous in denouncing the suppression of the 
prodemocracy movement and that its actions could harm relations 
with beijing 
before finding out the truth concerning the quelling of the 
counterrevolutionary rebellion in china the european council worked 
so fast as to rashly issue a statement making presumptuous 
accusations against china said foreign ministry spokeswoman li 
jinhua 
the chinese government cannot but express deep regret over this 
unreasonable act she said 
the leaders of the 12nation eec tuesday condemned the brutal 
repression taking place in china 
they also called for an embargo on arm sales to china and urged 
the world bank to postpone new loans to beijing the united states 
australia japan and canada have taken similar steps 
the crackdown on the movement for a freer society began on june 3 
when the army drove student protesters from tiananmen square in 
beijing since then the government has arrested more than 1800 
people and announced the executions of 27 
the eec urged the chinese government to halt the executions 
respect human rights and take into account the hopes for freedom 
and democracy deeply felt by the population 
ms li said china put down the rebellion in accordance with 
the chinese constitution and that the european countries had 
unilaterally adopted decisions jeopardizing the bilateral 
relations 
all attempts by all foreign governments or organizations to 
bring pressures to bear on the chinese government or interfere in 
chinas internal affairs in this or that manner are unwise and 
futile she said 
ms li said the government hoped eurepean leaders after learning 
the truth would treasure our friendly relations established 
after years of efforts 
the government says a small group of people instigated the seven 
weeks of demonstrations leading up to the crackdown 
it also says only 200 to 300 people most of them soldiers were 
killed in the clashes in beijing chinese witnesses and western 
intelligence reports say the death toll could be as high as 3000 
and that most victims were unarmed civilians

the legislature has voted to relax a 
napoleonicera law that forces parents to leave a portion of their 
estate to their children 
the legislation amending louisianas unique forced heirship 
law would guarantee an inheritance only to offspring who are under 
23 when a parent dies 
by that time the parents have raised and educated their 
children the bills sponsor rep sydney nelson said wednesday 
critics of the law complained it deprives people of the right to 
dispose of their estates as they see fit such as withholding an 
inheritance from a wayward son or daughter 
louisiana adheres to a civil code first adopted by france 
including forced heirship which requires parents with one child to 
leave that child at least onefourth of the estate parents with two 
or more children must leave 50 percent to them 
on tuesday the house placed routine amendments on the bill and 
gave it 6536 passage the senate on wednesday concurred in the 
amendments 2610 
the bill was sent to gov buddy roemer who is expected to sign 
it nelson said 
if we concur we will be wipping out 181 years of history 
well be wiping out equality among children warned sen oswald 
decuir he said parents could pick out a favored child and leave the 
others with nothing 
forced heirship the key word is force rep randy roach 
said during the debate what right has the state to tell parents 
theyve got to leave a certain portion of their estate to adult 
children theyve already raised and educated

under pressure to tear down a littered 
illegal shantytown of cardboard and decaying tents in the shadow of 
city hall officials say they hope housing and job programs will 
solve the problem 
its become about the most gross smelly awful thing ive ever 
seen in my life said lois chang a 43yearold travel agent who 
reaches her job by crossing the civic center plaza encampment 
a lot of these people are just taking advantage of the kindness 
and tolerance the citys tried to show said chang who says she 
has been spit on by plaza panhandlers now its out of hand and 
has got to go 
the number of makeshift shelters has doubled in the past week 
after growing steadily for several months said police capt dennis 
martel he said he fields about 10 complaints a week about the 
shantytown 
advocates for the homeless and some shantytown residents say they 
fear any trouble breaking out at the plaza could cause police to 
sweep in and make arrests despite a pledge by mayor art agnos to let 
them stay 
a city ordinance forbids sleeping in parks but agnos has an 
unwritten pact with the ragtag group which grows to as many as 400 
people nightly they can remain beneath the plazas olive trees 
until he implements his housing programs but there must be no 
public defecation no structures and no harassment of passersby 
opponents say the rules have been ignored making the shantytown 
a health and safety threat agnos urging patience says police are 
diplomatically reminding the homeless of the rules 
i believe the people of san francisco have the good will and 
compassion to accept this temporary situation until we as a city can 
provide the substantive meaningful humane alternatives we all 
want agnos said 
social worker lorett vergara of the nonprofit tenderloin housing 
clinic said she has been able to house 22 people from the plaza 
although she has identified 61 people with job skills she has been 
able to find work for only three 
the mayors doing all he can do and hes bucking a lot of 
people to do it vergara said 
public pressure for a crackdown has grown with an increase of 
auto breakins assaults public drunkenness and indecent exposure 
at the plaza said police sgt jerry senkir 
last week a couple complained that while they ate lunch in the 
plaza one man exposed himself another urinated next to their bench 
and a third demanded money while threatening them with a pipe 
were trying to keep the lid on this situation but whether or 
not were going to be able to enforce city law or not remains to be 
seen mainly were waiting to see what happens from the mayors 
office senkir said 
the shantytown homeless claim that for several days this week 
police arrived with bullhorns at 4 am warning people they must 
remove structures or face eviction senkir said bullhorns were only 
used once 
under former mayor dianne feinstein the city spent millions each 
year providing temporary shelter for the citys 10000 homeless 
agnos who took office 18 months ago called that a wasteful 
deadend approach 
he has cut back use of hotels and has earmarked 15 million in 
next years budget for transitional housing where homeless 
people can spend the night do laundry make phone calls receive 
mail and get job counseling and welfare services agnos said tuesday 
the city had received 6 million in federal grants to support his 
homelessness programs 
the homeless arent all just alcoholics or drug users said 
23yearold kevin who like other shantytown residents would tell a 
reporter only his first name but those kinds of people have taken 
over out here so its giving the rest of us a bad name 
i come here for the camaraderie said 33yearold reggie 
homeless for several years and sharing a bottle of cheap wine with 
three fellow campers about 9 am 
we all look out for each other here reggie said theres 
strength in numbers

riot police fought back firing volleys of tear gas from armored 
vans and rifles and hurling tear gas grenades and rocks across the 
walls and locked gates 
a dozen students were seen injured one policeman was injured

in downtown seoul about 700 students wanting to get into hanyang 
campus occupied a major intersection they fought riot police with 
firebombs and rocks forcing shoppers to race for shelter 
drive out yankees who block national unification the 
protesters screamed overthrow roh taewoo 
radicals back north koreas calls for the seoul government to

korea 
seoul says pyongyang is using the festival to stir up radical 
movements north korea denies the charges about the sports and 
cultural event that is attended mainly by nonaligned and communist 
nations 
meanwhile roh pledged today he will maintain a strong 
government against illegal acts and leftists who he claimed threaten 
democracy

greeces communist alliance with a day 
left to form a government thursday continued to press for a 
coalition of all parties despite continuous rejections from the main 
conservative and socialist parties 
harilaos florakis leader of the coalition of the left and 
progress met with ailing caretaker premier andreas papandreou at 
athens general state hospital and with conservative party leader 
constantine mitsotakis 
more such meetings are planned before the coalition on friday 
stands to lose its mandate to negotiate a governing alliance 
after a 55minute meeting with papandreou florakis said the 
coalition will assess the results of todays talks 
the coalitions proposals for a national unity government to 
include all political parties has run up against strong opposition 
mainly because of its insistence that a coalition politician lead 
the government 
the impasse follows inconclusive june 18 elections at which the 
coalition made up of the promoscow greek communist party and the 
eurocommunist greek left won 28 seats after receiving 13 percent of 
the vote and emerged as a power broker 
president christos sartzetakis gave the coalition a threeday 
exploratory mandate after the dominant conservatives and socialists 
failed to negotiate alliances it was the first such mandate 
received by the communists since the party was recognized officially 
in 1974 
their proposal has been turned down both by mitsotakis 
centerright new democracy party and papandreous panhellenic 
socialist movement 
the stumbling point is the coalitions insistence that neither 
mitsotakis nor papandreou head a coalition 
we believe that the demand to place certain persons above the 
possibility to find a solution is very wrong said eurocommunist 
leader leonidas kyrkos 
the premier of the new government should be able to reflect a 
greater deal of trust kyrkos said 
papandreou failed to win a third term in office because his 
government has been rocked by a series of scandals for the last 10 
months 
mitsotakis whose party racked up 44 percent of the vote and 145 
seats in the 300member parliament said the coalition demand is 
impossible 
how is it possible for 13 percent of the people to impose their 
will on the 44 percent mitsotakis said 
papandreou who received 39 percent and 125 seats also refused 
we consider this term unacceptable because for us papandreou 
is our leader said acting government spokesman sotiris 
kostopoulos 
the socialist leader was hospitalized one week ago suffering from 
kidney failure and heart problems his condition is gradually 
improving 
if the coalition does not form a government by friday 
sartzetakis will ask the three parties to try to resolve their 
differences and form a coalition 
if that fails then sartzetakis must appoint a caretaker 
government of high court judges and call early elections

the supreme court issued a freespeech ruling 
thursday that gives public officials more power to ban advertising 
and sales pitches including the peddling of cookware in college 
dormitories 
justice antonin scalia writing for the court in a 63 decision 
said government restrictions on commercial speech may be valid even 
if they go beyond the least restrictive means to achieve the 
desired end 
as long as the rules are reasonable and narrowly tailored to 
achieve the desired objective we leave it to governmental 
decision makers to judge what manner of regulation may best be 
employed scalia said 
by contrast the leastrestrictive test remains in force for 
other forms of expression particularly political speech 
the court acted in the case of a ban on cookware sales on 
campuses of the state university of new york suny 
while the justices said university officials may place some 
restrictions on commerical activity on campus they left unanswered 
another issue raised by the case whether the univeristys ban is 
too broad because it also limits noncommercial speech 
the justices said a lower court should study that issue 
the three dissenters justices harry a blackmun william j 
brennan and thurgood marshall said the rules involving 
noncommercial speech do go too far 
blackmun said the ban could prevent a student from meeting his 
doctor or lawyer in his dorm room if the doctor or lawyer is paid 
for the visit it could even prevent a student from paying a music 
teacher or a speech therapist to come to the dorm room for tutoring 
blackmun said 
the court he said is turning its back on its own freespeech 
precedents 
the majority holds that leastrestrictive means analysis does 
not apply to commercial speech cases a holding it is able to reach 
only by recasting a good bit of contrary language in our past 
cases blackmun said 
however scalia said thursdays ruling was in line with a 1986 
decision that allowed puerto rico to ban advertising promoting 
casino gambling that was aimed at puerto rican residents 
scalia also cited a weekold ruling in which the court made it 
easier for communities to turn down the volume at rock concerts in 
that decision the court upheld a new york city rule that 
rockconcert sponsors use a sound system operated by a 
citydesignated engineer 
the suny board of trustees adopted a rule in 1966 to prohibit 
most commercial enterprises from operating on campuses 
the ban was challenged by american future systems inc a 
housewares company in bryn mawr pa after one of its 
representatives was arrested in 1982 at the campus in cortland 
ny for refusing to leave a dorm 
the housewares company attracts customers by offering free 
florida vacations to students who arrange sales demonstrations in 
their dormi rooms for groups of their friends 
a federal judge upheld the suny ban but the 2nd us circuit 
court of appeals overturned the ruling last year the appeals court 
ordered further hearings to determine whether there might be less 
restrictive rules to accomplish the universitys purpose 
sunys appeal was supported by university officials in 10 states 
and groups representing thousands of college administrators 
nationwide 
the fundamental right of state colleges and universities to 
control the use of their premises is at issue said a 
friendofthecourt brief filed by the university officials from 
california connecticut florida michigan illinois ohio south 
carolina rhode island new jersey and vermont 
the appeal also was supported by the american council on 
education the american association of state colleges and 
universities the national association of state universities and 
land grant colleges and the national association of student 
personnel administrators 
also thursday the court ruled in a case from washington state 
limiting the power of indian tribes to use zoning laws to control 
land owned by nonindians within a reservations boundaries 
the court said tribes may be forced to share the zoning power 
with state or county officials

tourism minister olivier stirn said he expected a 25 million 
americans in france this year as france celebrates the 200th 
anniversary of the french revolution centered on bastille day on

occupancy we anticipate between 30 and 40 percent more foreigners

billion in 1987 he said

the next two years as of july 1 american tourists no longer need 
to obtain visas to make visits of up to three months in france

hundreds of supporters of an anticastro cuban 
militant threatened with deportation called a general strike 
thursday in the citys little havana section and more people joined 
a hunger strike in his support 
hundreds gathered for a noontime march and most businesses in the 
neighborhood participated in a threehour work stoppage in the 
growing protest of the justice departments decision to deport 
orlando bosch 
were trying to do the most that we can for bosch said sonia 
alfonso a cubanamerican who closed her universal unisex hair 
salon if cubans dont stand up for him whos going to do it 
the justice department announced last week it will deport bosch 
because secret us intelligence information implicates bosch in 
several bombings and assassination attempts during fidel castros 
30year rule of cuba the justice department has said its requests 
that other countries expel terrorists will not be taken seriously if 
it grants asylum to bosch 
the deportation order galvanized bosch supporters many of them 
cuban exiles who consider the 62yearold pediatrician a patriot he 
has been in federal prison since he returned to the united states 
illegally in february 1988 
his daughter myriam bosch said she was heartened by thursdays 
show of support 
my father was never alone she said hes very happy to see 
this kind of outpouring from the cuban community 
demonstrators rallied at a monument to participants in the bay of 
pigs invasion 
dr bosch isnt sitting alone in his jail cell hes got the 
entire cuban community sitting beside him said domitila sanchez 
a friend of the bosch family this is the most visible display we 
have given to date never since the cuban community arrived in miami 
have they united this strongly for a cause 
miami herald publisher richard capen told listeners of wqba radio 
he had raised the bosch case during a recent meeting with president 
bush but that the president said he could not comment on the case 
while it was under review 
us sen connie mack rfla has requested a meeting with 
president bush to discuss the case and a spanishlanguage radio 
station asked listeners to send telegrams to the white house 
requesting a review of the case 
justice department attorneys told us district judge william 
hoeveler on tuesday that the government would not deport bosch 
before july 14 
hoeveler has set a sept 13 hearing to examine whether the 
justice department has handled the bosch case properly 
lauri filppu an attorney for the department said the government 
probably would not deport bosch before the september hearing 
bosch was jailed from 1968 to 1972 for firing a bazooka at a 
polish freighter docked in the port of miami he then spent 11 years 
in venezuelan prisons fighting charges that he masterminded the 1976 
bombing of a cuban jetliner that killed 73 passengers he was 
acquitted three times in venezuela 
boschs son william ended a protest hunger strike tuesday for 
medical reasons but at least 18 other supporters of bosch said they 
were on hunger strikes thursday while several wouldbe fasters were 
turned away by a doctor who said they would be health risks 
several nicaraguan exiles joined the hunger strike several 
others marched through a little havana street tuesday night carrying 
a casket they said symbolized what would happen to bosch if he is 
deported 
nicaraguan exiles have identified with the plight of miamis 
cuban community because they fled their country after it was taken 
over by the leftist sandinistas in 1979

a colombian woman has been arrested and accused of 
attempting to smuggle cocaine inside four girdles the second such 
arrest within three days the us customs service said 
customs spokesman charles conroy said the 32yearold woman who 
arrived wednesday at houston intercontinental airport on a taca 
airlines flight from guatemala was detained after customs 
inspectors became suspicious of her behavior and dress 
a search revealed 16 pounds of cocaine hidden inside her girdles 
the seizure was almost identical to mondays arrest of blanca 
nellie dominguez toloza 38 of colombia who faces charges of 
smuggling more than 5 kilograms or 11 pounds of cocaine in girdles 
she was wearing 
in both cases the women were stopping in houston en route to 
european destinations and were traveling on altered passports said 
candace vice chief customs inspector at the airport 
ms vice speculated that the women were transporting cocaine to 
europe because the drugs value is about three times higher there 
than in the united states 
ms vice said the cocaine seized wednesday was divided into 
square packets and concealed in pouches inside the womans four 
girdles 
the name of the woman arrested wednesday was not released pending 
formal charges

percent from may to june but still averaged 5 percent more than a 
year ago the agriculture department said thursday

preliminary report that lower prices for tomatoes cattle wheat and 
corn were mostly responsible for the decrease from the may average 
higher prices for lettuce hogs lemons and strawberries partly

to 55 billion from the record 1988 level of 58 billion 
net cash income is the amount farmers have to spend during the 
year and represents the difference between gross cash income and 
cash expenses cash income rose last year despite drought partly 
because of higher market prices and crops farmers had stored from 
previous harvests 
the decline this year is expected to stem from farmers larger 
cash expenses as they boost plantings and also because of lower 
federal subsidies 
consumer food prices are forecast by usda to rise an average of 4 
percent to 7 percent this year following a 41 percent increase in 
1988 
based on the preliminary figures the price index for livestock 
and livestock products as a group declined 06 percent from may to 
june but still averaged 54 percent above the yearearlier level

62 percent more than in june 1988

percent of a 1977 base used for comparison down from a revised 
recordmatching 149 percent in may that was the lowest reading 
since december when the index was 145 percent 
the report said 
cattle averaged 6760 per 100 pounds of live weight nationally 
down from 6880 in may but still up from 65 in june 1988 those 
are averages for all types of cattle sold as beef

rule of law not to be confused or mistaken with any incidental 
mishaps that are attributable to an administration or an 
individual he said 
mobutu has long supported us policy goals in africa however 
his regime has been criticized by amnesty international of 
widespread humanrights abuses

gen wojciech jaruzelski says the communist 
partys automatic leading role in poland already is history and 
it will never return to the monopoly rule of the past 
in an interview with the associated press jaruzelski also 
praised solidarity leader lech walesa and said poland would seek 
friendly american support but not charity during the july 
911 visit of president bush 
as to his own political plans he said he would seriously 
consider the oppositions stance before deciding whether to accept 
the new office of president to be decided by the national assembly 
before bushs visit solidarity legislators who are a minority in 
the assembly have said theyll vote against jaruzelski if as 
expected he is nominated by the party 
the state news agency reported thursday a central committee 
plenum at which the party was expected to name its candidate would 
take place friday 
i am not striving for this office the way known and typical in 
the west i will not crawl to this post jaruzelski said 
he said political and economic changes in poland put it in the 
vanguard of east bloc reform but the opportunity for change could be 
lost if society rejects economic steps that are painful like 
every surgery that is expected to bring health 
jaruzelski party leader and president of the council of state 
discussed his eight years in power from the martiallaw period to 
the historic reforms of recent months in an interview wednesday in a 
reception room near his office in the council of ministers building 
he also answered other questions in writing 
the polish leader who wore a gray business suit and his familiar 
dark glasses spoke in soft tones as he sat on a green velvet settee 
beneath a huge oil painting of a winter scene by 19th century polish 
artist julian falat 
he said the communists did poorly in the june 4 and june 18 
elections losing 99 of the 100 seats in the freely contested 
senate because voters had not yet realized the extent to which the 
party has changed its program in favor of democracy and reforms 
that is why i think that if the party will honestly 
implement its program then it will have a chance to rebuild its 
influence in society he said 
but he added the partys influence could never again be on the 
basis of monopoly 
we have become convinced that monopoly is a very unhealthy 
thing not only in the economy but also in political life he 
said 
on the partys leading role by which the party in the 
constitution claims an automatic right to rule jaruzelski replied 
in writing the leading role of the party understood in a 
mechanical way already is history today the party like other 
political forces seeks social confidence and support 
when there was no challenge to party rule he said later it 
actually lost support because it became bureaucratic grew used to 
not having to compete for popular support and was blamed for 
economic failures 
what was supposed to be a strength turned out to be a 
weakness he said 
jaruzelski who imposed martial law to suppress solidarity in 
1981 and then led his party to restore the independent union this 
year made clear during the interview that he remained fully 
committed to both decisions 
imposing martiallaw was personally very painful he said 
looking at it from a certain distance today i dont want to 
blame the opposition alone we were somehow not mature there 
was a lot of distrust on both sides he said 
he also blamed a rise in eastwest tensions in the early 1980s 
and the situation in the east a reference to pressures from 
the soviet union under leonid brezhnev 
internal and external conditions formed such a knot that it is 
difficult to say today whether another course of events was 
possible he said 
of the tumultuous january party plenum in which the key decisions 
were taken to open talks with the solidarityled opposition and at 
which jaruzelski emerged victorious from a vote of confidence he 
said i really threw everything onto the scale my destiny and my 
dignity 
it would be the greatest drama for me if history one day said 
these decisions were wrong thats why i wish so much that the 
agreement that this pluralism passes the test in real life 
jaruzelski who turns 66 on july 6 demurred when asked if he 
would take the presidency a decision he will likely have to make 
within the next week 
i havent gone to confession in a very long time and i can see 
that you want me to confess joked the communist who grew up in a 
roman catholic family but i used to go i used to go 
he said his candidacy would depend on democratic 
consultations within the party and could not be decided by him alone 
i will also seriously consider the stand of the opposition 
understanding that the president especially in our conditions when 
we have to unite the nations efforts and build platforms of accord 
should have at least a minimum of support from all sides he said 
i am a soldier so i have a deeprooted feeling of duty but 
also of honor i will not crawl to this post he said 
turning to walesa jaruzelski said 
i must appreciate lech walesas realism especially today when 
i see him as a man who has developed his political possibilities 
very much 
of bush he said i am very happy that mr george bush is 
president of course it is not interfering in us internal 
affairs to express such an opinion especially since the next 
elections are in four years he sees world problems european 
problems including polish ones in a friendly way we dont want 
gifts or some kind of charity he said but called attention to 
the us voice in international lending organizations with which 
poland desperately wants to reschedule its 39 billion debt 
many of the problems mired today may move much more quickly 
with friendly american support he said

students at tufts university can wear tshirts with 
raunchy messages in dorm rooms and on campus lawns but not in 
classrooms under a new policy that officials said thursday tries to 
balance free speech with decorum 
we feel its our obligation to say that there are no 
constituencies that are fair game said dean of students bobbie 
knable 
the tshirt zones were created after a male student marketed 200 
tshirts that gave 15 reasons why beer is better than women at 
tufts all disparaging to women one of the more printable lines 
was hangovers go away 
there were complaints about it knable said the tshirt 
dealer was placed on probation and sentenced to 50 hours of 
community service which was later revoked officials of the private 
liberal arts school then decided to draft a policy curtailing the 
bodily display of hostile or derogatory slogans 
the new rules which take effect this fall could involve some 
fast changing for instance a student might wear a risque tshirt 
in his own room then cover up the offending portion on his walk 
through the dormitory common area before reaching the campus lawn a 
free area 
but knable says the circuitous policy stems from efforts to 
comply with free speech rights 
students in classrooms or dormitory common areas cant escape 
looking at the offending message so the tshirts are banned she 
said but dormitory rooms are private and general campus grounds 
cant be controlled 
we didnt expect that we could protect our students from all of 
the manifestations of bigotry or prejudice knable said 
the writing of the policy stirred lively debate on campus the 
final decision on what constitutes a derogatory slogan will be made 
on a casebycase basis she said 
we really tried to narrow the definition of offensive to 
derogatory and demeaning knable said there are a lot of ideas 
that people will encounter on campuses in a diverse community that 
will be offensive to them and we are not trying to protect people 
from ideas she said 
knable said the policy is intended to be more of a deterrent than 
a disciplinary tool if complaints are lodged with the dean of 
students the matter will be taken to a panel of faculty and 
students possible penalties might be probation or community service 
knable said officials at tufts known for its foreign policy 
department dont expect to have to enforce their penalty frequently 
this fall 
its not as if we are a campus in which we expect the most 
virulent kind of things will happen and happen frequently its just 
that we are still a part of the world she said

a federal judge has given the boston globe 
permission to compel participants in a trial to recreate their 
testimony because a clerk destroyed the official record depriving 
the newspaper of its legal access to the record 
the unusual decision handed down wednesday by us district judge 
joseph tauro stems from the newspapers efforts to obtain a tape 
recording of the 90minute drug trial in 1987 of thenpolice officer 
salvador aponte in west roxbury district court 
the ruling allows the newspapers lawyers to subpoena and 
through depositions question the trial participants under oath 
a globe reporter was told that aponte had been found guilty but 
then acquitted after a defense lawyer told the judge aponte would be 
fired if convicted 
when the globe requested the tape recording of the trial to check 
out the tip court clerks wouldnt provide it because a state 
statute required courts to seal all verdicts of innocent 
the newspaper filed suit in federal court challenging that 
statute last year tauro ruled the law unconstitutional 
the attorney generals office appealed tauros ruling but said it 
would provide the globe with the tape of apontes trial if the 
appeal were rejected 
the globe won on the appeal this year then found that the 
recording of the trial was erased last november 
court clerks routinely reused audio tapes 13 months after trial 
james mannering assistant clerk for west roxbury court said 
thursday 
the tape of the aponte trial was reused in its normal course of 
events he said 
clerks have since been ordered to keep tapes for 2 years after a 
trial ends 
e susan garsh a globe attorney said tauros ruling to 
recreate the trial is a remedy to the loss of the newspapers first 
amendment right to the trial record 
while judges sometimes order evidence and even testimony 
recreated for participants in a trial wantland sandel jr of the 
american bar association said tauro seemed to be stretching the idea 
in a novel way by using it to serve the publics right to know 
ive never heard of this particular application of the concept 
before said sandel from his chicago office where he is director 
of the abas judicial services its really the publics right 
thats being protected 
its an interesting application of the unwritten theory that 
the news media are quasigovernment in that they have not only the 
right but almost the duty to represent the public in news gathering 
and dissemination sandel added 
professor donald lively who teaches constitutional and 
communications law at the university of toledo in ohio also called 
the ruling rare if not unique i sure have never heard of anything 
like that he said 
thats really trying to bend over backward to promote the 
spirit of the first amendment he said 
but lively said he was skeptical that it would work 
i dont see how he can order those people to participate he 
said 
mary coughlin a clerk for tauro said that since the depositions 
were ordered by the court participants defying the order would risk 
a charge of contempt however trial participants can file a motion 
to quash the subpoena order ms coughlin said 
anthony cardinale who was apontes attorney during the trial 
was in court thursday and could not be reached for comment

efforts to curb longrange offensive missiles 
quayle criticized as misguided the house armed services 
committees recommendation for a 11 billion cut in president

quayle said the us spacebased defense shield could help the 
two sides make progress toward a start treaty in geneva and 
facilitate its ratification by the senate 
quayle in a speech to the american defense preparedness 
association said the proliferation of ballistic missile launching 
capability among smaller less stable nations also makes it all the 
more essential for the united states to develop and deploy strategic 
defenses 
the more progress we make toward offensive reductions th more 
we will need to rely on sdi to help us deter or deal with possible 
soviet cheating or breakout quayle said 
sdi is an insurance policy for start the vice president said 
and it provides the american people with muchneeded insurance 
against an acidental or inadvertent attack or against a deliberate

britain will argue vigorously that china should 
keep its army out of central hong kong after the colony reverts to 
chinese sovereignty in 1997 a british official said thursday 
the senior official who spoke on condition of anonymity briefed 
reporters as foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe prepared to travel 
to hong kong on saturday to reaffirm britains commitment to the 
colony 
howes schedule during his threeday visit includes meetings with 
officials and residents 
concern among hong kongs population of 57 million about life 
under chinese rule has increased since june 3 when the chinese 
government ordered thousands of troops into beijing to crush the 
sevenweek prodemocracy movement 
we shall be arguing very strongly that it would be very 
misguided of china to put their troops in the center of hong kong 
the british official said 
under the 1984 joint declaration the british pact with china 
that guarantees at least 50 years of autonomy for hong kong under 
chinese rule authorities in hong kong are responsible for public 
order 
this is not the responsibility of people in khaki uniforms 
that is what we have to underline in thick thick ink the 
official said 
chinese troops stationed in hong kong have to abide by hong kong 
law the official added 
he said the questions of how many chinese troops would be allowed 
in hong kong and where they would be stationed are still subject to 
negotiation 
britain will raise the issues during the next round of talks on 
hong kong britain postponed the july meeting because of the 
crackdown on the prodemocracy movement 
no decision has been made on when the meetings will be resumed 
but i would think certainly before the end of the year maybe in the 
autumn the official said 
under the joint declaration meetings are to be held three times 
a year and britain plans to stick to the letter of the agreement 
if we want china to do the same the official said 
since the crackdown began some hong kong residents have called 
for the joint declaration to be torn up 
the official said britain has no intention of doing that but 
wants to change a few things in a draft constitution under which 
china will govern capitalist hong kong as a special administrative 
region after the british withdraw 
the times of london quoted a report by the powerful house of 
commons foreign affairs committee as saying the british government 
should mobilize an international effort to resettle hong kong 
residents should china violate the joint declaration 
the committee recommends that limited categories of residents be 
given the right to settle in britain but rejects such rights for 
all 325 million british passport holders the newspaper said 
the report to be published friday also calls for an 
acceleration of the timetable for introducing democracy in the 
colony so it is firmly established before 1997 the times said

president bush reviving a topic buried by 
public outcry four months ago promised thursday to work with 
congress to get members a pay raise he didnt say how big the raise 
should be 
in a speech focused on another prickly issue campaign finance 
reform the president mentioned the payhike question only briefly 
he said he would send congress legislation in a few days seeking 
to ban the outside income senators and representatives earn from 
speaking engagements a restriction many have said they would accept 
only if accompanied by higher salaries 
bush said he would work with congress on the development of 
details for increasing the pay of those in congress as well as other 
senior employees of the executive branch 
he already has endorsed a 25 percent pay increase for judges and 
the legislation he sends to capitol hill on outside income will 
include a specific increase amount for senior officials white house 
counsel boyden gray said he refused to disclose the amount 
bush described his campaign finance package which includes 
provisions to abolish most political action committees as an 
effort to cut special interest influence in politics and make 
campaigns more fair by decreasing the significant advantages of 
incumbents 
since a majority of incumbents are democratic however the 
proposals have the effect of helping the republican partys chances 
to improve its standing 
we need reforms that curtail special interest influence 
enhance the role of the individual and strengthen the parties 
bush said to an audience of congressional interns we must do more 
to truly clean up the system 
his proposals also include curtailing congressional franking 
privileges which he said pay for mass mailings that amount to 
political advertising and doing away with gerrymandering the 
drawing of crazyquilt congressional districts to help certain 
candidates 
the president declined to endorse public financing of 
congressional campaigns or overall spending limits which have been 
urged by democratic officials as well as private groups 
democratic national committee chairman ronald h brown said that 
in failing to call for spending limits the presidents campaign 
finance bill ought to be labeled the fat cat protection act of 1989 
he wants to make it easier to give republican candidates access to 
big money contributors 
bob dreyfuss spokesman for the advocacy group public citizen 
said that in dismissing public financing and spending limits bush 
tends to really allow the people with money to have undue 
influence in politics 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash has already promised the 
house will produce an ethics and campaign reform package this 
session and he said bush was joining the bandwagon late 
i want to say this as kindly as i can we welcome the 
presidents involvement but he is not leading this matter he is 
joining an issue which the democrats and the congressional 
republicans have been participating in and actively since the 
first of the year he said 
bush said public financing would exclude individuals from the 
political process by denying them the opportunity to contribute and 
spending limits would discourage them from contributing 
congress has repeatedly rejected proposals for campaign finance 
changes but republican supporters from capitol hill said they hoped 
bushs leadership and heightened public opinion on the issue would 
change that this time around 
bush proposed to bar corporations unions and trade associations 
from financially sponsoring political action committees effectively 
abolishing most of the pacs that contributed more than 151 million 
to congressional candidates in the 198788 election cycle 
that move bush said would help free our electoral system from 
the grip of special interests 
he also proposed 
reducing the percandidate contribution limit for the remaining 
pacs from the current 5000 to 2500 
banning a practice known as bundling in which a group 
gathers individuals contributions and delivers them to candidates 
rather than having the individual donate directly 
requiring full disclosure of soft money contributions and 
spending 
soft money refers generally to corporate and labor money that 
is barred for federal candidates but finds its want into the system 
when the funds are contributed to political parties which then help 
the candidates 
touching on an area that has bedeviled the federal election 
commission for three years with no resolution bush called for 
guidelines on how to differentiate between such money and funds 
raised within federal standards for generic activity such as voter 
registration and getoutthevote efforts that benefit both federal 
and nonfederal candidates 
bush would decrease the advantage of incumbents by 
restricting franking privileges which allow members of congress 
to send mail to their constituents free blanket constituency 
mailings and newsletters for instance would be banned 
curtailing gerrymandering methods of drawing political district 
lines to benefit one political party or group over another the 
districts would have to be drawn according to geographical and 
community boundaries said a senior administration official 
no single factor is more important in restoring competitive 
elections bush said than doing away with the crazy quilt 
district maps that have been drawn in some states to group voters in 
a blocks that benefit one party 
the redistricting is controlled by state legislatures 28 of 
which are controlled by democrats to eight by republicans thirteen 
are split and nebraska has a nonpartisan onechamber legislature 
more than doubling the amount of money that political parties 
are allowed to give to their candidates for house and senate for 
senate races the amount currently ranges from 92000 to some 15 
million depending on state population since incumbents are able to 
attract far more money than challengers in private contributions 
this provision would mean more to the cashstrapped gop challengers 
banning carrying over campaign funds from one election to the 
next thus requiring congressional candidates to return leftover 
funds to the contributors or give the money to the political parties 
or the government

national party leader f w de 
klerk declared a new chapter in south african history thursday 
and wept before committing the white rulers to sharing limited power 
with the black majority 
conservatives among the nations 5 million whites condemned the 
plan as a sham to surrender control to blacks clive derbylewis of 
the conservative party likened the plan to the sales talk of an 
unscrupulous car dealer 
spokesmen for the 28 million disenfranchised blacks said the 
proposal uses new labels for old dogmas as a ploy to retain 
white rule and impress foreign leaders anglican archbishop desmond 
tutu said the proposal would not do away with apartheid 
tears brimmed over de klerks eyes as 1500 delegates gave him a 
standing ovation when he opened the governing partys congress with 
promises the nationalists responsible for 41 years of apartheid 
rule can lead south africa back into the international community by 
ending many racist practices 
we have reached a great moment of truth in the history of our 
country a new chapter is to be written he said at pretoria city 
hall 
but de klerk resolutely avoided specifics he said the form of a 
future government and constitution must be negotiated 
although the partys manifesto seeks to avoid using race to 
define political groups de klerk clung to the principle promising 
the nationalists will not forsake the whites and declaring 
group security is a prerequisite to constructive cooperation 
the congress of south african trade unions the nations largest 
said 
we are insulted if not surprised that the np thinks that the 
people of south africa will be so easily fooled by new labels for 
old dogmas 
the bottom line is that de klerk and the np remain wedded to 
white minority rule in the form of group rights 
the congress beginning its campaign for sept 6 parliamentary 
elections after which de klerk is designated to replace president 
pw botha adopted an action plan that envisions giving blacks 
a direct vote in national affairs within five years 
it calls for removing criminal penalties for violating laws on 
segregated housing more government subsidies for multiracial 
schools and a bill of rights 
the nationalists declared goal is to provide blacks with a 
national political voice in a way that preserves rights of whites 
and other minorities de klerk made it clear the plan will not 
encompass majority rule 
but the reform proposals could cost the nationalists 
parliamentary seats to the proapartheid conservative party 
de klerk who just returned from a visit with european leaders 
and is expected to meet president bush next month sees reform as a 
way to end south africas isolation and the economic punishment it 
has brought 
our cause is just and the doors must be open we will not have 
to go crawling back we will walk in proudly and with our heads held 
high he said to uproarious applause 
a less enthusiastic ovation followed his brief tribute to the 
absent botha relations between the two men have been strained since 
march when botha resigned as party chief following a stroke and was 
shocked to find party leaders also wanted him to resign from the 
presidency 
the congress clearly signaled the end of the botha era from new 
party logos and slogans festooning the hall to de klerks blunt 
statement at a news conference 
president botha is no longer active in politics he prefers it 
that way and we respect his wishes 
he went on to tell reporters we still have one big challenge 
which we face weve already received a mandate from our white 
electorate for powersharing with blacks the final test is to work 
out a system which will enable us to do that on the basis of 
nondomination 
he said the government will not scrap two cornerstones of 
apartheid the population registration act requiring race 
classification and the group areas act designating segregated 
residential areas unless they are replaced by other protections 
for those who want to live separately 
archbishop tutu winner of the 1984 nobel peace prize for his 
opposition to apartheid said on a visit to denmark that no 
effective change can take place in south africa while the population 
registration act remains 
he said the government wouldnt remove that because the basis 
of everything is still race and power still resides with the white 
race 
in london a leader of the outlawed african national congress 
guerrilla movement called the platform an advance but from a wrong 
position 
its a step forward but the position is wrong because it 
continues to define people as black and white and not as the people 
of south africa said international affairs secretary thabo mbeki

a courtappointed bankruptcy examiner told 
congress thursday that the only alternatives for strikebound eastern 
airlines are a reduction in its size or liquidation 
david i shapiro said at a crowded hearing that a plan by a 
chicago businessman to take over the airline in partnership with 
easterns unions and with temporary management by former defense 
secretary frank c carlucci is not viable 
carlucci and businessman joseph ritchie however told the house 
public works and transportation aviation subcommittee that their 
plan offered the only hope for restoring eastern as a major airline 
the subcommittee in calling the hearing had said its goal was 
to find a way to rebuild eastern which was the nations sixth 
largest airline prior to the march walkout of its mechanics pilots 
and flight attendants 
the panel is also examining the role of the new york bankruptcy 
court which has had authority over eastern since the airline filed 
for reorganization under bankruptcy laws after the strike 
these past months have left me with the reluctant but firm 
conviction that only two practical alternative remain in this 
case said shapiro who represents the bankruptcy court the 
first is a reorganization plan premised on a smaller eastern 
airlines the second is liquidation 
easterns management which filed for reorganization under 
bankruptcy laws after the strike has announced plans to sell of 
18 billion in assets and operate the airline at a smaller scale 
ritchies plan would add about 200 million in new debt to the 
airline and restore its full operations 
i intend to use my energies to oppose liquidation and promote 
the best reorganization plan possible said shapiro he said he is 
continuing to meet with unions to try to get them to accept the idea 
that easterns operations must be scaled down to survive 
shapiro said the ritchie plan to purchase eastern presented no 
firm offer to frank lorenzos texas air in payment for the airline 
and failed to present an operational plan that would keep the 
airline flying 
carlucci said he is still willing to act as an interim chief 
executive of the airline if ritchies offer is accepted 
this approach is the only one that has a chance of restoring 
eastern to its once proud status said carlucci who was defense 
secretary in the latter part of the reagan administration 
ritchie president of chicago research amp trading group said his 
plan would restore eastern as a major competitor in the airline 
industry it includes 100 million in new money from ritchie the 
unions and other investors and 200 million or more in new financing 
lorenzo rejected ritchies earlier unionbacked attempt to buy 
the airline along with several other offers carlucci said he had 
agreed to serve as interim chief executive officer of the airline 
because ritchies plan appeared to have the support of both 
employees and creditors 
several committee members said they feared that lorenzo planned 
to sell off all the airlines assets once he is allowed to 
reorganize

the economics minister reacted to 
the second chemical weapons scandal in six months by declaring 
thursday the government will devise laws to eliminate such deals by 
west german companies 
prosecutors said they had opened a criminal investigation of a 
duesseldorf company that allegedly contracted to deliver more than 
250 tons of a mustard gas component to iran 
officials have said that the rheineisen chemical products 
company run by an iranian family was contracted to arrange the 
shipment by irans stateowned industrial organization vezarate defa 
a company official mojtar ashtari said thursday night in an 
interview with the west german tv network zdf that the company had 
complied with export regulations before making the deal final 
we were given the green light by the export licensing 
authorities for this shipment said ashtari a buyer for 
rheineisen who helped arange the deal 
he said rheineisen had no indication the chemical would be used 
to produce poison gas adding that the shipment was halted and would 
be returned to bombay india were it originated 
six months ago an international furor arose over involvement by 
west german firms in building a plant in libya the united states 
said was designed to produce chemical weapons libya said it was a 
pharmaceuticals factory 
after disclosure of the libyan project chancellor helmut kohls 
government said it it would take legal steps to prevent a recurrence 
on thursday economics minister helmut haussmann said he would 
make sure there are no loopholes in the new measures 
such corrections are completely possible as a result of further 
discussions of the law he said in an interview with saarland 
state radio 
the government has expanding the list of weaponsrelated products 
that require a special export permit and also is trying to cut down 
on transactions conducted by west german companies outside the 
country 
in addition to the chemical deals west german firms also are 
said to be involved in illegal shipments of arms to several foreign 
countries 
parliament will consider more regulations including larger fines 
and longer prison terms for violators when it returns from summer 
recess 
in the future we will be able to catch and punish such cases 
and eliminate them from west germany haussmann said 
federal authorities have arrested juergen hippenstielimhausen 
whose company imhausenchemie allegedly played a centrol in building 
the libyan plant at rabta south of tripoli 
as in the case of the libyan plant the united states gave bonn 
the first tip about the scheduled shipment of the mustard gas 
chemicals to iran 
rheineisen is run by an iranian family company attorney georg 
greeven told reporters 
rolf chanteaux chief state prosecutor in duesseldorf told the 
associated press on thursday he had begun a criminal investigation 
of the company 
the facts show that the rheineisen firm agreed on a delivery 
contract for the chemical rather than just a brokers contract 
he said a special permit is needed for a delivery contract 
chanteaux said the company had not obtained a permit for the 
chemical which was to be delivered to iran from a company in india 
rheineisen says it canceled the contract for arranging delivery 
of 257 tons of thionyl chloride to iran from a company in india 
called transpec and there would be no shipment 
under an agreement reached on june 1 rheineisen was to receive 
360000 from iran rheineisen has said west german customs 
officials assured the company there was nothing wrong with shipping 
thionyl chloride to iran 
both iran and iraq used poison gas in their eightyear war which 
began in september 1980 a ceasefire was reached in august

president ranasinghe premadasa unable 
to get india to withdraw its peacekeeping troops now has asked that 
they stop fighting tamil rebels 
premadasa made the appeal the day after his government and the 
tamil tigers the main rebel group agreed to stop fighting 
at least 40000 indian soldiers are stationed in the 
tamildominated north and east under a civil war peace plan india 
worked out in 1987 with the last president junius jayewardene 
continued deployment of the indian troos has become a contentious 
issue between colombo and new delhi 
last month premadasa asked india to withdraw by the end of july 
but india refused prime minister rajiv gandhis government said a 
hasty withdrawal could lead to even more ethnic violence 
a government statement issued thursday said the president of 
sri lanka has requested the prime minister of india to ensure 
that the indian peacekeeping force does not take any action 
against the liberation tigers of tamil eelam 
other militant tamil groups who gave up the fight for a separate 
state in exchange for limited autonomy support the indian presence 
arthur ranasinghe deputy information minister told reporters 
if indian troops refuse to leave by the end of next month we will 
send them back india might bomb us or destroy all of us but we 
will fight back to the last man 
if india tries to be here by force without our consent and the 
consent of our people we will not tolerate it 
tamils nearly all of whom are hindus make up 18 percent of sri 
lankas 16 million people and claim discrimination by the majority 
sinhalese most of whom are buddhists 
militants began fighting in 1083 for an independent tamil 
homeland called eelam in the north and east more than 10000 people 
have been killed in the civil war and in violance by sinhalese 
extremists who want no concessions to tamils 
india became involved because it is the major power in the 
region is overwhelmingly hindu and has a tamil population of 60 
million concentrated across the palk strait from sri lanka 
the soldiers were deployed in july 1987 to accept the surrender 
of arms by the rebels but the tamil tigers refused to go along with 
the peace plan 
talks between the tigers and the government began last month 
after premadasa offered amnesty to tamil rebels who gave up their 
weapons 
on wednesday the rebels and government announced an agreement to 
stop fighting and settle their differences by negotiation

a man was arrested and charged thursday with 
the poisoning of the centuriesold treaty oak tree during what 
police described as a ritual 
the culprit may have been trying to use magic to cast a spell to 
protect a woman or because of a rivalry over a woman according a 
report in wednesdays austinamerican statesman which cited sources 
it did not identify 
police sgt john jones said in the arrest warrant that paul 
cullen poisoned the treaty oak in a ritual with the herbicide 
velpar the warrant said cullen got the herbicide from his job at a 
farm and ranch supply business 
cullen 45 was arrested in elroy a town south of austin and 
was held in lieu of 20000 bond police said he was charged with 
criminal mischief causing damage of more than 20000 which is a 
seconddegree felony punishable by a maximum of 20 years in prison 
judge jon wisser said that before he signed a warrant for 
cullens arrest investigators told him cullen had checked out books 
from the public library on black magic and the occult 
jones said in the affidavit that cullen drove around west austin 
looking for a live oak tree on which to apply the velpar 
legend says stephen f austin a founding father of texas signed 
a treaty with the indians under the oaks branches 
even though the handbook of texas a guidebook that includes 
state history says the story has little foundation the tree 
occupies a special place in texans hearts 
couples have been married under its branches and since the 
poisoning scores of visitors have left getwell messages in front 
of a ropedoff area that limits access to the ailing oak 
a yellow ribbon also was tied around the base of the 50foot tree 
this week as a bright reminder of peoples concern 
a reward of 11000 was offered for information leading to the 
conviction of the person who poisoned the tree dupont which makes 
velpar put up 10000 of the reward and the texas forestry 
association added 1000 
dallas billionaire h ross perot also has pledged money and given 
advice in the effort to save the tree 
the treaty oak is struggling to survive the poisoning since it 
was discovered early this month state and national experts have 
recommended several forms of treatment but it was not known if the 
tree would live

the growth in americans standard of living 
lagged behind other major industrialized nations last year despite a 
surge in us export sales according to a report released thursday 
the report prepared by the council on competitiveness said the 
united states had failed to keep pace with its major trading 
partners over the past 16 years losing additional ground in 1988 
the findings came from the councils second annual 
competitiveness index an effort to measure us standing in the 
world economy in terms that have meaning to the average american 
the council tracks competitiveness in four areas living 
standards worker productivity the us share of the world export 
market and american investment in education and nondefense research 
and development 
those categories were chosen because of their relationship to 
americas changing fortunes in the world economy 
us investment must keep pace with expenditures of other nations 
to boost american productivity a measure of output per hour of work 
rising productivity is needed to make american products 
competitive on world markets thus lowering americas huge trade 
deficit and providing the income growth to boost american living 
standards 
while the council found that the growth in americas living 
standard was lagging behind other countries the united states still 
had the second highest living standard west germany is first 
in 1988 the standard of living defined as economic output on a 
per capita basis was 15250 in west germany 13840 in the united 
states and 11820 in japan 
the competitiveness index found that america had made progress in 
trade and investment last year compared with its major trading 
partners but had lost ground in living standards and productivity 
the index measures us performance against the six other leading 
industrial countries japan west germany britain france italy 
and canada 
leaders from the seven nations meet each year for an economic 
summit the next meeting is july 1416 in paris 
the 1988 index shows that american products are now capturing a 
growing share of world markets but the downside is that other 
nations are still outperforming us in terms of standard of living 
and productivity growth said council chairman john young head of 
hewlettpackard co 
lawrence chimerine an economic adviser to the wefa group a 
consulting company that helped prepare the index said the need to 
improve americas productivity was emphasized by a separate report 
thursday that report showed that the united states widened its lead 
as the worlds largest debtor country with a net debt position of 
5325 billion last year 
the net debt figure means that foreigners own more in us assets 
than americans own in foreign assets 
our foreign debt burden will become bigger if our productivity 
does not go up and allow us to compete more effectively in global 
markets chimerine said if we dont get our productivity growth 
back up again there is no way we will see our living standards 
improve 
the us living standard grew 31 percent in 1988 however that 
lagged behind a 51 percent increase in living standards in japan 
and a 38 percent increase for the other six summit nations 
because of those developments the councils standard of living 
index dropped from 903 percent to 897 percent of 1972 the base 
year of the index 
among the reports other conclusions 
in 1988 the us export boom fueled a rise in the trade index 
from 769 percent to 896 percent of its 1972 base reflecting a 
partial rebound in americas share of the world export market the 
us share of world exports was 10 percent last year still below a 
high of 14 percent in 1974 
productivity the output per worker fell to 874 percent of its 
1972 base down slightly from 878 percent reflecting faster 
productivity improvements in the other six industrial countries 
longterm us investment rose from 975 percent to 1004 
percent the only measurement doing better than the 1972 base year 
this reflected gains in education spending research and development 
and spending on plants and equipment 
the council founded in 1986 is composed of officials from 
business labor and higher education who are trying to improve the 
ability of american companies to compete in world markets

legislation calling for a yearlong moratorium 
on oil exploration along vast stretches off americas coast 
including new england and alaska won approval thursday from a key 
house committee where members repeatedly cited concern about 
possible oil spills 
the bush administration immediately promised to fight the curbs 
probably in the senate saying mandatory prohibitions on offshore 
oil exploration would stifle badly needed domestic petroleum 
development 
we believe they congressionallyimposed bans are a delaying 
tactic said interior secretary manuel lujan 
the action by the house appropriations committee on a fiscal 1990 
spending bill for the interior department would put a temporary halt 
to oil exploration in alaskas bristol bay one of the nations 
premier fishing centers where the government already has sold a 
half dozen exploratory leases for 94 million 
the legislation also would extend or impose prohibitions on oil 
or gas exploration off california off the everglades of 
southwestern florida in the georges bank off new england and along 
a 50mile wide coastal strip that stretches from rhode island to 
maryland 
this is a critical victory at a critical time said rep leon 
panetta dcalif chairman of the house budget committee the 
message is clear we will not tolerate more tragic oil spills 
an exploratory drilling moratorium already has been in effect on 
leases in many of those areas but the ban would be extended to the 
center coast of california and to the midatlantic region under the 
legislation it also would ensure that no exploratory activity is 
taken before october 1990 the end of the next fiscal year 
the 116 billion interior money bill which prohibits any money 
being spent on oil lease in the areas cited cleared the house 
committee by a voice vote after two amendments aimed at softening 
the impact of the oil exploration moratorium were defeated by votes 
of 2922 and 2822 
the first amendment would have deleted reference to bristol bay 
while the second would have allowed a variety of prelease 
activities off the california coast although actual exploratory 
drilling would still have been put on hold 
opponents of the bristol bay drilling ban argued that oil 
development in the pristine alaska waters home for a 1 billion 
fishing industry is needed to keep america free of having to 
depend increasingly on oil imports 
what were doing in the name of the environment is cutting off 
our energy sources were going to have brownouts and then there 
will be blackouts argued rep bob livingston rla 
rep ralph regula rohio maintained that the danger from oil 
spills was not from offshore drilling but from tanker traffic 
prompting rep sidney yates dill to point out that tankers 
likely will transport the oil that would come from bristol bay 
yates chairman of the interior subcommittee that had recommended 
the moratorium cited the devastation left by the exxon valdez oil 
spill last march 
weve seen whats happend in prince william sound declared 
yates adding that the same potential for damage is present in other 
coastal areas 
rep silvio conte rmass described having on numerous 
occasions gone fishing off the southern alaska coast and said the 
oil damage from the exxon spill brings tears to my eyes 
weve got to wait declared conte in arguing for a moratrium 
on further offshore oil exploration 
alaskas congressional delegation and its governor have strongly 
urged for a temporary halt in oil exploration in bristol bay in 
light of the exxon spill until greater assurances can be made that 
the environment will be protected 
if the exxon valdez oil spill proved one thing its that the 
current ability to respond to spills in open seas is inadequate at 
best said alaska gov steve cowper in praising the house 
committee action 
im not willing to roll the dice on development in bristol bay 
and threaten the livelihood of hundrds of alaskans and the resources 
on which they depend the governor said in a statement issued in 
juneau 
the interior deparment sold exploratory leases for a half dozen 
sites in bristol bay last year the legislation would call for 
repurchasing those leases the bay is considered by experts to be 
even more vulnerable to pollution from an oil spill than prince 
william sound 
this is no less than a major victory for the environment 
said lisa speer of the natural resources defense counsel a private 
environmental group reacting to the house committee action 
but interiors lujan maintained that the moratorium on offshore 
drilling does little to address the real issue which is tanker 
safety while it could stifle domestic oil development 
an interior spokesman steve goldstein said that lujan intends 
to personally campaign to overturn the moratorium provisions in the 
house bill in the coming weeks 
president bush earlier this year ordered lease sales off southern 
and northern california as well as off southwestern florida 
postponed pending an environmental review a report on that review 
is to be issued to the president by the end of the year 
after that oil exploration would be free to continue if given 
the goahead by interior unless congress determines otherwise

reputed mobster and convicted heroin trafficker 
gene gotti went to jail thursday seven years after he was arrested 
on charges of running a major heroin operation 
with eight minutes to spare before a 10 am deadline set by a 
judge gotti and codefendant john carneglia both wearing nylon 
jogging suits and sneakers stepped out of a maroon lincoln and 
swaggered into the federal courthouse in brooklyn where they 
surrendered to us marshals 
afraid we werent going to show up gotti the brother of 
reputed gambino crime family boss john gotti joked to his lawyer 
us district judge john r bartels on wednesday revoked their 1 
million bail after a threeday hearing saying both men continued to 
pose a danger to the community and ordered the pair to await their 
july 7 sentencing in jail 
prosecutors maintained that gotti and carneglia continued to 
traffic in heroin and deal in gambino family affairs after their 
conviction 
prosecutors asked that they be jailed immediately after the bail 
hearing in us district court but bartels gave them an additional 
night to be with their families and pick up the personal items they 
will need during their stay at the metropolitan correctional center 
in manhattan 
his mood is hopeful certainly hes not happy about going to

a onetime broker for the department of housing 
and urban development in buffalo ny withheld payments 
overbilled and paid himself advances so when he died in 1987 he 
owed the department almost 73000 according to a federal audit 
after bernard a brady died his widow continued to withdraw 
money from his hud escrow account according to the audit obtained 
under the freedom of information act 
brady had been a closing agent on the sale of singlefamily hud 
homes and manager of at least one hud rental property said the 
audit by huds office of inspector general he died may 10 1987 
but while the audit was being conducted his widow maureen somehow 
withdrew 20100 from the hud account in her husbands name said a 
paul kane huds regional inspector general for audit who oversaw 
the probe 
we dont know whether she was forging the checks or whether 
they had a book of presigned checks kane said in an interview 
from huds region ii office in new york city 
brady had comingled personal and hud funds in the account kane 
said thursday no criminal charges against mrs brady are 
anticipated since she recently agreed through her lawyer to pay the 
24832 hud says she and her husbands estate owe kane said 
we expect to get it all back he said 
the escrow account was eventually frozen but hud has been unable 
to get at the money believed to be 48139 according to kane the 
audit was completed jan 19 and covered the period from jan 1 
1985 to dec 31 1987 
weve been trying to find out from the field office whether or 
not the money has been turned over we havent been able to get an 
answer kane said 
but joseph b lynch manager of the buffalo field office said 
thursday the bank has finally agreed to turn over the money 
although it is not clear when 
the auditors had some difficulty in getting the bank 
initially to release the accounts and canceled checks and finally we 
had to resort to a subpoena he said the reason became apparent 
later on when this mr brady died a death certificate was 
submitted to the bank and his widow continued to draw down on that 
account apparently forging his name on some checks so there was 
some liability on the part of th bank thats our feeling 
kane blamed the field office for not keeping closer tabs on what 
brady was doing and said it was the lawyer for the brady estate 
harold fein who brought the bank account problems to the local 
offices attention the field office then called in the inspector 
general kane said 
the amount of activity involved with brady was not that great 
so it was not likely for us to look at him if it had not been 
brought to our attention kane said 
fein did not immediately return a phone call thursday 
brady was not alone in using hud money as if it were his own 
during the laissezfaire administration of housing secretary samuel 
pierce cases are turning up almost daily where hud accountants 
brokers and others apparently misused or stole millions of dollars 
from the department 
bernard a brady a lifelong buffalo resident had been in 
business for himself for 32 years as a fee appraiser for the 
federal housing administration an expert witness for the courts an 
apartment manager for a hudowned property and from 1974 to 1981 a 
hud management agent according to his obituary in the buffalo news 
he was 58 when he died 
brady also appraised real estate for the state department of 
transportation a bank surrogates court and the city of buffalo he 
attended the university of buffalo law school 
as a hud closing agent and broker according to the federal 
audit brady 
did not turn over 97371 from the sale of six hudowned 
singlefamily houses 
did not forward to hud 12407 in rental income collected from 
tenants in a hudowned property 
overcharged hud 2460 for wire transfers sometimes 
triplebilling the agency for wires never sent 
wrote checks from the hud account either to himself or his wife 
totaling almost 44000 
according to the audit 18 checks totaling 20100 and payable to 
mrs brady were drawn from the account after bradys death the 
investigation found 
for the 18 months from april 1985 to september 1986 brady did 
not submit a single monthly accounting report to the department as 
required under his contract 
at the same time as he was shortchanging hud brady was not paid 
some 26000 in monthly management fees from the department the 
audit found he also wired the same 12500 in net sales proceeds 
twice to the us treasury and he overpaid hud several hundred 
dollars in other cases 
subtracting what hud owed brady the auditors concluded that 
brady owed the department 7297066

cabinet nominees who used to need only kremlin 
approval were quizzed and harangued by the rambunctious new soviet 
legislature thursday on matters ranging from the toilet paper and 
soap shortages to pollution 
after questioning and debate the 542member supreme soviet 
approved alexandra p biryukova as a deputy premier in charge of the 
government social agency and vladimir k gusev as a deputy premier 
overseeing chemicals and timber both were incumbents 
ms biryukova head of the bureau for social development since 
october faced questions about why women so often are given 
physically demanding jobs and put on the night shift 
women fill many menial jobs in the soviet union from shoveling 
asphalt for road repairs to clearing the snow from red square in 
winter 
lawmakers also complained about a shortage of furniture and 
school supplies 
ms biryukova the only woman in the top leadership proposed 
government aid to families with many children and said it was 
necessary to get 3 million women off night shifts in various 
industries 
she said production of such basic consumer goods as soap and 
toothpaste would be increased dramatically 
still this is insufficient she declared we must return 
again and again to the issue of increasing production of consumer 
goods 
a shortage of disposable needles made headlines last year when 
several dozen children were infected with aids in a hospital that 
used unsterilized nondisposable syringes ms biryukova said 
production of disposable needles is being increased and they also 
are being purchased abroad 
gusev head of the bureau for the chemical and timber complex 
since may 1988 was grilled for 1 hours about why those industries 
have not met production goals and are polluting the environment 
i am not satisfied with my work gusev told the legislators 
there are too many problems in the country due to our 
deficiencies 
he said 85 percent of his agencys investment budget for 
19901995 would be be used to modernize chemical factories and paper 
mills and install antipollution devices he said 47 percent of the 
investment budget now goes for those purposes 
pollution and poor social conditions have been leading targets of 
public complaint under president mikhail s gorbachevs policy of 
glasnost or openness 
officials have said 50 million people nearly onefifth of the 
population live in cities in which air pollution exceeds acceptable 
levels 
lawmakers also questioned gusev about a paper shortage that 
prevents the soviet union from publishing enough books or meeting 
the demand for toilet paper 
he said the paper industry lacks the equipment to increase 
production but is trying to expand capacity 
valentina s shevchenko a legislator from the ukraine told 
gusev she had heard promises before and admonished you must show 
more character and be more demanding 
in defense of his nominee premier nikolai i ryzhkov declared 
the question isnt gusev its chemicals the agency no matter 
who we put in the job the problems will remain 
earlier this week ryzhkov withdrew seven cabinet nominees the 
supreme soviet found unacceptable 
on thursday he asked legislators to focus less on personalities 
and more on balancing the need for the chemical industrys products 
with the environmental harm it causes 
the supreme soviet which replaced the old rubberstamp 
legislature this year has approved six cabinet nominees and is to 
review more than 50 others during a session scheduled to run through 
aug 4

prominent czechoslovak rights activists 
are demanding that their country release all political prisoners 
allow peaceful demonstrations and reassess the 1968 sovietled 
invasion emigre sources said thursday 
a source in vienna said about 1800 intellectuals actors and 
artists and many bluecollar workers signed an appeal urging the 
prague government to open a dialogue with people outside the 
communist establishment 
the document was issued in the name of four activists including 
banned playwright vaclav havel and sasa vondra spokesman for the 
charter 77 human rights manifesto according to the londonbased 
palach press newsletter and other sources 
havel was warned by secret police this week that he may be jailed 
again for his activities his brother ivan havel said thursday in a 
telephone interview from prague ivan havel said two security 
officials warned his brother his activities could be construed as 
incitement to rebellion 
in an interview havel gave to hungarian television broadcast 
wednesday night the playwright criticized pragues reluctance to 
embrace reform 
havel was freed on probation may 17 midway through an eightmonth 
jail sentence that drew protests at home and abroad 
in prague czechoslovakias official ctk news agency reported 
thursday that police arrested four people accusing them of 
organizing terrorism arson and murder and having close relations 
with independent initiatives 
ctk identified the four only as being in their 40s and said 
they reportedly directed and organized a group of youngsters 
allegedly setting several industrial targets on fire on czech 
territory since 1986 and killing a 17year old person in connection 
with this criminal activity 
the appeal signed by the activists demanded a free discussion 
to review not only the 1950s but also the prague spring the 
invasion of czechoslovakia by the five armies of the warsaw pact 
and the process of normalization which followed 
the czechoslovak leadership still suspicious of kremlinstyle 
political reforms has refused to reexamine the 1968 reforms 
introduced in the prague spring and the sovietled invasion that 
crushed the reforms the invasion is officially still described as a 
necessary action to defend socialism 
the sponsors also proposed that 1 all political prisoners be 
released immediately 2 that restrictions on freedom of assembly be 
lifted and that the government stop persecution of independent 
initiatives according to the text released in london and vienna 
it demanded an end to political manipulation and censorship in 
the news media and religious freedom 
it urged authorities to submit to expert and public review all 
projects which are designed to change permanently the environment 
of our country and are thus likely to condition the lives of future 
generations 
this was an apparent reference to the huge hydropower project 
near gabcikovo in czechoslovakia nearing completion prague refuses 
to discuss the issue with independent critics and environmentalists

democrats charged thursday that president 
bushs campaign finance proposals were designed for public relations 
and would do more to help republican candidates than accomplish 
meaningful reform 
the presidents campaign finance bill ought to be labeled the 
fat cat protection act of 1989 said democratic national committee 
chairman ronald h brown referring to the lack of campaign spending 
limits in the proposal 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash also criticized bush 
while i welcome the presidents willingness to join our ongoing 
reform efforts i regret that he has chosen to submit proposals that 
blatantly favor the republican party and jeopardize bipartisan 
reform efforts already under way foley said 
bush said in a speech thursday that he was proposing a plan to 
clean up the system of congressional elections with 
restrictions on political action committees and benefits enjoyed by 
incumbent members of congress 
because a majority of incumbents are democratic the proposals 
have the effect of helping the republican partys chances to improve 
its standing 
democrats while welcoming what they called a tardy interest in 
the issue by the top man in the gop charged that bushs plan was a 
transparent attempt to hurt the democrats who control congress by 
skewing the political finance system toward republican fundraising 
strengths 
a totally partisan package has been set forward said rep 
beryl anthony dark chairman of the democratic congressional 
campaign committee 
anthony called it a pr effort on the part of the president 
that appears to have been written by republican national 
chairman lee atwater and gop house campaign chief ed rollins 
however anthony said some elements in the presidents package 
would find favor with democrats such as rules requiring fairness in 
redistricting of house seats and more disclosure of soft money 
corporate and labor contributions given to candidate through back 
channel loopholes in the law 
bush proposed restricting political action committees but 
democrats said that only the type of pacs that tend to help 
democrats would be curtailed 
the president also suggested more money would be channeled 
through the political parties a move away from public disclosure 
of campaign contributions 
this really just sets up another hideandgoseek game 
said rep al swift dwash cochairman of the house task force 
that has been studying campaign reform proposals 
but swift said bushs participation might help increase chances 
of action on a campaign reform bill 
democrats repeatedly pointed out that it was senate republicans 
who killed chances for a campaign reform bill in the last congress 
sen david boren dokla sponsor of last years reform package 
said he hoped the presidents proposals would break the stalemate 
in the senate on this important issue 
but boren said in his statement bushs proposal was deficient 
because it did nothing to limit the amount of money that could be 
spent on an election campaign 
we cannot have real reform unless we address the runaway costs 
of congressional elections he said 
without spending limits all you do is turn elections into 
auctions said rep david obey dwis i think what the 
president is doing is posing for political holy pictures on this 
issue

seven hazardous waste sites on the 
environmental protection agencys superfund priority cleanup 
list are among 400 municipal landfills permitted by states to expand 
in the last few years the general accounting office reported 
thursday 
gao the investigative arm of congress conducted a 50state 
survey to chronicle a widespread expansion of municipal landfills by 
communities struggling with shortages of space to handle trash 
between october 1986 and october 1988 42 states received 640 
municipal landfill expansion applications and approved 396 of them 
the report said 
seventytwo applications were denied and 172 were awaiting action 
at the end of the survey period 
eight states said similar information was not available 
this is the first time anyone has inventoried the landfill side 
of superfund said andrew mcelwaine an aide to sen john heinz 
rpa who requested the study with rep bill goodling rpa 
of special concern to the lawmakers was the finding that 14 
landfills on the epas superfund list had applied to states to 
expand and that seven had been approved one permit was denied and 
six were pending as of late last year gao said 
three of the seven landfills allowed to expand are in 
pennsylvania and the others are in colorado indiana oklahoma and 
wisconsin gao said it did not identify them 
there are no rules against such expansions gao said all the 
states granting approvals required development of a cleanup plan 
with the exception of oklahoma where the operator had to close the 
original site or post a bond to pay for proper closure of the 
landfill eventually 
heinz and goodling requested the survey after learning that a 
superfund site in goodlings southeastern pennsylvania district had 
aroused citizen concerns by asking the state for permission to 
expand the application was recently rejected goodling said 
mcelwaine identified the site as the keystone sanitation landfill 
in adams county near the maryland border it was placed on the 
superfund list in july 1987 making it eligible for federal cleanup 
money tests conducted by epa and the state found that ground water 
on and off the site had been contaminated by lead and other 
pollutants 
citizens residing near this landfill have expressed concern 
about contamination at the site and whether the owners past 
operating record will lead to additional contamination if the site 
receives approval to expand its operations gao said in the 
report epa said the owner had cooperated with the cleanup by 
conducting an evaluation of the site and pumping ground water to the 
surface and treating it 
under the superfund program states and epa track down 
individuals or companies responsible for the dumping of hazardous 
wastes and try to make them pay for the cleanup if no one can be 
found or the responsible parties resist epa can conduct the cleanup 
and sue to recover the governments costs 
epa is in the process of developing new minimum criteria for the 
operation of municipal landfills the guidelines are expected to be 
completed by the end of the year 
municipal landfills may be owned by private firms or state or 
local governments municipal waste generally garbage and trash 
is normally not particularly hazardous but it may contain dangerous 
chemicals or substances that degrade into toxic material 
landfills to handle hazardous wastes are licensed under a 
different program run by epa

ritter said after the vote lipa was brought into being for the 
express purpose of shutting down the shoreham plant which has been 
judged to be safe by the nuclear regulatory commission and the 
authority is totally unqualified to engage in the decommissioning of 
a nuclear plant 
however the license could be transferred to a competent 
authority such as the new york power authority according to john 
hambel a committee spokesman 
but the amendment forbids the nrc from spending funds to 
decommission the plant unless the plant is certified unsafe he said 
the nrc authorization hasnt made it across the presidents 
desk in five years said peter coogan a spokesman for rep george 
hochbrueckner dny whose district includes shoreham 
hambel said chances are good that the amendment will be picked up 
by the senate energy and natural resources committee and attached to 
legislation sure to pass 
voicing strong support for the house amendment thursday was rep 
norman f lent ranking republican on the energy and commerce 
committee and a longtime shoreham supporter 
he said consumers would be spared the whopping 63 percent rate 
hike proposed by gov mario cuomo that would arise as a direct 
result of the decommissioning of shoreham 
the amendment passed one day after shareholders of the long 
island lighting co approved a deal to close shoreham under the 
agreement the company would sell the unused will unused 55 
billion reactor to new york state for 1 in exchange for a decade of 
5 percent annual rate increases shorehams license would be 
transferred to the new long island power authority which would then 
contract with the new york power authority operator of other 
nuclear plants to decommission shoreham

the nations coastlines are littered with 
plastic from cups to trash bags an environmental group said 
thursday after releasing a report on what volunteers found on more 
than 3000 miles of beaches 
the center for marine conservation said the assessment made from 
items collected by 47000 volunteers demonstrates that americas 
beaches once famous for their beauty and biological richness 
now are often littered with trash 
in addition to being unsightly the ocean trash has become deadly 
to marine life the group said 
thousands of marine mammals sea turtles seabirds and fish 
die every year when entangled in debris such as rope nets and 
fishing line or from ingesting items like plastic bags and 
sheeting mistaking them for food said the report 
the group said that in combing more than 3000 miles of beaches 
in 20 states the volunteers gathered nearly 1000 tons of debris 
in all nearly 2 million separate pieces of debris were found and 
recorded the report said 
despite the uproar about medical wastes only a small percentage 
of the items were reported in that category the volunteers recorded 
finding 1718 plastic syringes during their searches which account 
for about 009 percent of all the debris found said the report 
there were other medical items found including caps gowns 
tubing and even a set of dentures said kathryn ohara who 
coordinated the project 
by far the greatest amount of trash involved some sort of plastic 
product 78025 plastic trash bags 26148 milk or water jugs 
19300 plastic bleach cleaner bottles 14721 foam plastic trays 
and 9526 egg cartons 
among the dirty dozen items glass beverage bottles ranked 
no 6 with 95028 bottles littering the beaches that didnt 
include another 65819 glass pieces found in the sand and among 
the rocks there were also light bulbs fluorescent light tubes 
wooden crates assorted fishing lines rubber gloves fishing nets 
and 857 plastic hardhats 
some states had more trash than others 
the amount of trash reported per mile of beach was consistently 
higher in states bordering the gulf of mexico said ms ohara 
here are the states where the most pounds of debris per miles of 
beach were located georgia 4000 texas 3549 and louisiana 
2337 
the debris was collected in september and october of 1988 by 
volunteers over a threehour period

an autopsy found that a us 
diplomat killed in a shooting spree at police headquarters was shot 
twice in the back a government spokesman said thursday 
in addition to shooting john butler the us embassys political 
officer on wednesday the assailant also killed grenadas acting 
police commissioner cosmus raymond and wounded two senior police 
officials 
the killer grafton bascombe acting assistant police 
commissioner here was later found dead in a police cell cause of 
death was listed as cardiac arrest 
bascombes motive remained unclear but us and grenadan 
officials said the incident had no political overtones 
grenada a former british colony of about 100000 people in the 
southern caribbean has been politically stable since the island was 
invaded in october 1983 by us marines and paratroopers along 
with a small caribbean force the invasion toppled a leftist junta 
that had seized power in a bloody coup 
the state department said wednesday in washington that butler was 
shot pointblank in the heart after trying to subdue bascombe 
but albert xavier told a news conference thursday a pathologists 
report showed butler 33 of twentynine palms calif was struck by 
two bullets both of which entered from the back 
the report suggests that butler could not have been 
attempting to restrain bascombe said xavier an adviser to prime 
minister herbert blaize 
roy sullivan 56 the embassys administrative officer who was 
with butler at a meeting said he hit the floor when shooting 
broke out and was unhurt the last thing i remember was john 
rising and going toward the guy who was wielding the pistol 
sullivan said 
butlers body was flown home thursday 
officials said bascombe killed raymond and then burst into 
another room and killed butler and wounded deputy police 
commissioner collis barrow and assistant police superintendent 
daniel searles 
they said bascombe 45 was previously assistant police 
superintendent in neighboring st vincent island and was on loan to 
grenada police 
xavier said bascombes scheduled return to st vincent last week 
was delayed because he had charge of funds involving a joint police 
and military exercise and was to give raymond an accounting 
wednesday 
a government source speaking on condition of anonymity said 
about 25000 was involved and it was not known if any discrepancies 
had cropped up 
bascombe apparently surrended after the shooting he later was 
prounced dead in a police cell 
xavier said pathologist robert hannon gave cardiac arrest as 
cause of death and said bascombe also had suffered a concussion an 
unspecified wound above the left eye and a bruised and cut left 
cheek 
xavier said cardiac arrest was consistent with an examination 
made by bascombes personal physician who said bascombe suffered 
from an enlarged heart and high blood pressure

inflation and a shortage of goods have made tehran 
iran the worlds most expensive city ending tokyos fouryear run 
at the top of the list according to a survey of 105 cities 
published thursday 
despite high inflation rates latin american cities remain the 
most financially attractive to expatriates according to the 
twiceyearly study by business international a genevabased

rate of april 3 the study said tehran had a costofliving index of 
209 followed by tokyo at 202 and the japanese cities of osaka and

caracas venezuela and the brazilian city of sao paulo were rated 
at 42 
brazil had an inflation rate of 1200 percent in the 12 months to

patriotism fluttered in shades of red white 
and blue thursday as citizens of flag city usa turned out to 
support efforts to make burning the american banner a crime 
we may not be able to do anything about flag burning in libya 
and iran but we ought to be able to stop people from burning the 
flag in the streets of america said us rep michael oxley at 
the rally for flag and country 
this isnt a protest rally said oxley a republican from 
findlay its a rally to honor our flag 
nearly 1000 people turned out to express outrage at a recent 
supreme court ruling overturning flag desecration laws in the united 
states 
flags hanging from stores and homes along the narrow streets 
leading to this northwestern ohio city flitted in a light breeze 
vendors sold tshirts that read only a commie would burn the 
american flag most people held or waved small flags 
an act of congress in 1974 designated findlay as flag city 
usa said marjory buckingham manager of the hancock county 
convention and visitors bureau who coordinated the rally 
i knew the city would support it buckingham said its a 
patriotic issue and findlay is a flagwaving patroitic city 
members of citizens to protect our flag who also helped organize 
the rally went through the crowd asking people to sign petitions 
stating that the supreme courts ruling was an affront to the 
american people 
by the end of the rally the group had collected about 5500 
signatures on the petitions which they gave to oxley the petition 
drive started earlier this week 
among those at the rally was robert heft who as a high school 
junior in lancaster ohio submitted the winning design for the 
current 50star us flag as part of a class project in 1958 
heft said his first reaction to the supreme court ruling was 
disappointment and disbelief since then however it has 
turned to anger heft said 
i believe very strongly in freedom of speech when we show 
displeasure with government or business or anything else he said 
but how far do we go with that freedom of speech does it apply to 
desecration of the flag i dont think so 
the us senate has passed a resolution condemning the supreme 
courts decision in the house constitutional amendments have been 
introduced to overturn the ruling president bush has said he would 
support such an amendment

the us envoy to the afghan 
resistance on voiced strong backing thursday for a new 
governmentinexile despite sharp opposition by many of the 
insurgents 
we support the afghan resistance as a whole but are of the 
view that the interim government is the most important manifestation 
of the resistance peter tomsen told a news conference 
the us envoy urged patience among guerrilla leaders opposing 
the interim government that wants to end a 10yearold civil war and 
replace the sovietbacked government of president najib 
its only 3 months old he said it is a slow and 
laborious process but our policy is to encourage and assist this 
interim government 
one of the moderate guerrilla leaders who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said tomsens outspoken support for the provisional 
government is a stupid thing to say 
this government is the cause of the disintegration of our jihad 
holy war the cause of dissent and infighting among afghans he 
said 
the united states eventually wants to funnel its humanitarian and 
military assistance to the guerrillas through this government rather 
than pakistan which has acted as a conduit during the past 10 
years said tomsen 
some of the most vocal critics of this government belong to 
socalled moderate guerrilla groups many of whom support a return 
of the former monarch or a neutral transitional cabinet which would 
eventually oversee elections 
but even some of the looselydefined fundamentalists among the 
afghan resistance such as jamiateislami commander ahmad shah 
massood blasted the guerrilla government as unrepresentative said 
members of his party based in the pakistan capital 
abdul rahim a jamiat spokesman reported massood said it is 
unsuccessful and he is right up to now this government has done 
nothing 
so far this government represents only afghan guerrilla groups 
headquartered in pakistan where more than 3 million war refugees 
live it does not include the more than 2 million living in iran 
the majority of whom belong to the shiite sect of islam which is 
practiced by most iranians 
in prewar afghanistan the shiites represented about 17 percent 
of afghanistans 15 million people most of the rest are sunni 
moslems 
tomsen who arrived in pakistan wednesday said it is impossible 
to meet afghans in iran he met pakistani foreign minister sahabzada 
yaqub khan thursday and is expected to meet afghan leaders in the 
frontier city of peshawar about 40 miles from the afghan border 
during the next week 
in midfebruary the soviet union finished withdrawing its force 
of more than 100000 troops in line with a united nations accord 
the soviets sent the red army into afghanistan in 1979 to back the 
marxist government

honey bees the agriculture department said thursday 
amitraz was developed in europe and is approved for use in the 
united states against ticks and lice of cattle and hogs and against 
certain mites that infest pears said entomologist william t wilson

in early tests at the agencys honey bee research laboratory in 
weslaco texas wilson found that amitraz was at least 90 percent 
effective against the tracheal mite acarapis woodi 
the compound was also effective against the varroa mite another 
major bee parasite he said

protection agency before it can be marketed for tracheal mite 
control

the nations mortgage lenders are suing the 
veterans affairs department over a policy they say will increase 
already excessive losses on va defaulted mortgages 
the lawsuit filed wednesday by the 2200member mortgage bankers 
association asks the us district court for the district of 
columbia to block the policy scheduled to take effect aug 1 
under the policy the va will add borrowing costs to the formula 
to determine whether to acquire a foreclosed home at full price or 
let the private lender take it over for a loss 
lenders say a growing tendency by the va to cover only a portion 
of the losses on defaults and leaving the property in the hands of 
lenders is wreaking economic havoc 
the order covers the cost the va incurs to borrow money to 
acquire and hold foreclosed property until it can be resold other 
such costs that now might be deducted include repairs cleanup and 
commissions 
the industry group says the revision will worsen problems in the 
va program caused by economic problems in the southwest and the 
lingering effects of the recession of the early 80s it says banks 
and mortgage companies may have to cut back on the lowinterest 
reduced downpayment loans to veterans 
when the va doesnt bid on the foreclosure of a vaguaranteed 
home the lender must acquire and dispose of the property adding to 
its losses the bankers group said in a statement accompanying the 
lawsuit 
the va in turn pays only the portion of the loan that it 
originally guaranteed which is 40 percent or 50 percent up to 
36000 
the lenders group whose members hold 80 percent of va loans 
says the loss to its members for each piece of property not acquired 
by the va will be 18000 
thomas w maher assistant director for property management at 
va said the change would increase the numbers of pieces of property 
that it will decide not to acquire because the loss would be too 
great 
maher said the problem of defaults and foreclosures appears to be 
abating 
in the peak month of december 1987 there were 16200 defaults 
there were 13600 at the end of may there were 22200 foreclosures 
as of december 1987 compared with 20100 in may he said

cubas interior minister was fired thursday and that 
nations drug purge continued but the crackdown has failed to touch 
other leaders us officials say are involved in trafficking 
interior minister gen jose abrantes in charge of cubas 
domestic law enforcement was replaced to allow an investigation of 
how a group of officers conducted drug trafficking operations 
with impunity and without being discovered a government 
communique said 
the firing came two days after a special military tribunal 
recommended a courtmartial and death penalty for gen arnaldo ochoa 
sanchez who confessed to smuggling drugs ivory and diamonds 
but one member of that tribunal vice admiral aldo santamaria 
cuadrado is himself under a 1982 federal indictment in miami 
alleging he aided convicted marijuana and methaqualone smugglers 
other issues also call the cuban crackdown into question the 
continued presence of fugitive us financier robert vesco on the 
island accusations that cuban leader fidel castro mediated for the 
medellin cocaine cartel of colombia and continued reports of 
smuggling through cuba 
the selectivity of the cuban crackdown has led experts here to 
suggest there were two drugsmuggling operations in cuba 
i think there was a official operation sanctioned by raul and 
fidel castro and then there was a second private operation by 
ochoa so fidel and raul decided to clean house said jaime 
suchlicki head of the institute for american studies at the 
university of miami and author of a new book on the cuban military 
thursdays firing of abrantes is intended to put a wall between 
castro and ochoa suchlicki said it is impossible for 
militarybacked drugsmuggling operations to continue without the 
castro brothers knowledge he added 
as recently as sunday a plane carrying a ton of cocaine passed 
over cuba and dropped its load in the bahamas federal officials say 
within the last six months us patrols have observed the cuban 
navy in the immediate area while an actual operation an airdrop 
was going on in cuban water said coast guard lt jeff karonis 
an administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
told the associated press on thursday that the united states wanted 
santamaria and others brought to justice but does not preclude 
joint action against drug trafficking 
there have been other nonpolitical areas where we have 
cooperated like airsea rescue the official said if they are 
prepared to go ahead with this on a nonpolitical basis we would 
welcome cooperation 
most accusations against cuba are public record 
the february 1988 indictment of panamas military ruler gen 
manuel antonio noriega says fidel castro mediated a dispute between 
the general and the medellin drug cartel in june 1984 
in 1982 and 1983 the us attorneys office here prosecuted the 
case in which vice admiral santamaria was indicted he and three 
other cuban officials were accused of helping a group of miamibased 
exiles smuggle 23000 pounds of marijuana and 10 million 
methaqualone tablets five cuban exiles were convicted 
cuba has refused to extradite the vice admiral and the others 
including the former cuban ambassador to colombia 
vesco was indicted in jacksonville this year for allegedly 
helping convicted medellin cartel trafficker carlos lehder rivas 
conspire to import cocaine lehder sent a messenger to vesco in cuba 
to get permission to smuggle cocaine across the island according to 
the indictment 
cuba has not acknowledged vesco is in its territory 
reinaldo ruiz who has pleaded guilty to cocaine smuggling 
charges and is awaiting sentencing in miami flew cocaine 
accompanied by an undercover customs agent into cubas restricted 
varadero air base in cuba in 1987 
in recent years when we run into dope planes they immediately 
dip into cuban air space they signal cuban defense forces and they 
are allowed to seek protection where the coast guard cant fly 
said richard gregorie former no 2 man in the us attorneys 
office here 
on a secretly recorded videotape ruiz once claimed his operation 
was putting money in fidels drawer 
in august 1983 cuban defector jesus raul perez mendez who 
worked with one of the cuban officials indicted in 1982 told us 
officials that raul castro took money from drug traffickers to allow 
smuggling through cuba 
rep charles rangel dny said his house narcotics committee 
has never found conclusive evidence against castro 
if i wanted to say something bad about cuba its easy to do 
rangel said but meanwhile castro has arrested some bums we 
should explore opportunities that come to us

the house banking committee urged president 
bush on thursday to put more pressure on private us and foreign 
banks to negotiate larger debt forgiveness agreements with mexico 
the committee on a 419 vote approved a resolution saying the 
reduction should be big enough to permit mexico to achieve a 
sufficiently positive rate of economic growth to ensure the 
maintenance of social and economic stability 
the resolution also urged us banking regulators the federal 
reserve board and the comptroller of the currency to make banks 
set aside more reserves for covering impaired foreign debt 
mexico asked for a 55 percent reduction in the 54 billion it 
owes private lenders about 15 billion of it to us banks after 
treasury secretary nicholas f brady unveiled his third world debt 
relief plan in march 
the banks led by citicorp manufacturers hanover and chemical 
bank in new york and bank of america in san francisco initially 
offered to share in a 15 percent to 20 percent reduction 
even with its decision last week to extend an antiinflation 
austerity program for another nine months mexico has claimed the 
banks offer still would take too much of its foreign exchange 
earnings to permit a resumption of growth in its domestic economy 
the two sides are negotiating and sources close to the talks say 
discussions are centering on a debt reduction target in the range of 
30 percent to 40 percent 
the committee resolution is a reaffirmation of bradys plan 
which offers the private banks governmentbacked guarantees they 
will be paid interest on the remaining balance but only if the 
banks voluntarily reduce the debt third world countries owe them 
the administration has been hoping that a general agreemen could

a manmade fire destroyed six homes 
thursday and authorities said most of the houses burned because 
owners failed to clear away dry brush before the start of southern 
californias fire season 
the riverside county blaze faded under dying winds later 
thursday along with another that claimed one home and three other 
buildings in los angeles countys antelope valley thousands had 
been forced to evacuate both areas briefly as the fires burned 9750 
acres of brush 
the riverside fire ravaged five mobile homes and one house near 
lake elsinore 60 miles southeast of los angeles but no damage 
estimate was available said riverside county fire department 
spokesman barton ball 
it was manmade not caused by lightning or an act of 
nature said ball who added that there were witnesses but refused 
to divulge details results of the investigation will determine if 
the fire was arson he said 
the fire was first reported tuesday afternoon in the cleveland 
national forest near here ball said 1000 acres of forest wildland 
burned in the blaze which was fanned by winds 
most structures that were lost were lost because of failure to 
comply with state clearance requirements said ball those that 
were saved were saved because they did its as simple as that 
he said depending on conditions homes are required to have 30 
feet to 100 feet of brush cleared around them 
on wednesday authorities evacuated more than 200 families living 
on the lake elsinore shore and in the nearby mountains but most had 
returned home by thursday morning 
our last family just left said red cross shelter manager 
patti hanna at lake elsinore high school she said the shelter would 
remain open during the day in case authorities called for another 
evacuation 
ms hanna said 126 evacuees had registered at the shelter on 
wednesday and 48 stayed the night during its course the fire also 
forced the evacuations of a youth correctional facility a nudist 
colony and many homes and cabins 
ball reported 1910 firefighters on the line assisted by 12 air 
tankers and six waterdropping helicopters he said the only 
significant fires left were burning islands of brush surrounded by 
already charred areas 
they have nowhere to go ball said 
in the antelope valley 45 miles north of los angeles meanwhile 
firefighters were mastering a 2250acre blaze that slowed wednesday 
night and was 95 percent contained by thursday afternoon 
the reason we are doing so well is because the wind has died 
down said county fire inspector chris button the cause of the 
fire was still under investigation and reports that it was started 
by a downed power line had not been confirmed he said 
its now looking good said us forest service spokesman 
robert brady there are still lots of coals and embers but no 
massive flame fronts 
about 400 firefighters were battling the blaze along with two 
waterdropping helicopters 
the fire destroyed one home two barns and one other building and 
forced 2500 residents to flee the communities of green valley 
leona valley and elizabeth lake 
its hard to look at 25 years of your life all the pictures 
the things that no amount of money can replace said velma majors 
as she looked over the remains of her familys home near lake hughes

prosecutors said thursday a juror in the oliver 
north case gave inaccurate information to the court due to 
inattentiveness forgetfulness or lack of comprehension but 
that there is no evidence she lied 
the assertions came in a sevenpage court filing the day after 
north juror tara leigh king testified that she had forgotten that 
one of her brothers had served a year in prison for armed robbery 
norths lawyers say his trial was tainted by kings presence on the 
jury 
in connection with the armed robbery investigation of her 
brother tara king was contacted by a police detective at 
christmastime 1986 was subpoenaed and testified before a grand 
jury it was disclosed at a court hearing wednesday 
she responded no last feb 1 when asked on a courtroom 
questionnaire whether she or any relatives had been involved in 
court proceedings or an investigation 
on wednesday she testified that she shed tears when she found 
out her brother had been sent to prison and then forgot about the 
episode 
there is absolutely no evidence that ms king deliberately 
answered the questionnaire falsely feb 1 when being considered 
for the north jury prosecutors in the north case said 
ms kings testimony makes clear said the prosecutors 
that whether because of inattentiveness forgetfulness or lack of 
comprehension or a combination of the three the questionnaire 
simply failed to trigger in ms kings mind her own involvement 
and the involvement of her brother sam king in the armed robbery 
case 
there was no decision thursday from us district court judge 
gerhard a gesell on whether kings incorrect answer to the court 
had tainted the former white house aides threemonth trial 
gesell was tied up much of the day on other matters gesell said 
at the end of a court hearing wednesday he would issue a ruling

lawmakers businessmen and citizens urged a 
presidential task force on thursday to ban proposed offshore 
drilling on the rugged northern california coast 
the north coast simply cant afford the risks of an economic 
shutdown that are associated with spills from offshore oil and gas 
development said sen pete wilson a republican from california 
recent oil spills off alaska rhode island and elsewhere 
demonstrate that there are some risks that are not worth taking 
he said 
wilsons comments to the fivemember panel came in the second and 
last day of hearings to evaluate the environmental effects of 
proposed drilling in parts of northern and southern california and 
the west coast of florida 
the panel is scheduled to make its recommendations to president 
bush in january 
numerous local politicians opposed any drilling off the scenic 
coast of humboldt and mendocino counties parts of which are 
included in the proposed lease sale 91 that is under review by the 
task force 
we cannot allow northern california to be leased and our 
valuable ocean resources blown out the tailpipe of a gas guzzler 
when there is no national energy policy said wesley chesbro 
chairman of the humboldt county board of supervisors 
chesbro and others called for increased conservation efforts and 
a policy based on renewable energy sources like wind and solar 
power oil drilling opponents fear spills could devastate the local 
tourism and fishing industries 
some likened the prospect of drilling in the region to drilling 
in the grand canyon while others threatened to stage a seaweed 
rebellion in the boardroom and court to fight any approved lease 
sales 
eureka city councilman james worthen however testified that his 
council voted unanimously to support orderly and environmentally 
safe exploration of oil and gas preserves 
stressing the importance of safety worthen said he believes most 
transportation problems can be overcome with technology and that 
pipelines to shore can avoid many tanker transport risks 
his was the minority view at a rainy rally outside the hearings 
about 250 people gathered in support of a national ocean sanctuary 
if there was an oil spill it would put me out of work 
absolutely said commercial crab fisherman bill reid 
the task force is comprised of members of the departments of the 
interior energy commerce and the environmental protection agency 
and the office of management and budget 
the first sales of lease sale 91 were scheduled for february but 
bush postponed the sales for additional review as many as 22 
drilling platforms could be built on the 11 million acre parcel 
according to federal estimates 
in a related development thursday the house of representatives 
approved a moratorium on new offshore oil drilling along the entire 
california coast until at least oct 1 1990 
if approved by congress the moratorium would halt preparations 
for lease sale 91 as well as proposed lease sales in southern and 
central california

prime minister charles haughey resigned 
thursday night and set out to form a new government after parliament 
defeated his bid for reelection 
facing what he called an unprecedented political crisis haughey 
was expected to spend the next few days trying to line up more 
support before making a new bid for election by the 166member dail 
or parliament 
he told irish political correspondents he was sure he could reach 
a policybased arrangement with the sixseat progressive 
democratic party that would keep him in office the only alternative 
was a general election he said 
haughey 63 announced he would stay on as caretaker prime 
minister and not ask president patrick hillery to dissolve 
parliament and call an election 
his resignation was seen as largely a formality enforced by 
demands from the leftwing labor party that he follow constitutional 
procedure 
before that he left no doubt he intended to try to remain prime 
minister 
our paramount task now is to provide a government which can 
meet the challenges and the problems facing the country he told 
the house 
the dail adjourned until monday allowing three days for 
interparty negotiations 
the dail rejected his nomination by 86 votes to 78 underlining 
the failure of haugheys gamble in calling an election june 15 in 
hopes of strengthening the parliamentary base of his fianna fail 
party 
the progressive democrats are a breakaway of the fianna fail the 
main opposition is the fine gael which has 55 seats 
the situation which now obtains where the dail has failed to 
agree on the nomination of a taoiseach prime minister is 
unprecedented in our history haughey told the hushed house after 
the votes were counted 
i am confident that with a full appreciation of the political 
realities and mindful of the best interests of the country our 
efforts will meet with success he said 
after the dail adjourned haughey went to offer his resignation 
to hillery whose post is largely ceremonial hillery has the power 
however to allow haughey more time to line up support for a new 
vote or dissolve parliament and force a new election 
haughey had been governing for more than two years with a 
parliamentary minority and called the june 15 election on the 
strength of opinion polls that forecast a majority for his party 
instead fianna fail slid from 81 seats in the 1987 election to 
77 and on thursday the fine gael and the progressive democrats 
joined forces with socialist factions and independents to deny him a 
majority 
only one independent backed haughey another abstained and the 
speaker does not vote except to break a tie 
other candidates had little hope of winning a majority to form a 
government fine gael leader alan dukes was defeated 10361 with one 
abstention

committee on 17 articles of impeachment voted last year by the 
house he is accused of participating in a bribe conspiracy and of 
lying about it at a 1983 criminal trial in which he was acquitted 
the full senate ultimately would vote on his removal 
hastings who sued the senate on june 1 is seeking a preliminary 
injunction to block the trial scheduled to begin july 10

charges on which he was exonerated terence anderson one of 
hastings lawyers said at a hearing 
witnesses are dead documents have been destroyed 
memories diminish anderson told us district court judge gerhard

israel deported eight palestinians from the 
occupied territories thursday disregarding demands by the united 
states and international organizations that it stop 
the army said they were leaders of the uprising in the occupied 
west bank and gaza strip 
the deportations brought to 55 the number of palestinians sent 
into exile since the rebellion began dec 8 1987 at least four 
other cases are pending 
at un headquarters in new york secretarygeneral javier perez 
de cuellar said he was greatly dismayed by the israeli action 
adam shub a state department spokesman said in washington we 
are strongly opposed to deportations we have spoken to 
israel many times about this it is fully aware of our views 
he said deportations are especially harmful now while the bush 
administration seeks support for an israeli proposal to hold 
elections among palestinian arabs in the occupied lands 
twenty rightwing members of israels parliament hiked into the 
west bank a day ahead of 50 marches planned by jewish settlers for 
friday to dramatize their claim to the territory part of the 
biblical land of israel two dozen soldiers guarded them and no 
incidents were reported 
the umbrella group for settlers called gush emunim or bloc of 
the faithful said the hikes were an effort to counter the revolt 
about 17 million palestinians and 70000 settlers live in the west 
bank and gaza which israel captured from jordan and egypt in the 
1967 war 
gush emunim said the terrorists and instigators will not 
frighten us off neither from the roads nor from the hiking trails 
of israel 
residents of the territories held a general strike thursday to 
protest settler attacks on palestinians which have increased in 
recent weeks scattered confrontations with israeli soldiers were 
reported and arab hospital officials said 13 palestinians were 
wounded by army gunfire 
at least 538 palestinians and 23 israelis have been killed in 
more than 18 months of revolt in the occupied lands more than 8000 
palestinians have been wounded 
army spokesmen reported thursday that soldiers demolished the 
homes of three murder suspects in the gaza strip and four houses in 
the west bank belonging to palestinians accused of bomb attacks 
the international committee of the red cross contends 
deportations contravene the geneva convention on treatment of people 
in occupied territory which israel has signed 
israel says the convention permits selective deportations in 
extreme cases 
an army communique said the eight palestinians deported were 
leaders of the uprising in the territories and outstanding 
activists of fatah the guerrilla group led by plo chairmanb 
yasser arafat and of the syriabased democratic front for the 
liberation of palestine 
expulsion orders for all of them were issued in august but were 
not carried out until the supreme court heard appeals by some of the 
palestinians all the appeals were rejected 
lebanese police said the deportees four each from the west bank 
and gaza strip were flown by helicopter to israels security 
zone in south lebanon and driven to the zommaraya crossing a 
gateway between the border strip and the rest of the country 
among those deported thursday were two prominent west bank labor 
union activists mohammed abdullah labadi 34 and radwan ahmad 
zayad 31 and abu karesh 50 a gaza city teacher 
efforts are under way in israel to speed the expulsion process 
defense minister yitzhak rabin has asked that deportations be 
allowed before completion of the appeals process

carlos menem was quoted thursday 
as promising action on the military impasse soon after becoming 
president july 8 he is expected to offer a broader amnesty for 
officers accused of human rights violations 
now is the time to close the open wounds of argentine 
society the newspaper la nacion quoted the presidentelect as 
saying 
aides said he favors calling off the trials of 18 generals and 
admirals accused of abuses during the dirty war against leftist 
subversion during military rule in 197683 and releasing six who 
were convicted in 1985 and imprisoned 
in the interview menem did not specifically say he would ask 
congress to widen a 1987 partial amnesty to include the 18 or that 
he would pardon the six jailed officers who were members of ruling 
military juntas and include two presidents 
la nacion said he conveyed that impression however when he 
said i cant stand to see even a bird locked in a cage 
leaders of menems peronist party said privately that menem views 
an end to the trials as a path to national reconciliation 
the military problem as many call it has plagued the 
country since president raul alfonsins civilian government was 
installed in december 1983 
officers demanding an end to the trials organized three barracks 
revolts in april 1987 and in january and december 1988 all were 
nearly bloodless but argentines considered them a threat to 
democracy 
reports after his election may 14 said menem urged alfonsin to 
resolve the issue by amnesty or pardon but the president refused 
alfonsin then announced he would leave office five months early on 
july 8 
a commission appointed by alfonsin documented nearly 9000 cases 
of people who disappeared during the antileftist campaign and are 
presumed dead human rights groups put the total at up to 30000 
alfonsin was unable to find a compromise between those who accuse 
the military of a campaign of extermination and officers who say 
they were merely using unconventional tactics in a war on terrorists 
menem rejected an anmesty or pardon during his campaign and has 
repeated the position since the election although nearly always 
adding for now 
his designated defense minister italo luder signed an order 
while acting as provisional president in 1975 that authorized the 
military to annihilate leftists trying to overthrow president 
isabel peron the armed forces overthrew her the following year 
when asked last week whether he favored amnesty pardon or a 
national referendum on the issue menem said he opposed a referendum 
but left the other two courses open

the bush administration on thursday ordered 
domestic agencies to prepare for budget cuts of 5 percent after next 
year because current deficitreduction plans wont meet future 
targets 
it will be necessary to present the president with options 
for further spending reductions said richard darman the 
presidents budget director in a memo to department heads 
fiscal 1991 budgets submitted for white house approval must 
include not only the spending levels theyd like to see but also a 
freeze and a 5 percent reduction he said 
the memo does not cover military spending 
the required program cut proposals would not include 
entitlements which are ongoing programs that pay benefits to 
individuals however darman said such suggestions would be welcomed 
any such proposals including reductions in entitlement 
programs or increased user fees may be suggested if these are 
sufficiently attractive he said agencies could avoid other cuts 
or even offset increases in their regular spending 
the president submits his budget in january for fiscal 1991 
which begins oct 1 of next year the grammrudman budget law 
requires that the plan reduce the federal deficit to 64 billion 
less than half of the projected deficit this year 
darman said that simply extending the deficitreduction 
agreements worked out with congress for fiscal 1990 which begins 
this fall will not provide sufficient restraint on spending 
the white house and congressional budget writers have not yet 
begun hard bargaining on spending guidelines for fiscal 1991 as 
congress is still trying to enact the accord for fiscal 1990 
however many lawmakers have said the 1991 deficit targets could not 
be met without a tax increase something president bush has said he 
wont allow 
a congressional aide who spoke on the condition he not be 
identified said darmans memo indicated the administration was 
having real difficulties meeting the target

energy conservation through insulating homes is 
no longer cheaper than generating new electricity the tennessee 
vally authority told congress on thursday in defense of its decision 
to end its residential conservation program 
several house members attacked the decision despite the utilitys 
assertion that continuation of the conservation program would mean 
higher electricity rates 
tva seems to be out of step with most other utilities in 
america and to have sacrificed its pioneering reputation in the 
field of energy conservation said rep jim cooper dtenn 
the governmentowned utility announced in early may that on july 
1 it would end its 12yearold home insulation program for 
residential customers in the sevenstate region it provides power 
tva chairman marvin runyon told a hearing convened by cooper 
before the energy and power subcommittee of the energy and commerce 
committee that conservation programs have reached a point of 
market maturity and diminishing returns 
the benefits of further investments no longer outweigh the 
costs he said 
initiated during the interim between the oil and related energy 
price spikes of 19731974 and 19781979 the tva program became a 
model for a congressional directive to other utilities to offer 
their customers free home energy audits 
ironically that nationwide program the residential conservation 
service also expires on saturday congress like tva having 
concluded that its benefits no longer outweigh its costs 
during the life of its own conservation program tva provided 
free enery audits to some 11 million homes in tennessee kentucky 
georgia alabama mississippi virginia and north carolina it made 
nointerest or lowinterest loans totaling more than 400 million to 
install insulation and otherwise seal heat leaks from 600000 of 
them 
but runyon said the agency has found that it is now less 
expensive to generate a kilowatthour of electricity than to save it 
through conservation 
the conservation program was costing 114 cents for each 
additional kilowatthour of electricity it saved runyon said by 
comparison completing six nuclear reactors either under 
construction or being refurbished will cost only 73 cents to 87 
cents for each kilowatthour of power they generate 
if we didnt have billions of dollars in debt sitting out there 
already invested in those plants conservation would look a lot 
better he said 
runyon estimated that a continuation of the program at a cost of 
20 million a year would require annual rate increases of onehalf 
of 1 percent 
after averaging rate increases of 6 percent annually for the past 
20 years partly to finance its onceambitious nuclear power 
program runyon said he is committed avoiding a rate increase for 
three years 
at this particular time conservation will add to our rates 
and thats true for out to 10 years from now he said i cant 
answer that question for 20 years from now 
several congressmen questioned whether if what is good for tva as 
a utility is necessarily good for its customers but cooper conceded 
that with the expiration of the residential conservation service 
law there is nothing congress can do to force tvas program to 
continue

vacations for thousands of united mine 
workers members brought calm to the coal fields after violence that 
had accompanied a wildcat strike by coal miners 
a newspaper reported thursday that a strike by 1900 umw members 
against pittston coal group inc in west virginia virginia and 
kentucky is endangering two troubled funds that provide health 
benefits to more than 100000 retired miners 
the broader wildcat strike is in support of the contract dispute 
strike against pittston 
in southwestern virginia striking pittston employees and wildcat 
strikers from appalachia and the midwest continued to clog traffic 
on coalhauling roads thursday 
in west virginia a state judge has cited the umw for contempt in 
picketing two pittston subsidiaries in logan county judge eric 
obriant said he will decide by early next week whether further 
restrictions are needed on picketing at mines owned by elkay mining 
co and buffalo mining co 
health benefits are a sticking point between the umw and pittston 
in the strike that began april 5 and since has prompted the wildcat 
walkouts involving as many as 46000 miners in 10 states 
industry officials estimate about 37000 miners remained off the 
job late this week and about half of the nations umw coal miners 
are on vacation for a twoweek period that began last friday 
pittston has refused to contribute to the two health plans and 
two related retirement funds since its contract with the umw expired 
in february 1988 court documents show 
the union and the umw health and retirement funds have filed 
lawsuits against pittston over the issue umw spokesman john duray 
estimates pittston owes as much as 10 million to the umw health and 
benefits fund a figure pittston wouldt confirm the charleston 
daily mail reported 
if pittston is allowed to stop paying into the program the 
miners fear other large companies will follow suit 
in addition employers are not required to contribute to the 
funds for woerkers on an unauthorized strike as a result miners 
striking to protect their health plans are creating hardship on the 
funds industry officials say 
that can create a problem duray said adding that miners 
believe they cant afford to give in to pittston on such an 
important issue 
documents show that the two health plans spent more money than 
they earned last year 
the 1950 benefit trust which covers 150000 miners who retired 
before 1976 ended fiscal year 1988 with an 18 million debt while 
the 1974 benefit trust which covers 36000 miners who have retired 
since 1976 lost onethird of its assets and ended with only 22 
million in net assets the annual report on the funds said 
the daily mail reported that both funds continue to lose money 
even though coal operators rates have increased 
pittston lawyer john wood contends pittston had the right to pull 
out of the benefit plans when its umw contract expired in february 
1988 
the coal fields in southern west virginia have been mostly quiet 
since the vacation period began said state police sgt dl 
belcher although some isolated shooting incidents were reported 
earlier in the week 
on wednesday four coal trucks in west virginia and virginia were 
peppered with bullets and two others were damaged by steel balls 
fired from slingshots no arrests hade been made 
however in virginia about 1600 wildcat strikers from a 
halfdozen states stayed overnight at a campground near pittstons 
main processing plant virginia state police reported that three 
trees were cut across three coalhauling roads thursday afternoon to 
further hinder traffic 
state police spokesman charlie vaughan said traffic was stalled 
for about an hour before the trees were cleared 
gayla hoffman a spokesman for peabody coal corp which operates 
26 mines in states hit by the strike said peabody was losing 5 
million a day in sales

the congress and the states shall have power to prohibit the 
physical desecration of the flag of the united states 
bush will endorse the amendment language in a ceremony friday at 
the iwo jima memorial white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
it was a continuation of bushs presidential campaign tactics 
which included appearances at flag factories in an effort to paint 
democrat michael dukakis as less patriotic 
he attacked dukakis the massachusetts governor for vetoing as 
unconstitutional a bill requiring teachers to lead the pledge of 
allegiance in schools 
fridays ceremony at the statue of the famed marine flagraising 
in world war ii will be held for a public endorsement by members 
of congress and the president fitzwater said 
house minority leader michel rill introduced the resolution 
thursday before the house left for its holiday recess he said he 
expects senate republican leader bob dole to introduce it there when 
that chamber returns from its extended july fourth holiday which 
began last week 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash said thursday the house 
judiciary committee will begin hearings on the flag issue in july 
foley while condemning flag burning has urged caution about 
amending the constitution michel said he generally agreed but 
believed in this case such action was the only answer 
i just have to assume were not going to be thwarted he 
said insisting he did not view the issue as a republican attempt to 
paint the democrats as less patriotic 
michel said the amendment avoids specific methods of desecration 
because any list might leave one out he pointed out however that 
the amendment referred only to physical desecration in order to 
avoid hampering free expression 
websters new world dictionary second collegiate edition 
defines desecrate as to take away the sacredness of treat as 
not sacred profane

the remnants of adolf hitlers yacht 
sent to a watery grave recently by a group of holocaust survivors 
were refloated and sunk again thursday in a deeper resting place off 
miami beach 
air bags were used to raise the skeletonlike remains of the 
ostwind from atop a shallow reef where it was mistakenly dumped 
june 4 during ceremonies observing the 50th anniversary of the 
voyage of the damned 
weve said all along that ship has bad vibes said linda 
arter a marina worker at a1 marine and commercial wrecking in 
jacksonville it just doesnt seem to want to go away quietly 
the yacht intended as an artificial reef threatened marine life 
on the coral reef and was a hazard to ships 
an apparent navigational error caused the yacht to be dumped into 
25 feet of water as 27 survivors from the ss st louis 1939 voyage 
watched the ceremony commemorated the united states refusal that 
year to accept the ship carrying 937 jewish refugees many of whom 
perished later in nazi concentration camps 
a tugboat spent more than three hours thursday pulling the 
85foot yacht underwater to a 250footdeep spot two miles offshore 
where the steel cable was cut with a blow torch and the ship sunk to 
the rocky bottom the event was supervised by state environmental 
officials 
this is an opportunity to retell the story of the voyage of the 
damned said rabbi barry konovitch of the cubanhebrew 
congregation in miami beach a bit of good may have come from this 
event 
the fountainebleau hilton hotel on miami beach put up 10000 to 
move the ostwind into deeper water the army corps of engineers 
ordered the yacht moved or government crews would dismantle the 
remains and bill miami beach officials 
prior to the resinking a senate proclamation acknowledging the 
voyage of damned was read by state sen ileana roslehtinen of 
miami a republican candidate to succeed the late congressman claude 
pepper 
the ostwind was commissioned in 1938 by hitler as an olympic 
racing vessel but it was never entered in competition and was used 
instead by nazi officials hitler apparently only used the vessel 
once or twice 
the united states took possession of the ostwind as a war prize 
and it was used as a training craft at the us naval academy in 
annapolis md until it was sold as surplus in the late 1950s the 
yacht was then held by various owners in florida and sold in the 
mid1970s to a nazi memorabilia collector from massachusetts 
the collector brought the ostwind to a1 marine and commercial 
wrecking for repairs but the collector never completed work on the 
vessel and failed to pay for the dock space 
marina owner jj nelson took possession of the yacht in 1981 
the boat was repeatedly vandalized and nelson rejected an offer by a 
nazi group in chicago to buy the vessel for a shrine 
last year nelson contacted miami beach officials about using the 
remains as a reef it was transported last month from jacksonville 
aboard a large barge

britains first astronaut will team up with two 
soviet cosmonauts on a trip to the orbiting soviet space station mir 
in 1991 under an agreement signed thursday 
the astronaut job open to a man or a woman is to appear in 
advertisements in the british press in the next few days 
the british consortium behind mission is trying to raise 25 
million to cover the astronauts costs project director malcolm 
mageebrown told a moscow news conference 
the mission named juno does not rely on state support of any 
kind making it unique in space history mageebrown said 
the consortium britain in space ltd hopes to find the funding 
through corporate sponsorships contracts for scientific experiments 
in orbit and the sale of broadcast and publishing rights he said 
experiments the astronaut could perform might reap benefits for 
pharmaceutical companies biology and basic science said heinz 
wolff the projects science chief 
the project pairs the british consortium with glavkosmos the 
soviet space agency glavkosmos is already planning to send an 
austrian and a japanese journalist up to mir in 1990 or 1991 
director alexander dunayev said 
two british astronaut candidates will be selected by november 
one to fly aboard the orbiting station and the other to serve as 
understudy they will train in a glavkosmos center for 18 months to 
learn russian practice experiments and prepare physically for the 
flight organizers said 
candidates should be between 21 and 40 physically fit have a 
degree in science and an aptitude for handling delicate scientific 
equipment said vicemarshal peter howard in charge of astronaut 
selection marshal is former director of the british air force 
institute of aviation medicine 
dunayev said glavkosmos expects to barely cover its costs on the 
juno mission but is interested in developing international 
cooperation in the commercial space business 
the anglosoviet project was named for juno the roman goddess of 
marriage because it marks the start of a very special 
relationship between glavkosmos and the british space 
administration mageebrown said 
the united state was never in the running for the contract with 
the british wolff said there were no other offers of the kind 
the soviet union made from countries with human launch 
capabilities he said 
mir is currently unmanned but a new crew is scheduled to fly to 
the station in late august dunayev said

thirtyfive potential candidates showed up 
on the first day of registration for irans presidential elections 
but not one got to register the official islamic republic news 
agency reported thursday 
irna quoted local press reports as saying the documents of all 35 
were judged incomplete wednesday registration ends july 2 
elections are july 28 
the report monitored in cyprus named none of the hopefuls 
saying it was illegal until the council of guardians approves their 
qualifications 
irna said a prominent deputy from the majlis or parliament was 
the only face recognized by reporters 
others included a retired judge a psychology student and a 
shopkeeper 
interior minister ali akbar mohtashemi told a news conference 
most of the aspirants were under 35 years old he said the turnout 
shows public interest in the presidential election and the freedom 
in the present iranian society irna reported 
mohtashemi said special security committees will be set up 
throughout iran to stop any action by counterrevolutionary 
groups during voting 
i had a chat with friends and i decided that i must become a 
presidential candidate one hopeful was quoted as telling the 
daily kayhan of course i know that parliament speaker hashemi 
rafsanjani can be the most credible and prominent candidate in this 
election but i thought my presence could add heat to the campaign 
rafsanjani announced his candidacy at a news conference right 
after ayatollah ruhollah khomeini died on june 3 and remains the 
only leading political figure in the race 
he is widely expected to win and would have to give up his 
parliamentary seat mohtashemi said byelections will be held three 
months after the presidential election 
under a new constitution to be voted on in a referendum july 28 
the presidency will be much stronger the already powerful 
rafsanjani is expected to take over daytoday running of iran 
the council of guardians a committee of 12 religious and legal 
experts who review all laws passed by parliament must approve each 
presidential candidate 
the interior ministry said a presidential candidate must have 
iranian citizenship and ancestry a background in religion and 
politics management and administrative experience and must be a 
believing honest and pious moslem 
irna earlier quoted the farsilanguage daily abrar as saying the 
freedom movement of mehdi bazargan the only opposition figure 
allowed to stay in iran has not yet decided whether to nominate a 
candidate 
bazargan 81 was the first prime minister after the islamic 
revolution came to power in february 1979 khomeini fired him eight 
months later however saying his attitides were too liberal 
the governmentrun persianlanguage daily jomhuri islami said 
thursday that the speed with which iran was electing a new president 
and writing a new constitution after khomeinis death was proof of 
irans stability 
outside analysts have said the speedy elections could indicate an 
attempt by rafsanjani and ayatollah ali khamenei the current 
president and khomeinis elected successor to consolidate their 
control over the government 
the are considered pragmatists desiring a greater role for the 
private sector in the economy and outside financing for irans 
reconstruction after the 8year war with iraq the more radical 
camp including mohtashemi support a centralized economy and oppose 
ties with the west 
jomhuri islamis editorial mocked analysts who it said were 
waiting for iran to plunge into turmoil after khomeinis death 
it said developments since the revolutionary patriarch died 
disappointed them even more than any other development since the 
establishment of the islamic republic 
khamenei said thursday that irans hostility toward washington 
would abate only if the united states stopped backing iranian 
antirevolutionaries tehran radio reported 
the broadcast monitored in nicosia quoted khamenei as saying 
that the big powers such as america must repent from supporting 
the antirevolutionaries and until that happens the rage of the 
iranian nation against america will not abate

taiwan and south korea were given 60 days 
thursday to complete and implement north pacific driftnet agreements 
with the united states or face possible trade sanctions on their 
fishery imports 
secretary of commerce robert mosbacher told president bush that 
efforts to reach agreement with taiwan and south korea over the use 
of the driftnets by their fishing fleets have failed so far 
under a 1987 law thursday was the deadline for reaching 
agreements on monitoring and enforcement a 60day time clock now 
starts running and if agreements still are not reached by the end of 
that period the administration could impose an embargo or other 
trade sanctions on taiwanese and korean fishery products 
taiwanese imports mostly tuna and shrimp were valued at 372 
million last year and korean imports mostly pollock and oysters 
were valued at 250 million 
we have been unable to get the guarantees we consider 
absolutely necessary to protect critical marine life and valuable 
salmon stocks said mosbacher during this 60day period i 
sincerely hope that negotiations will continue so that we can avoid 
a disruption in our fisheries trade 
talks with the taiwanese continued thursday while talks with the 
koreans may resume in july 
an estimated 700 fishing boats from japan korea and taiwan have 
been using driftnets ostensibly to fish for squid since the early 
1980s the nets which sometimes can stretch more than 30 miles in 
length have been dubbed by environmentalists as walls of death 
the smallmesh monofilament nets hang in the water snaring 
almost any fish bird or marine animal they come in contact with 
on any given day the nets can cover more than 30000 miles of 
ocean 
us fishermen claim the driftnet fleets are catching north 
american salmon and that runs in alaska washington and oregon have 
declined as a result of the illegal fishing 
the united states and japan reached agreement on a driftnet 
enforcement and monitoring treaty last friday under that oneyear 
agreement the japanese will allow closer monitoring of their catch 
and a test program of using satellite transponders on research 
vessels 
the transponders can be used to keep track of where vessels are 
located however the agreement fell far short of what some members 
of the us fishing and environmental community had wanted 
brian gorman a spokesman for the national oceanic and 
atmospheric administration said in the past roughly halfadozen 
countries have faced possible trade sanctions for failing to reach 
agreement on various whaling issues with the united states 
in each case the countries had a change of heart and acceded to 
our demands gorman said 
northwest lawmakers praised mosbachers action 
i suspect that with the threat of sanctions hanging over their 
heads driftnetting countries will be a bit more anxious to talk 
said rep jolene unsoeld dwash if not they better be willing 
to suffer the consequences 
unsoeld called for an international ban on the use of driftnets 
rep john miller rwash said mosbacher had taken a major 
step to protect us salmon fisheries and the ocean environment 
miller said the piracy by the driftnet fleets has already 
delivered a painful blow to the us salmon supply 
these ships are supposedly fishing for squid but they are 
taking millions of pounds of our salmon and everything else swimming 
in the ocean miller said

the federal communications commission on 
thursday asked paramount communications inc to clear up apparent 
inconsistencies in a document that discusses the companys plan to 
take over time inc through a temporary transfer of stock to a 
trustee 
in a letter an fcc official asked paramount to explain just when 
it plans to take control of time from the trustee former defense 
secretary donald h rumsfeld 
the letter came a day before time stockholders were to consider 
paramounts 122 billion hostile takeover bid 
central to the takeover plan is paramounts receiving a special 
temporary authorization from the commission to allow rumsfeld to 
acquire time stock and operate the company this authorization would 
be issued pending fcc review of rumsfelds qualifications to hold 
licenses for microwave relay systems operated through times cable 
tv subsidiary american television amp communications corp 
the commission has jurisdiction over the transfer of relay 
facilities while local municipal authorities must approve transfers 
of the actual cable system franchises 
warner communications inc which is being pursued by time in a 
14 billion friendly takeover has claimed that if the fcc approves 
the authorization paramount will transfer stock to rumsfeld on july 
5 without prior approval from local authorities 
in a letter to paramount and rumsfeld on thursday alex felker 
the chief of the fccs mass media bureau said that based on 
earlier statements made in this proceeding it had been my 
understanding that you intended to await approval of paramount by 
local cable franchising authorities before time stock would be 
transferred from mr rumsfeld to paramount but that you did not 
intend to await approval of mr rumsfeld by local cable franchising 
authorities before he acquired time stock and took temporary control 
of its cable systems 
but felker noted that in its june 26 response to warner 
paramount characterized as patently false warners claim that 
paramount would effect an immediate transfer of control of time to 
rumsfeld without any required local franchise approvals 
felker said the paramount statement appears to suggest in 
contradiction to your earlier statements that stock will not be 
paid for and mr rumsfeld will not take control of time until local 
franchising authorities have approved mr rumsfelds 
qualifications 
felker requested a clarification in light of these apparent 
inconsistencies and that the sta process would be held up in the 
interim 
felker said that in the event paramount intends to first await 
local authorization before transfering control to rumsfeld the 
company should inform the fcc how long the process will take 
in a statement thursday paramount said the fcc staff has 
understandably been misled by times repeated mischaracterization of 
our position we have repeatedly and consisently said that our offer 
to purchase time shares is conditioned on obtaining both fcc 
approval and material state and local cable approvals 
time and warner have told the fcc that paramounts request for 
special temporary authorization called for an unprecedented 
extension to the cable tv industry of the fccs rules time and 
warner claim the rules allow expedited transfer of broadcast 
licenses pending fcc approval of the applicants worthiness to hold 
them but not for cable franchises which must be transferred by 
local authorities 
norman leventhal a paramount attorney in washington said 
well be filing a formal response tomorrow and were confident 
well be able to satisify the commission concerns as expressed in 
the letter 
we believe our plan is fully consistent with commission 
precedent leventhal said citing three instances in which the fcc 
has issued special temporary authorizations for nonbroadcast 
acquisitions

ships like the tanker that spilled 
420000 gallons of heating oil into narragansett bay are given 
federal guidelines that contradict state law governing where harbor 
pilots should board according to evidence presented thursday 
in addition the coxswain of a pilots boat told the coast 
guardnational transportation safety board inquiry he often dropped 
off or picked up pilots nearly inside the bay miles closer than 
where they should have boarded 
the tanker world prodigy had no pilot on board when it ran 
aground inside the area in which the state requires a pilot 
in other oil spills that occurred last weekend a delaware state 
official said 75 percent of the heavy oil leaked into the delaware 
river when a uruguayan tanker ran aground has been cleaned up 
in texas crews using handheld skimmers and absorbent pads were 
completing the cleanup of the last of about 6000 barrels of oil 
that leaked into the houston ship channel from a barge that collided 
with a tanker a commercial fisherman complained that several 
patches of oil patches are passing over oyster reefs miles beyond 
where the coast guard said the spill peaked 
in the investigation of the rhode island spill the justice 
department approved immunity against prosecution for the world 
prodigys helmsman and chief mate so they could testify 
world prodigy captain iakovos georgudis 43 remained confined 
aboard ship in lieu of 50000 bail on misdemeanor charges he 
violated the federal clean water and refuse acts that prohibit 
negligent discharge of pollutants or discharge of pollutants without 
a permit he was arrested wednesday 
a statewide grand jury is investigating possible violations of a 
state law that require a harbor pilot on board vessels inside a line 
from point judith to sakkonet point 
but the united states coast pilot a commerce department 
guide entered as an exhibit at the hearing says pilots normally 
board at the brenton reef light tower about 1 miles inside the 
line and in the approximate area where the tanker ran aground 
norman lidstone coxswain of the boat that brought pilot david 
leonard to the tanker said that while most pilots meet their ships 
up to 1 miles away from the tower some ships whose captains are 
familiar with the area meet pilots closer to the reef 
in other testimony chief engineer konstantinos tzalas aided by 
an interpreter told the coast guardnational transportation safety 
board investigating panel he was in the engine room and knew the 
ship had grounded from the shudder 
the engineer however said speed was controlled from the bridge 
and he could not estimate it from his measure of engine revolutions 
he said georgudis provided little information about the accident 
coast guard capt david h whitten said he decided not to attempt 
to call the captain or chief mate georgios a vlahos after their 
lawyer john mcfadden wrote that they would invoke their right 
against selfincrimination 
us attorney lincoln c almond said he was trying to obtain 
approval for the immunity grants from washington 
testimony by the helmsman konstadinos a paraskevopulos also 
was delayed by the immunity question he was granted state immunity 
wednesday and testified before a grand jury investigating whether 
state pollution laws or a statute requiring a harbor pilot on board 
were violated 
coast guard crews and a private contractor had pumped the last of 
the ships almost 8 million gallons of oil into waiting barges and 
were waiting for plans from the owner on where the ship would be 
repaired lt paul wolf said 
little shoreline pollution remained 
in delaware edwin clark secretary of natural resources and 
environmental control said 99 percent of the oil spilled by the 
tanker presidente rivera had been cleaned from the shoreline and 
about 75 percent total or 75000 gallons had been cleaned up clark 
said the state has kept its estimate at more than 100000 gallons 
while the coast guard said the tanker spilled 306684 gallons 
tristate bird rescue amp research inc has gotten about 100 birds 
mostly mallard ducks and canada geese to be cleaned of the thick 
oil clogging their feathers two ducklings have died at the center 
said spokeswoman joyce ponsell 
a galveston bay oysterman said the extent of the houston ship 
channel spill may be broader than initially believed because patches 
of oil particles are passing over oyster reefs miles away from the 
spill 
i had understood the oil was being contained and recovered so 
it was a surprise to me oysterman joe nelson of smith point said 
i was not expecting to see anything 
the coast guard reported thursday said a light sheen of oil 
stretched for about four miles from the cleanup site it might 
have been some oil that got out during the storm that we didnt know 
about lt david atkinson said

a federal judge agreed thursday to stop the 
sale of the registermail in galesburg to thomson newspapers inc 
saying two of the newspaperss trustees were blind to their 
duties in agreeing to the deal 
i think the conduct of the trustees constitutes selfdealing 
that is looking out for their own interests us district judge 
michael mihm said in granting an injunction sought by john t 
pritchard former publisher of the registermail which is owned by 
his family 
mihm scheduled a hearing friday to determine how the trustees 
should proceed in selling the newspaper which has a circulation of 
about 20000 
pritchard his brother lester t pritchard and their cousin 
sally day are the three trustees who control 54 percent of the 
newspapers stock 
mihm said he granted the injunction because lester pritchard and 
ms day stood to benefit personally from selling the stock to the 
exclusion of the other trustee john pritchard 
in his lawsuit pritchard alleged that his brother and his cousin 
breached their fiduciary responsibilities as trustees by accepting 
the thomson offer without adequately considering other offers 
mihm agreed with john pritchards allegations that his brother 
and cousin took the thomson offer because of personal benefits 
under the thomson offer they would receive additional payments 
of 15 million for agreeing not to start a competing paper and ms 
day and her family would get health insurance coverage those 
payments bypass the trust 
the decision reversed mihms initial ruling wednesday night after 
12 hours of testimony and arguments it blocks fridays scheduled 
closing of the sale to lincoln publishing inc of west virginia 
lincoln is a thomson affiliate created to buy the registermail 
and two weekly newspapers according to its attorney dan webb 
the judge however rejected arguments by pritchards attorney 
harold c hirshman that securities and exchange commission rules 
were violated in thomsons tender offer of 147 million for the 
newspaper 
mihm ruled the thomson offer was a negotiated sale not a tender 
offer so the cited sec rulings did not apply 
there are several other offers for the newspaper and its two 
weeklies that lester pritchard and ms day have failed to 
investigate thoroughly the complaint alleged 
the peoria journal star has made two offers directly to the 
shareholders one for 15 million that will create an employee 
stock ownership plan for the registermail and another for 16 
million for a direct purchase there are also two other offers for 
155 million and 1825 million 
more than 91 percent of the shares in the registermail have been 
tendered to torontobased thomson newspapers said richard franklin

a guerrilla leader resigned thursday 
after a cuban colonel being tried in havana on drug charges 
mentioned him as his only contact with the colombian insurgency 
ramiro lucio escobar spokesman for m19 the april 19 movement 
announced he is resigning in an effort to avoid further allegations 
against his organization 
i am conscious of the gravity of the accusations i want to 
assume my personal defense and prevent this matter to be politically 
exploited against the m19 he told colombian rcn broadcast 
station 
cuban col antonio de la guardia testified wednesday in havana 
that escobar was the only person he dealt with during his trips to 
colombia in the testimony broadcast on colombian television de la 
guardia did not specifically say the dealings were part of alleged 
cocainesmuggling activities 
escobar acknowledged he met the cuban army colonel but only to 
trade colombian paintings in exchange for cuban sugar tobbaco and 
alcohol 
de la guardia cannot reveal his real drug connections and 
that probably is why he named me a person with whom he had many 
commercial contacts escobar said 
i am one of the most watched man in colombia today because of 
my public condition of political spokesman for a guerrilla 
organization consequently the colombian government has a full 
information on my businesses with cuba he said 
in the havana trial cuban military officers are being tried on 
charges they helped drug barons of colombias medellin cartel 
smuggle into the united states up to six tons of cocaine using cuban 
airports facilities 
colombian authorities have repeatedly charged the colombian 
procastro guerrillas with involvement with drug traffickers 
the charges usually spared the m19 a nationalist guerrilla 
currently holding peace talks with the government aimed at a full 
incorporation of the movement into the colombian political system

the legislature thursday nominated 
tomas altamirano duque a newspaper publisher and friend of de facto 
leader gen manuel noriega as the administrator of the panama canal 
but panamanian and american sources expressed doubts altamirano 
duque will get the approval of the us senate to head the panama 
canal commission which is a us federal agency 
under treaties signed by the two countries in 1977 turning 
sovereignty of the waterway over to panama a panamanian citizen is 
to be the canal administrator as of jan 1 1990 but the candidate 
after being nominated by panama must have the consent of the us 
senate 
if they dont like me they can fire me said altamirano 
duque told reporters after the legislature voted 420 with 13 
abstentions to nominate him over four other candidates 
i am not antiamerican and i am not a communist the us has a 
great people that believe in democracy but sometimes its governent 
goes down a different path he added the us should have no 
objection but if it opposes it it will be another violation of the 
treaties 
altamirano duque 55 is a prominent businessman former cabinet 
member and publisher of la estrella panamas biggest newspaper he 
is also is a longtime legislator for the ruling revolutionary 
democratic party and holds a business administration degree from the 
university of florida 
a visa he had to travel to the united states was revoked by the 
embassy in september ostensibly because of his friendship with 
noriega and other top military officers who hold power 
another obstacle apparently is that the bush administration does 
not recognize acting president manuel solis palmas government and 
insists ousted president eric arturo delvalle is panamas legitimate 
president 
noriega was indicted by federal grand juries in florida on drug 
smuggling and money laundering charges in february 1988 a few days 
later delvalle fired noriega as chief of the defense forces 
but noriega who controlled a majority of congressmen had the 
legislature fire delvalle instead and named solis palma then the 
education minister acting president 
since then efforts by the us to oust noriega including 
economic sanctions against panama have failed to budge him from 
power 
the commission created to administer the canal until the year 
2000 when panama takes over the waterway has an american 
administrator currently dennis mcauliffe and a panamanian deputy 
administrator 
the deputy administrator fernando manfredo was considered a 
strong candidate whom the united states would have approved without 
reservations 
but panamanian government identifies manfredo too much with us 
interests and he received no votes when his name was proposed in 
the legislature

premier li peng on thursday dismissed 
international criticism that chinas crackdown on the prodemocracy 
movement violated human rights and he said the suppression was 
carried out legally 
the government also denounced the european economic community for 
condemning the attack on the studentled movement 
governmentrun newspapers on friday continued quoting leaders 
criticism that foreign lands were trying to isolate china in the 
name of human rights 
the china daily quoted president yang shangkun as telling a 
delegation from bolivia thursday he hoped the world will 
understand that the suppression of the rebellion represents a 
reasonable act in handlng our internal affairs 
the steering committee of chinas legislature held a special 
meeting to endorse the communist partys suppression of dissent as 
legal correct and necessary 
li said many nations had shown understanding for chinas tough 
stance 
at the same time china has also noticed an antichina adverse 
current under the banner of human rights these people have made 
unwarranted accusations of china for its quelling of the 
counterrevolutionary rebellion and punishment of criminals according 
to law 
the official xinhua news agency said li made the comments in a 
meeting with foreign minister carlos da graca of sao tome and 
principe a tiny island nation off the west coast of africa 
your visit is a support for china li told da graca the 
highestlevel foreign dignitary to visit china since soldiers 
marched on beijing the night of june 34 and crushed the movement 
for a freer society 
the troops backed by tanks fired on unarmed civilians and drove 
thousands of protesters from tiananmen square the government says 
200 to 300 people most of them soldiers were killed in the 
confrontation chinese witnesses and western intelligence reports 
say that most of the dead were civilians and that the toll was as 
high as 3000 
authorities since have arrested more than 1800 people and 
executed 27 and china has become increasingly isolated from the 
international community 
the 12nation eec on tuesday condemned the brutal repression 
taking place in china and called for an embargo on arms sales it 
also urged the world bank to postpone new loans to beijing 
the united states canada japan and australia have taken similar 
steps 
foreign ministry spokeswoman li jinhua said the eec had made 
presumptuous accusations against china and unilaterally adopted 
decisions jeopardizing the bilateral relations 
the chinese government cannot but express deep regret over this 
unreasonable act of the european council she said 
wan li chairman of the standing committee of the national 
peoples congress opened the committee meeting by praising the 
party and government for taking resolute measures to quell the 
counterrevolutionary rebellion 
this decision was in line with the fundamental interests of 
people of all nationalities in china and thus was legal correct 
and necessary xinhua quoted him as telling the 133 members 
present 
the full congress has about 3000 members and meets once a year 
it has limited powers and mainly serves as a forum for endorsing 
party policy 
the committee meeting was part of a nationwide campaign to unify 
chinas 11 billion people behind the crackdown on the sevenweek 
prodemocracy movement 
the committee canceled a june 20 session at which it had planned 
to discuss political reforms demanded by students the demands 
including a freer press were replaced on thursdays agenda with a 
proposal to tighten control over peoples rights to stage rallies 
and demonstrations 
stability represents chinas highest interest said wan once 
considered a moderate 
the communist party last week dismissed party chief zhao ziyang 
also considered a moderate because he had expressed sympathy for 
the student protesters demands 
the party replaced him with shanghai party boss jiang zemin who 
in his first public statement wednesday called for severe 
punishments for leaders of the movement 
jiang and other newly appointed hardline members of the 
politburo standing committee the partys top decisionmaking body 
appeared thursday with hundreds of military officers to celebrate 
the 68th anniversary of the chinese communist party which is 
saturday 
jiang standing next to premier li sang patriotic songs with the 
officers

a senior un environmental official says 
entire nations could be wiped off the face of the earth by rising 
sea levels if the global warming trend is not reversed by the year 
2000 
coastal flooding and crop failures would create an exodus of 
ecorefugees threatening political chaos said noel brown 
director of the new york office of the un environment program or 
unep 
he said governments have a 10year window of opportunity to solve 
the greenhouse effect before it goes beyond human control 
as the warming melts polar icecaps ocean levels will rise by up 
to three feet enough to cover the maldives and other flat island 
nations brown told the associated press in an interview on 
wednesday 
coastal regions will be inundated onesixth of bangladesh could 
be flooded displacing a fourth of its 90 million people a fifth of 
egypts arable land in the nile delta would be flooded cutting off 
its food supply according to a joint unep and us environmental 
protection agency study 
ecological refugees will become a major concern and whats 
worse is you may find that people can move to drier ground but the 
soils and the natural resources may not support life africa doesnt 
have to worry about land but would you want to live in the 
sahara he said 
unep estimates it would cost the united states at least 100 
billion to protect its east coast alone 
shifting climate patterns would bring back 1930s dust bowl 
conditions to canadian and us wheatlands while the soviet union 
could reap bumper crops if it adapts its agriculture in time 
according to a study by unep and the international institute for 
applied systems analysis 
excess carbon dioxide is pouring into the atmosphere because of 
humanitys use of fossil fuels and burning of rain forests the 
study says the atmosphere is retaining more heat than it radiates 
much like a greenhouse 
the most conservative scientific estimate that the earths 
temperature will rise 1 to 7 degrees in the next 30 years said 
brown 
the difference may seem slight he said but the planet is only 9 
degrees warmer now than during the 8000year ice age that ended 
10000 years ago 
brown said if the warming trend continues the question is will 
we be able to reverse the process in time we say that within the 
next 10 years given the present loads that the atmosphere has to 
bear we have an opportunity to start the stabilizing process 
he said even the most conservative scientists already tell us 
theres nothing we can do now to stop a change of about 3 
degrees 
anything beyond that and we have to start thinking about the 
significant rise of the sea levels we can expect more ferocious 
storms hurricanes wind shear dust erosion 
he said there is time to act but there is no time to waste 
unep is working toward forming a scientific plan of action by the 
end of 1990 and the adoption of a global climate treaty by 1992 in 
may delegates from 103 nations met in nairobi kenya where unep 
is based and decided to open negotiations on the treaty next year 
nations will be asked to reduce the use of fossil fuels cut the 
emission of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases such as 
methane and fluorocarbons and preserve the rain forests 
we have no clear idea about the ecological minimum of green 
space that the planet needs to function effectively what we do know 
is that we are destroying the tropical rain forest at the rate of 50 
acres a minute about one football field per second said brown 
each acre of rain forest can store 100 tons of carbon dioxide and 
reprocess it into oxygen 
brown suggested that compensating brazil indonesia and kenya for 
preserving rain forests may be necessary 
the european community istalking about a halfcent levy on each 
kilowatthour of fossil fuels to raise 55 million a year to protect 
the rain forests and other direct subsidies may be possible he 
said 
the treaty could also call for improved energy efficiency 
increasing conservation and for developed nations to transfer 
technology to third world nations to help them save energy and cut 
greenhouse gas emissions said brown

women once used hangers to end unwanted 
pregnancies now health officials say a few desperate women are 
using cocaine to induce abortions 
the national association for perinatal addiction research and 
education has heard of cocaineinduced abortions in every major us 
city during the last three years said ira chasnoff president of 
the chicagobased organization 
its probably cheaper faster and more efficient to do it 
themselves rather than seek an abortion in a clinic he said in a 
telephone interview wednesday 
the group keeps no statistics on cocaineinduced abortions but 
officials in miami and detroit say scattered cases of women who used 
large doses of cocaine to end pregnancies are showing up in 
emergency rooms as miscarriage patients 
chasnoff an expert on cocaine addiction and pregnancy said the 
drug causes blood vessels to constrict cutting off blood supply to 
the fetus and stimulates the pregnant uterus to contract

with republican leaders in congress to have a final version done as 
early as friday 
presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater said wednesday the 
measure would be developed jointly with senate minority leader bob 
dole rkan and house minority leader robert michel rill 
the proposal would seek to set aside last weeks supreme court 
ruling upholding the constitutionality of flag burning as a form of 
political protest 
fitzwater had earlier said a final white house amendment would be 
ready by the end of the day wednesday but later explained the new 
target by saying the gop leaders wanted to be part of it

demonstrators and say theyre near winning the bush 
administrations endorsement 
the sanctions drafted late wednesday by senior members of the 
foreign affairs committee were virtually certain to be accepted 
today by the full house as an amendment to a twoyear 23 billion 
foreign aid bill 
the move will send a very strong signal to chinas leaders 
while steering a middle course between those who believe we should 
completely sever diplomatic and commercial relations with china and 
those who believe we should continue business as usual said rep 
stephen solarz dny chairman of the asia subcommittee 
in addition to placing in law moves already taken by bush the 
list included suspension of trade and development programs banning 
the sale of policerelated weapons and limiting transfer of

on most mornings the roar of a missile 
overhead is the alarm clock for omar khan and his neighbors 
government officials make no secret that it is another 
sovietsupplied scudb missile the heaviest weapon used so far in 
the decadelong war against moslem guerrillas known as the 
mujahedeen 
when the missiles come over it is always just before dawn only 
their targets and directions are changed somewhere in the 
mountains or plains outside kabul 
to omar khan and others in the capital the missiles are a 
reminder that while soviet forces have withdrawn from afghanistan 
the fighting goes on and people are weary of it even though it is 
far away except for the times guerrilla rockets fall erratically in 
the city 
there is a struggle here between two great powers but we are 
the ones dying said the 52yearold khan who sells plastic shoes 
in kabuls old bazaar the russians and the americans are talking 
to each other about limiting atomic weapons but both are sending 
rockets and bombs to kill our people why what is our guilt 
when moslem guerrillas overran his village in eastern kunar 
province in 1980 khan and his family packed the few belonging they 
could carry left their small farm and walked 125 miles to the 
capital 
he set up a small wooden stand in the bazaar where veiled women 
display fruits nuts and spices and the shouts of peasants selling 
camel legs compete with the muezzins calling the moslem faithful to 
prayer at the city mosques 
four of khans seven sons have died in the war two still fight 
on the side of the guerrillas and he worries that his only 
surviving child will be called for military duty to fight the 
guerrillas possibly even his brothers 
forget you cant forget about this war khan said speaking 
through an interpreter but what are we supposed to do run and 
hide 
during the 11 years that the guerrillas have been fighting to 
overthrow the sovietbacked government the harshest of consequences 
have fallen on the civilians many if not most of the 13 million 
killed in the war have been civilians 
the guerrillas control afghanistans countryside but it is the 
cities they must capture 
that they have failed so far to do and with casualties rising on 
both sides doubt is growing that either side has the power to break 
the impasse 
we are simple poor people khan said our families may be 
with the government they may be with the mujahedeen but this has 
to stop 
while he and others in the bazaar praise the guerrillas for their 
struggle against the soviet forces that intervened to help the 
marxist government in 1979 they remain apprehensive about the 
fundamentalist guerrilla leaders and of the destruction the rebels 
inflicted while seizing provincial towns 
and even among those who speak contemptuously of the government 
the tendency is to question the decision of the united states to 
continue arming the guerrillas after the soviets left feb 15 
guerrilla projectiles almost always are chinesemade 
107mmrockets packed with shrapnel and designed to spray jagged 
metal shards over a wide area are fired at random from the rebels 
mountain hideouts about 15 miles outside kabul they usually land on 
houses courtyards parks and mosques but seldom on the intended 
targets military outposts government installations and the 
airport 
in the wards at indira gandhi childrens hospital feelings are 
strongest among the doctors trained by westerners before war erupted 
we would like to see the worlds two most powerful countries 
trying to help us not destroy us said dr mohammad jalail as he 
checked an 11yearold boy whose legs had to be amputated after a 
rocket slammed into a park where he was playing 
i am not a politician but those who supply these weapons 
should think if they were here and they could see this how would 
they feel would they want to continue sending the weapons or would 
they think it better to help us with the medicines and food we 
really need said the californiaeducated jalail 
few people in kabul expect a unified opposition to emerge and if 
the war continues many fear the uneasy alliance between the seven 
pakistanbased guerrilla groups could rupture creating a country so 
divided by a warlord system that no outside influence would be 
likely to control 
most believe that almost any negotiated settlement would be 
better than one won on the battlefield 
a common preference seems directed toward an illdefined 
compromise that would install a government that would be neither 
marxist nor committed to islamic fundamentalism 
one hope is that some outside force will end the fighting and 
restore peace one who is frequently mentioned is the exiled king 
mohammad zahir shah dethroned by a military coup in 1973 
he was a good king and he isnt killing anybody khan said 
now 74 years old zahir shah lives in rome but most diplomats in 
kabul say the chances of his playing a significant role are not 
rated very highly partly because of allegations among some 
guerrilla groups that his personal behavior as king fell short of 
the standards expected of a devout moslem 
but the yearning for a solution runs deep 
the americans give bombs to the mujahedeen the russians give 
bombs to the government khan said the americans dont die and 
the russians dont die only afghans died its time to say ok 
enough finished

wall street hates the word bet which it 
associates with the somewhat frantic and relatively lowbrow 
activities at casinos and racetracks that contrast with the serious 
business of stock exchanges 
betting is gambling wall streeters say they consider it an 
often irrational and addictive activity that generally brings 
nothing but woe to participants and families whereas investing 
builds happiness and nest eggs 
as they see it gambling is for the uninformed the unfortunate 
the touts and dreamers in contrast investing is rational 
considered informed calculated prudent it is productive it 
builds the economy 
betting is lowclass investing is high betters are hotheaded 
investors are cool betting is blind investing is informed betting 
is for losers investing for winners betting may flirt with the law 
and sometimes flout it but investing is allamerican wholesome 
democratic 
but with due respect for such definitions and opinions some 
of the people who run us free enterprise arent strongly inclined 
to make either a bet or an investment in the very companies with 
which they associate 
proxy statements tell the tale showing that executives of major 
us businesses sometimes have surprisingly small investments in 
their own companies directors sometimes have what is called an odd 
lot or fewer than 100 shares 
still these are the people whose job it is to convince others to 
invest in their corporations and for most people the most 
convincing argument for investing is the potential for corporate 
growth and profit 
the case of managers and directors who decline to invest heavily 
in their own companies or who sell when others are buying has long 
been a curious phenomenon in us corporate life and it is closely 
watched 
it is in fact a key measure used by smart investors if 
managers and directors arent enthusiastic investors why should 
outsiders want to buy in if managers are selling doesnt that 
suggest a lack of faith in the future 
often but not always highlevel managers sometimes are 
compelled to sell for personal reasons such as to pay taxes settle 
estates or raise money to support a certain life style 
but when several insiders lower their holdings simultaneously it 
often is enough to provoke speculation that they know something the 
public doesnt that type of speculation now involves lockheed corp 
the wall street journal noted this week that robert fuhrman 
lockheed vice chairman sold 8635 shares in february and 5000 more 
on may 25 reducing his holdings to 1000 shares seven other 
insiders were sellers in recent months 
while such decisions could be personal they are watched closely 
by advisory services as potential evidence the future might contain 
some bad news indeed that is often the case 
are these managers therefore betting against their own 
team thats where the distinction between betting and investing 
and sports and business becomes clearer managing a business is not 
managing a team 
business unlike sports isnt played a game at a time but all 
the time the season isnt limited but endless both business and 
sports keep score the former with runs or goals or points the 
latter with dollars but sports scoring is much more precise in 
baseball winners are emphatically declared but what appears to be 
a loser in business may on reflection turn out to be a winner 
above all the power and influence of one individual in a 
professional sports organization may be far greater than that of any 
one person in business teams are small generally a fraction of the 
size of even small corporations 
yes there are differences between betting and investing big 
ones but sometimes the two become remarkably alike if corporate 
managers sell heavily its a good bet that you as an investor 
should examine the reasons

silt has built up in the harbor 
where whaling fleets once anchored on shore factories stand 
derelict only a few tourists sip coffee at the moby dick cafe or 
wander around in the whaling museum 
since the 1983 international whaling ban things have been 
looking bleak for lajes do pico and almost all of the 250000 people 
living in the azores the atlantic archipelago 740 miles west of 
mainland portugal 
but as a portuguese possession the azores now are part of the 
european economic community headquartered in faroff brussels 
belgium and that has rekindled hopes for modernization and a return 
of some of the prosperity of old 
even so azoreans are in a struggle 
with a per capita gross national product of 1286 in 1985 they 
rank among the poorest in europe trailing portugal with 2160 
and greece with 3280 about 28 percent of islanders work the land 
all through history weve concentrated on one product wheat 
then oranges now dairy products and thats left us very open to 
crisis said carlos cordeiro history lecturer at the azores 
university on sao miguel the largest of the nine azores islands 
portugals entry into the eec in 1986 meant a new source of 
money according to government figures eec funds will increase from 
41 million in the previous threeyear period to 511 million or a 
quarter of the azorean budget for 19891992 
the us air force base at lajes on terceira the island in the 
middle was once a source of vital income for the islands and 
provided jobs for about 1500 azoreans 
but revenue from the usportuguese base agreement is becoming 
less significant as eec assistance rises 
and regional president joao bosco mota amaral has set his 
priorities modernize agriculture and fisheries and promote 
tourism 
across the water from pico the capital of faial island horta 
is already booming boat crews record their visits with graffiti on 
the docks and private yachtsmen pack petes bar ordering drinks in 
french english german and spanish 
maria da graca sousa director of two luxury hotels on faial and 
pico says the azores will offer 3000 beds by next year but cant 
rely on tourism alone 
the destiny of the azores in tourism is not cheap it costs a 
lot to get here and its a very specific market nature walking 
and watersports 
profitable alternatives are hard to find however 
nearly all our main sectors are in crisis meat and milk are 
products already in surplus in the eec said mario fortuna a 
leading azorean economist 
after more than a year of negotiations eec officials recently 
authorized the islands to set up a dutyfree manufacturing zone on 
santa maria the easternmost of the azores 
under the plan companies can operate taxfree through the year 
2011 and the government plans incentives for potential shareholders 
were hoping to attract manufacturers electronics 
pharmaceuticals plastics all light and cheap to transport said 
fortuna who is chairman of the freezone administration board 
zofram 
it was difficult to persuade the eec to make an exception just 
when its trying to standardize countries for 1992 but if the 
azores had to use the same rules as regions in the heart of europe 
that would be unfair competition exactly what the eecs against 
high cost of transporting goods and supplies to the azores is a 
chief problem and island shopkeepers charge about 15 percent more 
for wares than stores on the european mainland 
the portuguese government in lisbon plans to move some 140 air 
traffic controllers responsible for midatlantic operations from 
santa maria island to the mainland by 1990 that will mean a loss of 
purchasing power on the island of 5000 people and turn its main 
community vilo do porto into another lajes do pico 
many shopkeepers here say theyll close their doors when the 
controllers leave theyre not optimistic that foreigners will want 
to come and set up business here said luis pereira of the 
commercial radio station in vilo do porto 
because of their isolation azoreans are superstitious and 
religious on one hand and open to travel adventure and foreign 
ideas on the other the latter is a main theme of the novel o 
barco e o sonho the boat and the dream by the azorean writer 
manuel ferreira 
recently turned into a popular portuguese television series the 
novel tells of two azoreans who build a tiny sailboat to cross the 
atlantic in search of a new life 
they see the america of the 1950s as a marvellous world over 
the sea its flag a shower of stars and dollars 
emigration has always been a safety valve against poverty famine 
and unemployment on the azores 
between 1960 and 1980 some 160000 azoreans emigrated mainly 
for the united states and canada today emigrants and their 
descendants in north america number about a million four times as 
many as live on the islands

when david byrne creates a rock group its the 
brilliant talking heads when he makes a movie its the unique 
social satire true stories 
so its not surprising that when he makes a documentary its the 
unusual and enlightening ile aiye byrnes onehour offering can 
be seen on most pbs stations wednesday opening the new season of 
the alternative film and video series alive from off center 
byrnes film is a portrait of candomble a religion practiced in 
bahia the northeastern province of brazil by descendants of 
african slaves 
ile aiye means the house of life 
pulsating music is an integral part of the highspirited and 
graceful rituals of candomble byrne like many composers and 
musicians has a longstanding fascination with the afroamerican 
influences on american rock and jazz 
the music led me to ask what was the underlying spirituality 
underneath the music he said at a cafe near his home in 
manhattans soho section i honestly think that some kind of 
spirituality that has some of the elements that that kind of 
religion has is going to be our saving grace 
its going to help us survive because its a certain kind of 
spirituality that doesnt deny any part of human nature like 
sensuality or sex or good or evil theyre all thrown in there 
one could say that this religion helps people get along with 
one another in funny way because each person is presumed to be 
ruled by a specific god people can kind of get along with 
people whose behavior is different from theirs they dont try to 
make everybody behave the same act the same they can say oh that 
persons acts that way because oshun rules their head 
look at it on the good side it works that way byrne said 
adding with a smile on the bad side it can be just an excuse 
byrne had arrived at the restaurant toting a small tape recorder 
he uses for orally jotting down lyrics hes working on a new album 
for release in the fall featuring latin jazz musicians from new york 
no doubt strongly influenced by the music that is an integral part 
of candomble 
byrne first went to bahia in 1987 on the way to a film festival 
in rio de janeiro on the return trip to do the film he attended 
several candomble ceremonies before asking permission to film them 
ile aiye utilizes split screens and inserts rather than 
narration to tell the story information is presented mostly through 
music and image for the viewer to absorb 
a lot of these techniques they used to be used sometimes in 
narrative films and sometimes in rock videos and stuff said 
byrne and sometimes in those contexts they dont make much sense 
or they dont serve any purpose other than being kind of groovy but 
in a documentary you might be able to use them where they actually 
convey more information 
sometimes wed show a pan of the city wed show it 50 years 
ago and as it is today at the same time we dont tell you all that 
but you get the idea and sometimes if somebodys making an offering 
of a basket we show in an insert them making the basket 
it seemed a way to include all those kinds of crossreferences 
and things without having to say it you can pick it up visually and 
you dont have to have an intrusive voice come in and tell you about 
it 
byrne doesnt pretend that his documentary is a work of 
journalism in fact he left out one important ritual of candomble 
animal sacrifice because he figured it would be offputting even 
though the animals used in the ritual are also used as food 
i think you can get a sense of the religion without it without 
seeing it its something they dont do all the time they 
apparently would do it only on festival days if they can afford it 
if they can afford a goat or some chickens or whatever part of 
the price we had to pay for filming was to buy a couple of goats and 
chickens and stuff like that and wed all get to eat pretty good 
later too

in 1972 bible scholar delbert hillers completed 
what was intended as the most thorough comprehensive volume on the 
old testament book of lamentations 
now he has to revise it because he and scholars generally were 
unaware that much earlier chapters of lamentations had been 
available for years in the dead sea scrolls but only a select group 
knew about it 
the particular chapters have finally been issued but more than 
half of the immense trove of ancient manuscripts remains hidden from 
public view 
furor erupted anew this week over the long delay in releasing 
much of the scroll contents its been a problem to get access 
to the scroll material said theresa dorsogna an editor for 
doubleday publishers of the huge anchor bible series expected to 
exceed 70 volumes of which hillers book is a part 
its something that scholars have been fighting for a long 
time she said in a telephone interview it works a real 
hardship on them hillers of johns hopkins university was 
expected to have his revision finished by years end 
the scrolls contain parts of every book in the old testament 
l000 years older than any ever available before as well as 
extensive material on first century judaism in which christianity 
arose 
david noel freedman professor of biblical studies at the 
university of michigan and editor of the anchor bible series said 
the scroll team kept their work in the dark while a whole 
generation has gone by 
the delay has been almost 40 years and thats too long to keep 
the material from public scrutiny he said its a serious 
matter and long past time for some changes 
less than half of the scrolls have been published although the 
first were discovered in a cave near the dead sea in 1947 and many 
more were found in 11 caves over the next decade 
theyve been in the hands of a small international team of 
scholars since the early 1950s now overseen by israels department 
of antiquities 
their editorinchief john strugnell harvard university 
professor of christian origins said the work was being speeded up 
and hopes were to have all the manuscripts published by 2000 
its slow business he said we are producing and were 
getting faster an immense amount of work is being done 
he noted that only three volumes of the scrolls had been produced 
in the first 20 years of the project nine of them since 1976 he 
said only a third to half of the material has been published so far 
strugnell scoffed at suspicions once voiced that religious 
authorities such as the vatican were covering up the materials 
because they threatened church teachings anyone who would believe 
that would believe anything he said 
the notion also was derided in the current bimonthly biblical 
archeology review which had raised new challenges to the delay in 
issuing the scrolls calling it a conspiracy of silence and 
obstruction 
but the magazine said it had tried to scotch these rumors of 
religious supression and we do not believe there is any credible 
evidence for such conclusions 
there also was early speculation linking jesus to the qumron 
community of ascetics called the essenes who produced the dead sea 
documents but strugnell said this has virtually been dropped 
however jesus movement and the essenes were contemporary he 
noted the two groups lived in the same century and there must 
have been some contact but it was no closer than that he said 
concerning complaints about a still unpublished scroll letter 
from the qumron community leader the teacher of righteousness 
to jerusalems high priest strugnell said it should be out by 
years end 
thats a top priority he said 
the high priest whose leadership the qumron community had 
rejected was the same one that pushed for the elimination of jesus 
strugnell said while the material on firstcentury judaism did 
not refer directly to jesus it relates to the background of 
christianity in that period and country 
freedman who alternates teaching at the university of michigan 
and the university of california at san diego said that among still 
unpublished documents are parts of the two books of samuel and the 
book of jeremiah 
such material belongs to the whole scholarly community and 
should be released right away he said he said after such 
archeological finds photographic slides should be generally 
available within a year or two 
the anchor bible series issued its first volume in 1965 on the 
book of genesis and is scheduled to issue its 47th volume this fall 
on the book of amos with 70 volumes expected to be out by 2000

an american scholar on soviet religion said 
legislation has been proposed by the soviet council on religious

been provided to the church and is further evidence of a genuinely 
liberalizing situation

zimbabwe has made a uturn on the road 
to socialism set out by president robert mugabe and is opening the 
way to foreign investors a cabinet official says 
even dreaming of socialism is a nonstarter hebert 
ushewokunze the minister of political affairs told businessmen 
assembled here recently we wont see true socialism here nor 
will our children 
mugabe came to power after independence from britain in 1980 
vowing to lead the former colony of rhodesia on a marxistleninist 
path and his government introduced sweeping social and economic 
changes 
those changes included cheap schooling free health care price 
controls on a broad range of commodities and stringent protective 
labor laws that critics said promoted inefficiency 
but mugabe had inherited a mixed capitaliststyle economy that 
has remained largely in the hands of a 100000member white minority 
that favors the free enterprise system 
for years government and the business community coexisted 
uneasily all the while the economy stagnated and unemployment 
increased 
next year experts say some 300000 students will leave school 
and enter an economy that is producing only about 7000 new jobs a 
year unemployed voters will outnumber employed voters 31 in the 
1990 parliamentary election 
so in may after months of speculation that something of the sort 
was coming mugabe announced a new investment code 
it was expounded by ushewokunze to the businessmen in bulawayo 
zimbabwes second largest city after harare the capital formerly 
called salisbury 
we have lifted the lid by inviting external investors he 
said i dont see this investment atmosphere as conducive to the 
goals of a socialist state 
the investment code zimbabwes first has brought a mixed 
reaction many businessmen say it is too little too late while 
radical students and others have condemned it as a sellout 
on june 9 kempton makamure a university professor and an 
outspoken marxist idealogue was detained by police for questioning 
after criticizing the code on state radio as a violation of 
socialist principles two journalists involved in the broadcast were 
suspended 
while makamure and his disciples think the code strays too far 
from socialist philosophy a great many businessmen believe it 
doesnt go far enough 
we have been given a bone but theres not enough meat on it 
said arthur chapman a business executive in harare 
a black entrepreneur who requested anonymity said the states 
ideological dilemma created an investment policy that was not 
dramatic enough to attract the high rollers we really need 
the code allows foreigners to hold 25 percent of the share value 
of new investments up from 15 percent it also permits them to send 
25 percent to 100 percent of their profits to home offices in hard 
currencies depending on the type and priority of the investment 
mugabe also pledged less state interference in business affairs 
and set up a onestop center to approve investment applications 
within a maximum of 90 days he also proposed lifting most price 
controls scrapping fixed wages in favor of collective bargaining 
and liberalizing labor laws 
in the past an employer had to have labor department approval to 
fire any worker and most such applications were turned down 
we are not neocolonialists looking for vast hard currency 
returns said one western investment expert speaking on condition 
of anonymity 
what we want is a strong economy we can do business with 
zimbabwe has not made the quantum leap but theyve made a start

the birds are dead or gone maria san 
martin says she would like to have wings and fly away too 
but she hasnt the money to leave its a plight shared by 
thousands in this and other villages beneath southern chiles 
9400foot lonquimay volcano which rumbles and spits ash and toxic 
gases since erupting christmas day 
lonquimay a village of 3800 people 21 miles from the volcano 
is surrounded by mountains that block the winds that could bring 
fresh air in and blow the ash and gases out 
according to a special government census 10472 people in 
lonquimay and several indian reservations of the mapuche tribe are 
being affected doctors say most are suffering irreversible damage 
to the central nervous system 
a strong disagreeable sulfurous odor pervades the area ash 
lodges in peoples teeth their eyes itch and breathing becomes 
difficult 
without birds the dominating sound is the volcanos crackle and 
roar especially at night 
lonquimay is dead said mrs san martin 43 the mother of 
four 
a team of 20 scientists sent recently by the governments 
national science commission found that the air contained 
potentially toxic levels of particles including silicon iron 
calcium and aluminum fluoric sulfuric and chloric gases also were 
found and the poisons were detected in the drinking water 
according to local doctors residents complain of headaches 
stomach and back pains itching of the eye and throat 
i feel terrible i cant eat and i feel totally 
incapacitated nuria quintana 63 said the government should 
take us all out of here 
doctors in the area agree that evacuation is a urgently needed 
but the government in santiago 375 to the northwest has so far 
refused 
the subsecretary for regional development gen patricio serre 
maintained that the symptoms were psychosomatic 
people are living a psychosis because of something they think 
might happen he said during a recent visit air in lonquimay is 
pure and fresh probably even better than in santiago 
santiago has a high level of smog 
serre said the government has allocated the equivalent of 
280000 to help residents especially those who have lost cattle to 
the volcano but he added that the area would not be declared a 
catastrophe zone which would make more money available 
about 15 percent of lonquimays residents who had the money to go 
elsewhere have left many others who must stay including soldiers 
and police assigned to the area have sent their children away 
a confidential report by the chief regional government health 
official a copy of which was obtained by the associated press 
seems to contradict serres assessment the report which recommends 
evacuation says human and animal life in the area is seriously 
threatened and the enviromental damage is grave 
trees and plants died first followed by the birds and other 
animals a man and an infant died recently but government doctors 
say theres no evidence they were the victims of the volcano 
many residents wear governmentissued face masks of cotton gauze 
although experts said months ago they were ineffective only some 
rich cattlemen the military and police have masks with proper 
filters 
animals are dying by the hundreds in the area where most people 
make their living raising a few head of cattle on small ranches 
hens and ducks have died by the thousands 
emaciated oxen and cattle were seen in the villages some could 
not stand 
the towns veterinarian carlos ducom said heavy concentrations 
of fluorine are often found in dead animals the fluorine damages 
bones and causes paralysis he said and some dead cattle had as 
much as 3 pounds of ash in their stomachs 
erasmo rivero a father of five said he wanted to sell his 
animals but they were too sick 
without healthy oxen people havent been able to gather firewood 
as the the snow and cold of the southern hemisphere winter begin to 
arrive

loaning 450000 in money and supplies 
or did he 
every generation or so somewhere in the country someone 
claiming ancestry to jacob de haven insists he did and seeks 
repayment whether interrupted by civil war or failure of congress 
to act the efforts have been fruitless 
in us claims court in houston an attorney fresh out of law 
school is awaiting the governments response to the latest request 
the lawsuit filed in march on behalf of some 50000 de haven 
descendants asks for 450000 plus 6 percent interest compounded 
annually since at least jan 1 1778 
put away your calculator thats a whopping 983 billion 
this is the first attempt to go through the federal courts 
instead of congress which was dunned in the 1850s 70s 90s and 
early in this century a repayment resolution was introduced but 
tabled in the house in 1966 
jo beth kloecker who took the case about two months after 
hanging a shingle outside her first office in stafford texas 
expects the governments response to the suit due in may 
sometime this month 
the claim is not without legal obstacles 
the sixyear statute of limitations expired about 205 years ago 
the suit seeks repayment from a united states that didnt exist when 
the money was lent and a receipt bearing a red seal of the 
government has been missing for years 
in addition theres no record of a wealthy jacob de haven whose 
family owned much of upper merion township now suburban 
philadelphia 
according to tax records for 17691812 the areas only jacob de 
haven lived in nearby whitpain township owned an acre of land in 
1791 and worked as a laborer said judith meier of the historical 
society of montgomery county 
theres no proof of a jacob de haven who lived in that time or 
died who could have loaned 450000 said mrs meier whose 
curiosity was piqued by the familys claim it looks like its out 
there hanging on an imaginary nail 
a family history describes the de havens as the wealthy owners of 
a tract stretching about 10 miles from norristown to philadelphia 
mrs meier says the history is a fairy tale and the relatives of the 
jacob de haven she found were all farmers weavers masons tanners 
and other tradesmen 
the family history also puts de havens grave in the cemetery of 
christ old swedes church now in the shadow of an elevated stretch 
of interstate 76 the rev john miller jr vicar of the episcopal 
church said records dont show a jacob de haven and most of the 
marble markers have been worn bare 
kloecker however thinks shes got a case 
i know what youre talking about she said of the lack of 
records adding that she has some unrecorded deeds showing jacob de 
haven existed as in the legend weve got some evidence i cant 
comment on what weve got 
beyond deeds and tax records the one piece of evidence that 
would prove a loan was made a receipt has been gone for 
generations said carl dehaven a descendant of jacobs brother 
samuel dehaven a retired police officer who lives in gulph mills 
said it was probably kept in a family bible now lost 
kloeckers client thelma weasenforth lunaas is decended from 
william de haven another brother of jacobs kloecker is asking the 
court to declare all the descendants of jacob and his nine brothers 
and sisters part of the class 
they just want his ancestry recognized for his contributions 
she said 
dehaven doubts any of the relatives will see any money 
nothings ever been done over the years and i dont think anything 
will be done this time 
he would be happy with a monument at valley forge national 
historical park commemorating the de havens and other families who 
gave to the cause 
in that legendary winter of 177778 washingtons troops were 
encamped at valley forge about 25 miles from britishoccupied 
philadelphia about 3000 of the 11000 troops living in crude log 
cabins died the continental congress couldnt appropriate any more 
money to send food so the call went out for citizens to lend the 
army money and food 
jacob de haven and many others responded his descendants say 
most were repaid after the revolution in continental dollars jacob 
refused to accept the unstable scrip which kloecker describes as 
not worth a flip

seven newborns lie sleeping swaddled in pink 
and blue blankets and tucked into bassinets in a hospital nursery 
six were born to mothers addicted to crack cocaine and then 
abandoned 
in the same pale yellow room with green curtains a 6monthold 
girl smiles and gurgles in a swing near two children in playpens 
they too are boarder babies whose addicted mothers abandoned 
them 
hospital officials say boarder babies like these at howard 
university hospital are taking up space that could be used for 
treating sick children 
sometimes theres not a vacant bed in neonatal intensive care 
between richmond and philadelphia says hospital director dr 
haynes rice 
see that he says pointing to the baby in the swing right 
next to the infants you shouldnt have them with newborns but 
what can we do 
the material cost for dealing with these children is high from 
750 a day to 1768 the physical and psychological price is 
immeasurable 
statistics gathered by the house select committee on children 
youth and families suggest that 375000 newborns a year may be 
harmed by drug exposure and that last year 11 percent of pregnant 
women used drugs 
although hospital officials say the number of boarder babies is 
growing the problem is so recent that nationwide statistics arent 
available theres not even a standard definition although rice 
defines boarder babies as infants who are ready for discharge but 
have not had a parental visit for 30 days 
a recent visit to the howard hospital found 21 of the abandoned 
children they appeared healthy although some had been born 
drugaddicted 
healthy is a word id be careful about using with these 
children rice says theyre not sick but some of them will 
have problems later on were told these babies will have problems 
for the rest of their lives 
two of the recent infants tested hiv positive meaning they carry 
the virus believed to cause aids 
in the typical case a multiple drug user gives birth stays for 
three days and goes leaving behind what rice calls these little 
ittybitty ones 
they just leave and you never know if they plan to abandon the 
baby 
the sign on the nursery door says daily visiting hours 
restricted between 10 am and 12 noon but the only visitors many 
of the infants have are the busy nurses who tend to them when they 
can 
on another floor an 11monthold boy the oldest boarder baby at 
the hospital sits in a carriage eating ice cream in a pediatrics 
ward covered with wallpaper of clowns and raggedy anns the nurses 
call him by his name terrail but to hospital officials he is 
baby 3 a sick child wails in the background 
terrail is not ill but already is developmentally handicapped by 
a life spent entirely in the hospital the shortage of staff means 
he cant crawl and play as youngsters his age normally would and 
the nurses say he hasnt taken any steps toward walking 
its wrong for a baby to be in a hospital for a year and not 
sick rice says 
hospitals must swallow the cost of caring for the boarder babies 
an expense that eventually is passed along to the public through 
higher fees and insurance premiums meanwhile hospitals appeal to 
the welfare bureacracy to find homes for the children 
nationally boarder babies fates varies by circumstance and 
jurisdiction after 11 months terrail has not been placed for 
adoption or foster care 
after 30 days the howard hospital notifies the district of 
columbia department of human services about the abandoned children 
but the babies wait as forms are filled and papers are processed 
out of desperation rice joined with the department to place ads 
in local newspapers asking people to please open your home and 
heart and adopt or take in one of the children in the first three 
days the department received 30 inquiries 
but ad responses alone are unlikely to keep pace 
in california for example the foster child population increased 
by 28 percent from 49978 in december 1986 to 64900 in december 
1988 
and as many as 60 percent of drugexposed infants end up in the 
foster care system says neal halfon of the childrens hospital in 
oakland 
the dramatic increase in crack cocaine use is mirrored by 
increases in the number of foster children he said an already 
bad situation is becoming disastrous

mongolian cashmere sweaters hang from 
bloomingdales racks and general electric still hopes to sell china 
its locomotives but the 14 billion trade relationship between the 
united states and the peoples republic has been damaged after years 
of patient nurturing 
following the tiananmen square massacre and subsequent string of 
executions experts point to pockets of vulnerability among us 
companies working with china as well as a decline in chinese imports 
it wont be because americans dont want to buy but delivery 
and reliability will be perceived widely as going down and that 
will affect orders irrespective of whether its true said david 
m lampton president of the national committee on united 
stateschina relations 
china had replaced other pacific rim nations as a lowcost 
producer of everything from clothing to luggage to tents while 
steadily improving productivity and quality as workers became more 
motivated 
as chinese workers and managers become more fearful of 
associating with foreigners lampton said the problem is going to 
be whether the work force will continue to be as productive 
communications are snarled we dont know if longshoremen will 
load ships on time and american importers just may not want to 
deal with those uncertainties he noted 
without chinese imports americans would pay more for nike 
running shoes silk blouses and painted porcelain bowls 
experts say toy and game importers already stocking up for 
christmas are scrambling to line up suppliers in other lowcost 
nations such as thailand and mexico last year china exported 117 
billion worth of toys and games to the united states 
on the flip side midwest farmers would take a beating if their 
exports were curtailed last year they shipped to china about 700 
million in wheat the largest us export to the peoples republic 
according to the commerce department 
computer makers could lose a 150 millionplus outlet for their 
goods 
military suppliers already are bearing the brunt of a 
presidential decree prohibiting further sales to china grumman 
corp said earlier this month it would eliminate 250 jobs associated 
with a 500 million us air force contract to develop and modernize 
a weapons control system for chinese fighters 
us companies that sell products like powergenerating equipment 
to the chinese goverment could face trouble because china is going 
to have a foreign exchange shortage said roger sullivan 
president of the uschina business council 
theyve taken a big hit on their balance of payments they 
cant buy what they thought they would buy and theyre going to 
have to cut imports he said 
roughly 80 percent of us companies investment in china lies in 
industries that manufacture goods for the domestic market sullivan 
said plans for expanding those operations are evaporating rapidly 
but most us businesses are not likely to suffer substantially 
while they have committed 34 billion to joint ventures in china 
each firms individual exposure is limited 
general electric co for example sold 500 million of 
locomotives aircraft engines and medical systems to china in the 
last five years but the number pales in comparison with ges annual 
revenue of 50 billion 
and ball corp a 11 billionayear container maker in muncie 
ind has spent just 2 million since 1987 on its joint venture in 
china 
from our perspective its a very small percentage of sales 
said ball spokesman brad wilks 
still companies do not want to mothball their china operations 
its clearly not because of the money sullivan said its the 
effort theyve spent five or six years building relationships 
for businesses the attraction is formidable china looms as the 
worlds fastest growing economy with a gross national product 
expanding at more than 10 percent a year 
as a market for consumer goods china is virtually untapped the 
nations 11 billion population is a solid reason companies are 
reluctant to just bag it you cant just write off 25 percent of the 
globe one china watcher said 
while most us companies are taking a waitandsee approach a 
few have found opportunity in the crisis jack shamash president of 
the new yorkbased trading company shamash amp sons inc said he has 
been snapping up chinesemade products ranging from silks to nails 
now that shamashs competitors are skittish about buying prices 
of chinesemade goods are lower and the goods are more abundant 
the us embassy in beijing said some american staff of the 175 
us companies operating out of the chinese capital are returning 
despite a travel advisory and the embassys counsel against it 
the chinese government is pulling out all the stops to lure 
businessmen back even as it simultaneously wages a media campaign 
against the us government for alleged interference 
american companies are being bombarded with longsought 
concessions from the chinese government and atypical promises of 
prompt payment 
governmentowned noble tower a modern beijing building that 
houses foreign companies sent faxes to every tenant asking them 
to come back and that everything is peaceful said one american 
tenant 
but businesses are wary that they may become pawns in chinas 
powerful propaganda game 
we dont want to be in a position where were manipulated and 
paraded in front of cameramen said ball corps wilks

its an unlikely opening for a superpower 
summit conference the president of the united states calling the 
leader of the soviet union to say hey lets get together 
president bush says maybe thats the way hell arrange to meet 
with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev when the time comes hes 
not saying when that time will be although he often is asked 
when there is a bushgorbachev summit arrangements wont be 
quite that casual despite the presidents breezy suggestion but 
his latest observations on summit prospects underscore that such 
meetings usually are longer on drama than on diplomatic results 
what bushs cautious course toward moscow lacks in excitement it 
may make up in continuity the president says hes comfortable with 
the state of ussoviet relations and feels they are on the right 
wavelength 
he took his time getting there despite unilateral troop and 
weapons cuts gorbachev announced last winter and spring scoring 
public relations points in the process bush ordered a strategic 
review and stuck to his methodical pace despite complaints in 
congress he announced his proposal for swift drastic cuts in us 
and soviet forces in europe at nato on may 29 
bush said hed never felt pressured i said when i first came 
in we were going to take our time and we were going to study and 
were going to think it out and we did exactly that 
he seems to be handling summit talk the same way 
there will obviously at some point be a meeting he said 
tuesday but i still feel id like the meeting to be seen as 
productive rather than just the meeting itself 
i feel comfortable about the wavelength were on with the 
soviet union now 
bush said he thinks the soviets feel the same way knowing that 
the united states wants to move forward on strategic arms reduction 
talks and on negotiations for conventional force cuts 
he said that while a summit has to be seen as productive that 
doesnt necessarily mean signing an agreement as evidence of 
progress i would like to think that the criterion the governing 
criterion would be so that the world would see the meeting as 
having been successful something good happening out of it 
ive been around this track long enough to know that you 
can always whip out something to sign a fishing agreement or 
something of that nature 
gorbachev and president reagan did sign fishing and maritime 
agreements at their moscow summit in 1988 their major arms treaty 
eliminating intermediate range nuclear missiles was signed at a 
washington summit in 1987 
they met five times all during reagans second term the 
president who once called the soviet union an evil empire spoke at 
the end of his terms about a satisfying new closeness in relations 
with moscow 
no such mood swing is likely in the new administration while 
bush thinks relations are headed in the right general direction he 
still is guided by a certain sense of caution citing the 
tremendous differences that remain with the soviet union 
i must admit that i would not have predicted after first taking 
office that some day i would be waxing nostalgic about my meetings 
with soviet leaders reagan said before his final summit in new 
york with bush on hand as presidentelect but here we are for 
the fifth time mr gorbachev and i together in the hope of 
furthering peace 
bush said he wont insist that there be a major treaty of some 
sort before i would sit down with mr gorbachev 
maybe well do it like this say hey lets get together 
and im interested in what he thinks about it 
but its clear that there is no hurry and there is no high 
expectation theres a ration of realism in that ussoviet summit 
meetings usually have been significant because they were held rather 
than for any specific results

the national education association a favorite 
conservative target during the 1980s convenes on sunday to choose a 
new leader and determine its course for the coming decade 
it will be up to 8500 delegates to decide whether the huge 
teachers union continues its recent movement into the mainstream of 
education reform efforts or harks back to the hardline stands that 
prompted repeated broadsides from president reagan and former 
education secretary william bennett 
the 2 millionmember union the countrys largest is a potent 
political force with a formidable washington presence and the 
ability to organize in nearly every nook and cranny of the nation 
reagan and bennett constantly described it as an obstacle to better 
education 
nea president mary futrell steps down this summer after six 
tumultuous years during which she weathered the conservative 
attacks led the nea into the reform movement and won overwhelming 
affection from her troops 
on monday delegates will choose between two candidates to 
succeed her keith geiger an inside player and experienced 
negotiator who as vice president has helped improve the nea image 
and john wilson a selfdescribed activist who promises never to 
compromise for the sake of a good editorial 
the outcome of the geigerwilson race will be one indication of 
where the teachers want their union to go another clue will come 
from the position the delegates take on public school choice the 
current rage among reformers and the primary education cause 
advanced by president bush 
choice plans allow parents to pick the schools their children 
attend some operate within school districts but some let families 
choose any school in the state in minnesota for instance state 
money follows the students to any new district they choose but they 
have to provide their own transportation 
futrell predicts that choice will be the most hotly debated 
topic at the meeting three proposed resolutions on the subject 
reflect nea attitudes ranging from militant opposition to serious 
misgivings 
the hardliners led by wilson supporters in california propose 
that the nea help state affiliates oppose choice plans and develop a 
national strategy to fight the concepts spread without a national 
effort against choice the california affiliate said state and 
local agencies will foster educational discrimination and weaken 
national commitment to public education 
at the other end is a more imageconscious resolution proposed by 
the nea board of directors it says the nea continues to support 
alternative programs in public schools for specific purposes 
deliberately leaving a loophole it adds that the nea opposes 
federal state or locally mandated choice plans that compromise the 
associations commitment to free equitable universal and quality 
public education for every student 
the boards proposal is a revision of the third alternative a 
resolution on the original nea conference agenda with changes its 
sponsor said make it more positive and less restrictive 
futrell at a news conference last week said the nea has always 
supported magnet schools alternative schools alternative curricula 
and other options 
the board resolution basically says we do support some forms of 
choice but we have to be very careful as we look at this new form of 
choice to make sure the broader programs do not further segregate 
schools along racial and economic lines she said 
futrell described the california approach as very rigid we 
are hoping they will go with the more moderate position she said 
of the delegates 
she hasnt said as much but futrell apparently hopes they will 
go with geiger as well she has tried to steer the union to greater 
flexibility on issues ranging from merit pay to teacher 
certification restore professional concerns to the nea agenda and 
generally ply a moderate course that is reflected in her vice 
presidents campaign literature and rhetoric 
futrell said last week she wouldnt make an endorsement unless 
the race wasnt going the way she wanted it to go so far she said 
it was going her way 
geiger is reporting endorsements from at least 46 state and local 
boards of directors or delegate assemblies including large states 
such as florida pennsylvania and his home state of michigan he has 
spent the last few years traveling to teacher events large and 
small in the process winning friends all over the country 
by contrast wilson of raleigh nc has won support from a 
majority of his colleagues on the executive committee and majorities 
on the budgetary committee and the board of directors 
but neither mans highpowered endorsements may count for much 
monday when the delegates will file statebystate into a special 
room at the washington convention center to cast their secret 
presidential ballots

twelve years three planets and 44 
billion miles after leaving earth voyager 2 is converging on 
neptune a swirling bluegreen planet with a backward moon for the 
last stop on an extraordinary tour 
the solar system is our neighborhood and were getting to the 
end of the neighborhood said norm haynes voyager project manager 
at the national aeronautics and space admnistrations jet propulsion 
laboratory 
voyager 2 already has detected a dark spot on nep 
a giant storm like jupiters great red spot as it nears the planet 
the probe will search for undiscovered moons and partial rings and 
at 9 pm pdt on aug 24 voyager will swoop within 3000 miles oftune 
that may be 
neptunes north pole cloudtops the closest of its close encounters 
and the first spacecraft to visit the planet 
it will be 275 billion miles from earth after traveling 443 
billion miles along its curving path the information it sends back 
at the speed of light will take four hours and six minutes to arrive 
five hours after the closest encounter voyager will fly within 
25000 miles of the backwardsorbiting moon triton the other known 
moon is nereid 
lion through the neptune 
encounter the voyagers returned more new knowledge about the 
outer planets than existed in all of the preceding history of 
astronomy according to nasa 
neptune discovered in 1846 is 30700 miles in diameter six 
times earths size and the fourth largest planet after jupiter 
saturn and uranus a neptunian year lasts 165 earth years and a day 
lasts 17 to 18 earth hours a detail voyager may pinpoint neptune 
usually is the eighth planet but because of plutos elongated orbit 
neptune will be the ninth and outermost until 2007 
scientists expect voyager to discover at least 10 small moons 
said deputy project scientist ellis miner 
some moons may confine or shepherd the 5 to 12milewide 
incomplete rings called ring arcs orbiting neptune said 
physicist ed stone nasas voyager project scientist and a vice 
president at california institute of technology 
voyager also may discover dust bands and 50 to 100 partial rings 
in addition to the three to six arcs scientists believe they 
detected from earth stone added the partial rings possibly made 
of dust and pebbles most likely are debris from the collision of a 
comet and an ancient moon he said 
voyager should be some 33400 miles above neptunes clouds when 
it crosses the ring region so it is unlikely to be destroyed by an 
unseen arc he said 
the probe also will study neptunes weather scientists believe 
the 6200milewide dark spot it found probably is similar to 
earths hurricanes or jupiters great red spot the source of the 
internal heat driving neptunes storms is a mystery earths comes 
decaying radioactive material in rocks 
neptune is pale bluegreen because methane or natural gas in 
its mostly hydrogenhelium atmosphere absorbs red light scientists 
suspect that a third of the way toward the planets center the 
atmosphere becomes a superhot slurry of hot water and rock so 
neptune like neighboring uranus probably lacks a distinct 
skysea boundary stone said 
despite any internal heat neptune receives 900 times less 
sunlight than earth so the temperature at the top of its atmosphere 
is 350 degrees below zero fahrenheit about the same as on triton 
stone said 
scientists believe triton 1400 to 2240 miles wide roughly 
the size of earths moon will be the most fascinating part of 
voyagers flyby 
when a planet and its moons form from a spinning disk of gas and 
solid material the moons should orbit in the direction the planet 
rotates tritons reverse orbit suggests it once orbited the sun 
like a comet or a planet but collided with a moon to form a new 
backwardsmoving satellite stone said 
triton probably is cold and geologically inactive with an icy 
mantle over a rocky core but it once may have had a molten interior 
that created ridges valleys cliffs canyons and volcanoes that 
voyager might photograph 
observations from earth indicate tritons atmosphere contains 
methane and nitrogen sunlight likely converts methane into complex 
hydrocarbons creating a transparent reddishorange photochemical 
haze stone said the hydrocarbons may form heavier particles 
coating the surface with frozen sludge 
could the organic chemicals have allowed life to develop on 
triton 
the temperature is very very cold so i think its unlikely 
he said 
scientists believe triton has extreme seasons because its orbit 
around neptune is highly inclined one pole faces the sun for 82 
years and the other remains in darkness this may mean tritons 
atmosphere gets thinner and thicker as methanenitrogen icecaps 
cover one pole then the other 
researchers discarded the theory that triton has liquid nitrogen 
oceans but puddles or lakes are possible along with fields of 
nitrogen ice crystals stone said 
nereid about 190 to 620 miles wide has a very elongated 
elliptical orbit caltech astrophysicist peter goldreich speculates 
nereid once had a circular orbit that was disturbed by gravity from 
triton or a large passing object 
if voyager confirms that neptune has a magnetic field the planet 
also may have an aurora like earths and a mysterious ultraviolet 
electroglow a magnetic field should trap a radiation belt 
around neptune similar to earths van allen belts jupiters 
radiation belts damaged some of voyagers equipment haynes doubts 
similar problems at neptune 
voyager 2 has worked 12 years with only relatively minor 
failures although it contains electronics equal to 10000 
television sets he said 
commands sent to voyager and photos and information it sends to 
earth travel at the speed of light but the oneway trip still take 
four hours six minutes nasa is using 38 dishshaped radio antennas 
in new mexico california australia spain and japan to capture the 
radio signal which is like trying to see a 20watt light bulb 
burning 275 billion miles away 
both voyagers are expected to return valuable data well into 
the 21st century before their power supplies run out in about 
2020 nasa said 
after neptune voyager 2 will join voyager 1 and pioneers 10 and 
11 in seeking the true edge of the solar system where solar wind 
gives way to interstellar wind billions of miles beyond the planets

imagine a 20watt 
refrigerator light bulb burning in the dark 275 billion miles away 
now imagine the sophisticated eyes needed to see the light 
voyager 2 heading for neptune is emitting 20 watts of radio 
signals information coded in binary bits ones and zeros on the 
space probes health and from its scientific instruments and cameras 
think of that lightbulb as flickering and that flickering 
contains the information that voyager is sending back to us said 
bill brundage voyager preparation manager for the very large array 
radio telescope 
the signals have become fainter since voyagers encounters with 
jupiter in 1979 saturn in 1981 and uranus in 1986 the signals and 
commands sent to the 12yearold probe take four hours and six 
minutes to cross 275 billion miles at the speed of light larger 
antennas and more sensitive receivers are needed on earth to receive 
the signals and more power is needed to transmit commands to the 
craft which will pass fly within 3000 miles of neptune on aug 24 
the national aeronautics and space administrations deep space 
network is used to talk to voyager the dsn has three complexes 
goldstone in californias mojave desert madrid spain and 
tidbinbilla australia near canberra 
when voyager flew by uranus the california and australian 
listening posts used three antenna dishes each one 210 feet across 
and two 112 feet and the madrid station used one of each said 
mary beth murrill a spokeswoman for the nasa jet propulsion 
laboratory in pasadena calif the canberra complex also was linked 
to australias 210foot parkes radio astronomy telescope 
for neptune the 210foot dishes at goldstone canberra and 
madrid have been increased to 230 feet and another 112foot antenna 
was built at madrid in addition the vla is being used in 
conjunction with goldstone parkes again is linked with canberra 
and a japanese telescope will be added to the network 
the different sites ensure that at least one station can 
communicate with the spacecraft despite the earths rotation 
brundage said 
the vla alone gives us almost a third more images than if we 
didnt have it said norm haynes voyager project manager at jpl 
the vla is a oneofakind spaceage erector set sitting on an 
ancient lake bed the site is skirted by four mountain ranges 
protecting it from much of the electronic interference from 
television radios aircraft and the like 
it consists of 27 white dishshaped antennas each 82 feet in 
diameter 92 feet high and weighing 235 tons the dishes sit on the 
plains of san augustin amid tumbleweed cattle and sparse vegetation 
at an altitude of 7000 feet 
the dishes are arranged along three arms of railroad track laid 
out in the shape of a y two arms are 13 miles long and the third is 
118 miles the earth rotates the y like a turntable creating 
images that have the same detail as if using a radio telescope up to 
26 miles in diameter 
a special 36wheel transporter moves each antenna to one of 72 
observation stations along the three arms this acts like a zoom 
lens the farther out the dishes the higher the resolution the 
closer in the larger the field of view 
nasa spent 65 million to equip each dish to receive voyagers 
signals it also set up special techniques and installed two big 
diesel generators to guard against lightningcaused power 
fluctuations during the thunderstorm season 
the separation of the listening posts around the world just 
like the separation of the vla dishes strengthen the sensitivity 
of the network the signal vla gets from voyager is sent via 
satellite to goldstone where the two signals are combined decoded 
and sent via microwave to jpl in pasadena

bacteria to fight some forms of bladder cancer which kills 10000 
americans a year 
the american urological association is urging the fda to speed up 
the approval process for the use of bacillus calmetteguerin fda 
spokesman mike shaffer declined to discuss details of the review 
but said it was pretty far along and that approval could come in 
as little as a year 
it isnt so much a matter of safety because its already being 
used for something shaffer said its a question of 
effectiveness 
doctors have known since the 1880s that severe bacterial 
infections can shrink some tumors by stimulating the immune system 
some doctors actually treated patients with bacterial infections 
before the advent of chemotherapy and radiation therapy said dr 
donald lamm chairman of the urology department at the west virginia 
university medical center 
chemicals and radiation replaced bacteria therapy in the 1950s 
but research on bcg which has been used as a tb vaccine since 1921 
continued because of its powerful effect on the bodys immune system 
lamm said his research and studies by memorial sloankettering 
cancer center in new york have indicated that bcg is cheaper than 
surgery and more effective than chemotherapy against early cases of 
superficial bladder cancer 
my frustration and the frustration of doctors caring for 
patients with bladder cancer is that the fda has failed to approve 
bcg for use in treating the disease said lamm who heads a 
urological association committee that is urging the fda to speed up 
its approval process for bcg 
research indicates that bcg reduces the recurrence of bladder 
cancer nearly twice as effectively as traditional chemotherapy and 
dramatically decreases the mortality rate of bladder cancer 
patients he said 
doctors can treat bladder cancer patients with bcg only with 
federal approval and must warn patients that it is an experimental 
treatment whose effectiveness and safety cannot be guaranteed lamm 
said they can receive the vaccine but their insurance companies 
and medicare wont pay for it 
a typical sixweek treatment costs about 435 for the vaccine 
comparable chemotherapy costs would run from about 1000 to 2500 
he said 
bcg has been used as an experimental cancer treatment for 20 
years and its been given to billions of people as a tb vaccine with 
just a handful of deaths said dr michael groves head of the 
pharmaceutical department at the university of illinois at chicago 
institute of tuberculosis research 
the chicago college was the only producer of thestrain of bcg 
used in the united states until 1987 when it transferred production 
to bionetics research inc of rockville md which is concentrating 
on its use against cancer 
bcg works best on the earliest stages of bladder cancer before 
the malignant cells have had a chance to spread to the deeper layers 
of tissue to muscle that make up the balloonshaped organ lamm said 
bladder cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the united 
states it kills about 10000 americans annually typically male 
smokers over age 50 and more than 47000 new cases are expected to 
be diagnosed this year the most common warning signs are blood in 
the urine and frequency of urination

when two explorers first set foot on 
the moon two decades ago they found a lifeless world baked by day 
and frozen by night in temperatures ranging from 230 degrees below 
zero to 270 degreees above 
they found no wind no storms no clouds no water no magnetic 
field the thinnest of atmospheres and gravity onesixth the 
strength of earths 
it has a stark beauty all its own said neil armstrong buzz 
aldrin described it as magnificent desolation 
armstrong aldrin and 10 other americans who followed them to the 
moon in the next 3 years returned with 842 pounds of rocks and 
soil they left behind sensors that sent data on moonquakes 
meteors radiation and the solar wind 
slowly almost grudgingly this trove is yielding secrets about 
the moon and its place in the solar system 
a picture is emerging of a birth in searing heat a brief 
violent life of boiling lava and shattering collision and 
geological death 3 billion years ago when volcanic activity ceased 
the moons surface has remained essentially unchanged since except 
by impact from an occasional meteorite and almost imperceptible 
dustings from solar and cosmic radiation 
this stability means much of the history of the solar system 
during those 3 billion years can be read by studying lunar rocks 
but the revelations go back even further because samples dating to 
more than 4 billion years and fragments at 46 billion back to the 
begining have been found in the apollo samples 
most experts agree the solar system was born 46 billion years 
ago when great masses of gaseous matter called the solar nebula 
began condensing to form the sun and planets the nebula condensed 
into debris ranging from pebbles to mileswide boulders that 
collided and fused to create celestial bodies 
scientists believe the young earth underwent the same period of 
meteor bombardment and volcanism that the moon did for half a 
billion years the weak lunar gravity couldnt keep volcanic gases 
from escaping into space but earth with its stronger gravity held 
on to its volcanic vapors and they helped form an atmosphere and 
oceans creating conditions for the development of life 
because erosion tides and weather have scoured earths surface 
the oldest rocks found date back only 37 billion years the older 
lunar rocks therefore are helping scientists piece together 
earths formative years 
however less than 20 percent of the samples have been studied 
the rest are in airtight nitrogenfilled stainless steel cabinets 
locked in vaults at the johnson space center and at brooks air force 
base in san antonio texas 
john w dietrich deputy chief of the national aeronautics and 
space administrations planetary science branch and curator of the 
material said the samples will stay there until better analytical 
techniques are found 
the rocks have not revealed exactly how the moon originated but 
they have eliminated some old theories and raised a new one 
before apollo there were three theories about the origin that it 
formed near earth as a distinct body that it was once a piece of 
the earth and that it formed elsewhere in the solar system and was 
captured by earths gravity 
we have determined that all three of them are impossible the 
theory best accepted at the moment is a hybrid between two of 
those dietrich said 
the new theory is that the moon resulted from cataclysm when 
earth and the other wouldbe planets were still partly molten a body 
perhaps the size of mars which has onetenth the mass of earth 
collided with our planet 
the highspeed impact caused a giant explosion and the outer 
layers of the intruder disintegrated at least partially vaporizing 
the rocky material that and vaporized chunks from earths outer 
layer were ejected with some of the material flying high and fast 
enough to orbit earth forming a ring 
the vapors cooled and condensed into solid particles which 
coalesced over a few hundred or a few thousand years into the 
primitive moon 
that would explain why the moon has so many of the same 
chemical properties as the earth but in different proportions 
dietrich said it also would explain the low metallics on the 
moon the deficiencies in iron and the loss of a lot of 
volatile components that would have been vaporized and lost in the 
collision

some pine forests react to pollution while 
others dont and researchers hope by december to have some idea why 
university of georgia and emory university researchers are 
wrapping up a threeyear study costing 800000 to 1 million on 
the effects of acid rain and other pollutants on pine forests 
the researchers are particularly concerned about the loblolly 
pine one of the mainstays of georgias timber industry the number 
of loblolly pines in the region has decreased though the drop may 
have resulted from drought changing land use patterns or normal 
variation said forest hydrologist john dowd 
the study is looking at material deposited by rain and 
particulate matter in the air as well as ozone dowd said the 
ozone is a photochemical oxidant not emitted by a source its 
produced by the atmosphere its quite high in this nonurban area 
the air here is cleaner than that in the northeast but its dirtier 
than that in the west the air here is intermediate 
researchers also are trying to determine whether acid rain pulls 
nutrients from the soil said biologist larry ragsdale of emory

market by selling dollars which aided the currency in staying 
lower the intervention could not be confirmed through commercial 
banks and the central bank does not comment on its monetary 
activities 
minori takeuchi trader with chemical bank said thursdays 
fluctuation was mainly due to by foreign investors position 
adjustments 
tokyo investors avoided making major moves she said and 
very few people wanted to buy the yen because of mr unos geisha

the value of newly started construction contracts fell to an

april the fw dodge group of mcgrawhill information services co 
said wednesday 
despite last months slight decline the group said the 
construction outlook in the second quarter and for the rest of the 
year looked promising due to a downturn in interest rates 
lower interest rates in the rest of the year will help sustain 
the current rebound and were upgrading our 1989 outlook for 
construction said george a christie fw dodges chief

billion dodge said 
industrial construction which set the pace for nonresidential 
work in may with a 40 percent increase included a 300 million 
expansion of a petrochemical complex near houston 
residential building meanwhile slipped 9 percent in may to an 
annualized 1153 billion largely due to previously higher interest

the advertising agency that created fibbing car 
pitchman joe isuzu is charging that business week lied or rather 
lied in its june 12 issue about american isuzu motors incs 
car sales 
the quotation marks are important because the wall street journal 
had refused to run an advertisement about the accusation until the 
agency put quotation marks around the word lied 
the fullpage 82000 ad is scheduled to appear in thursdays 
editions of the journal according to jerry della femina chairman 
of della femina mcnamee wcrs inc the agency that created the joe 
isuzu character 
in an article about the auto industry business week accurately 
reported in a onesentence mention of isuzu that the companys car 
sales fell 38 percent last year but it failed to note that isuzus 
sales of trucks and other vehicles which account for 80 percent of 
its business rose 4 percent 
the magazine said the joe isuzu character hasnt created a 
positive image for isuzu the character smiles as he spouts 
exaggerations or untruths about the vehicles while captions point 
out hes lying 
business week ran the agencys letter to the editor criticizing 
the article but the magazine turned down della feminas ad the 
reason being we did not lie and the ad says we lied its not a 
logical ad as far as were concerned spokeswoman mary mcgeachy 
said wednesday 
theyre angry and they want to kill me but the fact is they 
managed to screw up a very successful character and make it seem 
like it wasnt doing well when it really is della femina said in 
an interview wednesday 
della femina said his agency rather than the automaker was 
paying the full cost of the wall street journal ad he said it may 
run in other publications as well he said he was pleased with the 
addition of the quotation marks around lied 
i didnt want it to be that strident i was just so mad when i 
wrote it he said 
the wall street journal by company policy declines to comment 
on ads appearing in forthcoming editions but robert higgins the 
journals director of advertising services said wednesday i have

avon products inc says it has called off an 
agreement to sell the health care operations of its mediplex group 
partly because the buyer appeared unable to get financing for the 
deal 
the sale agreement with an acquisition group called west corner 
also was terminated because of a lawsuit filed by meditrust which 
leases properties to avons mediplex division 
meditrust a real estate investment trust that specializes in 
health care properties contends that it has the right to approve 
buyers of the mediplex holdings under terms of its property leases 
avon said wednesday it may sue meditrust for interfering in its 
sale plans 
the deal with west corner was to have closed on june 30 but it 
appeared that the acquisition group wouldnt be able to raise 
adequate financing by then avon said 
under the agreement avon was to receive 55 million in cash for 
the mediplex health care division 
mediplexs health care business includes nursing homes alcohol 
and drug abuse treatment centers and psychiatric treatment 
facilities mediplex based in wellesley mass also has a 
construction division which has about 100 million of work in 
progress once the work is finished avon intends to close the 
construction arm of mediplex 
the mediplex sale was to be an element in the cosmetics makers 
strategy to divest its holdings in the health care services field so 
it could concentrate more closely on its beauty products business 
this strategy came under intense scrutiny earlier this spring as 
avon fought off an unsolicited 21 billion takeover bid from 
another directselling company amway corp avons board rejected 
the bid and amway withdrew its offer 
avon said it still plans to sell mediplex and noted that mediplex 
has become profitable so it wont be a drain on its parent company 
the collapse of the deal with west corner wont impair avons 
financial prospects the company said earnings still are expected 
to range between 230 and 240 a share this year avon said in a 
news release

the federal commmunications commission says it 
will allow lin broadcasting corp to transfer control of the 
licenses of seven television stations to a new company lin 
television corp 
the commission ruling wednesday that the proposed transfer was a 
routine transaction that does not violate fcc rules said it would 
remain neutral as to whether or not the transfer would affect the 
65 billion hostile takeover bid mccaw cellular communications has 
made for lin 
lin announced in late may a week before mccaws tender offer 
that it would spin off its television stations the new york 
citybased lin said it would operate its cellular telephone and 
specialty publishing business as a separate company with lin 
shareholders to own stock in both lin broadcasting and lin 
television 
the decision by lin was viewed as an attempt to complicate 
mccaws takeover bid which would combine two of the nations 
largest cellular telephone companies 
mccaw through mmm holdings objected to the lin transfer at the 
fcc 
mccaw which is the nations largest cellular company with 50 
million potential customers on june 6 said it would offer 120 a 
share for the 902 percent of lin it does not already own with the 
merger the kirkland washbased mccaw would have 68 million 
potential customers 
but mccaw made its tender offer contingent on lin staying intact 
lin has lucrative cellular franchises in new york los angeles 
philadelphia dallas and houston mccaw has cellular operations in 
seattle san francisco miami denver minneapolis and portland ore 
mccaw told the fcc that approving the transfer would allow lin to 
use the spinoff as a tactical weapon which would unduly favor 
incumbent management in violation of commission policy 
mccaw also said securities and exchange commission rules require 
that lins board consider mccaws offer 
but the fcc said lins proposal was a quintessential pro forma 
transfer of control a corporate restructuring which does not result 
in a substantial change in the ownership or control of the licensed 
facilities 
we conclude that it would inappropriately thrust the fcc into 
the midst of this hostile tender offer if we were to act in a 
nonroutine manner here the fcc said in a statement signed by 
alex felker chief of the commissions mass media bureau 
the fcc said it would leave it to the sec to decide whether lins 
board of directors was properly considering mccaws tender offer

a state panel has endorsed a 500 million 
300mph magnetically levitated train that would run between the 
orlando airport and walt disney world 
the florida high speed rail transportation commission voted 
wednesday to recommend certification of the project subject to a 
list of conditions aimed at satisfying a number of concerns the 
trains builders say it will be a showcase project to demonstrate 
the technology worldwide 
this project is of major significance to florida because it 
brings in absolutely brandnew technology that may eventually be 
blended into a mass transit system for the area commission chairman 
malcolm kirschenbaum said 
the governor and his cabinet will make the final decision on the 
project after a series of public hearings 
in making a recommendation for certification the commissions 
executive director charles h smith said the project is 
financially feasible and no public subsidies are needed 
under the plan the 175mile long system would be built by 
maglev transit inc and would begin operating in 1994 
the technology involves powerful magnets that levitate the train 
a fraction of an inch above an elevated track eliminating friction 
and allowing high speeds 
magnetic levitation trains have been used experimentally in japan 
and germany for years but no commercial system is in operation 
transportation experts expect other cities in this country and 
other nations to follow orlandos lead if the technology is 
successfully demonstrated with paying customers 
the key is to get one system to operate successfully and 
people will just jump on board and they will say this is the way to 
go said jim powell a scientist at the massachusetts institute of 
technology 
maglev and other highspeed rail systems are seen as one answer 
to highway traffic congestion and crowded airports 
the interest is just picking up all over the country said 
robert casey director of the high speed rail association a 
pittsburgh trade group 
sen daniel moynihan dny a major booster of maglev trains 
intends to lobby the bush administration to allocate at least 1 
billion to help us industry develop the technology said a staff 
member 
powell who pioneered maglev research during the early 1960s 
said government funding and lack of interest halted research in this 
country in the early 1970s but west germany and japan continued 
working and are now the leaders in the field

business executives have lowered their 
expectations for thirdquarter sales and profits in line with 
economic data suggesting the economy is slowing according to a 
national survey 
most of the 1500 business executives polled believe the economy 
will slow enough to curb inflation in the julyseptember period but 
not enough to fuel a fullblown recession in the second half said 
the report released wednesday by dun amp bradstreet corp 
the latest quarterly survey of business expectations by the 
business research company was conducted may 1531 and included 
manufacturers retailers and wholesalers 
the decline in optimism was particularly strong among 
manufacturers due to the recent rise in the dollar against major 
currencies and increased foreign competition said joseph w duncan 
dun amp bradstreet economist 
nevertheless overall optimism remained at historically high 
levels he said 
the recent declines in interest rates as well as continued 
exports to europe and japan should continue to boost manufacturers 
sales duncan said 
the sales optimism index declined to 67 down seven points from 
the second quarter and off six points from the third quarter of 
1988 the survey found 
manufacturers were the least optimistic followed by wholesalers 
and retailers 
profit expectations also fell down 8 points to 61 from a 
fiveyear high of 69 in the second quarter however the outlook for 
higher profits remained slightly higher than in the first quarter of 
1989 
manufacturers and wholesalers believe prices will not rise as 
much as in the second quarter but retailers expect to see some 
gains that index posted a sevenpoint drop to 39 
business executives also expect tighter inventories fewer new 
hires and lower durable goods orders the survey showed 
the surveys indexes are calculated by subtracting the percentage 
of respondents predicting decreases from the percentage of those 
expecting increases

a union official told congress that the 
government should closely monitor an industrysponsored study and 
also undertake its own study of potential health hazards facing 
workers at semiconductor manufacturing plants 
barbara j easterling executive vice president of the 
communications workers of america said wednesday that employees at 
semiconductor factories frequently work under very dangerous 
conditions 
the carnage in the semiconductor workplace is not scored in the 
spilled blood of wage earners or visible damage to their bodies 
she said instead it is imposed on the invisible world of 
workers chromosomes and tissues through ingestion of hazardous 
substances 
the semiconductor industry association representing the 
countrys major semiconductor manufacturers is currently sponsoring 
a threeyear study in response to concern over reported high rates 
of miscarriages among pregnant workers and other potential health 
effects 
testifying before the house education and labor subcommittee on 
health and safety ms easterling said that the national institute 
for occupational safety and health should closely oversee the 
semiconductor industry association study 
in fact it would be best if the federal government initiated 
its own study of semiconductor factories utilizing government 
scientists to examine possible health hazards she said 
the communications union represents about 7000 employees of 
semiconductor manufacturers while most workers in the industry are 
not covered by union contracts 
potentially hazardous substances to which workers can be exposed 
at semiconductor plants include toxic solvents acids caustics 
metals plastics resins and asbestos workers also may be exposed 
to radiofrequency radiation lasers and ultraviolet light 
lee neal the semiconductor industry associations director of 
occupational health safety and environmental programs told the 
house panel that sia has sponsored the development and maintenance 
of the most comprehensive industrysponsored occupational injury and 
illness surveillance system in operation in the us 
he said labor department statistics show that in 1987 the rate 
of occupational injury and illness was 43 cases per 100 employees 
in the semiconductor industry as compared with an average of 119 
cases for all manufacturing sectors 
late last year neal said sia signed an agreement with the 
university of california at davis to undertake the threeyear 3 
million study to examine the health of workers at 16 semiconductor 
manufacturers

rep george miller chairman of a house 
interior subcommittee says that thousands of safety violations on 
offshore oil rigs are going unpunished 
the california democrat told reporters wednesday that the 
failure to enforce the offshore oil drilling law shows the 
scrupulous indifference of the reagan administration and its 
successor toward environmental law enforcement 
miller head of the subcommittee on water power and offshore 
energy resources said he has learned that 16000 safety violations 
were found on such rigs in the last four years but no civil 
penalties have been imposed and there has been only one criminal 
punishment 
miller said his office began investigating offshore rigs when 
word was received of a 750000 criminal penalty against texaco last 
year for failing to conduct certain safety tests on a rig off the 
california coast in 1986 through information from the interior 
departments minerals management service miller said he found that 
civil penalities stopped in 1983 
in that year a federal court acting on an appeal of a case 
involving chevron usa inc ruled that civil penalities could be 
assessed but only after the responsible party was given notice of 
the violation and a reasonable period to correct it 
miller said he has asked for information about what kind of 
followup in lieu of fines is done by the service interior 
secretary manuel lujan said in a june 2 letter to miller that the 
service is working on guidelines that would comply with the 1983 
federal court requirements 
miller said the interior department should have acted long ago to 
correct its enforcement policies and by its inaction the bush 
administration has extended the reaganwatthodel lackadaisical 
approach toward the environmental hazards of offshore oil 
drilling james g watt and donald p hodel were interior 
secretaries under president reagan 
were just getting access to information as to exactly how bad 
the previous administration was and how hard they were working to 
diminish the effectiveness of the federal government said miller

the us dollar edged down against the japanese yen 
today while the tokyo stock exchanges key index plunged 
the dollar closed at 14290 yen down 065 yen from its 14355 
yen close the previous day it opened at 14315 yen and ranged 
between 14285 yen and 14338 yen the dollar had climbed 337 yen 
in the two previous trading days 
the 225issue nikkei stock average shed 28929 points or 087 
percent closing at 3295631 the index had lost 22361 points 
wednesday 
stock dealers attributed the indexs fall to a lack of energy in 
the market amid uncertainties over the political effects of 
allegations that new prime minister sousuke uno had kept paid 
mistresses in the past 
in thin trading today volume on the first section was estimated 
at 400 million shares down from wednesdays 600 million 
kazuhiro nomura a dealer with the new japan securities co said 
most investors stayed on the sidelines due to uncertainties over 
domestic politics and fluctuations in the foreign exchange rate 
the stock market has been gradually recovering from the initial 
impact of mr unos geisha scandal but many institutional investors 
were still reluctant to buy any issues he said 
on wednesday major japanese newspapers reported that uno had 
expressed a desire to resign after less than a month in office 
over allegations concernin his woman problems uno denied any 
intention to resign 
also we cant expect much buying incentive among japanese 
market players before the major elections nomura added 
tokyo citizens vote sunday for their municipal council and 
elections for japans upper house of parliament are scheduled july 
23 
in currency dealings traders said the dollars fall resulted 
from selling for profittaking 
although japanese market players had little incentive to buy 
the yen they were not aggressive enough to buy the dollar beyond 
the 144 yen level either said bank of tokyo trader masafumi 
koyama thats because theyre afraid the dollar might keep rising 
again after surpassing that level 
after the currency rose beyond the 144yen level june 12 it kept 
rising and reached a close of 15130 yen on june 15 many investors 
consider 144 yen as a dividing point that determines market 
direction 
koyama said japanese investors also were generally pessimistic 
over the ruling liberal democratic partys prospects in the upcoming 
elections and were reluctant to make major moves 
the bank of japan was believed to have sold dollars to support 
the yen but neither the amount nor the intervention were confirmed 
the central bank does not comment on its foreign exchange market

several key european central banks announced today they would 
raise interest rates in a move that took financial markets by 
surprise and put pressure on the dollar 
west germanys bundesbank led a wave of rate hikes when it 
announced it would raise the nations discount and lombard rates by 
a half a percentage point each effective friday to their highest 
levels since the early 1980s 
the central banks of france switzerland austria and the 
netherlands followed suit shortly afterwards by announcing similar 
rate increases 
the dollar fell sharply in hectic early trading in new york the 
dollar plunged to 19465 west german marks from 19620 at 
wednesdays close and to 14245 japanese yen down from 14325 yen 
in the previous session 
the bundesbanks hike in the discount rate to 5 percent puts 
the key lending rate at its highest level since early 1983 the 
discount rate is the cheapest form of bank refinancing 
the lombard rate the rate at which the bundesbank lends 
shortterm funds using securities as collateral increased to 7 
percent its highest level since 1982 
the bundesbank said in a statement the move was prompted by 
strong economic growth and the potential for rising inflation the 
rate increases would aid the bank in stemming money supply growth 
and would help stabilize the west german mark 
the decision took some market participants in europe by surprise 
but many analysts pointed to comments made last week by bundesbank 
president karl otto poehl as a harbinger that a rate hike was in the 
offing poehl said west germanys current economic boom could cause 
a deterioration in german price stability 
in paris the bank of france boosted its benchmark lending rate 
by a half a percentage point in the countrys first credit 
tightening since jan 19 the rise will put the money market 
intervention rate at 8 percent 
the move had been promised earlier in the day by economics 
minister pierre beregovoy as part of frances european cooperation 
strategy 
beregovoy stressed however that domestic concerns didnt call 
for a rate hike but private economists said the hike was an 
opportune way for france to curb the rapid expansion of domestic 
demand and address its trade deficit 
separately the swiss national bank announced it would raise the 
nations discount rate a full percentage point to 55 percent 
effective friday the increase marked switzerlands second hike so 
far this year

americas foreign debt burden soared to 5325 
billion in 1988 pushing the united states further into hock as the 
worlds largest debtor country the government reported today 
the commerce department said the new debt total was 1542 
billion higher than the 3783 billion in debt to foreigners that 
the united states owed at the end of 1987 
the debt figure means that foreigners own more in us assets 
than americans own abroad 
for 1988 the government reported that foreign holdings in the 
united states increased 154 percent to 179 trillion american 
investments abroad also rose but by a smaller 72 percent climbing 
to 125 trillion 
the difference between those two figures in americas net debtor 
position 
the huge 41 percent jump in the debt total in just one year was 
certain to rekindle the debate over what the runup in foreign 
holdings means for americas future 
many private economists believe the united states is losing 
control of its economic destiny and the debt burden will ultimately 
lower american living standards as more and more wealth is 
transferred into the hands of foreigners to service the debt 
leaving less money for distribution in this country 
however the bush administration like the reagan adminisration 
before it contends that foreign investment has been good for the 
nation bringing an infusion of capital needed to rejuvenate many 
aging american industries 
foreign director investment defined as ownership of at least 10 
percent of a company soared by 21 percent last year to a record 
3288 billion reflecting something of a foreign buyingspree for 
american companies 
the overall net debtor position of 5325 billion showed how 
rapidly the foreign debt is piling up as recently as 1983 the 
united states was the worlds largest creditor nation with an 
investment surplus of 89 billion 
that surplus fell to 33 billion in 1984 and disappeared 
altogether in 1985 the year the country became a net debtor for the 
first time in 71 years 
the countrys investment surplus evaporated as the united states 
ran up huge merchandise trade deficits during the 1980s 
transferring billions of dollars into the hands of foreigners to pay 
for imported cars and television sets 
these dollars now in foreign hands have been reinvested in the 
united states in everything from stocks and bonds to factories and 
real estate raising alarms in congress that something must be done 
to curb the selling of america 
the transformation of the united states from the largest creditor 
country to the worlds biggest debtor is often seen by critics as 
the one of the biggest failures of former president reagans 
economic policies 
a report by the congressional office of technology assessment 
which reviewed the situation last year concluded as the united 
states sinks deeper into debt foreign investors and creditors will 
be less inclined to commit everincreasing amounts of capital to a 
4 trillion economy on a spending spree 
many private economists have warned that the united states is 
increasingly vulnerable to a sudden withdrawal of funds on the part 
of investors foreign uneasiness with a plunging us dollar and 
rising interest rates have been cited as an underlying cause of the 
october 1987 stock market collapse 
however officials of the bush administration using identical 
language as the reagan team contend the rising foreign investment 
is really a sign of strength showing that overseas investors believe 
the united states is an excellent place to put their money 
commerce undersecretary michael darby discussing the issue with 
reporters wednesday noted the united states was a net debtor from 
the founding of the country until 1914 during that period 
foreigners provided the investment needed to develop america 
darby said that foreign investment by itself doesnt make you a 
weak nation it doesnt make you a strong nation he said what was 
important was that the investment be used to modernize american 
industry so that the country is better able to compete in the global 
economy 
but nigel gault an economist at drimcgraw hill an economic 
consulting firm said that through the 1980s much of the foreign 
money has gone to support americas huge federal budget deficits and 
overconsumption by american consumers 
it is plainly clear that the foreign funds have not been used 
to boost our competitive position he said

paramount communications inc announced today 
that seven banks have agreed to serve as coagents in the syndicate 
being formed to finance the companys 122 billion tender offer for 
time inc 
the syndicate of banks will provide 90 percent of the financing 
for the 200ashare unsolicited offer paramount has said the 
syndicate would provide 14 billion of the 156 billion estimated 
financing costs while the remaining 16 billion is to raised 
through the sale of debt securities 
the lack of financing commitments for paramounts bid is one of 
the objections raised by time to the unwanted offer todays 
announcement does not mean paramount has obtained the commitments 
but it is a step toward satisfying that condition 
time is trying to preserve a merger with warner communications 
inc and fight the paramount bid 
time stock which has fluctuated as traders tried to forecast 
the outcome of the threeway struggle was up 162 a share to 
15887 in early new york stock exchange trading indicating wall 
street feels somewhat more optimistic today about the paramount bid 
warner stock was off 62 cents to 6012 a share while 
paramount slipped 112 to 6175 a share 
on wednesday delaware chancery court judge william t allen said 
times shareholder meeting can proceed as scheduled friday 
allen ruling in a suit brought by several major time 
shareholders declined to issue a restraining order postponing the 
meeting scheduled in new york 
the meeting originally was called for june 23 for shareholders to 
vote on times planned stockswap merger with warner and on the 
election of four time board members 
after paramount announced its original 107 billion takeover bid 
for time june 6 the meeting was rescheduled and time officials 
withdrew the merger proposal from the agenda 
time and warner have since restructured their merger agreement 
under which time is making a 14 billion tender offer for warner 
several major time shareholders including texas investor robert 
bass have complained that information time has given them about 
fridays meeting was incomplete and inadequately reflected 
takeoverrelated events that had occurred since proxy materials were 
sent to shareholders those events include paramounts tender offer 
and times rejection of it 
four incumbent members of the time board including chairman and 
chief executive richard munro and president nicholas j nicholas jr 
are running unopposed for reelection at fridays meeting 
allen said there might be some merit to arguments raised by 
shareholders but that he would rather spend his time preparing for 
the july 11 hearing in a suit brought by paramount against time than 
to take two days to determine the legal merits of the shareholder 
complaint 
allen said no irreparable harm would result from allowing the 
meeting and the likely reelection of the board members to proceed 
as the four would continue serving on the board anyway until a new 
meeting was called 
before the meeting could be restrained or prohibited the 
shareholders had to prove irreparable harm would result from 
allowing that action to occur 
observers believe the july 11 hearing could be pivotal in the 
battle for time the hearing is expected to deal with paramounts 
contention that time effectively put itself up for takeover bids by 
announcing in march it would merge with warner 
under state law in delaware where all three companies are 
incorporated if a company has put itself up for sale its board is 
required to seek the maximum value for shareholders 
if allen rules time put itself up for sale the companys board 
could be hardpressed to reject paramounts 200ashare cash bid 
which is 74 higher than the price at which time stock traded before 
paramount announced its bid 
time has rejected paramounts offer calling it financially 
inadequate and subject to too many conditions 
time has said shareholders wont be asked to vote on any issues 
related to the timewarner merger at fridays meeting but it is 
likely some angry stockholders who believe time should accept the 
paramount bid will vehemently express their displeasure with the 
board 
its going to be a circus jerome e hass a professor at 
cornell universitys johnson graduate school of management said 
wednesday of the meeting people are going to fight for the 
microphone and chastise management

the chairman of the house ways and means 
committee has given up the idea of cutting the capital gains tax 
because of democratic opposition according to a published report 
today 
rep dan rosetenkowski dill said he plans to fill a 53 
billion taxincrease bill with revenueraising provisions instead of 
coupling a temporary reduction in the capital gains tax with 
expansions of tax breaks for lowincome people 
rostenkowksi said in an interview with the wall street journal 
that he encountered stronger resistance than expected from democrats 
on his committee to reducing the tax on gains from the sale of 
securities and other assets 
i never anticipated there would be as much resistance to 
capital gains as there was he told the newspaper 
democrats had argued the tax break would be too large a benefit 
for wealthy people and also probably would cost the government 
revenue in the long run 
rostenkowskis plan which he termed a trial balloon would 
have paired the cut with a reduction for lowincome people in areas 
such as earned income tax credit and child care credit 
he said president bush had supported the idea of cutting the 
capital gains tax and that his balanced plan came after the 
president had suggested why dont you try to put together a 
package 
the chairmans plan would have reduced the capital gains rate for 
a year from the current top rate of as much as 33 percent and to 
help lowerincome individuals with expended tax credits 
he said the plan would have raised about 15 billion over two 
years because of churning of assets during the shortterm change 
rosetnkowski said he now will focus on ways of raising the 53 
billion tax increase called for in the congressional budget 
resolution for fiscal 1990 which begins oct 1 
he said because of that need some tax breaks due to expire this 
year will have to wait a year to be extended he said he was 
considering a variety of provisions that bush would be most likely 
to accept given his pledge not to increase taxes

hooker corp the financially troubled australian 
real estate developer and retail concern may liquidate all of its 
us department stores and shopping malls according to a report 
published thursday 
the wall street journal quoted j frank haasbeek president of 
hookers us subisiary as saying it looks like hooker will sell 
everything over the next 12 to 24 months 
an assistant to haasbeek at his office at lj hooker corp in 
atlanta said haasbeek was traveling thursday and unavailable to 
comment 
hooker might maintain a presence in the united states if it finds 
investors willing to become jointventure partners in proposed 
shopping malls in florida and north carolina the journal said 
earlier this month hooker said it was looking for partners to 
take stakes in its b altman and bonwit teller department store 
chains and in malls in cincinnati denver and columbia sc 
the journal said haasbeek indicated hooker thinks chances of 
finding partners for those operations are bleak 
haasbeek said hooker is looking for an investment banking firm to 
handle the b altman and bonwit teller divisions he hopes to have a 
tentative agreement to sell both chains by the early autumn 
hooker acquired bonwit teller which has stores in the east 
midwest and florida for about 92 million in august 1987 it bought 
b altman with stores in the northeast for about 100 million the 
following month of that year 
the investment firm first boston corp already has been hired to 
handle the sale of hookers malls in cincinnati denver and columbia 
as well as the merksamer jewelery chain 
hooker also has put up for sale its interests in sakowitz a 
houstonbased retailer and in parisian inc major department store 
chain in the southeast 
among its other us holdings that hooker is selling are a us 
residential construction business nine strip shopping centers in 
florida and ohio and six vacant tracts of land hooker already has 
reached an agreement to sell its us industrial operations to 
divisions of japans kajima corp 
hooker has said it is suffering from a cash squeeze largely due 
to high australian interest rates and other unfavorable economic 
conditions that have hurt its property develpment business in that 
country 
last week hooker reached an agreement with its creditor banks on 
a fourmonth moratorium on repaying principal on outstanding loans 
the banks to which hooker owes about 700 million also agreed to 
maintain credit lines at current levels

banc one corp an ohio banking company known for 
its consumer innovations overcame six other bids to win the 20 
failed banks of dallasbased mcorp in what is estimated to become 
the nations thirdlargest bank bailout regulators said today 
l william seidman chairman of the federal deposit insurance 
corp told reporters in washington dc the best estimate of 
government assistance required for mcorp is 2 billion with the 
risk that the cost could ultimately be 10 percent to 15 percent 
higher 
he said the mcorp rescue likely will prove to be the second 
biggest in the history of the fdic which insures commercial bank 
deposits 
the initial government payouts were larger for both the 1988 
rescue of first republicbank of dallas and the 1984 deal involving 
continental illinois of chicago however seidman said the ultimate 
cost of first republicbank will likely be 3 billion more 
expensive than mcorp while the eventual pricetag of the 
continental illinois rescue will be a lesscostly 15 billion 
the fdic which insures the nations bank deposits announced 
banc ones selection wednesday but withheld details of the 
government assistance package until today 
analysts praised the decision saying it would add a strong 
competitor to texas troubled banking industry bidders who lost out 
said they are prepared to compete 
seidman said in a statement wednesday that banc one was selected 
in a highly competitive process from among attractive 
proposals 
banc one said it would begin managing the banks july 5 under the 
name bank one texas and would purchase the banks after a four to 
sixmonth period during which problem assets would be identified 
the holding company said it would invest about 500 million to 
buy all of bank one texas equity 
bill boardman a banc one senior vice president said the fdic 
would take over problem loans and bring the balance sheet to a 
zero position 
we wont know how many dollars are involved until the closing 
of the transaction boardman said banc one has its own estimate 
of the cost but boardman declined to say what the estimate was 
analysts predicted it could take as much as 2 billion to bail 
out the banks ranking only behind 1984s 45 billion rescue of 
continental illinois of chicago and last years 4 billion deal 
involving first republicbank of dallas 
seidman has said that mcorp is the agencys last remaining major 
commercial bank problem 
however the fdic also is reviewing bids for national bancorp of 
texas of san antonio and texas american bancshares inc of fort 
worth with combined assets of 7 billion they are likely to be 
sold in a package requiring about 500 million in government 
assistance 
banc one the countrys 25th largest banking company with 253 
billion in assets was one of the first institutions to offer 
automated tellers and has been a leader in packaging credit card 
debt into securities for sale to investors 
the columbus company allocates more of its earnings to research 
and development than most banks but has remained one of the five 
most profitable banks every year since 1984 
on march 29 the 20 failed mcorp banks which stretch across much 
of texas including houston and dallas were packaged into a 
governmentowned institution called deposit insurance bridge bank 
or dibb 
the seizure left mcorp with five subsidiary banks plus trust and 
investment operations that continue to operate although the parent 
company has filed for protection from creditors under the federal 
bankruptcy code 
mcorp also has challenged the takeover of eight of the subsidiary 
banks saying they were solvent at the time they were seized 
among the other prominent bidders for bridge bank were ncnb corp 
of charlotte nc which bought first republicbank last year 
houstonbased texas commerce bancshares inc a subsidiary of 
chemical banking corp the nations sixth largest banking company 
first city bancorp of houston itself the recipient of 1 billion 
federal bailout in 1987 the new yorkbased leveraged buyout firm 
kohlberg kravis roberts co and the bank of scotland 
buddy kemp chairman of ncnb texas the new name of first 
republicbank said his company was disappointed with the fdics 
decision but added we remain committed to serving the texas 
market by expanding our franchise throughout the state 
kohlberg kravis which has no banking interests said in a 
statement we are extremely disappointed weve spent an enormous 
amount of time resources and effort on this matter it noted that 
its proposal would have maintained an independent bank in texas 
analysts have blamed mcorps failure on the collapse of the 
energy market even though the bank had focused more on real estate 
loans than energy loans the collapse of oil prices earlier in the 
1980s snowballed into a real estate bust and a regional recession in 
the southwest

former defense secretary frank c carlucci told 
congress today he is still willing to become interim head of eastern 
airlines to help meet a congressional committees goal of restoring 
it as a major carrier 
carlucci told the house public works and transportation aviation 
subcommittee he supports the plan of chicago businessman joseph 
ritchie already spurned by eastern chairman frank lorenzo to buy 
the airline in partnership with easterns striking employees 
this approach is the only one that has a chance of restoring 
eastern to its onceproud status said carlucci who headed the 
pentagon in the latter part of the reagan administration 
ritchie president of chicago research amp trading group submitted 
to the subcommittee a plan he said can still restore eastern as a 
major competitor in the airline industry 
lorenzo rejected ritchies earlier unionbacked attempt to buy 
the airline along with several other offers carlucci said he had 
agreed to serve as interim chief executive officer of the airline 
because ritchies plan appeared to have the support of both 
employees and creditors 
easterns management has said it plans to rebuild the airline as 
a smaller carrier eastern which had been the nations 
sixthlargest airline has operated only limited flights since a 
machinists strike in march led to a sympathy walkout by pilots and 
flight attendants 
other witnesses scheduled at the hearing included officials of 
eastern its striking unions the bankruptcy court the department 
of transportation and the federal aviation administration 
the committee in a letter seeking testimony said it believes 
that restoration of eastern as a major carrier is critical to avoid 
a substantial loss of jobs economic damage to the communities in 
which easterns employees are based and an adverse impact on 
consumers 
subcommittee chairman james l oberstar dminn said the panel 
is concerned that the course chosen by a new york bankruptcy court 
to allow eastern to sell off assets will lead to the liquidation 
of eastern the airline filed for protection from creditors under 
bankruptcy laws after the strike began 
oberstar said the panel seeks to determine how the loss of 
eastern as a major carrier will affect service and fares in the 
markets it serves 
he said the committee will examine both ritchies and easterns 
plans the bankruptcy courts ability to consider the public 
interest and any steps the transportation department has taken to 
consider the effects of the airlines reorganization on air travel 
easterns employees and its creditors 
rep newt gingrich of georgia subcommittee member and house gop 
whip has asked transportation secretary samuel skinner to intervene 
in the bankruptcy courts proceedings 
our concern is urgent gingrich said in a letter to skinner 
last week because it appears likely eastern airlines will be sold 
off in pieces resulting in less than a fully integrated competitive 
carrier 
gingrich accused lorenzo head of texas air corp which owns 
eastern of having an interest in not building up eastern as a 
competitor to his other airline continental 
gingrich said that because no assistant attorney general for 
antitrust has yet been confirmed the bankruptcy and possible sale 
of eastern airlines is taking place without proper guidance from the 
bush administration

t boone pickens was joined by a group of japanese 
racketeers in seeking greater shareholders rights in koito 
manufacturing co but the corporate raider lost his bid for three 
board seats thursday even though he is the companys largest 
shareholder 
it was the most unusual shareholders meeting ive ever 
attended in my life said pickens who in march bought a 202 
percent stake in the automobile lighting manufacturer 
among the 200 shareholders present pickens was the only hand 
raised in favor of electing himself and two associates to koitos 
20member board 
during a 20minute address pickens said that japan should open 
up more and give foreign investors a chance to participate in its 
economy 
pickens said his inability to gain representation on the koito 
board showed that the japanese investment market is not as open to 
americans as the us market is to japanese 
you invest freely in my country yet i invest in japan and i 
am excluded he told shareholders at the threehour meeting 
but koito officials said their reluctance to support pickens was 
based on his history of corporate raiding in the united states not 
his being an american they said they doubted he had a longterm 
interest in the company and pointed to his lack of experience in 
manufacturing 
pickens said after the meeting he would testify before the us 
senate finance committee on july 11 about his difficulties in 
breaking into the japanese investment market 
the shareholders present included koito employees loyal to the 
company and racketeers known as sokaiya who generally took pickens 
side in their questioning and heckled koito executives in the end 
however they voted against pickens 
the sokaiya often speaking in the rough cadences of yakuza or 
gangsters scolded koito management for not thinking of japans 
international responsibilitiesand drew frequent laughter from the 
large contingent of japanese reporters watching on a television 
monitor in a nearby room 
sokaiya are a regular part of shareholders meetings of major 
companies in japan companies pay them to be quiet or sometimes to 
silence other shareholders 
although paying sokaiya is illegal industry sources say it is 
common to avoid filibusters by the racketeers who cannot be 
excluded because they are legal shareholders koito executives deny 
any ties with sokaiya 
pickens said the sokaiya asked good questions and criticized 
koito management for not answering them fully 
but he called the meeting something of a sham complaining 
that it was filled with koito employees who supported management 
statements almost as if theyd practiced 
after the meeting koito president takao matsuura said it was 
difficult to tell whether pickens intentions were those of a 
corporate raider 
mr pickens asked only very appropriate questions matsuura 
said 
koito was just one of more than 1500 companies holding annual 
meetings thursday and more than 5000 police were dispatched to 
prevent disturbances japanese firms are increasingly holding their 
meetings on the same day to discourage sokaiya but the result is 
that individual shareholders can attend only one or two meetings 
reducing their voice

grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly 
lower thursday on the chicago board of trade with wheat leading the 
way on ideas that the strong gains of the three previous sessions 
had been exaggerated 
despite a rainrelated slowdown in the winter wheat harvest 
especially in the south and southeast analysts said the movement of 
new wheat to market was bound to force prices lower 
further selling of wheat futures was prompted by fears that the 
relatively high prices reached this week could stifle export demand 
corn and soybean futures slipped following wednesdays 
sixto10day national weather service outlook for nearnormal 
rainfall in the midwest 
the soybean market also was pressured by prospects for a 
temporary resumption of soybean sales to processors in brazil after 
a 2week boycott brazilian producers are considering their 
governments request for a 10day coolingoff period in their 
protest against the countrys agricultural and economic policies 
at the close wheat was 2 cents to 7 cents lower with the

net profits at telefonica de espana the 
statecontrolled telephone monopoly rose 18 percent in 1988 over 
the previous year as the fastgrowing spanish economy continued to 
spur strong demand company president candido velazquez said 
thursday 
velazquez said net profits in 1988 totaled 6284 billion pesetas 
or 507 million up from 5324 billion pesetas in 1987 
revenue in 1988 increased to 61253 billion pesetas or 493 
billion from 56870 billion pesetas the previous year 
velazquez said the company expected to catch up with exploding 
demand for telephone services by mid1992 in time for the barcelona 
92 summer olympics and the expo 92 worlds fair to commemorate 
explorer christopher colombus voyage to the new world 
consumer and media criticism of telefonica has been great for the 
last year due to months of waiting required for installation of new 
lines 
former telefonica president luis solana left his post last 
december to take over as director general of staterun spanish 
television after being blasted by the media and consumers for 
failing to foresee the explosion in demand

chrysler corp and mitsubishi motors corp of japan worked 
together to design and produce the 1990 plymouth laser rs turbo and 
its twin the mitsubishi eclipse gs the result is a fine example of 
joint workmanship that young single car buyers can enjoy 
the laser test car was expressive from its sporty design to its 
leaveothersinthedust turbo engine 
it was as car and driver magazine said in naming it one of the 
10 best cars this year a modestly priced sports coupe with enough 
performance to embarrass a porsche 944 
slip down into the laser rs drivers seat and examine the 
cockpitlike dashboard arrayed in front notice how the right side 
of the dash curves out and around toward the driver knobs buttons 
and dials are all around shift a bit in the seat to rest your right 
arm on the thick center console that houses the smoothshifting 
fivespeed gearbox dont worry about the cigarette lighter thats 
also on the console next to you the lighter has a collar around it 
so it wont depress casually 
now push in the clutch and start up the car dont let the 
relative quiet from under the hood fool you this is a car with a 
2liter turbocharged 16valve engine thats deceptively quick and 
really fun thank heavens the companies installed passive shoulder 
belts in the car for frontseat passengers who might be caught 
unaware the sporty front seats too help hold a body in place 
in he first five months of sales since its january debut 
chrysler sold about 6000 lasers but company spokeswoman rebecca 
caruso noted there are enough back orders to keep the assembly plant 
in normal ill going at its current pace until november 1990 
though production at that chryslermitsubishi plant known as 
diamondstar motors will crank up with time and should shorten that 
waiting list 
the new laser which isnt related to an earlier plymouth laser 
that was in dealer showrooms until 1986 is designed for young 
adults with median age of 29 and college education caruso said 
sixtyfive percent will be single more than half of the laser 
buyers are expected to be females 
but the rs turbo version is likely to attract more men than 
women caruso said adding that the laser comes in two trim levels 
and with three engine offerings a smaller 18liter nonturbo 
engine a 2liter engine with no turbo and the topoftheine 
2liter turbo that was in the test car 
base price of the laser rs turbo was 13394 making it quite 
competitive in the small sporty coupe market that includes the ford 
probe gt mazda mx6 and toyota celica gts the probe gt for 
example starts around 14000 and the celica gts starts around 
15400 
caruso added that the laser rs turbo also is faster than the 
competitors 
from the outside the laser rs turbo test car looked a lot like 
the probe sloping and aerodynamic underneath is a modified 
platform borrowed from another mitsubishi car the gallant 
handling on the laser was fine and the suspension was not as 
stiff as in other sporty cars i would stress that buyers consider 
whether they will use the laser to carry more than one other 
passenger with any regularity because the laser rs turbo back seat 
was made for a contortionist 
once i got in the back with a couple of bruises along the way 
my head was up against the ceiling and im just 5feet4 the seat 
does fold down however for more room in the hatchback area for 
carrying nonhuman items 
there were just a couple other drawbacks the amfm 
stereocassette player buttons were small and therefore had to be 
hit with precision and there was considerable torque steer with the 
accelerator pushed down quickly especially when the car hit bumps 
and uneven pavement 
but those still didnt take the edge off all the fun because the 
laser rs turbo is new for this year consumer reports magazine does 
not have owner reports of trouble

federal bank regulators estimated thursday they 
will spend 2 billion to rescue the 20 failed banks of the 
dallasbased mcorp in the secondcostliest bank rescue in history 
l william seidman chairman of the federal deposit insurance 
corp which backs commercial bank deposits said he foresees no 
failures rivaling it in the immediate future 
regulators picked banc one corp of columbus ohio the nations 
25th largest banking company from among six firms bidding to take 
over the insolvent banks with 131 billion in assets 
banc one chairman john b mccoy assumes the chairmanship of the 
texas institutions on july 5 and will operate them under the name of 
bank one texas 
the ohio company one of the most innovative retail banking 
operations in the country is contributing 500 million in a complex 
arrangement that will permit it to exclude the texas operation from 
its consolidated balance sheet and maintain its record as one of the 
nations five most profitable banks 
the mcorp banks have been under federal control since march 28 
when regulators stripped them from the parent holding company 
leaving five banks and a trust operation still in private hands 
seidman said 2 billion was the agencys best estimate of the 
bailout cost but cautioned that could end up being 200 million to 
300 million too high or too low most of the subsidy comes from 
covering losses on the failed banks 3 billion to 35 billion in 
sour commercial real estate loans 
the fdic will be part owner of bank one texas for at least five 
years 
this transaction ranks as the second most expensive in the 
fdics history seidman said 
the costliest was last years bailout of first republicbank of 
dallas which the agency estimates will wind up costing it 3 
billion third he said is the bailout of continental illinois of 
chicago which should ultimately require 15 billion in federal aid 
at this time for the year 1989 we do not foresee any 
transactions near this size seidman said 
bank failures have risen for seven years hitting 221 in 1988 
the fifth consecutive postdepression record for the first time 
since it began operating in 1934 the fdic saw its reserves decline 
dropping from 183 billion at the end of 1987 to 14 billion a year 
later 
seidman said the agency booked its loss for the mcorp rescue last 
year and he expects it to begin rebuilding its reserves this year 
he is predicting bank failures will decline slightly from 1988 
however bert ely a financial institutions analyst in 
alexandria va said the slate of problems has not been wiped 
clean weve still got some weak sisters out there in the 
banking world 
he said the sharp deterioration of the arizona real estate market 
would produce banking problems there fdicinsured savings banks in 
the northeast also are slipping because of real estate weakness and 
bank involvement in financing corporate buyouts will make some big 
institutions vulnerable he said 
banc one in winning the mcorp banks fended off five rivals 
ncnb corp of charlotte nc which bought first republicbank last 
year houstonbased texas commerce bancshares inc a subsidiary of 
chemical banking corp first city bancorp of houston itself the 
recipient of 1 billion federal bailout in 1987 the new yorkbased 
leveraged buyout firm kohlberg kravis roberts co and the bank of 
scotland 
the selection of banc one was the result of a highly 
competitive bidding process in which the margin of difference among 
the finalists was extremely narrow seidman said

eastern airlines union members on thursday took 
actions against former colleagues who have defied their nearly 
4monthold strike picketing the homes of three pilots and the 
business of another and announcing plans to fine working pilots 
tim holder an air line pilots association official in atlanta 
said disciplinary proceedings will begin july 26 to seek fines 
against some 220 pilots who have flown during the strike holder 
said he expects penalties to be substantial running to 
thousands of dollars for each offender 
the alpa constitution calls for penalties against members who 
disobey orders from the master executive council of the union which 
represents pilots at most major airlines disciplinary hearings for 
eastern pilots will be conducted by a threemember panel of pilots 
from other airlines holder said 
meanwhile eastern union officials said they would continue 
pickets at flying pilots homes 
this has sunk to a new low said tom bueter a 23year 
eastern pilot who confronted seven pilots and a flight attendant 
outside the home of his neighbor pilot roberto freytes these 
people are losing they perceive theyre losing and now theyre 
becoming more and more desperate 
bueter and freytes have continued to fly for eastern during their 
unions strike 
were going to do this every day at different homes said 
edgar belaval a striking eastern pilot picketing outside freytes 
home in suburban southwest dade county fla 
our striking pilots flight attendants and machinists 
apparently lost all sense of decency today eastern spokesman 
robin matell said in a message to employees whatever happened to 
the notion that a mans home is his castle wouldnt you know the 
chickenhearted picketers selected homes where for the most part the 
husbands were out flying and only the wife and kids were home 
matell a management veteran of strikes at several airlines said 
he had never heard of picketers going to private homes 
gary greksa a spokesman for alpa said the union obtained police 
permits to picket three homes and the keg south a tavern owned by a 
pilot and flight attendant who have crossed picket lines 
theres been a lot of press lately and a very heavy advertising 
campaign by the company its led a lot of people to believe that 
the strike is over greksa said we do every little bit of 
activity we can to keep it in the public eye 
greksa said alpa has begun running radio ads about the strike 
other union sources have indicated the strikers plan a mass protest 
july 4 at miami international airport and at other airports at which 
eastern flies 
at least 3400 of the 3600 eastern pilots joined the machinists 
union march 4 when that union went on strike the flight attendants 
union also is honoring picket lines 
eastern last week asked the bankruptcy court to terminate its 
contract with the pilots union

the dollar staged a puzzling turnaround thursday 
when it finished mostly higher in domestic trading despite 
announcements that a string of european central banks will hike key 
lending rates 
gold prices were mixed republic national bank of new york quoted 
a troy ounce of gold at 37015 as of 4 pm edt down from 37440 
late wednesday

announced it would hike its discount and lombard rates by half a 
percentage point each effective friday the discount rate will rise 
to 5 percent and the lombard rate to 7 percent their highest levels 
since the early 1980s 
similar actions followed in france switzerland belgium the 
netherlands denmark and austria 
higher rates overseas typically depress the dollar by enhancing 
the value of foreign investments rather than purchase dollars to 
invest in us securities foreign investors will keep their funds 
overseas when rates there are attractive 
following the central banks announcements the dollar fell a 
steep 23 pfennigs to 19390 west german marks but before trading 
ended in europe and midway through the domestic session the dollar 
began to turn around a phenomenon that had many traders scratching 
their heads 
theres no reasonable justification for it said frank conte 
vice president of foreign exchange at barclays bank plc in new york 
the dollar should be a lot lower 
some said the recovery was due to a variety of technical factors 
including the fact that traders already had begun to square up their 
positions ahead of the july 4th holiday weekend 
but robert ryan a vice president at irving trust co noted that 
heavy japanese dollarbuying in the face of political difficulties 
in tokyo worked to boost the us currency 
the yen kept weakening and it impacted the other currencies 
and the dollar came back he said todays activity showed total 
bearishness toward the yen 
while the european rate hikes may have caught some traders by 
surprise more dealers were jolted by the dollars resilience 
still bank of boston senior trader scott horwitz cautioned that 
the dollars strength should not necessarily be interpreted as a 
trendsetting reaction 
the dollar turns on a dime he said adding that thursdays 
recovery was more a product of a fourday us holiday 
in tokyo the dollar slipped to 14290 japanese yen from 14355 
on wednesday later in london the us currency traded lower at 
14253 in new york however the dollar climbed to 14400 yen from 
14325 yen on wednesday

expensive for buyers than wednesdays late 15613 later in new 
york it cost 15435 to buy one pound cheaper than 15580 on

jh whitney amp co launched a 125 billion tender 
offer for prime computer inc on thursday but rival bidder mai 
basic four inc said it would try to exceed that price 
mais position is it is still evaluating the situation and is 
hopeful that we will be able to beat the whitney offer said toni 
lee a spokeswoman for the tustin calif computer firm 
wall street however treated mais statement with skepticism 
primes stock closed at 1925 up 25 cents while mai shares 
dropped 12 cents to 575 in composite trading thursday on the new 
york stock exchange 
securities analysts said they doubted mai would be able to obtain 
financing for an offer high enough to wrest prime away from jh 
whitney 
i dont think were going to see a bidding war said stephen 
k smith who follows the computer industry for the brokerage firm 
of painewebber inc in new york 
prime is a natickbased maker of minicomputers and computeraided 
design and manufacturing equipment in the face of a hostile 11 
billion bid from mai its board of directors agreed june 23 to a 
merger with jh whitney a private venture capital firm in new york 
city 
whitneys offer is 2150 a share in cash for primes 495 
million outstanding shares of common stock which represents about 
79 percent of the companys stock on a fully diluted basis 
for the remaining 21 percent of the shares whitney said it would 
exchange securities with a face value of 22 per share securities 
analysts have estimated the overall value of the offer at about 20 
a share or 125 billion 
the whitney offer expires july 27 the day after primes annual 
meeting mai has said repeatedly that it would wage a proxy battle 
to elect its nominees to the board of directors at the meeting 
prime which has about 11200 employees and annual revenues of 
16 billion has seen its earnings plummet during the takeover 
battle it reported a loss of 5 million on sales of 387 million 
during the first quarter of 1989 
mai which had 1988 revenues of about 421 million has offered 
1950 a share in cash for about 75 percent of primes shares and a 
mixture of preferred stock and bonds for the remainder analysts 
have valued that offer at about 18 a share 
mai chairman bennett s lebow had said june 22 it would increase 
its offer but no increase has yet been announced on thursday the 
company extended its previous offer until july 6

the united states already the worlds largest 
debtor nation strengthened its hold on that dubious title in 1988 
as its foreign debt surged 41 percent to 5325 billion the 
government said thursday 
the commerce department releasing its annual balance sheet on 
americas global economic standing said the us debt burden had 
risen by 1542 billion in 1988 up from 3783 billion in debt to 
foreigners the united states owed at the end of 1987 
the figures mean that foreigners own more in us assets than 
americans own abroad the report was certain to fuel the already 
heated debate over whether the united states is losing control of 
its economic destiny to foreigners 
last year the government said that foreign holdings in the 
united states increased 154 percent to 1786 trillion american 
investments abroad rose a smaller 72 percent to 1253 trillion 
the difference between those two figures represents the united 
states net debtor position 
britain remained the country with the largest stake in the united 
states with 1019 billion in direct investment holdings up 28 
percent from 1987 japan moved into second place with 533 billion 
in direct holdings up a sharp 52 percent from 1987 
some economists predict that the debt total could surpass the 1 
trillion mark early in the next decade 
they warn that the burden of servicing that debt will put a 
severe strain on domestic resources lowering living standards in 
the united states as more and more money in the form of interest 
payments and dividends flows into the hands of foreigners 
we are exceedingly vulnerable as a country said c fred 
bergsten director of the insttute for international economics a 
washington research group 
we have a huge foreign debt and that means that decisions taken 
abroad can increasingly influence our own economy that is an 
untenable postion for a country that wants to be a global power 
the bush administration like the reagan administration before 
it played down the significance of the debt noting that it still 
represented a tiny fraction of americas 5 trillion economy and had 
nowhere near the adverse impact as the smaller total debt carried by 
third world nations such as brazil and mexico 
commerce secretary robert mosbacher said that the increase showed 
that america was still viewed by foreign investors as a good place 
to put their money 
it just shows that this country is where everybody wants to 
be he said in an interview with associated press radio 
commerce undersecretary michael darby noted that the united 
states was a net debtor from the revolutionary war until 1914 as 
foreigners provded the investment needed to develop america 
it foreign investment doesnt make you a weak nation it 
doesnt make you a strong nation darby said adding that what was 
important was for the foreign funds to be used to modernize american 
industry so that the country can compete in the global economy 
foreign direct investment defined as ownership of at least 10 
percent of a company soared by 21 percent last year to a record 
3288 billion as foreigners went on something of a buying spree of 
american companies 
one of the largest purchases was the 65 billion acquisition of 
federated department stores by the campeau corp of canada 
in addition to 10 percent ownership or more in companies direct 
investment includes holdings of office buildings and real estate 
the foreign purchases of american companies and choice real 
estate have set off alarms in congress rep john bryant dtexas 
is leading an effort to require better accounting of foreign 
ownership of us assets 
bryant contends that the true value of foreign holdings in the 
united states could be twice the official estimates because the 
commerce department is forced to rely on incomplete inaccurate 
information 
the new debt figure highlighted the speed at which americas debt 
is piling up 
as recently as 1983 the united states was the worlds largest 
creditor nation with an investment surplus of 89 billion that 
surplus fell to 33 billion in 1984 and disappeared in 1985 when 
the country became a net debtor for the first time in 71 years 
the change has occurred because the united states transferred 
billions of dollars into the hands of foreigners to pay for cars 
television sets and other imported goods those dollars are being 
reinvested by foreigners in the united states in everything from 
stocks and bonds to factories and real estate

the investor group led by alfred checchi 
announced thursday it has commitments from a group of banks for more 
than 335 billion to finance its proposed 121ashare purchase of 
nwa inc parent of northwest airlines 
the investor group wings holdings inc issued a statement from 
new york saying that its agent bank bankers trust co had received 
commitments for significantly more than the amount needed for 
the purchase it said the commitments would be adjusted to produce 
the required 335 billion 
bankers trust has agreed to commit 500 million toward an 8year 
loan while wings holdings has pledged 700 million in equity toward 
buying the eagan minnbased airline and related nwa subsidiaries 
participating lenders are being asked to commit 100 million to 
400 million each said tom parisi senior vice president at bankers 
trust 
he said loans would be secured by all of northwests assets 
consisting largely of more than 3 billion worth of aircraft 
the nwa board of directors last week agreed to sell the company 
to wings holdings for 121 a share checchis buyout offer to nwa 
shareholders holds through july 21 nwa and checchi expect to 
complete the sale by sept 18 
mike hamilton an analyst for the investment firm piper jaffray amp 
hopwood said the wings holdings announcement reinforced checchis 
earlier statements that he would have no trouble securing financing 
for the deal 
analyst kurt rivard of dain bosworth inc agreed 
this shows theres more than enough money available for them to 
close the financing and the positive thing is that it is bank 
financing rather than junk bonds it shows checchi has been able to 
convince the lending institutions that theres value there rivard 
said 
its another hurdle he had to get through and hes through that 
one he added 
inanother development thursday the us department of 
transportation sent a letter to nwa as expected asking for more 
information about the proposed acquisition 
basically they asked for details on management structure 
financial forecasts and explanation of the debt and equity 
arrangements hamilton said 
the request is part of the governments attempt to determine how 
the acquisition will affect the airlines ability to operate 
hamilton explained 
to my knowledge the dot has not given any indication as to 
when theyll have a decision on it he added 
nwa stock closed at 115 a share thursday down on the new york 
stock exchange for the second straight day

treasury secretary nicholas f brady said 
thursday the administration will continue to seek a capital gains 
tax cut despite a leading democratic congressmans decision to look 
elsewhere for revenueraising provisions 
chairman dan rostenkowski of the house ways and means committee 
was reported thursday to have said he had given up the idea of 
cutting the capital gains tax because of democratic opposition 
instead the illinois democrat told the wall street journal in an 
interview he plans to file a 53 billion taxincrease bill with 
revenueraising provisions instead of coupling a temporary reduction 
in the capital gains tax with expansions of tax breaks for poor 
people 
rostenkowksi said he encountered stronger resistance than 
expected from democrats who argued the tax break would be too large 
a benefit for wealthy people and also probably would cost the 
government revenue in the long run 
brady noted in a statement thursday that president bush has made 
a capital gains tax cut a key element of his economic program 
it will lower the cost of capital create incentives for 
investment in the longterm productive capacity of american 
industry make american firms more competitive internationally and 
create new job opportunities brady said 
all americans will benefit we will emphasize these economic 
benefits as we work with congress to achieve enactment of the 
capital gains measure he added 
in the interview rostenkowski described his capital gains tax 
cut proposal as a kind of test balloon that he floated at bushs 
suggestion 
the plan would have reduced the capital gains rate for a year 
from the current top rate of as much as 33 percent and would have 
helped lowerincome individuals with expanded tax credits for earned 
income and child care 
he said the plan would have raised about 15 billion over two 
years because of churning of assets during the shortterm change 
rostenkowski said he was considering a variety of revenueraising 
provisions that bush would be most likely to accept given his pledge 
not to increase taxes

sears roebuck and co said thursday it had 
created a new management structure for its retailing headquarters 
that will eliminate at least 400 jobs and make sears stores more 
responsive to customers 
the job reductions added to cuts already made among headquarters 
management workers and in field operations staff will bring to more 
than 1600 the number of sears management jobs eliminated since the 
nations largest retailer announced its streamlining plan in march 
1988 
already 425 headquarters management workers have left and about 
800 positions have been eliminated in a corresponding reorganization 
of field operations 
the new management structure will eliminate 400 managementlevel 
jobs from the sears merchandise group said ernest arms a spokesman 
for the division 
to cut the 400 jobs sears will offer incentives to quit or 
retire to most of the 3700 management workers in the chicagobased 
retail headquarters the company said the incentives will include 
two weeks of severance pay for every year worked at sears up to 52 
weeks of pay the company said 
arms said the company expects more than 400 employees to accept 
the incentive package but if fewer do it would lay off the 
necessary number to reach 400 he said any employee laid off would 
receive the incentive package 
sears announced earlier this week that the merchandise group will 
move from the sears tower to the chicago suburb of hoffman estates 
within three years the sears tower the worlds tallest building 
has been put up for sale as part of the restructuring 
arms said the new management structure which should be in place 
by midaugust will create a vertical chain of command from 
the retail store to the group vice president for each of the 
retail groups six major business lines 
for example the manager of a stores brand central appliance and 
electronics department will no longer report to the manager of that 
store but to a district manager who is also involved solely with the 
applianceandelectronics business 
the other business lines are home fashions home improvement 
womens apparel mens and childrens apparel and automotive 
arms said the management structure would fit well with the 
store of superstores concept that sears is pursuing in the 
radical restructuring of its retail business 
what this all means is that we are becoming quicker on our 
feet more responsive to the customer able to act faster in todays 
retailing environment arms said 
in an effort to battle discount chains sears has cut prices and 
increased the number of brandname products at its stores 
in yet another departure from tradition sears announced 
wednesday it would lease space in three of its stores to 
kuppenheimer mens clothiers 
the announcement came just a month after sears said it planned to 
discontinue sales of suits and sportscoats and emphasize more casual 
clothing in its mens clothing departments 
the deal with kuppenheimer is the first time sears has contracted 
with a known apparel retailer 
the strategy is similar to the recent move by montgomery ward amp 
co to rent space in its stores to specialty outlets such as toys 
r us and rose records 
sears officials said kuppenheimer will set up shop at the sears 
store in the northridge shopping center in milwaukee and at two 
other undisclosed stores on the east coast and the midwest 
kuppenheimer is a 115store subsidiary of chicagobased hartmarx 
it primarily sells privatelabel suits sportscoats dress shirts 
slacks and neckwear

friendly buyout offer from the groups and taken several steps to 
make itself a less tasty takeover target including adopting a
